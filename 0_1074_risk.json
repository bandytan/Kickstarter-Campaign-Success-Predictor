  "We understand the challenges that lie ahead of us. Some industry experts say that the market for protein bars is too crowded. These days companies decide to focus on one niche and cater to specific needs of their customers. Ademi\u2019s mission is not only to spread vegan lifestyle, but to innovate and bring out the best in nutrition technology. We sincerely believe that Ademi bars can survive with this Kickstarter campaign plus sales projections that we are planning to generate by adding more flavors and controlling our own supply chain along the way.",
  "Team Unicox Superfoods has taken significant steps to ensure this Kickstarter is as successful  as possible. \n\nWe're a startup and during our first production run things may get delayed. Ingredients can ship late, packaging can be incorrect and things can go wrong in our supply chain. Any of these things could cause us to ship our first products later than we expect. That said, we will keep our backers updated on any and all developments.\n\nIf we reach our funding goal during the preorder window, we will be able to produce our first run with our co-packer in April, May and begin shipping in June .\n\nGiven our capacity for production has limits, if the demand exceeds this capacity, we'll likely need to push out our delivery timeline. However, Unicox Superfoods would have to go truly \"viral\" for this to happen.",
  "With an experienced writing and production team, our production company is confident in achieving its goals and overcoming any challenges from concept, creation to distribution.",
  "With a full month and complete flexibility on my end, it's hard to imagine that anything would get in the way of this project. In some *insanely unlikely* event that I am unable to paint during my stay in Sparkill, a rescheduling of modeling sessions at a later date will occur as necessary and painting will continue once home in Kansas City, thereby completing the paintings and fulfilling the rewards. The schedule may be affected, but not the result.",
  "The challenge is assembling the people and equipment needed for this.  You need cameras for photos and videos. A studio is a must to be able to create the many different images I want. And finally, I need to hire models or bring in survivors from around the country to take part.",
  "My obstacle is Mentoring for new business, I would be my own boss, I'm new to running my own business, I have a passion for this to succeed, so with help (and funding) I will make this work.",
  "Risks once the film is funded successfully is the film location and crew.",
  "Aside from accidentally summoning a demon, there are many risks associated with making this film. Primarily, pushing the bounds of what our camera systems are technically capable of will be a challenge to say the least - but our months of testing and prep has us confident we can do something new and exciting, and fun to watch.",
  "A challenge we face is time. We plan on the film being complete and released by the week of halloween. All of the creators work fulltime jobs outside of their film jobs (which during filming can also be fulltime) so getting the film shot and edited and released in 60 days will be a challenge. \r\nOur short 'Meat' was shot edited and released in two days with a 100$ budget. So we are fully confident in our ability.",
  "I have made 40+ pins at this point and so I have a good idea of what I'm doing. There may be delays due to unforeseen circumstances (weather, holidays, imperfections in the pins, etc.), but I will do everything in my power to make sure these pins are in your hands by May.\n\n***NOTE: Backers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply. I'm not responsible for delays due to customs. Actual colors may vary slightly from proofs.***",
  "I'll need to hire a writer, make up artists and put together a film crew and editors/sfx, all for a relatively small amount.  This will be tough to come up with skilled people and basically this is the first time I've done anything like this, so this movie will probably suck. lol  So many people have tried something like this and failed, zombie movies are a dime a dozen, but there are so few good ones,  I want to create something that is action packed and for zombie film lovers which I am one of.",
  "To be honest without your support we wont get this done, in preparation we have been in contact with a location agency and well as freelance after effects people. our crew are a bunch of film buff and we are ready to go. casting the crew will take some time as we want the best for your money. to be honest our risk is very minimal but it all can't be possible without your support.",

  "I believe the risks and challenges are few. I did my best to tailor the expected delivery time on each the incentives according to what I've learned about the process of making records in the past.\r\nBarring an act of God, there is little that can prevent me from completing this project and honoring the incentives.\r\nThat said, scheduling of the studios and musicians, completion of cover art and issues with pressing can all contribute to delays in completion.\r\nI will keep you all abreast of process as events unfold.",
  "The main challenges involved with recording this record are preparing the material and making sure that we are all healthy both mentally and physically before we get into the studio.  We have a limited time to complete this project and we are on a tight budget.  But we feel confident that with the love and support of our friends, family and community, we can work through any obstacle that will arise.",

  "I have experience with kickstarter as well as been in the pin making business for a year now. I'm able to make the process a lot smoother but a full disclosure is always warranted. I have a designated manufacturer I work with but have expanded my interaction to multiple as a fall back plan. My pins come from overseas so that explains the time necessary to produce all the enamel pins. \nAll designs displayed so far are tentative designs until I can get a better idea of what is possible with the the mold to make these designs accurate. I will try my best to adhere to the original design as much as possible however.\nDue to the timing in the global problem of COVID 19, I've added a buffer month just in case something gets delayed or if the pins need more time to be made.\n\nSome manufacture errors are possible in mass production so if there are any B-grade enamel pins of greater than 15% in a batch, I will request a remake for quality which will have a bit of a longer wait time. I will be on top of quality check before and after receiving pins to the best of my capabilities. Please note that some slight color variation may occur from my original artwork due to each viewer's monitor settings and what colors can actually be generated in reality. \n\nI am the sole person designing, planning, ordering, packing and shipping out the packages. If any delay comes along, I will certainly let you backers know as soon as possible and keep you all updated. I will answer questions to the best of my ability.",
  "1. Delay of shipping the pins due to slow production because of local holidays/defects.\n2. Actual color of the design might not look exactly the same with the digital art design posted.\n3. If you have any problems or concerns with the shipping of your parcel, please contact me ASAP through email or message me directly on Instagram and i will help you with my best. But in the cased that you missed out on receiving your parcel it is your responsibility to contact the courier.",
  "We're transparent in communicating the physical and mental demands that come with running a restaurant. It's no secret that a bigger space means that the responsibilities, expenses and maintenance will double. One of the biggest risks is not having the right team to divide the responsibilities amongst. We've experienced this in the past. We've been working from within our current team to build a better structure for operations, prep and service.\n\nAnother risk in opening \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" is the challenge that comes with running two locations. The structure and demands of our small cafe is being scaled down to accommodate a breakfast and brunch menu w/a fresh juices, coffee and tea in the early half of the day. Our full service location will be for lunch/dinner and nightlife service. Strategically having these locations open at different times will help with balancing out the managerial needs and maintenance of both spaces.",
  "The only possible risk is that i might ship your products with a little delay.",
  "Vegan food is hotter than ever and it is growing every day at the moment.\nWe hope to be one of the first vegan food trucks of our kind here in Sweden, and by being first together with serving amazing food we hope to become more and more popular and more and more known, so that we eventually can open up a 2nd and then a 3d truck, there is a dream about Vegan EVERYTHING being in both Denmark, Norway and Finland as well in the future.\nThere is risks and challenges with everything you decide to do, but if you never try then you will never know. Vegan food and healthy food is everywhere, but a vegan food truck serving the vegan food that we are going to serve is something we have not seen here and that is what we are so optimistic about!\nIf a problem would show up, we would just have to work our hardest to solve it.",
  "As anyone who's traveled knows, crazy can and does happen. All you can really do is plan for contingencies and adapt when they occur. I will be purchasing travel insurance best suited to cover the nature of this trip in case something major does happen. Should travel plans change backers will be updated. Also all artwork will be fully insured during shipping for full reimbursement to backers should it be lost or damaged and there is no possibility of replacement (ie. original artwork not prints). \r\n\r\nThough I've tried to plan my trip for the most suitable weather for outdoor painting, it is always possible that some days that might not be true. If the weather is not cooperating and I'm not able to paint outside I'll do my best to find a interior sheltered location in which to paint, or do an extra painting another day. But if I'm not able to complete all the plein air paintings purchased by backers while on the trip, then the remaining number of paintings will be completed in studio from photos once back home in the same style and size of their plein air counterparts and backers receiving these paintings will be notified of the change. \r\n\r\nLastly, though access to wireless internet is common place while traveling these days, we all know that sometimes it goes out. I'll do my best to update my blog at least once a day, but if there are internet problems it might be late.",
  "The biggest risk and challenges  associated with participation in Spectrum Miami is taking the time away from my students and finding the extra time while I'm teaching to keep my creative projects moving forward. The risk is spending the time and money to put on a good quality exhibit and not achieving the results I need to keep moving forward as an artist. If I get picked up by one gallery, or sell the pieces on the floor, I will consider it a success. But its long term growth as an artist and advocate for the arts which has led me to take this project on.",
  "There's no risk involved, especially if you liked issue 1 and 2. When the project reaches it funding goal it will be professionally printed and posted to each and every person who funded the project.\r\n\r\nThe magazine is guaranteed to be at least 68 pages in length, in full colour containing articles about eight bit computers written by enthusiasts of eight bit computers.\r\n\r\nIssue 1 and 2 was successfully funded and received positive feedback. Issue 3 aims to be even better.",

  "There is many risks and challenges ahead for us, most notably that we will fail to raise the required amount and the project fails. This is will be most unpleasant and will mean that all of the money raised thus far will be returned to it's lender as this is an all of nothing vehicle.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we might face is that Belan Hall is under such heavy snow that we will not be able to get there. If this is the case we will scratch our stubble and agree on an equally creative (though less remote) place to record.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we could face is that we don't receive any bookings for festivals, which although unlikely, could happen, as at this stage we only have it in 'word' and not 'writing'. If this is the case and we fail to agree on any festivals the THE FESTIVAL prise will be refunded to the sum of \u00a3300 and the THE VIP will be offered as a makeweight.\r\n\r\nThe final challenge will be staying fit and healthy and creative, if for any reason a release date is pushed back we will give you ample warning and communicate throughout.",
  "With your support we will have our project completed and ready to deliver by March 2015. We will keep you up to date with all progress and feel free to contact us for any reason at JustinAlanBlackBand@gmail.com.",
  "We are giving ourselves the month of November to fully realize the songs and ensure our confidence during the recording process. The most realistic challenge we think could happen would be the need for more recording time and in turn more money. An obvious risk is the potential inability to reach our goal of $1,500. This would be a set back to the creation of the album, the production of CD's and general saving for future tours/recording projects. We hope to release the album in the early new year.",
  "Filmmaking is always a complicated and involved process with room for many unforeseen problems (trust us). However, with our amazing team, I know we'll overcome any problems that arise in a creative and effective way.

You're part of the team now!\r\n\r\nAnd if another fire comes our way you can BET we'll fight it off with our BARE HANDS!!! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqw1gq-5UZY)",
  "Primarily everything is being planned by myself but there are some things that require speaking with and coordinating everyone involved will be a bit tough. This project is also a bit experimental as everything will be edited on tablets(i Pad) with a wide selection of interesting editing programs that create surprisingly great quality videos. Casting the actresses for Claire and Moira could also be challenging as they are iconic characters with a specific look but thankfully there are a few theatre student volunteers who are interested so it'll just be a matter of choosing the right people. Lastly there's finding the right location to film at that reasonably captures the look of the various environments within the game, but with enough research a place should be found.\r\nI personally believe with the right amount of effort put into all the variables there should not be any issues working on this project.",
  "Every great business venture involves some risk.  I feel I am very well prepared because of my years of experience in the food service industry.  Everything from waitressing to cooking to bookkeeping.  I have over 20 years under my belt to handle the hustle and bustle of preparing and serving food.  I've utilized many resources to properly guide me on my journey to entrepreneurship.  Most invaluable has been my business advisor Matt from the CT Small Business Development Center (SBDC).  He has successfully assisted in the opening of over 50 food based businesses and his tutelage and guidance has been my greatest gift.  I believe slow and steady wins the race.  So my goal is to expand Dutch's without going \"too big, too soon\".  A consistent quality product is always my first priority.  My focus for successful business will be proper financial management, well developed marketing strategies, building a strong team, superior customer service and continuously looking for opportunities to improve.  Our biggest challenge will be attracting non vegan customers.  To overcome that challenge we plan to have as much face to face contact as possible.  I believe that most people are open to listen and try something new once even a small amount of trust is established.  If we can be on hand to answer questions about ingredients or preparation it will help them gain a better understanding and be less fearful of eating something new.  It only takes one bite to be hooked.",
  "There are two major challenges: this being a collaborative project and being held outside.  The commitment from the artists is present, however, emergencies do arise at the most unexpected times.  The other is the weather, if the weather stops the event it will be rescheduled for a later date.",

  "Well, we could freeze to death... no just joking! There is the risk that no northern lights will appear or that the weather will be so cloudy or foggy that even if there are northern lights, we won't see them. But this is why we go for 3 weeks to get a good chance of clear nights with hopefully lots of northern lights. Otherwise there are no risks just fun in the cold winter nights ;-)",
  "The biggest challenge will be getting all the calendars out to backers in time for the holidays. The funding period closes on the 8th of November and the printer has assured me that I can get an eight day turnaround on printing. With an estimated seven days to ship at the most, I'm looking to have the calendars by the 23rd or 24th of November. It'll be hectic, but I believe I can get them all shipped within two weeks. That means they're out my door two and half weeks before Christmas. If the response is so large that I need to hire help to make that happen, then I'll do that.",
  "There's actually very little risk!  The first issue is more or less done and paid for.  The authors are paid and the artist is paid.  The only one who hasn't been paid is me!\r\n\r\nLet me explain.  I intend to put out this high quality science fiction magazine regardless of what happens on this Kickstarter.  So, why am I Kickstarting?  Because I intend to use Kickstarter as an investment platform. By supporting this first issue of Cirsova, you are investing in the future of the magazine.  Proceeds from the Kickstarter will be used to fulfill orders and profits will be used to purchase stories for a second issue.",
  "There are many challenges with completing a project of this size. The main one is being able to pay a professional lay out artist to set up the magazine for printing. This is a very specific skill set and it doesn't come cheap!\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is getting all the content together. It takes a tremendous amount of time and creative energy to write the stories, take the photos and put the whole thing together in a cohesive whole. While I've written and published many articles for other magazines, I've never put a whole magazine together myself. The previous editor had years to figure this out and I was part of the team, but I have never been responsible for a magazine from start to finish, so I'm learning as I go. \r\n\r\nThe final challenge; allowing enough time to actually create the content and production. I always think I'll be able to finish a project much faster than I actually do. As you can see from the above video, I originally expected to have this out by early summer. Here it is, late fall, and I'm finally done pulling all the articles and pictures together. I'm working with a lay out artist now to design the magazine, and by the time this campaign ends, I will finally be ready to go to print!\r\n\r\nEverything in this magazine has been done from scratch; there is no pre-made template where you just plug images in and voila, you have a magazine. I'm building it all from the ground up. Even finding a printer has been a challenge since so few places exist now that print in the style I want to print in! \r\n\r\nEvery step of this magazine has been tackled one piece at a time. If further delays come up, it will be handled in the exact same way; with transparency, honest communication and lots of elbow grease!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your pledge and support! Rock on! \r\n\r\nxo Rev. Michelle",
  "The largest risk involved after funding is complete is also the next challenge. After the Registrations are filled out, the Legalities Sorted, and the Teaser is shot, the Over-all Film Budget will be the next Kick Starter Project in order to complete this masterful film project and get it entered into the hands of the Film Festival Circuit and Possible Distribution.\r\n\r\nIf this project succeeds and the over-all budget fails, I will still strive in all manners possible to continue to raise the funds for the Full Feature Film Project.\r\n\r\nBackers who do fund this successful project will still receive all related rewards and promises made in this Project if it does reach its Goal. If the Full Budget Kickstarter Project reaches its goal, the Backers of this project will be automatically credited as promised from this Funding without further Backing necessary for the Full Budget Fund.\r\n\r\nAny amount of funding over this preliminary goal will be transferred to the Full Feature Length Budget Fund Project and bring that Project's Initial Goal lower.",
  "1. I understand that restaurants face their fare share of challenges.  That is one of the reasons we are starting with a food truck.  This will allow us to introduce West Michigan to an all vegan dining experience, while running a lean operation and making data-driven decisions to ensure our success and growth.  Having a seasoned veteran of the industry on our team will help us avoid some of the common pitfalls of a food startup.\n2. The timeline could be pushed back as purchasing, outfitting and licensing a truck can sometimes take longer than planned.\n3. NASA says that thousands of meteors hit the ground every year so the chance of one of them hitting our truck is something that keeps us up at night.\n\nThank you all so much for your continued support with my companies Bit Baking Co. and Cheeyeah and I look forward to sharing this amazing project (and food) with you! \n\nPeace & Love",

  "This is the second time that I and four friends stayed on my friend's land in New Mexico for a month of art creation. Last year was a great success. This year we have planned our schedule and meals, and have a good estimate of our costs. I would say generally the biggest challenge for me is planning. With this project, I have a clear schedule of work and a definite number of paintings to finish, which corresponds to the days of the month of July: 31. It is always good for me to be working on something that I know I will be giving to someone for them to enjoy.",
  "The risks and challenges are fairly minimal. I've already been accepted to the Fellowship and I have transportation. The only obstacle really standing in my way is money.

I will continue to monitor the situation and should any updates need to be made about shipping expectations, I will update accordingly.",
  "The production time of the pins is completely beyond my control, because a manufacturer makes the pins for me after I send them my design. Normally it takes about 4 weeks of production, if there is any delay I'll let all my backers know.\n\nThe colors may change slightly once the pins go into production. If something in my design changes, I'll notifiy all backers.\n\nThe cost for shipping are standard delivery, without any tracking code. This way I can keep the shipping costs low for you. I am not accountable for lost or damaged pins, but if the damage occurs under my accountability, I will gladly have a new pin send to you!",
  "While I am seeking $10,000 to fund the 2nd stage of this new album, in truth that only covers the recording fees. I actually need another $3,000 beyond this to print the album and another $5,000-7,000 for marketing and advertising costs. So, the completion of this project is contingent on gaining these extra funds at some point. I've set this Kickstarter campaign threshold at $10,000, but I sure would appreciate if I were able to achieve much more than that. My dream goal is to raise $20,000. The extra funds will be used wisely in the completion of an album that will be a pinnacle of my career!",

  "We truly believe No Planet B Festival will make an impact from the offset creating a positive energy for the future of our planet. \r\n\r\nBut of course all things have their challenges, and by highlighting them here we aim to to be fully transparent with you, so that we can all grow on this journey together! \r\n\r\nRisks: \r\n\r\n1) Ticket Quantity Sold: \r\n\r\n- Being a first year festival, despite our incredible line-up and fully rounded weekend of activities, we need to consider the possibility of not selling enough tickets to outweigh the expenditure involved in running this festival (which isn't cheap!)  \r\n-We have been planning for this outcome all year, and no pun intended have Plan B, Plan C and Plan D have been thought out. However, if we do not sell at least 750 tickets by May 26th we plan to discuss as team whether we look to temporary put the festival on hold until 2019. As a result Kickstarter will not charge ANY money from your accounts. \r\n\r\n2) Wet Weather: \r\n\r\n-As much as we want that Coachella festival weather, we need to face the facts that we are in the UK, and as well all know to well....festival 101 rule....bring your wellies! \r\n\r\n-We have a full wet weather contingency in place, however depending on the amount of rain (if it were to happen) we may need to cancel the festival.

This process takes time and might involve delays. However, I wish to have the book published in december 2019.\nPhoto books are expensive to print and a minimum of 500 copies are required to order. Otherwise, the unit price will become too expensive. \nIn other words, it is a 'Limited edition print' and my Kickstarter backers will have priority and a signed copy of the book.\n\nOther challenges with self-publishing will be marketing. Since I have no distributors, I will have to promote the book on the internet. Also, I will take personal contacts with selected book stores in order to have presentation. Additionally, I will of course present the book and do signing during my exhibitions.",

  "Our passion is food!. My husband and I have been in the hospitality business for 30 years.  There are other people selling their sofrito. What separates our product from other ones out there, is our commitment to using only 100% fresh product without preservatives and it is 100% vegan.  In the last couple of years we've been selling our sofrito from home, farmers markets and on ebay. \r\n  There is mainly one company that sells their sofrito at big name brand supermarkets. Since we make our sofrito without preservatives, we know that with an amazing sales and marketing team and plan, we will approach with confidence potential markets. A couple of the markets we will approach with our sofrito are, Wholefoods, Trader Joes (these stores do not sell sofrito). You see, sofrito is used mostly in the Caribbean, so we are here to educate folks on using it on a daily basis to season and marinade all foods. It's so healthy!.  I've researched the benefits of the ingredients in the sofrito and you'll be pleasantly surprised to find out how good it is for a good diet and health promotions. \r\n     We have also pledged to give back to the community. every month, we will choose a charity or family to lend a financial hand.\r\n \r\n      With your monetary pledge, we will :\r\n\r\n.mass production\r\n.All necessary licences \r\n.commercial kitchen rental\r\n.sales and marketing\r\n.distribution\r\n\r\n     We thank you in advance for taking the time to read our story and be a part of something amazing.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nSharon and Jim",
  "What we find challenging is getting 100% funded and finding that perfect spot in the metro.\r\n\r\nBetween us both we have 26 years of kitchen experience both in cooking and in assisting in the day-to-day operations. We have worked the past 5 years in perfecting our recipes and studying the vegan and gluten free lifestyle in order to provide quality products for our guests to enjoy.",
  "Starting any business can of course come with unique challenges. \r\n\r\nSome problems we can foresee are the following. \r\nDelay in getting license due to slow bureaucracy\r\nDifficulty in getting into a suitable kitchen\r\nGetting our product into big shops - supermarkets will be quite challenging to get into. The focus at first will be on smaller shops.  \r\n\r\nWhile we anticipate the bureaucratic problems. We believe that finding an appropriate premises will not be a problem. Also while it may take longer to get into bit supermarkets, we believe that due to the exploding demand for vegan products we will see great growth.",
  "The biggest challenge for me was finding the right producer. And I've already found the perfect guy.\r\n\r\nLorenzo and I did a practice run with my song, Crosby Street, and he nailed it. He wrote parts for a guitar, banjo, bass, keys, even back up harmonies for me to sing for myself. He heard the music I wrote and then he heard the possibility that lies within it. And the best part is that he then knew how to execute it. He knows the best people to work with. And my favorite part is that he knows me. He knows how to push and challenge me to stretch my talents to create something that's better than I could have imagined. \r\n\r\nWith that secure, I feel no fear of risk, only excitement for opportunity.\r\n\r\nOh. I forgot. It will be a challenge for me to stay in tempo, but that's not news to anyone that's seen me play. I promise I'll overcome it. Mostly.",
  "Once this project is successfully funded, I intend to proceed quickly through the tangled process of editing, mastering and recording the album.  Of course, there can be delays at any step, graphic design glitches, finding common time to get everyone together, but having gone through this process many times, I'm confident that I'll have a product for you by this fall - in time for holiday gifts!",

  "I'm a rookie.  I've never made a zine!  My projected costs are based on research, but who knows what I might not have thought of.  I think I have some great connections and leads on promoting it, but some of these put me under some pretty short deadlines.  I hope that those deadlines will be a great motivation to get things done in a timely manner!",
  "There are many risks and challenges with making a film.  One of the challenges we have come to face is equipment we are here to raise some money to overcome that.",
  "The risks for this project are minimal.  If I receive my minimum funding amount, I will finalize, professionally print, publish, and begin to advertise the screenplay.  The actual writing of the screenplay is not reliant on funding of this project.  I am certain I will have it completed by December of next year.  I intend to keep all contributors updated on my progress.  The only major challenge I face is taking this project to the next level.  I have no connections in any aspect of the film industry and would have to rely first on the quality of my final product, and secondly on advice on how to get my product known to those in the film industry.  Those who contribute at this base level of the project are guaranteed success.  Together, we will see where we can take it from there.",

  "Setbacks are almost a certainty, but with precision, focus and lots of rehearsals, we assure that hiccups and hurdles won't be happening. I've set up a very rigid pre-production, production, and post-production schedule and plan to adhere to this 100% of the way. Even in pre-production, we've encountered hurdles, losing a couple of actors, and re-writing things on the fly to keep on line to make a great film. \r\n\r\nI plan on screening this theatrically after it is complete, and then taking it to festival play to ensure that everyone will see what their money went to.",
  "We are going to get this album done, no matter what. If we have busk on the street of downtown Asheville barefoot every weekend for the next five years to pay for it, we will.

There will be many unforeseen hurdles and hiccups, but we will use our brains and our incredible resources and work through them. Thank you for believing in us.",

If I find I'm in need of a lot more pins than I have quoted my manufacturer, then obviously that will cause some delays.\n\n\u2022 Potential minor design changes - my manufacturer has already approved the borb designs so we should be good to go, so i'm being cautiously optimistic that there will be no issues - but you never know! I may have to tweak things during production.",
  "The paintings are completed so that isn't a risk. (This project will clear my art debts and let me buy supplies to create my next project.)\r\n\r\nRisks include damage/alterations to paintings while displayed for publicity or during shipping.

I am doing my best to make sure the paintings will be protected during shipping (glassine, water resistant wrapping and foam board) but damage might occur.",

Within the past year I have decided that I need to share my passion with others. Which is why I have become interested in photography and writing, because I feel they are the best routes to share my experiences with others.\r\n\r\nI am taking on an amazing endeavor. Because of the challenges I know that I will face, I have spent a lot of time researching everything I need to be successful. \r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I am not able to start this project without the help of all of you. Your pledges will pay for my hiking equipment, living expenses throughout 2018, and will allow me to publish my photo book once it is completed.",

I am also not responsible for any taxes, claims, or additional fees that your country may require.

  "This is our 6th Kickstarter and we are very familiar with enamel pin production and order fulfillment. Please visit our Etsy store if you'd like to see our customer reviews. :)\n\nMost of the anticipated potential risks occur in pin production or shipping delays. If a delay occurs during either phase, all backers will be notified. As with all Kickstarters, if this is not funded, there will be no charge to you.\n\nThank you for your support! :)",
  "There are very few risks associated with this type of project, however we understand things may and do arise especially at the worst possible time. Potentially the only real risk that could cause any delays would be in the mastering from digital to analog or from the company chosen to produce the 7\" being unable to complete the project in a timely manner. In which case we would still be able to offer all of our incentives, only at a later date.",
  "Colors & design changes:\nFinal products can have slight color variations from the provided images due to monitor/computer settings. I will work with my manufacturer to try to get the best match for the PMS colors that I have chosen for these designs!\nThere is a possibility that there will be minor design changes to the pins (ie:  line thickness) due limitations in production, but I will try to stay as true to the design as possible. If there are major changes needed, I will notify backers.\n\nDelays:\nSince the pins are manufactured overseas, there is a potential for delays in production and shipping. There is also a small possibility that if my manufacturer sends a high number of damaged/faulty pins, I will have to get them remade as soon as possible. I will keep backers notified if these situations occur!",
  "This will be my second time making a pin via Kickstarter, and my main concern is making sure the manufacturer can deliver by the time I'm asking, which will be somewhere between March and May, but I have previously gone to them for my first pin, and I trust them.",
  "I am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time. There could be production issues that are beyond my control that could impact the delivery date. Also minor changes in the design may occur to prevent manufacturing problems, but these will only be made if it is absolutely necessary and every effort will be made to preserve the original aesthetic.\n\nAdditionally, though shipping logistics could always potentially be a problem, I have reliably shipped thousands of pins via USPS.\n\nIf any issues arise I will be sure to notify backers.\n\nPlease note that everyone's monitors display images a little differently. The colors shown for the pins may vary slightly when compared to the pins in person.",
  "Time. Tackling a large series like this will take time. I plan on dedicating the months of June - October to this project. I will do a few other pieces within this time frame, but only as a quick break. This will be the largest series I've completed, but I have practiced on a 20 piece series of African animals in the same style. Those 20 pieces took about two months, which is how I calculated the time frame for this project.",

There are a LOT of rules about how we're allowed to display signage and we have read them all, as well as acquired all the permits.  We have a professional painter ready to do the renovations on the wall when the weather breaks as well as sources for all of our signage and lighting.  \r\n\r\nWe will be sending out rewards as soon as they are available (which we anticipate mid Feb) and we'll do our best to customize to your liking!",
  "Because we have been running this business for over two years, we already have much of the infrastructure in place and are prepared to meet and overcome any obstacles we face. \r\n\r\nThe designs for our packaging are complete and ready to be ordered as soon as funds become available. \r\n\r\nWe will need to find and secure a commercial kitchen and can pay rent once the project is successfully funded. To fulfill orders, we will need to hire two bakers. Our family has had many years of combined experience in the food production industry--Grigor as a restaurant owner, Christina as a coffee shop assistant manager and baker, and Tony as a professionally-trained pastry chef--which will enable us to start up and run a kitchen that meets all Health Department and FDA requirements.\r\n\r\nIf you have any concerns about our ability to deliver quality products in a timely manner, please ask away and we would be happy to answer any of your questions!",
  "The biggest challenge to getting the record out by September will be making sure the band can all be off for 3 days to make the record.\r\n\r\nThe other challenges that we can forsee we have found help to package envelopes, so that should be covered.\r\n\r\nThis will be 4 songs instead of the 8 we were looking to make in the prior kickstarter project. We have a new studio on board to help us make the project that will make this go quickly and save us some time and money!",
  "I have had a lot of help from friends going through the recording process. As you all know some of the money funding this project has to go fulfilling perks! which if all goes well everyone that becomes part of this EP or \"backs\" will be getting some pretty awesome stuff.

I have already lined up a team of friends that have been there helping me make this record from the start to also help ship your GOODS! Whether I have to drop it off at your house personally or if i have to ship it to the north pole. The idea here is you get what you put in plus more.",

  "There are Risks and Challenges associated with any restaurant startup. Here's why we think VURRITO's standards will mitigate those risks. For one, there is no one currently doing what we do. Our competitors are the non-healthy options that are not good for us. They contribute directly to obesity, heart disease, global warming and animal cruelty (just to name a few). VURRITO\u2122 is a sustainable, cruelty-free food option for everyone. \r\n\r\nOne of the of the most important aspects of a restaurant business is controlling food costs.  VURRITO\u2122 can lead the fast-casual industry in food cost percentage and at the same time, provide the highest quality ingredients!  All of our ingredients are used in multiple menu items, which reduces the cost and potential waste of each product. We also have very little chance of cross contamination, there are no animal by-products, which means no nasty salmonella.  \r\n\r\nWe believe there are multiple effective and profitable ways of bringing VURRITO\u2122 to the masses! VURRITO's model is exceptionally scalable and profitable: this includes catering, food trucks, farmers markets, food carts, as well as wholesale in stores or online. The sky is the limit!",
  "I am hoping for the best result, but of course I need to consider risks.\r\n\r\nThe main risk that arises is that the project will not be funded, so I am setting a goal of \u00a3100 for a start.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge for me is to find 30 different ideas in my head and get them painted onto the paper and to try not to use same elements in the painting. I think that it will be really interesting to see how my head copes with it ))",
  "The major challenge to the project that I see is getting good, usable photos that are adquate for painting references of the 14 fields that I have not personally seen.  While completing 30 large paintings in 30 weeks is a challenge I am totally confident that I can get it done.",
  "I want to make sure I raise money to fund other projects including helping local non profits. I also want to do this together with you so that we all win in being generous to our city whilst also getting art prints out of it!",
  "There are essentially no risks to this project",

Fuh-Ree-Zing!\r\n\r\nOther than that, I've done a successful mini project on Kickstarter already. So I've got a good idea about how it all works!\r\n\r\nThe only other risk is trying to safely get prints out to you. But I'll be really careful to pack them all proper!",

I have allowed for the extra work in my projected time scale and should still have everything completed by December 2013 in this most wonderful of eventualities.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am new to portraiture commissions, please rest assured that I have owned my own online business since 1998 and am very used to fulfilling orders in a timely manner on an international scale. I have also received many jewellery design commissions over the years so the concept of commissioned work is not new to me. \r\n\r\nI already have a printer lined up for the Giclee prints and another one for the postcards and stickers so I'm all ready to go. Yay!",
  "A large risk in our project would be Covid. We'll have to take into consideration how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our filming schedule as well as our cast and crew. To stay as safe as possible, we will be limiting the number of crew-members we have on set, sanitizing all equipment before and after use, and more. We will be taking the necessary steps to stay safe. And following the Texas Film guidelines for COVID safety. Our biggest priority is making sure our cast and crew healthy, comfortable, and taken care of.",

  "Risks and challenges\n- Your card will not be charged if the Dapper Cats Enamel Pin Kickstarter does not reach its goal.\n- There may be delays in production or shipping, due to time zones, and Holidays. However, I will do my very best to make sure that everyone receives their pins and goodies as quickly as possible.\n- Due to the hand-made nature of these enamel pins, there is a possibility of defective pins. (No backer should get a defective pin, so if a large portion of the batch is defective, I will communicate with the manufacturers to get this sorted as soon as possible. I have immense faith in my manufacturer as I've worked with them on three Kickstarters already. They have never let me down so far. \n- Inspections/grading will be another challenge. This will take time! I want to ensure that everyone gets perfect pins, so I usually take about 2 weeks to grade every single pin personally. \n- All US bound packages will include tracking. Some packages may be delayed due to inclement weather, post worker strikes, or other unforeseeable events. I appreciate your patience, and am happy to replace a package if it is marked as officially LOST by USPS on their tracking website. However, if your package is marked as delivered, I cannot replace it. Please make sure that your delivery address is a safe location to receive your rewards.\n- International packages are a bit tricky. These do not have tracking once they leave the US. I cannot replace missing packages due to being unable to determine with confidence whether your package was truly lost or not. To prevent loss of stock, these packages will not be sent twice. You will always be able to see when your package is sent out via the US tracking sent to your email, however, this will not show your package as it travels outside the US. Please make sure that you trust your postal system, and pledge with confidence! \n- I will keep backers posted via the updates tab, and through my social media outlets! Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you have anymore questions! (BraveLittleAvengers @ gmail. com) :)",

  "Common to Utah is the chance of winter hitting in October. To help avoid this potential issue, all scenes that take place outside are scheduled first, with many having the option of being moved to interior locations without hurting the storytelling. There is also the chance of the actual pandemic having a second wave hit around the time of production. This production will be using testing kits to make sure everyone on set is healthy as well as practicing CDC guidelines. Easier to pull off when you have a pandemic in your story and having a killer who is always wearing a mask. If there is a city or state stay-at-home order, the film will be rescheduled for next spring and will not be cancelled.",

  "As with any Kickstarter, this project runs the chance of not meeting  the funding goal. In such an event you will not be charged for your pledge.\nOther risk factors include: \n- Defective pins - which will cause a DELAY in shipment time. \n- Minimal design changes - sometimes certain details are better left  out. I will be sure to negotiate with the manufacturer to ensure that the pins will look as closely as possible to the default designs. I will  provide updates if there are further changes! \n- Lost packages - this risk will be minimized by double checking  your mailing information before sending them to me! Once an item is in  transit, it will depend on the post to handle the package. Any damages  can be negotiated with USPS office(s). \n- Health factors - these pins will be made with METAL. If you have any allergies to such, please be wary!",
  "The only thing that stands in my way of having the new album printed up is providing the upfront funds to purchase the materials & services needed to do so.  It is that simple.  There are no collaborators.  I am doing all the artwork and writing all the songs.  I am recording a SOLO record so no other musicians are involved.  There is only one guy, Patrick Herzfeld, who is recording, engineering & producing the record and we are best friends.  He has recorded three other records ( Graham Wilkinson & the Underground Township, Graham Wilkinson, and Spiritual Accessories EP ) of mine and has been my right hand drummer for over ten years.  \r\nIn the event that Patrick was unable to record this record, simply to address this section of the Kicstarter application process where we assess the \"Risks & Challenges\", I have over 10 other studios I am connected with where I could complete the process.\r\nI have three different companies lined up and ready to print up the record once it is done and have compared their prices (all of them are about the same)... and THAT is the only thing I am doing, printing up the cd's, with the Kickstarter money.\r\nIf I had to imagine the biggest challenge i will face in trying to complete this project, outside of actually raising the money, it would be finding the time in my family's busy schedule where my wife isn't working, or we have a babysitter and I'm not missing one of Zoe's soccer games so i can record - and that can be made possible all with a little communication & planning. :)",

  "The obstacles that come up are mainly financial; making copies of the final product once it is collaged.  Buying glue and scissors and tape and paper. Printing the submitted materials.  Mailing them out.  The financial burden is definitely the largest, but that will be taken care of if this campaign is successful.\r\n\r\nOther obstacles include:\r\nfinding a place that is indoors and warm to actually construct these zines.  There are always coffee shops and really sweet couchsurfing hosts, and i've got a large tarp and some rope, so worst comes to worst, i'll go to a national park and set up camp for a few days of uninterrupted zine construction.\r\nFinding a local print shop i want to give my business too, because i don't want to support any corporations who contribute to the suffering in this world.  That's easy enough, thanks to my pocket god (aka smart phone).\r\n\r\nThose are really the only challenges i can foresee, and their pretty easily solved.  I have a really wide social network and know of a lot of platforms to post calls for submissions and already have a blackbook full of amazing artists to solicit.  \r\n\r\nso, really, the only challenge is funding.",
  "The risk involved in this project is really quite minimal. The biggest challenge is getting advertisers into a very first issue of any magazine. Most advertisers want to see a bit of a track record before committing advertising dollars. So there is a good chance we will take a minimal loss on the first few issues of the magazine. Which is why we need to ensure we are properly funded to make the magazine viable long-term. Now don't get me wrong, there are many ways to get paying advertisers into a first issue, and that will be a huge point of focus. Giving advertisers an incredible looking preview of the magazine is by far the best way to do that.",

  "Because this is my first Kickstarter and I'm not sure how to gauge the reaction or the popularity.  I will be working my hardest to retain momentum and hype for the witch pins. \nIf the project is not able to fully funded, then any pledges made will not be charged! It's all or nothing! \n\n I'll be active with everyone, and for any question that you may have, I can be reached at MousieMagick@gmail.com. \n\nOnce the campaign has been funded my Manufacturer will be given the green light to proceed, Pins will be made, it will take approximately three-four weeks to get them back, and at that point, I will be grading all of the pins for quality.  Rest assured, I'm happy with my Manu, and they have always given me excellent quality. \n\n\nBest wishes x Lauren",

  "There are many risks and challenges associated with starting a food business. The demand for MALK has greatly exceeded our expectations. We just launched MALK in June at a Farmer's Market in Houston and now in February, you can find MALK in several big box grocers and numerous coffee shops and convenient stores throughout Houston, Austin and Dallas. \r\n\r\nOne challenge we now face is meeting the demand for MALK. We are doing our best as a family owned and operated business, but due to the need to produce in larger quantities we have had to hold off on expansion and fulfilling every request . The time has come for MALK to grow. Once funded, we will be able to use this money to purchase the proper equipment and fill any order that comes our way.",
  "There are a lot of variables and challenges opening a bakery/cafe. One of the biggest challenges is location. We have scouted out several locations and we have done our research. We have found several locations where both the community and the cafe will benefit from opening it's doors. Our choice location is Rhinebeck, NY. Time is of the essences. which is why we decided to use Kickstarter. Our target date for opening is ASAP (yesterday).",

Our backup plan is to have the company continue operating even when competition sees the value in our products.  There will be two other divisions of PGI: 1) ERC Corporation which will test other companies products to ensure they are 100% free of harmful chemical to one part in billions and 2) offer  our brand of polymer called Pur-Olyn to companies that want to produce 100% chemical free plastic.\r\nAlternatively, we plan to expand our offering to the healthcare industry which will include items like blood bags, inspection devices, medicine containers and anything made of plastic that should not come in contact with the human or animal body.",

The goal of this project is to get not only our creative works to you, but to get us to you.  \r\n\r\nOnce the project is backed, the hang-ups are pretty simple.  \r\n\r\nThere's always a chance our car could break down on the road, or we get stuck in a snowstorm somewhere on the way.   Regardless. . .we will find a way to make it!!!  \r\n\r\nThe EP is what runs a little more risk.  We are working feverishly to finish the audio portion of the EP production process.

If you come to see us, you can pick up your copy AT THE SHOW!!\r\n\r\nIf you're not in the area, that's ok!   We will mail the prizes right to your door.  This may take a little bit of time, but it will get to you.  Our goal is to have everybody with the EP in hand as soon as possible.  We thank you for your support and want you to be happy!\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a digital copy of the EP, we would be happy to send it to you over the internet!  That way you can get your copy much faster.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to ask us any questions about the project!",
  "While Kickstarter is a wonderful vehicle for creating my first EP, there are always risks involved when it comes to musical endeavors. I'm confident that the risks and challenges will be at a minimum, but they cannot be avoided altogether. The biggest risk we face is time, simply because of how many steps there are to the recording process. Since this project is independent, we are not operating under any major time constraints. Should the process experience delay, it will just take a little extra patience. However, I will do my best to get all of your rewards to you in a timely fashion!",

  "What We Need & What You Get-\r\n\r\nHere's the thing, we cant finish Los Muertos without your help ! We need your support to bring the Lady of the Dead to life! We started filming Los Muertos originally named ICU in the late fall of 2013 and have 1/3 of our film completed (which you can see in our teaser). We created that with minimal funding and have been gaining interest and followers around the world. If passion were money, we'd be fully funded. But art imitates life, and damn it, things cost money! So... we need some. Our $85,000 target is not a lot by Hollywood standards, but it's still going to require many helping hands supporting us with small amounts. We know how hard we all work to make ends meet, so we would never want someone to pledge anything exorbitant. Give whatever you can and if you can't pledge, show us some love on social media! Every little bit helps. Because we cannot finish this film without you, the horror fans, getting involved. \r\n\r\nSocial media has opened so much opportunity and outreach, but we cannot do this alone. If we were able to reach 21,250 people around the world in support and ask them to skip buying just one $4.00 cup of Starbucks to contribute to our film, we would hit our target ! Sounds simple right? It's not. So we have to rely on those of you that do contribute to spread the word and help us motivate others. Nothing is more important than the word of mouth from you, THE HORROR FAN!          \r\n                                 \r\nYou have a powerful voice so please share our movie campaign with others, LIKE our FACEBOOK page and FOLLOW us on TWITTER! \r\n\r\nIn appreciation for you help, we have put together some cool perks for your contributions and will work on adding new ones as we go along, but please check out the ones we are offering now.\r\nThe Impact\r\nBig Hollywood studios are not the only ones that can make great movies. Help us prove that independents like us have earned a seat at the table. Ultimately, the only thing that matters is what you, the fans, think. If it wasn't for you, every movie out there that succeeded wouldn't have. You are the architects of popular culture not Big Studios. Let's take back our movies by making the movies we all wish to see!            \r\n\r\nRisks & Challenges\r\n\r\nOur target goal is entirely for full production costs and solely for the purpose of completing this film. Your contributions and support will help to make a new horror classic come to life! Every little bit helps, even your support in sharing our campaign by visiting our web page and also LIKING and FOLLOWING us on our social media platforms. So please spread the word about Los Muertos to everyone! \r\n\r\nWe will work hard to raise our goal within the next 45 days. All funds will be will be thoughtfully utilized in the best way possible and stretched to its limits.\r\nHow will the money be used?\r\n\r\nWe cant make this movie without a budget, PERIOD! \r\n\r\nWe have 5 areas to cover !!\r\n\r\n1.  30% - Our biggest chunk is obviously crew. We can't get these guys to do anything without waving a little green in front of their eyes. Bringing a KICKASS HORROR will take the efforts of our crew to wear many hats, go without sleep (thank God for coffee!), and effortlessly do what it takes to make this film happen! Our effects, set dressing, makeup/art departments are also in this category and without them we have no magic!!\r\n\r\n2.  25% - Editing is the next expense we will encounter. Since we will shy away from an all CGI platform, we have to depend on the look, feel and sound that a good movie needs. Editing, color correcting, audio and processing is a definite must we cannot skimp on!! \r\n\r\n3.  20% - ACTORS. What will we do without them? Not a damn thing!  Apparently, it's customary to pay and feed these folks? The nerve of some people huh? We need them and we need to feed and buy them ice cream daily. No, but we do have to pay for their skill and talent which brings characters and the story to life. We tried monopoly money, guess it didn't work!\r\n\r\n4.  15% - Seems we cant film like we would like to without permits. Go figure!        But we do need them as well as liability insurance and clearances which falls into this category. The support from local owners of specific locations and businesses for our shoot has been EXTREMELY overwhelming and we've been thrilled that they opened their doors to our production. This all adds to production value and authenticity. Of course location is everything and some do come with a price. So this, too, can be a challenge to consume all our budget. Do I smell favors cooking?\r\n\r\n5.  10% - And last but not least we have PUBLICITY. This little area is what we need to shout out to the media and world that we have arrived damn it ! Yes even social media costs money to be done strategically. Not only social platforms, but shows, festivals and events to promote also need funds. Your continued support in spreading the word about LOS MUERTOS will intensify our efforts even further.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a tremendous POSITIVE NOTE, we have been contacted for distribution already just with our teaser clip and we only have 1/3 of our movie completed. WE ARE JAZZED! HELP US FINISH IT !\r\n\r\nThe bottom line.\r\n\r\nNO sugar coating, just the straight facts. No matter how big or how small the film production company is, obstacles and challenges will arise. The key is to carefully plan a strategy to cover as many possible pitfalls in order to avoid them or correct them. This is why having a production team and mentors behind us with years of experience is priceless. We've helped ourselves even further by hiring really talented actors that have sharpened their craft and bring a wealth of additional support to the table.\r\n\r\nOne of a film's biggest challenges, after financing of course, is production scheduling for both actors and locations. Our writer specifically designed our story with a smaller cast because it allows for greater mobility, less expense and more freedom to adapt our shooting schedules due to availability and other unforeseen issues. The best way to avoid a problem is not to make one. You know, measure twice and cut once!\r\n\r\nBut seriously, we can't finish Los Muertos without actual legal tender and your HELP! So please make it rain... or shower, drizzle, or sprinkle. Even a trickle is immensely appreciated. \r\n\r\nWe will work our hardest to overcome every obstacle, but one of our biggest challenges is immediate -- raising all the financing required to make this film a reality. And this is where you all come in. Your support and word of mouth can make this film fully materialize!\r\nOther Ways You Can Help\r\n\r\nIf contibuting funds is not possible at this moment, there are other very valuable ways to help us out. Help spread the word and awareness about Los Muertos as much as possible. Social media is an amazing asset and you, the horror genre fans, have the power to make a difference.",

The PALM is new, but a working publication, and the goal is equal to our fixed expenses.  \r\n\r\nSummer in South Florida is a time when many businesses simply don't advertise and hunker down for our \"Off-season\", so funding the July issue will not only give us the experience we need to create a Crowd Funding issue, but it will help us get through the financial drought of the South Florida Summer.",

Although I am advertising an expected delivery date of Oct 2015, I am hoping to be able to ship even earlier than that.  I expect to be able to finish shooting and editing images by the end of July.  This will allow me to finish the design phase of the book in August and hopefully have the final version ready to ship in late August or early September.

  "Beyond the inherent risks of the music industry, this is a very low risk project logistically as far as we can tell. We cannot predict how the record will be received overall, but it's a piece of art we very strongly believe in. If it's something you believe in too, we're confident these funds will, at the very least, allow us to help put this record into the world and reach much further than it ever could otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe album is already recorded and basically ready to be released. We've done our homework. We've spent the past few months building a knowledgeable team of people to facilitate this release, and to reduce any foreseeable risk of the funds not achieving their full potential. \r\n\r\nWe have a publicist in place who is ready to begin promotion of the release of the album, a radio promoter on board, and release tour booked. We have a finished album and artwork ready for manufacturing, photographer in place ready to take beautiful photos, and a video artist ready to film and create. We've allowed ample time for executing all of these things prior to our Feb. 25 release date. We have every reason to believe that all of these elements can be accomplished competently and by the deadline of our release date, once they're paid for.",
  "I'm already in the studio working on the songs, so I expect to have it out by February, but sometimes making music seems to take longer than scheduled.

I'm super thankful for all of you that have grabbed the CD's in the past, or came out to shows, or recorded one of my songs for your own record. It's means a lot to me.

I don't need much, but I want to have some good equipment so it makes it more pleasurable for my viewers/audience. I just need some help if there is anybody willing to do that. There have been plenty of challenges in my history of filmmaking and if I were to tell them all to you, we'd be here a while.",
  "Permits may be a challenge, however, If things should arise , then my crew will simply remove any obstacle from the project. Seeing as though I plan on having only a small handful of people in this project, I do not see any of these issues arising.

We are also committed to contributing our own labor - sending emails, licking stamps, stuffing envelopes - to ensure the success of our marketing campaign.",
  "There are a few challenges and problems that I could encounter after this project is successfully funded. Here's how, when within my power, I plan to tackle them:\r\n\r\n\u2013 I could become ill when scheduled to record (I reckon I'll need my voice for that!) - a musician could too. This might delay things about a week or two, depending on when a recording slot is/becomes available for reschedule. I will wrap up warm this winter and try to stay healthy.\r\n\r\n\u2013 As this isn't a do-it-ALL-yourself album and I'll be working with artists, photographers and other musicians, they will have their own schedules too, so, again, there could be slight delays and reschedules here and there. I intend to get everything done before their actual deadlines to minimize the effect of these possible inconveniences.\r\n\r\n\u2013 When recording, mixing and mastering are done, and the artwork is complete, I'll be sending the master off to be replicated and printed, and the packaging to be printed with the artwork. There could be some delays in me receiving these CDs before I release the album, which is out of my hands, and it shouldn't delay the release by too much, if at all. However, if it should happen to affect the release, all that means is the album will hopefully be out in March instead of February.\r\n\r\n\u2013 I am going to be working leading up to and during the Christmas period, so... needless to say, that could definitely throw a spanner in the works. Again, I aim to skirt around this by trying to complete things before their scheduled deadlines.\r\n\r\n\u2013 I already know how exceptionally busy I am going to be from the start of this funding period in November, right the way through to February. The portraits I may be drawing for some of you may take a while... but you will get them!\r\n\r\n\u2013 I am doing this all independent of a label (I actually think this is a perfect opportunity to start my own), which - though I'm really looking forward to it - means there's a lot of work! I'll be labouring diligently in order to fulfil all the necessary tasks, reach the deadlines and get this album out there. Please be patient with me. Thankfully, I've got a bunch of really talented and supportive friends and family to help me with every aspect of this project, give me great advice and encouragement, and... make sure I get enough sleep.\r\n\r\n\u2013 I also cannot overstate how greatly I will need you too. As much as I believe in myself and believe in this album (which is so very much), my belief simply isn't enough - I need yours too. During the funding period, I'll be promoting the campaign and hoping that you'll all jump on board to help spread the word too. But also throughout this whole journey, from here to the very day you get your copies, I'll need your prayers, support and for you to keep me as motivated as you have done in the past. Thank you.",
  "As with any Kickstarter campaign, there is always the chance for delays in production and shipping. I have planned well ahead to give myself plenty of breathing room in the event of delays of complications.\n\nIn addition to this pin campaign, I am working on a large Tarot project through my Patreon as well as a full time Bachelor student. I will be using BackerKit and fulfillment services in order to ensure that neither this campaign nor my Patreon and school work will be negatively affected by the other.",
  "I feel confident about the realisation of the product; I've done a research about the aspects of the project: I've also choosen a pin manifacture, printing studio and the post office.

I'll make updates of every step on the further way.\n\nThe colors on the final pin may appear different than the mock-up designs. The apperance can also influenced by your monitor display settings. I've choosen the Pantone Chart for the colors and in addition black and white. But anyway the colors won't change radically.\n\nThere's always a risk of delayed production times, printing errors and shipment delays. I'll will be sure to keep everyone informed of all changes, if any issues come up.\n\nPlease note: Backers will be responsible for any import taxes of their country or custom fees. Please beware of that, before backing the project. \nThank you for your time and understanding!",
  "Rest assured that I have already done more than one pin before, I have my connections and know which manufacturers to trust and which to avoid. Very common risks in this type of project consists of shipping or manufacturer errors/delays.

  "Our first challenge is to find a suitable commissary kitchen to work from. If we had more funding we'd start our own kitchen but as a stepping stone we plan to rent space in an existing kitchen. We have several leads on kitchens already but so far these are all kitchens that have non-vegan food prepared there. While this is an acceptable plan B for us at this time, we would definitely to find a fully vegan kitchen such as partnering with an existing vegan restaurant that does not offer lunch service or has extra space.\r\n\r\nOur second challenge is logistics, setting up our delivery system. We're still determining whether we will hire our own delivery drivers or use a contracted service. We've contacted several existing delivery services and the challenge is most will only deliver orders received through their websites, whereas we plan to take orders off our own website and need those processed for delivery. \r\n\r\nOn the technical side we face the challenge of making a simple, easy to use interface for ordering. Our website is a Wordpress site with Woocommerce and it will take some custom programming to enable pre-ordering and scheduled deliveries.",
  "The only real risk here is missing out on helping me make the best pizza I've ever had.",
  "This project has been challenging because working with a great producer has added much travel and schedule juggling resulting in greater expense and less income as time has been given to travel and record.  Once this project is completed I am unclear with how to proceed but I am talking with seasoned recording artists and learning so much about how this differs from my experience as a Live performer only.  I do hope to tour the Pacific Northwest when the album is done and share what I believe God has given me.  I don't know who else needs to hear that life is full of unwelcome events and moments ~ but it does not change who God is and what He has in store for you.  I know He has shown me this.  Suffering is what this world offers.  Thank God this isn't all there is.  That's my message.  You can cry.  Then be glad.  In weakness - He is strong.  In tears - comes joy.  Thank You Jesus.",
  "As with any, especially creative project, there are risks and challenges. I have a great crew working to help me accomplish my goal of releasing my debut solo album, Maiden Voyage. But their could be unforeseen obstacles. Perhaps it will take longer to get each song exactly the way we want it. We may be counting on a certain musician to add a fiddle or accordian track, and they could have an emergency that would keep them from keeping their recording date.  Would we move ahead, and just lose the musical vision we had for that artist's contribution?  No, probably not.  We would work them into our schedule, and it could cause the record to be released later than we thought.\r\n\r\nThere could be problems with the actual physical production of the cd.  It could be delivered with technical flaws, and we would have to send it back to fix the problem. \r\n\r\nWe are fully committed to this albums release, and I believe the biggest risk would be that it would be ready later than we hoped.\r\n\r\nAs far as our incentives go, it could be a challenge to schedule your house concert or party at a time that works well for us both.  But as I said before, I am committed and determined to fulfill every promise, and we will find that perfect date for me to perform at your home or wherever you would like.  I am very much looking forward to this aspect of rewarding and thanking my backers for their support. \r\n\r\nThe money raised will go toward the hard costs of making the CD, and paying my marvelous musicians and production crew. And if  we exceed our goal, these dollars will go towards funding a tour to support the record, and for publicity and promotion.",

I will just have to see what level of interaction is required but I can see it bogging me down if I'm giving updates on Kickstarter, the Google documents, and the blog. I will play this by ear and will likely set a schedule for these things. I will maintain the blog updates, which are practically daily, but that's not feasible across the blog, Google docs, and the Kickstarter page. The Kickstarter page and Google docs will become more regulated and will likely be updated once or twice per week.",
  "Risks and challenges are few. There are lots of places that do CD duplication and production and they do great work. I've priced some local and national businesses and have narrowed the choices. I've got a great designer working on the album jacket and I've secured the rights to use a photo by renown photographer Art Shay on the cover. My hope is to keep duplication and production local; I like to keep my money close to home. In short, everyone on the \"team\" knows what they are doing and they've done it before, so the risks are minimal. If we make the goal, we'll have a record.",

However, there are a lot of moving parts with importing. Unplanned or unforeseeable events may delay shipment from our suppliers and in effect delaly delivery of your Crownby Program. \n2) Quality Control. This risk exists anytime a product is outsourced.

However, these pins are being manufactured for me - therefore the production process is outside of my control. Potentially we could hit delays if the manufacturer experiences any issues. Other small issues could be slight changes in linework or color.

We are focusing this year on films in a digital format to reduce the logistical risks involved with a 35mm format. We have also moved forward our close of programme date by one month. (we currently have 80% of feature films confirmed)\r\n2)\tFunding gap: We have started our funding campaign earlier than in previous editions, and of course, Kickstarter should help us fund the festival in advance.\r\n3)\tKey volunteer risk: We have established teams of at least 3 individuals in each key area, allowing us to react quickly if for some rason any member of the team needs to take a break",

Availability of our guest speakers.  We are still scheduling the line up of speakers and have not made any promises as to appearances.  However, we believe our roster of speakers from last year proves our ability to produce an array of stimulating speakers.\r\n\r\nThe major challenge is expanding the audience.  Being in our second year allows us to capitalize on our first year's publicity. In addition to that we plan to purchase ads in local newspapers, online media, and industry trades, and reach out to community and student groups.

We opened The Chromatic Dragon in 2015, and that was 10 times more precarious because of the liquor license.

We've already invested over $50,000 in the project to get this far and one of the things a successful Kickstarter will do, in addition to providing additional funding, obviously, is demonstrate to our investors that there is a market here in Savannah for the type of business that we have planned.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have nearly the perfect team for overcoming this obstacle.  People said a gamer pub would never work.  Not just any people, but people who have made their careers in the Savannah food & beverage industry.  They told us gamers wouldn't come out to a pub.  And they told us the ones who did would not spend any money.  They told us we needed to have ESPN and girls with bikini tops and basically the same thing every other bar has.  But we proved them wrong with The Chromatic Dragon and we want your help to do it again with 8-Bit Donuts.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would be remiss if we didn't mention the very real possibility that Cthulhu, the Great Old One, will awaken from his aeons-long slumber and drive the world into a long, dark age of madness.  But we feel like our team is ready for that challenge, as well.  After all, insane Cthulhu cultists need gourmet donuts and craft coffee, right?  And, with so many tentacles, Cthulhu would probably enjoy playing all of our arcade games at the same time!",
  "The good news is, the landlords accepted our offer for the lease! They were aware of our reputation and keen for us to have the tenancy.

  "Any expedition to remote parts of the world holds an array of risks and challenges. The two largest potential risks for this expedition will be weather concerns and the scarcity of animals in the region. I hope to create shots of multiple wild animals but there is no guarantee that I will find all the subjects I am looking for (polar bears and arctic foxes being some of the more challenging animals to photograph in their natural habitat). The same goes for the Aurora Borealis, another natural phenomena which hopefully will manifest during my time there. With two solid weeks out in the field I feel confident I will be able to meet both of these goals.  Barring any major equipment failures, I should bring back thousands of exposures resulting in a large array of images to choose from.",

  "Challenges ... having a successful Kickstarter campaign! But we have faith that people will help us reach our goal so we can get this program started.  \r\n\r\nLocal community garden clubs that already do straw bale gardening are on board to lend their help and expertise. Students from area colleges and universities will be able to earn credits through internships and practicums, senior centers have agreed to post volunteer opportunities for those individuals that had to give up their gardens when they moved into senior living apartments but who still have a passion for \"playing in the dirt\", scouts can earn badges and so much more. So - we think hands on help won't be a problem.  \r\n\r\nWith the crazy weather that this area is experiencing, a drought and water restrictions are possible this season, but having learned from my Dziadziu (Grandfather in Polish) a garden can grow anywhere (Passaic, NJ) and water falls from the sky - you just have to grab it. So rain water barrels will be used to hydrate the garden as much as possible. Pests, maybe. Sustainable gardening practices will be used and critters like lady bugs will be released.  \r\n\r\nRisks are part of life ... handling them knowledgeably and with respect for all people, plants, animals, and the environment will be first and foremost in our approach. Oh - and the key to addressing risks and challenges is not being afraid to ask for help!",

  "Challenge 1  \r\n\r\nQ: How do you plan to secure a site [in which to host MOPH]?  \r\n\r\nA: We'll start seeking a site to host the event on February 1, 2017.  We're positive that we'll find a place.  Seattle's a big, diverse city with plenty of options.  If we can't secure an interior site, however, we'll consider hosting MOPH outside, which may require a permit [from the city].  Some of your pledges may be used to pay these rental and/or permit costs.  We should have confirmed site information to share with the public by June 30, 2017.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge 2  \r\n\r\nQ: If necessary, how do you plan to get more creatives to submit content?  \r\n\r\nA: Before December 2016, we plan to further promote MOPH outside Seattle by posting flyers and distributing brochures, encouraging creatives to submit their work.  In February 2017, if needed, we may use some of your pledges to target creatives via web, print and/or broadcast advertising.  We plan to accept content until May 1, 2017.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge 3  \r\n\r\nQ: What will you do if you can't run MOPH?  \r\n\r\nA: If, after raising the necessary funds and choosing the content to appear in our film fest, we can't, for whatever reason, host MOPH, all the remaining funds (or pledges) will be held to execute the following year's event.  These [remaining] pledges may be used to fund many of the same things funded in preceding years.   At no point will your pledges be used to fund processes, activities or businesses not related to My Own Private Hollywood.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSince MOPH is a product of 1613 Enterprises, my own company, I have complete control over its execution.",
  "The risks of publishing a photo book include delays in design, pre-press, and print production.

  "One of the biggest challenges prior to opening is getting the funding to open up The Oak House.  So far we have received tremendous support from friends and others interested in seeing the project come to fruition.  We are nearly fully funded and this campaign will provide the funds to get us to the finish line financially.  \r\n\r\nAnother challenge, currently being tackled, is recruiting an excellent team to keep The Oak House running on an ongoing basis. Many have come forward seeking to be involved, and our connections to the university and greater Elon community have helped lead talented, motivated individuals to us.  \r\n\r\nFor our opening just prior to the start of the academic year, our challenge will be pulling it all together for a successful opening.  Ryan's expertise and detail orientation, and Phil's connections and \"make it happen\" skills will be put to the test.  We are confident that those around us committed to our success will be invaluable resources during this time.  \r\n\r\nOnce up and running, we will challenge ourselves to remain committed to our mission and always listening to the Elon community to bring in relevant product based on the tastes of those who frequent The Oak House.",

  "The greatest risk to this project is if one of the negatives becomes damaged and therefore could not be printed. I take great care with my negatives and do everything I can to avoid damage. Otherwise, all of the images have been made and printed before, and the photographic and mounting materials are readily available. The risk is low. \r\n\r\nThe greatest challenge will be to work out all of the Kickstarter and fulfillment logistics the first time through. But I am committed to do this (with a little help from my friends!) and expect that we\u2019ll have happy supporters in the end. That is one of our major goals as there are several other photographic projects planned. \r\n\r\nLastly, all of the money raised for this project will go toward the costs of producing each print. The list includes: \r\n\u2022\tPhotographic paper\r\n\u2022\tDevelopment and processing chemicals\r\n\u2022\tDry mount tissue\r\n\u2022\tMat board \r\n\u2022\tProtective tissue and coverings\r\n\u2022\tPacking materials\r\n\u2022\tShipping & insurance, and\u2026\r\n\u2022\tLots of personal labor on each print\r\n\r\nThere is no expensive equipment to buy, no big non-recurring, one-time costs, and no process discovery of any sort.

  "Mylea is a new material that is still under development. We are aware that there is still room for improvement to reach the highest quality as well as to scale up the production efficiently that might reduce the cost of production in future.\n\nSince we grow the material in-house, it may take a bit more time to set up our to-scale production facility. However, our production facility is ready to grow the leather demand up to 1000 wallet/month.\n\nWhile, as with anything, there can be surprises, we feel confident we can deliver this product on schedule by Fall of 2019. Leading up to delivery date, we will do our absolute best to respond to all of your inquiries as promptly as possible, keep you up to date on our progress, and work as hard as we can to get you your Mylea product as soon as possible.\n\nWe are only responsible for mishandling of product when it is still in our hands & are not responsible for mishandling of item when it is in the hands of the shipping company. If you wish to return the item for a new one, we only accept returns within the one week after you received your product. \n\nThe images and videos of the products and Mylea leather are prototypes \u2014 therefore, slight details may change in actual production.",
  "Basically no risk. We've made pins through this manufacturer before, have confirmed this design to be doable, and have experience shipping out pins! Should be smooth sailing.",
  "I'll be using trusted manufacturers that i've worked with before, but occasionally, minor mistakes can be made, and delays in production can happen. \n\nI will always be upfront with backers along the way. I will disclose any setbacks, delays, and any other pertinent updates.\n\nIt's important to understand that this is a crowdfunded campaign. Crowdfunded campaigns are often subject to delays due to unforeseen circumstances. Please also understand that money pledged to a crowdfunded campaign is a donation or investment. This is not an online store and you will not immediately receive your rewards after pledging.\n\nPlease note that minor changes may occur in production, and that the images presented here are my mock up designs. There is a possibility of slight changes in color and size, but I don't foresee any major issues.\n\nPin Grades\nThe Snarky Company offers two grades of pins, First Grade, and Second Grade. First Grade pins are really the only pins I offer in my online stores, and they are the only ones available for Kickstarter campaigns. Second grade pins are only available through online stores, and currently we're not offering any. Our pins are handmade and they may have minor cosmetic imperfections. \nExamples of expected First Grade imperfections:\nSmall buff marks, scuffs, or scratches on metal/enamel\nSmall specks, pores, or bubbles anywhere on the pin\nSlightly low or uneven fills\nSlightly misaligned screenprinted details (for pins with screenprinting)\nSlight variations in the distribution of giltter\nSlight defects in text (this is usually only in pins with small text)\nWe want to make you aware that these First Grade pins may have small imperfections, but 99% of the time, these imperfections are non-existent or not noticeable. \nAn important note about color and size.\nIt is crucial to understand that while we have made pins before, the pins in this Kickstarter have not yet been manufactured. The designs you see on this page are only mockups, which means the final product may have slight changes in color and size. Taking your two dimensional design, sending it to a manufacturer, and receiving a three dimensional, physical object is difficult. From our experience, the majority of our pins turn out looking like the mockup design. \nThere are so many variables when you see a mockup that you are viewing on your computer or phone. Different computers, phones, or other devices have different screen settings which means we may not all be viewing the same coloration. We use a Pantone Solid Coated book to choose the colors for our designs. The manufacturers use those Pantone numbers to know which colors to mix and apply where, however, looking at a Pantone swatch on paper, is different than looking at a Pantone color in enamel. \nEach mockup has a rough estimate of what the size will be. Our sizes are either specifying the general height of the pin, or width of the pin, however, the actual size of the physical product may vary. \n\nGlitters\nWhen you view a mockup design that has components with glitter, it is crucial to understand how glitter overlays work in Adobe Illustrator. Glitter textures are artificially created in Adobe illustrator. We have glitter textures in various shades for each color, but they come no where near to the hundreds of different glitter colors that manufacturers offer.  The mockup design may show you a section of dark blue glitter, that has flecks of dark blue and silver, however, the physical glitter may contain specs of other shades of blue, green, or silver. When you see a mockup design with glitter, understand that the glitter overlay is to give you an idea of the general color of the glitter, and where it will be on the pin. When a pin has holographic glitter, it will be labeled as holographic glitter. Holographic is what you could call rainbow glitter, each spec of glitter can reflect various different colors. What you should know about holographic glitter is that it reflects different colors depending on the enamel it is placed in. When placed in white enamel, it reflects a shade of light blue, when placed in black enamel it reflects a shade of green. \nRefunds or Exchanges\nAfter the campaign has ended, you will have ample time to make your pin selections in your BackerKit survey. You will be notified before surveys are locked down and any add-ons are charged. Once your order is locked down, we have a no refunds or exchanges policy. The only time we will issue a refund or replacement, is in extenuating circumstances, or if your pin arrives damaged (please read the section on pin grades to determine if your pin is damaged). Examples of damaged pins are, posts that are bent and unusable, posts that may have fallen off, or whole chunks of enamel that are missing. We will also offer refunds or offer to reship an item if it is missing from your order. \nRubber Backs vs. Locking Backs\nEach pin from our campaign will come with rubber backs, but we highly recommend purchasing locking backs. If you choose to adhere your pin to a jacket, bag, or other item, with a rubber back, and it falls off, we will not replace the missing pin. We do offer locking backs through our add-ons section in your survey. \nShipping Policies\nPlease visit the shipping section to read about these policies. \nComments\nMental Illness can be a very intimate and personal topic. Any one who leaves a comment that I determine to be rude, defamatory, or ignorant, will be blocked with no explanation. \nThe Denim Jacket Pledge Level\nIf you pledge for this tier, after the campaign has ended, we provide a sizing chart where you can choose your size. We'll provide 1-3 different options for jackets. We prefer Levi's jackets, but we have other chosen brands that are also great quality. From the options we provide, you'll get to choose which jacket style, color (if that style has color options), and of course your size. For the collector's box you have three options for engraving. You can choose just our Logo, just your name, or you can choose to have the Logo and your name. You'll receive one of each pin, and if that pin has multiple color options, you'll receive one of each color (for example, the Pill pin comes in four colors, you'll get all four). All pins will come on backing cards, with locking backs, and arrive packed in the collector's box. Please be careful when choosing your jacket size, as we cannot provide an exchange or refund if it does not fit. Once your pledge level is locked down (you'll be notified before the lockdown) the pledge level is non-refundable. If any of your items are damaged in transit, we will replace them though. If you purchase this tier as an international backer, we properly fill out all customs forms, but we will not be held responsible if your country loses your package through their mailing service (this means once the package is no longer with the USPS), or if they hold your package and ask for additional VAT, taxes, or fees. You'll also receive any add-on stretch goals that are successfully unlocked. If any add-on stretch goal is not unlocked, it will not come with your order. If you have any questions about this tier, please feel free to reach out.",

Thanks so much for coming on this wild ride with us, y'all. It's going to be amazing!",

  "Risks and challenges would fall into failing to reach the financial goal. If I fail to reach the specified amount, I could attempt to find a cheaper publisher, though it is unlikely I will receive the same opportunities presented from the current publisher I am aiming for. Another issue is political correctness since Native Americans are in the original Peter Pan but are referred to as 'Indians' which is the main identifier for these characters in the original. To remain faithful, I have included the identifier 'Indians', however to avoid offense to anyone, this is merely the group's name and I am going to specify that the nationality of the 'Indians' are not Native American individuals. In relation to this terminology issue, I am open to suggestions on its inclusion and execution.",
  "I've previously successfully run a enamel kickstarter and know the ropes on how to manage things. Risks come mostly with timing and scheduling being pushed back due to manufactorering errors, having to remold pins, holidays that bring delays, or having a high amount of rejects that have to be remade. \n\nOther obstacles come with international shipping and delays that come with customs and passing through borders. International shippers need to make sure to provide all necessary information to get their packages to them.",

Thanks to our first successfull Kickstarter campaign we learned a lot and were able to optimize our processes:\r\n\r\n- We get the movements directly from Sellita\r\n- We receive all components from one supplier (next to the movements)\r\n- We have produced several prototypes and all of them have been\r\n   checked and approved by an independent party\r\n- A multi-stage quality control takes place:\r\n   AQL at the suppliers side\r\n   100% check of all parts when arriving for assembly\r\n   100% check after assembly\r\n   100% check before shipment \r\n\r\nNevertheless it remains a project and delays cannot be excluded.

  "The main challenges of this project are to ensure safe transit of the rewards to their respective address', to ensure the highest chance of success we will be sticking to the steps listed below:\r\n\r\nKickstarter may take up to 21 days after the project ends to transfer funds to Peter.\r\n\r\nOur choice of printers has recently changed to Pinksheep! their product Quality and level of customer service out stripes our previous choice, We plan for the posters to be delivered ready for signing within 7 days of the \"cool down\" period.\r\n\r\nThe delivery of Packaging will take up to 5 days which I would order at the same time as the Posters, meaning the packaging will be here before the posters, allowing us to package them safely once they are signed.\r\n\r\nPosters will be signed & numbered by Peter at a rate of around 10 per day due to Pete suffering from back pain, they will then be dispatched to their correct destinations by myself, Daniel Barber.\r\n\r\nAfter dispatch, most parcels will arrive at there final destinations within 7 days but some may take up to 12.\r\n\r\nThe expected delivery time would be within 46 days of the Project coming to an end, If you do not receive them within 52 days we can discuss the situation and resolve the issue in one of the following ways,\r\n1. Use the tracking info to see where it is exactly.\r\n2. If the parcel has not moved for a day or two we will Contact Royal Mail.\r\n3.

  "I've successfully recorded and released three full orchestral/choral albums in the past, including one that was fully funded by a Kickstarter campaign ('To Shiver the Sky'), so I have a wide range of resources and experience for recording and releasing this album. The album is already slated for release in 2022 via my new record deal with the legendary record label Decca Gold/Universal, so there's no way that this album doesn't get finished. The worst that will happen is that it gets delayed.\n\nOne potential challenge will be the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: at the moment the orchestral sessions are scheduled for February 2022, but that presupposes that the virus is contained well enough such that large recording sessions can take place, and I'm able to get a vaccine and fly to London. We'll keep everyone informed about the outlook, and if necessary, we'll reschedule the sessions and those who pledged to attend them will be given the option of a refund. This may cause delays to the album's release.\n\nI have a good track record with Kickstarter: my last album was the highest grossing classical music Kickstarter ever, and I gave a very thorough behind-the-scenes experience of the creation of the album, from pre-production, to composing, to release, to marketing.

  "There's a lot that goes into making a book happen besides typing on the computer and hitting the send button. The first two novels in the series were published  by two different publishers (in 2008 and 2011), and we are now attempting to get all three in one publishing house. Restoring the copyrights of the first two books to the author so that this transition can happen will, in our case, cost a bit in fees to smooth out the intellectual property wrinkles. In addition, the third book is ready to go to editors (to whom we need to pay a living wage), and the previous books will need an additional edit before republishing by our new publishing home, Hillside Education.\r\n\r\n    This Kickstarter will smooth out all publishing wrinkles with the stroke of a key on your keyboard, providing the needed funding. Your contribution will help us to transfer the rights of all books in the series to the author, and pay for editing necessary to get the third and final book in the series in print. Having full rights to all three novels will do more than just give all three books a common home; Hillside will be able to market and license the YCC brand (Who'd like a Gilbert action figure! C'mon, you know you want one!), and a host of other things. \u2026\r\n\r\n     Well, if you're tired of waiting, and would like a bit of swag and a personal visit from the author thrown in to boot, here's your chance!",

We will also need to pay for venues for our students and tutors to teach reliably within their living area across multiple cities. As well as get in contact with the surrounding schools and places of education in order to set up extra classes for students who require extra help from us.

  "It is difficult to record high-quality audio and video of a live opera without many microphones and cameras, but these tools are expensive.  The balance will be recording budget versus amount of equipment. Smart placement and operation of the cameras and mics will overcome this challenge.\nEditing and mixing these recordings will take time, but I expect to have a finished project within about three months.\nLastly, despite the passion of the small opera community, opera remains relatively unpopular, and often intimidating to outsiders.  I believe in the music and in the story of Role Playing Game, but it will take some creative and aggressive marketing to draw people to the show.  I will be pushing for press coverage, but it is tough to guarantee marketing success for a super-low budget self-produced opera.  Please spread the word about the project to show listeners that opera can be relevant and accessible in 2019!",

A dream of sharing my love of books with the world and putting whole new worlds in others fingertips and providing unique items to make some of the fiction be a real world experience. \r\n\r\nA lot of the risk is the fear, the all or nothing nature of trying to create something successful and the fact that the future is so unknown. \r\n\r\nWhat isn't a risk is my passion. The spinning wheels in my head yelling and screaming at me to go out there and do something to share the love I have in my heart. I know exactly what I want to do. I have done my research, I know what I need to create something incredible. If only because I am creating a service I have wanted to get for myself but never having the funds to afford it.  \r\n\r\nThis business is my beginning. The struggles make the rewards all the more worth it in the end.",
  "The story itself is well-received in terms of creativity with its setting and concept; you could easily look at any online store (amazon, barnes & noble, iTunes, etc.) and understand more of the issues that this story deals with. \r\n\r\nBecause of my commitment, I actually have less free time and resources to work on this story and get it to where it needs to be. While it is becoming easier for me to write a little more often, I still need to work with a professional editor who I met recently. This respective creditable editor has offered a full structural edit. And due to the amount of words counted, this is a big purposed editing project that I wish to do.\r\n\r\nI plan to work my ass hard and making sure that we achieve one goal: re-write this story in a way that doesn't distract the reader from the journey. \r\n\r\nIt's been extremely humbling being constantly reminded of my terrible writing skills distracting a reader from enjoying this story.\r\n\r\nThe $ goal that I placed is what my editor has requested, and I wish to get started as soon as possible. This story was published 5 years ago and the fact that I've struggled to improve/fix the writing, says a lot. I've wanted to do this sooner but I have to put my love ones first with what I earn.\r\n\r\nThus, I humbly ask you to please help me gain enough funds so that I could get this story back on track and bring joy to people. It's been emotionally stressful but I promise that I would take any advantage that I can to make sure that your money isn't wasted. I plan to redeem not just my story but myself, and re-create the start of something special for people to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAny donation that you could offer would help. Hell even just $1 would make me happy knowing that there are people who support and believe in me and my story's potential.\r\n\r\nI am going to be sent on deployment sometime this year and I would hate myself if one of my biggest regrets continued to distrub me while committing to my country. A clear mind helps a sailor, and helps a human being.\r\n\r\nI DO NOT intend to charge people for my E-book; even if I was getting perfect ratings, I refuse to charge the first story in a series that I believe will achieve something and impact the lives of many. It's seflish and egotistic in my opinion and I plan to keep my promise.\r\n\r\nThis editing project should last 6 months. It IS a long time but I agreed with my editor that this was important in order for us to give Rey de Noches a full-nothing held back editing job. All to make sure that I don't disapoint anyone with my writing again...or myself.\r\n\r\nThank you so much.",
  "The challenges of Dignity Music always include finding the *right* musicians for this project: friendly, nonjudgmental, talented and flexible! Some of the \"regulars\" include Ben Dean (violin), Philip Boulanger (cello) and Bethany Wilder (violin / viola); these are wonderful musicians, but also people who enjoy talking with people and connecting to others through music.\nAnother challenge is making sure we are in the right environment to present music. Most conversations are interesting and kind, but aggression and fights can break out and it is important to keep the musicians (and their instruments) feeling safe.",
  "We are eager to get in the studio and begin recording however projecting timelines is difficult. Aligning schedules can be a challenge but we are dedicated to beginning recording before the New Year. \n\nDepending on the amount we are able to raise we may or may not be able to complete the whole album. Many of our donor gifts depend on completing the whole album but we will work each one of you to find solutions in the event we fall short of our funding goals.\n\nWhile we have received overwhelmingly positive interest from record companies that is also a challenge when trying to project timelines. The release of the full album is temporarily marked for a fall 2019 release. Thank you for your patience, understanding and continued support.",
  "The project is straightforward honest, simple, and easy. The hard work is done. We are in execution phase so things are really mechanical at this point. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest risk is that the project is really driven by one person -me.

  "The risks and challenges associated with a project like this are not so much about whether or not we can pull it off - we can, and we have already begun preparing the gallery and framing the artwork - but whether or not we will be able to secure our fundraising target to safeguard the Hellenic Museum's mission to inspire a passion for Hellenic art, history and culture through a variety of exhibitions and education programs.   \r\n\r\nThe risk of not securing our fundraising target will propose the challenge of overcoming loss of funding from our overall Exhibitions and Education Budget, impacting the implementation (or not) of future programs at the Hellenic Museum.",

  "We've weathered the riskiest part of filmmaking: filming! Our talented cast and crew bested mother nature and all of the uncertainties of working on a film set. Now, our post-production is working on transforming our raw art into a professional and absorbing movie. The last challenge is to apply to film festivals. Luckily, your funds help us apply to those festivals and ensure that the film gets the widest possible audience it can.",
  "Shooting for ten days in sub-zero temperatures and sideways blizzards was certainly a challenge. But executing the trailer during the harshest time of year was a huge opportunity to prepare all of us for what it means to make a film in Iceland! We are collaborating with an Icelandic crew who knows exactly what they're up against, and now so do we.\r\n\r\nThe creative team is in place and the principal roles have been cast; the film has taken on a life of its own. Financing will kick the mechanism into gear, and the resources that we secure on Kickstarter are a key step towards making that happen.",
  "This is a double beneficial project. There is a dual purpose for the Test Kitchen. It will be used to conduct classes but also to produce products that are sold to the community, so it will always be put to use in some capacity.",
  "You may be asking, how do I make a profit on something that has an expiration date on the shelves?  I have mastered a shelf life recipe (without using additives or preservatives)!  My secret is that I immediately store my product in air tight plastic containers and I sell them in display freezers at my big box retailers.  My cupcakes can last 30 days this way, and I have little to no waste.  I have proven this theory already by selling them at the Big Box Retailer I currently have a partnership with!  My customers have an understanding that the cupcakes will take a little while to thaw out, or if my local customers want cupcakes they can order them special from me as long as we have it booked in our calendar.\r\n\r\nPatience: \r\n\r\nI have big dreams as Amanda Cupcake and I want to see them all happen (just as you do as my backers).  To grow in a healthy direction, you won't see everything happen overnight.  We must move forward in mini cupcake steps, with intention on building a healthy brand. \u2665  I have already proven through gaining love all over Wisconsin that this is a brand that can grow and make a difference in the world!\r\n\r\n With every growth and change you see happen, you can know that you are a part of it, but I ask for your patience in building Amanda Cupcake.",

I will be able to put my MBA to work as I work on a business plan, options for marketing and expansion plans as well.",

  "A big risk for this residency and my entire trip is working on the road and not being able to finish artwork/murals in time due to lack of materials and the length of my residency. Because I have travelled while working in the past I feel more comfortable to take on this challenge.",
  "The risks and challenges include creating a space in a market that has large and small businesses competing for shelf space in retail outlets. I have a business degree from Stetson University with marketing experience and have researched the industry as well as competitors. I know that my product and business model are original, and that there is a market for these products.\r\n\r\nEveryone needs something to hold that reminds them of a special event. Original art printed on cards and accessories are things that can find a home in an office space or on a cubicle wall. The moments that inspire us to move forward or contemplate an important event includes something that informs our decisions. I will provide a beautiful or poignant representation that will remind or evoke to help take that next step.\r\n\r\nThe commercial space nearby is reasonably priced and on a busy thoroughfare. I am in the process of creating the pricing structure and website that will route traffic to the products. Further, I am looking for an agent to help market and sell the lines commercially to retailers in the region, and for future expansion. Inquire within.\r\n\r\nI have a created the business model and have applied for a fictitious name and tax ID, so moving into a studio and engaging a commercial printer are actions immediately ready for the next step. The growth opportunity in this business is exponential. Future plans include opening boutique franchises in other states.\r\n\r\nRewards will be available within three (3) months of goal attainment for shipment to contributors at the respective reward levels.",
  "I work full time at the moment so the biggest challenge is finding the time to complete this project. I have been realistic about how much I can do and how quickly. I am currently waiting for approval of my application for a stall at the local art market but I can fulfil these obligations even if it is turned down.",
  "As a skilled artist and teacher I feel that I am fully prepared to take on this project with both the artistic skill and outgoing \"people skills\" to draw people into the project and create a following in addition to working with park rangers, ecologists, tourists, and locals.  There are challenges to be faced in traveling alone and camping my way through the 2 - 40 day road trips, but I am well-equipped and knowledgeable in travel and outdoor activities to feel confident in this area. I am already knowledgable in social media networking and website building with two other successful websites and a strong following for each.  The area I will need the most training in is when I get to the publishing portion of the project.",

  "I'm still finishing photoshoots and interviews with the muses that are partaking in this project but I will be done in the coming months.",
  "Working with a volunteer cast and crew means that we don't have as much time to complete this proof of concept short film. Meaning there might be delays caused by the continued need for all involved to work at other jobs. Another risk is that the Kickstarter project does not reach its goal, leaving 100% of the funding to personal income.",
  "The Accidental Beauty of Rural America by Keith May\r\n\r\nA 2001 assignment to photograph the changing face of rural America led me down a rabbit hole of dirt roads and lost highways East to West on a roaring silver Harley. \u201cGo where the wind blows you and let pictures tell the story,\u201d became more than an Editor\u2019s vague direction and the quietly provocative scenes included in \u201cThe Accidental Beauty of Rural America,\u201d prove that the more things change, the more they stay the same. And the best assignments never end.\r\n\r\nThe Carrollton Center for the Arts in beautiful downtown Carrollton, Georgia has asked me to exhibit photos from this endless adventure in their beautiful Galleria in May of 2019 and my Kickstarter will fund the production of approximately 30 new prints to fill 130 feet of wall space that will tell the story and hopefully become a traveling exhibition.\r\n\r\nPrints will be unconventional.

  "The process right from the beginning has been a challenge.  Convincing the \"higher power that be' that a concept of combining a cafe with a motorsports rental business, is not only possible, but profitable, and a huge tourist draw for the local community, has been difficult.  Choosing a location we thought would work, and finding one that was zoned properly were two different things. Every time we took one step ahead, it felt like we took 3 steps backwards. There were times we felt crushed and that his business was not going to be able to move forward. But we persevered!\r\nFast forward to today and here we are; mid-construction! The challenges are not over, but we feel we are moving in a forward direction now! \r\nRunning a profitable restuarant is not easy, especially as a start-up business. Combining a touring and rental company adds another dynamic, that while providing another revenue stream also requires expertise and knowledgeable personnel in this area.\r\nBudget challenges and cash flows are our biggest concerns getting started.  Cora Lea's experience in restaurant management and accounting will prove invaluable as we move forward. She has been working for over the past year on restaurant and cafe comparables, break-even analysis, budgets and cash-flow projections to keep us on track.\r\nJordans experience with people and as an apprentice chef, his motorbike touring, and connections in the motorsports world are all valuable assets. If you've ever visited, you know he makes a mean cup of coffee, and is affectionately known as a \"coffee snob\" around here!\r\nWe know our limitations, and as such we have hired an amazing caf\u00e9 consultant who has helped from the onset and has been integral in layout and flow in the caf\u00e9.  Our construction team has provided amazing insight as well.  We have no fear in asking those who know more than us, to share their knowledge and expertise.\r\n\r\nWe want to keep resources as local as possible. Locally sourced, locally made food, ethical coffee, members of the community working in our caf\u00e9 and touring business.  \r\nOur full-grown kids are fast learning the ways of POS systems and customer service in their individual jobs, and are looking forward to helping us with in the caf\u00e9 as well.

  "This is an extremely ambitious project that we plan to achieve with a bare minimum budget, but what may or may not be apparent is how meticulously \"I'll Be Damned\" has been planned out.  If you support \"I'll Be Damned\", you will be supporting a project that will go above and beyond and (fingers crossed) deliver something extra special.\n\nBut even with years of development, obstacles still get in your way daily on set (even by the minute) but it's our job as filmmakers to think 5 steps ahead and eliminate the problem before they happen.  So many variables had to come together perfectly to achieve our opening scene.  Some of those difficulties included --\n\n1) Convincing an overseas vender to not only rent expensive samurai armor to us on our limited budget, but to also trust the production to take care of it while filming and to ship it back when we were finished (getting armor through customs was no picnic either!)\n\n2) The design, blueprint, 3D modeling and 3D fabrication of an essential prop\n\n3) Period costuming\n\n4) All of the above had to be sized to an out of state actor, through carefully detailed correspondences and photos (and a bit of luck!)\n\n5) Finding and locking down the only 2 locations in state that were not only crucial to pulling off a convincing 17th century Japan, but also being able to work for our story.\n\n6) Period authentic set dressing\n\n7) Combat and ritual training\n\u200b\n8) stunt choreography\n\n9) Hair extensions\n\n10) Dialogue translation (along with actors learning and pronouncing Japanese correctly)\n\n11) Visual effects prep for a smoother running post production\n\n12) Filing down the blade of a sword duplicate to the right measurements to achieve a special effect\n\nI could go on!  But the point is we set out to accomplish our goals and we conquered.  Along with the support from my team.  A team who are all passionate about this project, but equally as important, believe in me as a filmmaker and I desire to give them- and our audience- the best experience and final product possible.\n\nPersonally, I will treat \"I'll Be Damned\"as if its my one and only chance to make a feature; I'm going to pour my soul into it.",

  "There is a possibility that this disc will be a bit controversial. A common refrain among early recording buffs is the wistful sigh, \"You could never get away with playing like that nowadays.\" While the Brahms circle's playing style is no longer in living memory, the oldest of our teachers and colleagues remember being forbidden to take the artistic liberties necessary to play in it. The vivid yet nuanced inflections of timing (rubato) and pitch (portamento) that had a sincere, speechlike quality in the 19th century became associated in the 20th century with flippancy and egotism at best - at worst, with a brazen disrespect for the composer's work. We feel that the 21st century has no need for this prejudice, and that putting the old artistic freedoms back in circulation can give Brahms' music the freshness and vitality that it deserves. Whether we will \"get away with\" it remains to be seen.",

I am asking for the amount that I am asking for because I think it gives me a better chance to accomplish my objectives, more than just trying to make a call here, or do a document there, over the space of many years (which is what a LOT of people try to do).\r\n\r\nYes, this is my first screenplay, but it has been in the works for a long time, and I know the stories about people who have been rejected time and time again before they finally were able to sell and MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY when they finally found someone who believed.\r\n\r\nI am hoping that you BELIEVE!!\r\n\r\nBecause I am going to dig in and \r\nDO IT, \r\nDO IT RIGHT, \r\nand \r\nDO IT RIGHT NOW!\r\n\r\nThank you!!",
  "This fundraiser is \u201call or nothing\u201d - meaning that if I don\u2019t reach my goal of $2500 by the end of the campaign, I don\u2019t receive any of the pledged funds. So please consider donating - no matter how small.  And share with friends, family, and neighbors - everyone loves cake! Thank you x a million \u2764\ufe0f",
  "We recognize that there are many risks and challenges associated with starting a business at any time, let alone during a pandemic. \nSince our renovations rely on permits from the City of Hamilton, we have no control over the timeline of our project completion. Once approved, we have our contractors in place to begin working on the space as soon as possible.\nWe may also face delays sourcing materials and fixtures for the shop, and plan to allow several months of lead time.",
  "There are no real risks in this project for me or the KICKSTARTER community. \r\n\r\nThe challenges would be in making enough paintings to meet the demands but I do have a good start and plenty of material to work with ... thanks to Hurricane Matthew, of course.\r\n\r\nIn my line of business, I have some extra time during the next couple of months.",
  "There are no real challenges to delivering the promised rewards on time as I have already completed all paintings that I have promised as rewards.  I also do not anticipate any problems with completing the postcards and the calendar on time.",
  "Keine Risiken.",
  "The main challenge of this project is knowing what will be produced in the time frame I have set out.  With the holidays quickly approaching, the time frame is a bit more pinched, but this is when I thrive.  I have already reached out to various galleries and creative opportunities, as well as been approached to showcase my work at various vending shows. \r\nThis campaign will allow me to quickly get supplies to set up, the larger quantity of prints to offer, and be able to focus on what I am good at, making that art.",
  "It's a book. With words. Not much risk, so it's definitely worth backing if that's what you're interested in!!",
  "Playing the Music: This would normally be the hard part, but we've put together an A-list lineup including Synergy Vocals. Finding a day when all our first-choice players were free at the same time was a struggle, but we did it. We've played this piece together so many times that Steve says we play it better than he does.\r\n\r\nRecording the Music: We're working with Sound Intermedia, who do the sound for our live shows. They know exactly what they're in for.\r\n\r\nReleasing the Music: We're in discussion with a number of companies to distribute the recording, but we're also completely prepared to self-publish it if that's what's best.",
  "While I've released many records as a founding member of Eighth Blackbird, this is the first time I've done everything myself, and so there are some inherent risks in that. As I mentioned above, I'm navigating numerous costs including mixing, mastering, PR costs, photography, album art, and album production. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, I am firmly committed to bringing this project to life, I have the help of many amazing people and New Amsterdam, and am confident this recording will come out into the world.",
  "We are currently trying to reserve the venue, and If that place we found in Hollywood is taken, we have to find another suitable venue to hold my concert at.",
  "We're hoping to complete this campaign and raise our target during just the month of March, when we celebrate our fourth birthday.  This will mean a campaign period of only 15 days.  However, we will be working consistently during this time to attract pledges from around Australia.",
  "I hope to have the book ready by November 2015 but please understand that life is unpredictable and things change. it could be for the better and be released early though too :)",
  "The only risk that we have projected so far is outgrowing our current location and not having enough computers available . We have partnered with a local computer repair store that will donate 7 desktop computers and 3 tablets once we get the program up and operational.",
  "It will be very difficult for me to create the standard of exhibition expected without your help, the exhibition may end up with quite a retrospective element as I may not be able to afford to by enough canvases and boards to create the work and what work I do create I will need to be precious about. \r\nAlso the exhibition at Python Gallery may not have the greatest impact if I can not pay for a private view. I hope that this exhibition may be a stepping stone to bigger and better exhibitions and projects, and so I am really pushing to make it the best I possibly can.\r\nIf I do not achieve my goal with this funding the exhibition will not happen at Brick lane Gallery, as this is fee based. \r\nThank you again.",
  "Challenges are about getting the timings for the last few states right, and getting it produced in time for August, however, the risks are relatively low as I have most of the images already and could publish with what I have if needed.",
  "This is my third book and second to be published so I am aware of the risks involved. Artwork, editing and interior formatting are all included in the goal as well as fulfillment costs for backer rewards. If the project is fully funded I have no worry about hitting project milestones or fulfilling promises.\r\nThe first book in the series is doing well and I'm excited to publish the second book for fans of the first.\r\nThanks for considering being part of this project!",
  "The risk and challenges of the project is itself time and funding. I planned on self publishing this when the work was complete. But due to unfortunate circumstance I have found plenty of time to work on this project but funding it would not be possible. This mite change but if funded will fully commit to finishing the book on time.",
  "The Manuscript is done; I'm currently working on book 2 because I just couldn't wait any longer. All that really needs to be done is some professional edits, proper formatting.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve done my research and I already have an Editor I want to work with. But there\u2019s always a chance, by the time I have my project funded that they will not be available to work on my book due to how awesome they are at what they do. \r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s all right. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure there are plenty of other awesome editors I could work with. It\u2019s just a matter of choosing which one is the best fit. I\u2019m a man of my word, at least I try to be, so when I say I\u2019m going to do something I always follow through on my end.

  "Small, independent businesses are inherently risky, and we know that. Since our inception in 2017, we've taken each step of our growth journey with caution (and excitement). This big step--opening our parlor--is no different! But our community has been behind us each step of the way and supported us during all of our challenging times, reminding us exactly WHY we do what we do. We are bringing a proper ice cream parlor to the East End because we love making ice cream and seeing your smiles when we hand over your scoop, but even more than that, we want to support a community that has been so supportive of us.",

  "There is always a risk that people say \u201cnah, I love the fake, shallow environment of online dating sooooo much I plan on swiping forever\u201d and we fail to reach enough backers to meet our goal and deliver the wristbands. Aside from that, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re building a rocket propulsion system. We\u2019re confident in our ability to produce the wristbands and have taken all necessary measures to create a realistic timeline. As long as the dating app CEO\u2019s don\u2019t form a secret cartel and hire mercenaries to stomp-out the \u201cGreenlight Movement\u201d then the risk of complications in the project are pretty low. We have a manufacturer ready to ship, a warehouse ready to pick & pack and just need your help to build initial inventory.

  "I am confident the Angel Numbers Jewelry brand will be a success with minimal risk. The most prominent risk would be protecting the brand while simultaneously building it so the vision does not die on the vine! I'm having conversations with the best brand protectors and I predict success. The rewards are on schedule for a timely production and will be received by mid September.",
  "We understand that we risk being compared to other online clothing stores that sell apparel. We also understand that we have to take risks in order to become successful.

  "Like military missions and any big project, there are always potential problems and obstacles.  I will address possible roadblocks and their solutions: \r\n\r\nLate printers, editors, proofreaders or artists      \r\nSolution: Specific deadlines in contracts.  Frequent follow up.\r\nFirst draft of book is complete and has been proofed and edited by  another author, (Caroll Wolverton).  This is my 6th book authored and I have a reliable network of printers (lulu.com, LSI, Createspace), editors, proofreaders and artists. \r\n\r\n\r\nFulfillment slow at shipping out autographed copies world wide.  Solution: Hire an assistant.  Do it myself. Work weekends.\r\n  \r\nDelayed publishing.   \r\nSolution: Final draft is already completed.  Four different Print on Demand companies have been tried and tested from previous experiences and are ready to go. \r\n\r\nComputer break down\r\nSolution: I own a back up desktop and have access to several other computers.\r\n\r\nLack of funding\r\nSolution: Work, save, borrow, persist.",

The logistics and funds required to pull this off are daunting, but we feel it is an appropriate and reachable challenge for us in our tenth year\u2014a fitting tribute to our past decade, and a sign of our ambitions for the next ten. \r\n\r\nOur connections to our communities in Rochester and Lyndon are deep-rooted, and we have confidence in our combined management and performance abilities to create a memorable and rewarding experience for all who participate in the project, whether as performers, audience or community members.",

  "The greatest risks that I expect to encounter is a lack of grant support and exhibition scheduling. If grant support from fine arts organizations isn't obtainable, then I will have to look outward again for individual donations. At that point, I will have an exhibition plan and can provide an itemized budget to see it through. Exhibition scheduling varies from gallery to gallery. Some galleries are booked years in advance. For this reason, I may have to get creative about the space I used for early presentations of the work.  I am prepared to take it one step at a time and be flexible with the options available.",
  "No foreseen risks. And the only challenge would be reaching my funding goal. Producing tintypes is a time honored process. The only innovation I am introducing is a digital projector.",

If the album is picked up and sponsored by a label, we will re-appropriate those funds and put them towards more touring and community engagement.

  "This is a very low risk project, the product is already developed and selling, it's just a matter of scaling up a bit!",
  "I am the sole creator of this project so if I was incapacitated in some way, the project wouldn't get done.",
  "The risk involved would be not raising enough funds within the 30 day funding campaign to fulfill the obligation of associated start-up costs and reproduction of booklets.\r\n     The challenge would be in sending out enough notifications to friends, family and business community in order to reach the funding goal.",
  "There is always the possibility the book will take longer to complete than I anticipated, or I could become injured and not be able to complete it, but this is not likely. \r\n\r\nThere is also the miniscual chance I can not get it published by one of the major companies, but based on current reception this is extremely unlikely.",
  "All the writing is done. The only tricky points I anticipate will be if there is a delay in illustration or printing or shipping, to which I will say, I'll push things forward the best I can.",

  "re risks and challenges. BREAKING THE LIGHT is a challenge to the past history of traditional photography. Our goal is to make this new work known and branded in order for it to be widely exhibited in galleries and museums. See: www.harveylloyd.com. The risks are the difficulties in getting the new art accepted at any time, as happened with modern  painters around the turn of the las century. We must use our funding to brand the work for the art world to accept what is a challenge to the past. With half a century of adventure and journalistic photography around the entire world, I have overcome all challenges. Ivana Lovincic is a lovely, brilliant intuitive artist and photographer who lives in NYC, coined the title BREAKING THE LIGHT, and will make social and art world contacts to aid our branding for collectors, museums and galleries. The work is already at the leading edge of the new art of photography and we will succeed.",

  "Operating a small business, especially in the midst of a global pandemic has been challenging to say the least. \n\nMyself and the small businesses and creatives I work closely with have had to get extremely creative and work twice as hard to survive these last 9 months.\n\nThis project is about collaborating with businesses who deserve to thrive most: those often overlooked, those who face challenges such as racism, homo and transphobia, and other obstacles that stand in the way of our success as entrepreneurs and creatives.\n\nWith better tools and production for Dayum Jam and a space to share our wares with the community and work with other like us to do the same, we can ensure RVA (and beyond!) has access to amazing, creative, locally-made goods!",
  "With every project and every dream, comes obstacles and challenges. The key is perseverance. The time we are living now has added risks. If there is one thing we have learned is how much we need connection and being around family and friends. We would like to take some time to talk about those risks and how we plan to overcome them. \n\n1. COVID-19- is a huge threat to so many different businesses and we understand our situation will be no different. Caf\u00e9 TISTA has a unique opportunity to be set up for success during this global pandemic, as our grounds stretch over a 6-acre farm. Caf\u00e9 TISTA will be able to take the correct preventative COVID-19 protocols. These will help keep staff and customers safe. Caf\u00e9 TISTA will have plenty of outdoor sitting areas and appropriately distanced seating arrangements so that when our customers visit and spend time in our space they will be safe. \n\n2. Timeline: We are planning on opening doors in summer 2021. There are always unforeseen delays when renovating a space. But we are supported by a community of friends and family who will volunteer their time to assist us at every step so that we are ready for opening day. \n\n3. Marketing Risks: We want to make sure that people hear about Caf\u00e9 TISTA. Our dedicated TISTA team in Colombia and the United States will implement marketing strategies to promote our Caf\u00e9 TISTA brand and coffee shop. Our pre-launch sale and our Kickstarter campaign will help us to continue to spread the good word about this unique opportunity for connecting beyond borders, despite a pandemic, all the while enjoying our unique farm-to-cup experience. \n\nThank you for going the extra mile with us. We are so excited to connect with you and have you join our extended Caf\u00e9 TISTA community!",
  "This darn global pandemic has effected almost every aspect of life. Try starting a business with all the uncertainty and changing landscape. Everything takes longer, and normal processes are being reinvented daily. There is ample doubt and uncertainty that any new venture will succeed as small business around the US close their doors. This would deter the weak or faint of heart, but we're committed to press on and deliver all we promise. \n\nWhere many view change with doubt and fear, we at Model Citizen Coffee see opportunity to thrive and succeed. Yes, we are new to small business and the coffee game, but we're excited to engage in this challenge and join the other fearless ones.",
  "We have set an ambitious goal of making a very competitive bid on the dough sheeter on December 14th. Even with the best laid plans, sometimes the unexpected happens. Please bear with us in the event of any delays! Even if we don't get this dough sheeter, the money we raise will be put towards finding the best deal possible on a commercial sheeter! We love Springfield, and are so excited to expand our offerings to our community.",
  "Risks\r\n- Technical quality issues with printing of the book\r\n- Price Increase in book production\r\n- Not enough books to send out as rewards\r\n\r\nI would insure the above risks and challenges are avoided by printing out a single copy of the book from the chosen printing and publishing outlet before bulk producing the product in its entirety.",

  "I don't believe there will be any complications, I love to paint. It might be time consuming, but I have extra time I can spend on this project.\r\nI don't see any challenges coming up after the project is successfully funded, and I hope everything will go smoothly.\r\nThis is my first time creating a project on Kickstarter, and I'm excited to see how it goes.",
  "I hope this campaign has an enthusiastic reception and raises the funds to purchase both the screen printing exposure table AND the much more expensive etching press. But because Kickstarter is an all or nothing model, I've set a low minimum goal to meet at least the cost of the exposure table.\r\n\r\nI'm aware most dreams aren't realized as smoothly as we'd like. In the event Casa X\u00e1tiva doesn't benefit from your invaluable support, don't fear.

  "BevShots has been producing micro-photographs of popular beverages for several years based on the pioneering work of scientist Michael W. Davidson.  We have access to the laboratory and print-house capability to fulfill the project.  \r\n\r\nOnce funded, the most significant risk is that a particular drink might not be amenable to crystallization despite best efforts in the lab.  After all, it is an empirical process subject to the whims of nature.  Further, the chemical complexity of beer makes it relatively more difficult to crystallize properly.  That said, we have been successful with many custom shoots and are confident in the success of the project and that our backers will be pleased with the stunning new images of their favorite micro-brewed beers.",

  "There are no risks. The production of Falling Man (paired with Jeremy Beck\u2019s Blackwater) is scheduled to take place at Symphony Space in New York City on April 29, 2016. The Center for Contemporary Opera has already engaged performers and artisans to create the production.",
  "The only risks are production delays due to error in creation, shipping delays, or misprints. I've worked with this company before for many Kickstarters and I'm satisfied that I'll get frequent updates and a solid product. However there is no risk you won't get the pins you've chosen.\n\nAlso small delays in shipping may happen if we get a huge number of backers, as there are only 2 of us to work on this project.",
  "It's always important to remember that every project involving nature and its ecosystems comes with a multitude of risks and challenges.\n\nJust to remember that it takes the entire lifetime of 12 worker bees to produce a single teaspoon of BlackBee Honey.. Taking that further, to produce 0.5lb (227gr) of Black Bee honey it takes about 30,000 bees travelling 27,500 miles and visiting more than a million flowers just to gather the nectar required.\n\nThat is why any products or results are always a given gift when working with nature.. Every honey jar that we manage to fill is a precious prize to us.\n\nThe main risk involved, would be having a bad season and end up with low honey production... That wont allow us to sell much honey after fulfilled the rewards. This is basically the bigger risk we could face.\n\nAlso another little risk could be to receive a damaged parcel, even if its been carefully wrapped by us, that is why we firmly remind to all backers to write down \"accept with reserve\" on the receipt or tick the relevant box \"with reserve\" when signing.\nOnly like this we can claim against the Courier and try refund any damage that may occurs.\n\nOur big challenge is meet the target and get enough fund to keep on producing our honey and perhaps be able to grow in number our hives.\n\nWe'd like to specify once more time that, when working with bees and with nature in general, there are no real certity of the outcome, and with this pandemic still spreading and devastating, the results of this season's honey production will be even more uncertain. Have said that, we are very confident on a good outcome, but it's always better to prepare for the worst while hope for the best!\n\nThank you.",
  "For the purpose of the Kickstarter campaign I am offering some fine art prints from the development phase of this body of work as a reward to fund the ongoing work with an expected conclusion date of the summer of 2016. Once it is photographed and produced it will be presented to galleries along the West Coast at first, to gain some wider art market exposure with the project and forward my life long career as a photographer. \r\n\r\nSince it will be a time consuming effort to shoot and print the ongoing project, I find it better to offer you some existing fine art print work for your support. Please leave an email if you wish to sign on to the email newsletter/dairy of the ongoing art project and to preview new work as it is in progress. Please make a note of heinzdanzberger.com and the blog will offer you insights in the project as it progress.\r\n\r\nHopefully this offer will take any risk out of the fulfillment for any of your commitments and help to increase the projects appeal to backers and supporters.",
  "Our hope is that we have too many backers and that it may take us a bit longer to fulfill the reward orders.  In all seriousness, this is our first try at crowd funding, but we feel that there is a need in our area for a community darkroom, and with support we will be open for a long time.",

  "We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll overcome any challenge we face, and we\u2019ve already experienced our share of downfalls \u2013 everything from faulty equipment, having to reshoot, or rethinking the overall concept of a photograph; we\u2019ve met every glitch head-on. We also realized that every time something didn\u2019t work out quite the way we expected it to, we took a moment to rethink and recalibrate our ideas to combat the challenges in a way that produced a stronger image and a better result. It\u2019s all about adjusting to the process. In Peru, flexibility is key.\r\n\r\nHaving spent so much time in Lima working on the project already, we know what to expect and what we need to plan ahead before we travel. The availability of certain artist\u2019s materials and some types of photography equipment can be difficult to access in Lima, so we\u2019re partnered with some amazing colleagues and fellow artists here in the U.S. who have let us borrow what we needed ahead of time, providing us the opportunity to bring more things with us. And, if all else fails, FedEx is God!",
  "Every donation helps, as I had mentioned.  While I plan on using the donations for equipment such as lenses, flashes, various camera accessories, etc, your donation helps.  Photographic equipment, such as lenses can be costly.  I plan on using the funds to put towards the equipment, and if I am fortunate enough, purchase equipment with no additional costs besides donations.  \r\n\r\nI will use the donations for my photography journey, and nothing else.",

  "Our goal with this project is to collect 5000 SEK that will help us do the journey. That is about half of the cost for the travel. The rest will be funded by our own private money - as we are pasionated to do this.\r\nIf this project raise more money - we are only grateful.",
  "Other than band member/engineer illness or travel difficulties, we do not foresee any risks involved with this project. Should any of these come to fruition we would move the recording session to early June and still make the delivery deadlines.",
  "You will have to be patient. It may take a few weeks to ship your rewards.",
  "Building a community-run business will be hard, but we can overcome our challenges and it will bring us together. We've already made and canned one batch of our salsa so we know that we can do this.",
  "The risks and challenges we need to overcome include purchasing some much needed equipment, electrical work, and freezers that ranged outside of our initial planned budget.\n\nWe are still in the licensing process with our fabulous city so the only possible hold up would be waiting for the finalization of that licensing in which case we would just move back some of the rewards by a month or two but no later than 2020.  \n\nWe are asking for the bare bones needed amount but any donations past our goal will only help us more with getting our wish list of items as well.",
  "This is a brand new initiative and - as far as we know - has never been been attempted in this way before. \r\n\r\nOne risk we're taking in particular is that we're challenging the very idea of what a classical concert can be and this could alienate as many as it draws. Still, we feel this is a risk worth taking.\r\n\r\nFinally, while many of us have produced, directed or played in an orchestra before, it's our first time Kickstarting and doing something so unorthodox. It's an exciting and scary place to be in at the same time.",
  "The only risk involved may be the occasional trespassing fine and the only challenge will be deciding which city I should explore and document next.",
  "This is a risky project as I don't like to \"ruffle feathers\" it's a hot button subject and I am afraid people will view me in a bad light or do things to make my life more challenging if they don't like my art.  I am also not sure I will find a venue for the art as I have in the past  simply because of the nature of the subject matter.  However I think I can overcome this as well perhaps a gun club or perhaps a show online?  I will have to work out this detail.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of painting the subject to communicate the need for awareness on this subject is of course a challenge as I hope to communicate well so the viewer needs no further explanation then the images.  What images must I create? \r\n\r\n I have been painting for over twenty years; I have shown my art in local arts and crafts shows. I believe I can do this.\r\n\r\nAfter I have created the images and had a show I will distribute the rewards.",
  "The shipping is out my control; however I have not had any major risks as such. I will track the orders till it reaches the rite hands.",
  "Of course, there is the challenge/risk of \"How many copies will I sell?\" As I say in my video about my dream, my Pastor once said, \"If you have a dream that you can accomplish on your own, that dream is not of God.\" God has told me to aim to sell a certain amount of books in a certain time period. It requires a lot of faith. I am believing it WILL happen.\r\n\r\nThe other challenge is dealing with the returned edited manuscript. But that's just perseverance! I wrote 15K words in a single day to finish book one! I can handle pushing through to the end to finish something.\r\n\r\nThe last challenge is finding the right person to pay for illustrations/a cover. I have a last resort through Create Space, but I would rather pay a friend to do it and put their name as the illustrator on my book to advertise their skill as well.",
  "With the majority of this new book already written the risks and challenges are quite minimal.\r\n\r\nA professional editor (www.indiegopublishing.com) has already been selected to edit the book and a professional illustrator (www.danlambertart.com) has been commissioned to create the cover artwork.  Once the project is fully funded the book will be sent to the editor and I expect to publish it some time in November 2014.  That means that the books should be out and in the hands of backers before Christmas.\r\n\r\nWith the experience of five previously self-published novels successfully under my belt I can confidently say that I don't expect there to be any problems or major delays, but of course I will keep everyone up-to-date should anything unexpected occur.",
  "There are abundant risks with any startup company bringing a product to market. Thankfully, we have already gone through a good portion of them. We completed a market test over the last 4 months, selling online on quevos.com and in ten stores around Chicago. The reception Quevos received was fantastic, which is why we are scaling up our manufacturing facility and launching in earnest now. We need your help fronting the costs of a large production run we want to do in May.  If all goes according to plan and we hit our goal in this Kickstarter, we will ship out your rewards in June!\n\nSince we need to buy new packaging equipment and that has a lead time between 3-6 weeks, there could be delays which cause our shipments to arrive at your door in July. But rest assured, if we hit our funding goal we'll go straight into squaring everything away for production and then start manufacturing bags of Quevos by the thousands!",
  "The most essential work is done.  I have 60 minutes worth of first-rate, polished audio.  So we're starting from excellent material.\r\n\r\nDelays sometimes happen in the process of creating a recording.  Even the strongest performances may present difficulties when you try to translate them to a variety of audio formats that will be played on an even wider variety of listening devices.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this is the sixth album that I've been involved in producing.  (It is my first full-length solo album, though!)  I know the potential pitfalls.  This time, I've tried to sidestep them by attending carefully to every step of the process.  I'm also working with seasoned professionals who are way more experienced than I am.\r\n\r\nSo delays may occur, but the final product will be excellent!",
  "Yes, Every Project has it's obstacles, but we also have a Motto: Never Quit, Never Give Up....

  "While programming and performing this sort of concert is a familiar activity (after 50 years, I hope we've learned a thing or two about it!), we've never before attempted to self-present an orchestra concert in New York. There are a host of challenges associated with this, ranging from making sure there are enough stands and chairs onstage to getting enough busy New Yorkers to commit to taking the time from their busy schedules to actually fill the house.\r\n\r\nWe have an excellent team ready to take on these challenges, however, who combine years of experience with presenting and publicizing classical concerts in New York, so we're confident that we can meet the production challenges. And, of course, if you buy tickets pre-sale through this campaign, you're already helping us guarantee a good house, and we're confident that if we can raise the money, 50 years of experience will be put to good use in creating a successful concert.",
  "We managed to mitigate almost all the risks by testing the products before shipping.\nThe Taps have been tested and are in production.",
  "Like other crowdfunding projects, there are some inherent risks that can occur. However, we have prepared carefully and we are confident that our reliable suppliers and manufacturer can help minimize unforeseen problems in the production process.\nOf course, with any new product, there are going to be surprises along the way. One of the beauties of Kickstarter is that we\u2019re inviting you into the process with us, so you\u2019ll get to see how it all works. We\u2019ll be posting lots of updates during the final phases of development and manufacturing and we\u2019re excited to share the journey with you. Thank you for your support and understanding.",

All due diligence will be taken to plan for the foreseeable future and I will have alternate sleeping arrangements as well as equipment to forge ahead in any weather condition. Publishing a book can also be a difficult process, but I have a team of knowledgable people to help me with design and logistics.",
  "Our biggest challenge will be timing. We want to make this Comedy and tell this story as soon as we possibly can, but there may be production delays along the way because of casting and filming permits. \n\n\n\nThis will in turn delay the expected delivery for rewards associated with the film itself. If this does happen, we will be sure to update our backers and be completely transparent. \n\n\nThat all said, based on years of experience with film, television, and documentary production, we are confident we will overcome any obstacles we face.\n\nOur intention is that this film would coincide with the upcoming pilot season 2023.",
  "There are risks to any challenge that you undertake in life.  One of the those that we face in today's climate includes the weather - specifically, floods, whether our location is in Brisbane or in Maryborough.\nAnother big challenge that we face is that most of us are students - we are still learning and mistakes happen while learning, and although we will plan for as many contingencies as possible, we can only do our best.",
  "Como buenos Productores, tenemos el tiempo sobre nosotros, menos cabello y m\u00e1s ojeras.\nEn este hermoso camino vamos a tener posibles desaf\u00edos y retos que sabemos lidiar, c\u00f3mo; que en \u00faltimo minuto nuestros actores nos cambien por un comercial del gobierno, que el equipo de Sonido Directo decida dedicarse a otra cosa o que nuestra comida del rodaje se convierta en Sopa Maruchan. \nTodo esto lo podemos sacar adelante, solo te necesitamos a ti para apoyarnos y darte el riesgo de disfrutar la serie y no moverte de tu asiento",

  "We constantly learn from our previous projects and will always design a Plan B to deal with unexpected changes or situations. However, we understand that there are some circumstances that may be out of our control, such as international issues, pandemics, natural disasters, and so on. We promise that we will communicate with our backers to solve the issues at our most if we encounter such unexpected incidents.\n\nShipment: The estimated delivery time varies from region and cities, especially when rural regions are included. Different national customs regulations may also impact shipping. We will make all of what we can do to seek and select safe and fast logistics lines, but please kindly understand that we have little control over the customs clearance and shipping when the parcel is held by the courier companies. Delay may also happen when the customs officials/couriers couldn't manage to reach out to the recipients.\n\nTax or handling fees: WG will not collect taxes or extra fees from our supporters. We will take precautions in ensuring the shipping items meet the targeted local policies, but the backer is responsible for any duties, handling fees, and/or VAT/GST/Sales tax. As the regulations vary from country to country, we advise customers to reach out to their local customs office for information about the duties and fees to be expected.",

  "Writing a show like \"Grey Area\" can be tricky. With the content we are tackling there is a very fine line between funny and offensive, we are trying to approach every episode with care because even though our show is a comedy we are often talking about very serious subjects. \nOur goal is to address issues that may come up in your thoughts or conversations daily, but you're too nervous to talk about to your friends and family. Our goal is to make Grey Area a safe space to unpack those hard questions, hopefully whilst making you laugh!",

Another challenge is filling all 200 openings. This is the crucial start to a mission that I feel will be a major success. A mission that is immediately scaleable.",
  "I think the biggest challenge is what every one has to face.  Make a recipe for a single serve, have it taste  good and pair it with other items so it is healthy and reasonably priced.",
  "We feel that this is an important project that contributes to the joy people can experience in this extended moment of ... joylessness. Our biggest risk is that we do not receive the funding that we understand as necessary to compensate ourselves for the time spent on this project. That being said, we have had an amazing time together, and our contingency plan is to get these postcards to the people who want them by any means necessary. \n\nShould the kickstarter not be fully funded, our timeline for our larger rewards, the prints, recipe boxes, and custom YCCLA postcards cannot be fulfilled within a close timeframe.",
  "The main risks and challenges are getting the books to print and distributed.  Both books are written, edited, and ready to publish, so that there are minimal risks involved.  I have done careful analysis of costs, and I am confident that the budget will provide for ISBN numbers, publication, e-book submission, and shipping.",

  "My book is more of an educational story which encourages young children to take their Asthma medication, I know this book is not for everyone and my first priority is to get this book out to pediatric clinics and hopefully the American Lung association. With Asthma on the rise I believe my book will provide a fun way for parents to communicate with their children about using their medication. This book would be great in the classroom for understanding inhalers used by someone in their class.",
  "Since this is a digital project, which therefore will not need printing or distribution, and since I am the only artist involved, I don't need a big budget and I can guarantee that every step of the realization is already organized and follows all its course as planned.

  "Logistics & Budgeting:\nEach spice blend recipe requires its own testing and photography, and then another round for the dish that uses the spice blend. The funding structure is a projected estimate to produce a 6\u201d X 9\u201d color soft-bound cookbook. The skinniest version of this book will likely be 0.75\u201d thick and weigh about 1 lb.\n\nI do all my own writing, food photography, graphic design, and indexing, while my husband edits and converts each book into an eBook in exchange for the picture-plate dishes. If delegated to a third-party entity like a book-designer, eBook producer etc, each would cost the project several thousand dollars. For instance, a indexing a single cookbook costs on average $4000+ (after doing it all for six cookbooks, I am not looking to outsource anything). \n\nBy doing it all in-house, I pass on the savings to you, the backer.\n\nBut I can\u2019t do everything. As a small business myself, I am a big proponent of supporting small businesses, and rely on a long-time local vendor to print the book. They have worked with me on all previous books and respect my expectations.\n\nI also use the local USPS postal services for shipping. USPS has further increased prices for 2022, and even a Priority Mail envelope, domestic, will now cost more.\n\nBesides USPS, our printer has also mentioned higher printing costs since early 2021. In general, costs have increased across the board. I can only use my best guess to determine how much this project will cost. \n\nLimitations:\nThis is my 8th Kickstarter campaign. Of prior campaigns, only two were relaunched for the same project (same project, smaller product, trim funding goals). Eventually, all projects were successful. To the best of my knowledge, 99.9% of the backers were happy.\n\nIf we meet or exceed our campaign goal, Masaleydaar would be my SEVENTH cookbook produced entirely through crowdfunding. I am familiar with the pieces of it: the good and bad of a crowdfunding campaign. While 95% of my crowdfunding and production experience has been positive and without hiccups, I know to leave a margin of 5% for unplanned events.  \n\nThings you should know:\nGeneralized Delay: \nWhile I have written, photographed, designed, and shipped cookbooks in as little as 8 months (Crack the Code), as the only person who does the bulk of the work, it is hard on the production quality and is not feasible overall. Additionally, the pandemic has made most schedules moot. I can only project a timeline and do my best to adhere to it. \n\nMissed Communications: \nPlease use a personal email on your Kickstarter account because work-based email addresses are not reliable in the long term. Please adjust your messaging settings (I cannot do it for your account) if you wish to receive fewer project updates. Long-time backers know that I use the project updates to routinely communicate with campaign backers. Some may be pledge-level-specific, others may be public or for all campaign backers. Project updates are typically once a month after the project is funded, and once every two weeks when the book is nearing completion and about to be shipped/e-delivered.\n\nDigital Rewards: \nDue to copyright restrictions, I am unable to provide pdf\u2019s of the book to any backer at any time. Only two versions of eBooks are available \u2013 iBook (Apple devices) and GooglePlay (Android devices). GooglePlay books REQUIRE a _____@gmail.com address. Please update your profile while pledging. Also, please confirm your device compatibility and regional permissions compatibility before pledging. Kindle books are not available. eBooks are not available to backers in China. Project updates will provide a timeline for a one-time use, digital redemption, with an expiry date.  Digital rewards once distributed will not be re-assigned. \n\nDomestic Shipping: \nAs I only ship using USPS through Priority Mail, the tracking numbers are provided if the books are not received within 2 weeks of the shipping-specific project update. \n\nInternational Shipping: \nWhile I cannot offer guarantees on international delivery times as the tracking is not applicable after it leaves US soil, I send out the Customs\u2019 Slip to international backers so that they too can keep a lookout for it. Across six campaigns and 30+ countries, the postal service has lost two books, one was never delivered in China, and another because the Australian backer moved and missed giving a forwarding address.\n\nAdd-ons: \nSpice-kits (advents, samplers) are only available to backers in the domestic USA. Due to customs restrictions these are not available to international backers. My apologies \u2013 I wish I had a better solution to this.\n\nThird-Party Service: \nFor what it is worth, I do not, and have never used a third-party service to fulfill rewards. I don't intend to do that for this campaign either. While third-party services would free up my time, it would also require me to inflate the funding goals over and above budgeting for Kickstarter and shipping. A third-party service also makes room for errors. As there isn\u2019t a production facility or a staff that will handle all the pieces, I hope backers extend their patience during production and later during fulfillment. \n\nSolicitation: \nPlease do not contact me to offer services. In the past I have reported the individual or company that solicits.\n\nI hope that backers recognize that overall success requires a fair measure of being pragmatic and respectful about roles and expectations. \n\nPlease reach out for any clarifications.",
  "The risk is taking too long making the book (especially with the still ongoing pandemic) and my challenge will be to have it ready and published by May or June.\n\nEl riesgo ser\u00e1 tardar mucho haciendo el libro (especialmente con la pandemia) y el desaf\u00edo ser\u00e1 tenerlo listo y publicado para Junio.",
  "We've already shouldered most of the risk: the writing, photos, illustrations and design are all complete, and we've already consulted with the printers and received a prototype copy of the book. It looks really great! All the recipes have been tried, tasted and given an enthusiastic thumbs up. \n\nAll that remains is a final review and the actual print job. We're working with one of Europe's top printers to ensure a truly professional result. \n\nWith the current crisis, the availability and pricing of the quality and environmentally-friendly paper we want to use may cause a minor delay, but we'll do our best to get this beautiful book in your hands as soon as possible and keep you posted of its progress.",
  "With any project, comes the risk that it might fail. I already have a bank of delicious recipes to fill this book, and over the coming months I'll be testing and tweaking them all to perfection.\n\nThe challenge won't be in the cooking or the writing, but in the actual putting together of this book. That's why I'm here asking for your pledges, to pay for professionals to oversee the design of the book.\n\nIf this Kickstarter fails, I'm still committed to producing this recipe book, but it may take a much longer time to fund the project myself and deliver it to the public.",

If you're forcing me to mail this kicking and screaming, it still won't be long after. \n\nYou're not buying a thing on Kickstarter, you're supporting an idea.

  "Covid-19: Though the case numbers for Covid have been brought down significantly in Ontario; we still have to stay on our toes in case there is a last minute change in Government safety guidelines. Until then, we will follow the safety procedures as put in place at Sheridan College as well as the Ontario Government in order to ensure safety and security on-set. \n\nVisual Effects: Given the high-concept nature of this film, it of course, requires a great deal of special effects. We have literal months to spend time realizing the exact image designed for our film, but we are planning on pushing what we have learnt up until this point to create elements that will blow audience members away. \n\nWeather: The story takes place 20 years ago on January 1st. Winter 20 years ago looks a lot different from what Winter looks like now in Ontario unfortunately. We have back-up plans to ensure that we can have a snowy look to our exterior shots, but there is always the possibility that nature will not be on our side. \n\nDog Handling: Though the story is about finding dogs, we have kept their screen-time to a minimum to ensure a healthy work environment for our non-human co-stars. We will have to work hard to get exactly what we want, but we have planned to make sure that what we need is not too demanding from our furry friends.",
  "The challenges we might find with this production will be honestly location related. We have the most idea spot in mind but it does come at a price- a very costly price for us and we truly hope through your support and help that we will  be able to accomplish that goal. \n\nThe second challenge will be covid related. I personally want for the safety of my crew and cast the very best care in terms of covid care. So cleaning products do not come cheap.",

However preliminary inspections support the conclusion that the scan will work.  \r\n\r\nOnce complete the scans and video link will be provided to the backers.

Although we have tried our best to think about and plan for any production that might arise there is always the potential for unforeseen circumstances or for Covid-related issues to hold things up. All that being said, we are fairly confident in our ability to fulfill large orders on time. \n\nTo ensure our timelines is as accurate as possible we are in communication with everyone involved with every step of the jump rope production, that way any issues can be resolved quickly and directly.",
  "we have done everything we can to eliminate all the risks. That is why we have already produced a working prototype that we have been testing the last 8 months.  Working in a time of covid things can sometime be unpredictable. Especially working with factories in other contries and doing shipping. We have tried to find the best and most reliable partners to minimice these challenges.The estimated shipping time starts in September and we will make sure the sequence of shipping will be followed by backer numbers.",

  "Every project has its risks but our funky alien friends are going to do their part to help minimize that, like actually checking the rear-view mirror this time. One of the major possible hurdles is publication delay, especially with the ongoing pandemic. We will do our best to keep our backers up-to-date with our social media and with backer updates. If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to reach us through Kickstarter, email, or social media. Also, want to mention that all our designs here are subject to change and are not final.

  "The smoothness of the light at all angle: difficult to produce them smoothly. Huge challenge on tooling quality and LED Light positioning in the interior.\n\nSpeaker quality: enough space for air to bounce when the speaker vibrate; balance between light spacing and speaker spacing to create the optimum experience for both context in combination.\n\nCarabiner hook: product needs to be light enough to be hanged on the top of your tents, yet still strong enough to hold it still when you want to blast some nice tunes.",
  "We've been developing the SB01 over the last two years through six major prototypes, with a commitment to quality and reliability. With the design and prototyping stages completed, the summer was spent honing production and we are finally ready to begin pre-orders and manufacturing.\n\nThe SB01 is an instrument with a number of custom components, and we have outlined a typical production schedule that allows for any minor challenges that may occur. We are confident our synthesizer can be manufactured to the highest standards and begin shipping to our backers early next Summer.",
  "All our previous projects which were funded were all delivered on time.\n\nFor this project , the final production prototype has been completed and only software improvements are remaining.  We will continue to improve the software as upgrades even after the rewards has been shipped.\n\nPossible risks of delay:\n- Unexpected manufacturing problems during initial production for the 3D case but it have rarely happened. We will ensure that they are found as early as possible to minimize delays",
  "We have meticulously planned out production, manufacturing, and fulfillment. We have sourced materials, identified a manufacturer, and confirmed pricing. The only item that remains is funding.\n\nThere is a possibility that the final product differs slightly from the prototypes and first batch pictures shown in the campaign, but we promise to implement minor changes only if it makes Console Sling objectively better!",
  "The biggest challenge for us has been funding. We've researched the manufacturing processes available as applicable and practical to this product and are confident that the injection molding process will provide the quality, accuracy, and volume necessary for success.  The upfront cost to create the mold is $35,000, but once the mold is made it can produce upwards of 500,000 units before it will need to be replaced.",
  "Risks include retaliation from certain types police officers.",
  "Finding a reasonable printer would be a risk but I have done my research",
  "Compared to our previous Kickstarter projects, this project is the least risky and least challenging (although we are often challenged by being a small staff). We at KVML have put on incredible programs that benefit our attendees, and we know what we are doing when it comes to what our audience wants. We know this because we ask our audience... at the end of programs and in occasional member surveys... we ask you what you like and don't like, and we incorporate your recommendations into our future programs.\n\nKVML has enlisted some of the best and brightest minds locally and nationally to help us put together an incredible year of programming that can be accessed virtually. In some cases, we have worked with these community partners before, and we know what to expect. In other cases, partners are brand new, and we will learn how each other operates. We know that being a good partner means showing common decency.\n\nThere really is no risk to supporting this wonderful year of programming because KVML has already done a great job of planning our programs and putting time into the logistics required to make each event great. We want to touch as many lives as possible with The Good Earth: Vonnegut and the Environment so that many people will learn about caring for our good earth.",
  "All comic content for Love Not Found volume 2 is already completed! The printer has already been lined up and we have worked with them in the past, so we are confident that we will receive good work in return. I have successfully run eight Kickstarter projects, all of which have fulfilled. Two of the book projects were large anthologies that required organizing 20+ creators each. \n\nI always keep my Kickstarter backers up to date on how the project is going, opting for full transparency. If there is anything that will delay the book getting to your hands I will definitely let you know and have the experience to deal with it quickly.",
  "The biggest risk has been done! That was: will we be able to make the book?! And we did! The biggest challenge now is to get enough money together for making a beautiful high quality print. We know the recipes are delicious and correct. We know the pictures are great. The biggest work now is to fine tune the print. This is our first time printing a book, but we are collaborating with a professional book print company to make it as professional and good quality as we can.

  "\"Wait, weren\u2019t you involved with the KickStarter for NeverEnding? Where\u2019s the rewards for THAT campaign?!\"\n\nYes, I\u2019m still involved with NeverEnding. And yes, we\u2019re still fulfilling rewards for that campaign. But that\u2019s separate from THIS campaign, which is being run under my own company, Fantasyville Productions, LLC. NeverEnding is a separate company, who has a team of artists whom I\u2019m leading to fulfill rewards. Those rewards will get fulfilled as quickly as possible.\n\nWith that said, I feel that the rewards for this campaign are distinct enough from NeverEnding\u2019s offerings. I\u2019m comfortable asking you to get The Legend of Jamie Roberts, volume 1 to print because of that.\n\nAlso, since this specific campaign is narrower in scope, the rewards can get fulfilled faster. As I\u2019ve mentioned above, I\u2019ve run successful campaigns for the last 8 years on this platform, and all of those previous projects have been fulfilled.\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s an option to back this campaign and donate copies of this book to my local library. How are you going to make that happen?\"\n\nI\u2019ll admit - this is the first time I\u2019ve made this an option in a campaign. That said, the information I\u2019ll need from you (if you choose this reward option) is the name, address, and/or website of your library. If you have the contact information of the folks who work at your library, that would be even better. If you know who\u2019s in charge of acquiring new books at your library, that\u2019s *chef\u2019s kiss*.\n\nSo why am I charging for copies donated to the library? Because printing is expensive. All I\u2019m asking at this reward level is to offset the cost of printing and shipping these books.\n\n\n\n\u201cOk but WHY is the reward donating two copies of a book? Can\u2019t I just give one?\u201d\n\nSpeaking as a former librarian, libraries would REALLY rather have duplicates, because books can get lost, damaged, stolen, or otherwise unreturned. If a library only has one copy of a book? That sucks. But multiple copies? Yes, please.\n\n\n\n\"But Covid-19 is affecting the post office and the delivery of packages in general. \"\n\nI know.

Another risk is that the manufacturer may be delayed for any number of reasons, as we are still going through a pandemic at this time. This is all a learning process for me, as I am new at selling a product; but I poured many hours into researching how to do so. I hope it all goes smoothly, but these are the risks associated with this project. As a point of reference, I would need 50 backers of the single plush in order to fund the project. If I wanted to fund Kazuya without going out of pocket, I would need around 100 backers.",
  "Making an album can be a slow moving and expensive task.  I began recording this album in May and have been back several times to Mighty Fine Studios in Denver, Colorado. The challenge of finding studio time, working with schedules of musicians and engineers has made this projects timeline expand beyond what I had originally planned.  The plus side of this is I have had time to really workshop the songs and be sure that they are presented in the best and most clear way. But, as studio time extends, expenses extend. Fortunately I have already had plenty of experience in creating, promoting and delivering a quality album, having co-written, produced and promoted every album \"The Burroughs\" have released.

All that's left now is to raise some funds and move ahead with the manufacturing and distribution.\r\n\r\nIf this Kickstarter is successful, we hope to put in our order and begin manufacturing as soon as possible.  Hopefully this means our expected shipping date of June 2019 is ample time to meet the deadline.",
  "\u203bWe do not accept returns or refunds.\n\u203bThere is a chance the design and specifications of the product may change while under development.\n\u203bIf the number of backers exceeds more than expected, the shipping time may be delayed due to the manufacturing process.\n\u203bIn the chance we get more support than expected and the mass production system goes as planned, the sales price might be lowered.\n\u203bSince natural materials are used to make this product, the appearance of the wood grain is different in each piece. Please note that it may slightly differ from the photo.\n\u203bSince this is a crowdfunding product, we ask for your understanding in regards to the information and precautions above before supporting us.

  "- Let's get rid of our skeletons in the closet! - \n\nWe want to achieve maximum precision and quality on the details to make the skeleton \"OSSEUS\" realistic and with perfect posability, with the outmost attention to detail!  \n\nAs with all Kickstarter campaigns, any unplanned issues will be promptly addressed and resolved. \n\nFattel learning curve in design and production has been long and steep, but allowed us to gaing years of experience in this field so we are confident and ready for this new and exciting project. \n\nWe will do our best to reduce production time of the parts/bones, our production is completely from scratch therefore the process may be subject to changes due to unexpected injection molding factory related issues.\n\nThe individual skeleton pieces in ABS-PVC, and other steel structural parts will be produced in China, then assembled in Italy by hand.\n\nNext step is hand painting.  \n\nEventually they are checked one by one and then shipped worldwide.  \n\nWe want to make the production process as transparent as possible and keep you regularly informed on all the steps taken once the production has started, by providing  monthly updates and of course answering your questions.  \n\nOur challenge is to activate a new production line allowing us to distribute our product worldwide while also reducing costs for our customers.  \n\nIf the campaign should exceeds our expectations, we will have the opportunity to undertake our future projects.  \n\n- Female skeleton  \n\n- Horse skeleton  \n\n- Custom dioramas  \n\n- Custom vehicles  \n\n- Creation of custom skeletons related to of movies / comics and video games.  \n\n- Create a comic book about the epic skeleton wars.  \n\nIt all depends on your support for our project, and bond us all by the passion for functional and collectible action figures!",
  "Is there any chance I won\u2019t get my planner in a timely manner?\nNot at all! We signed the agreement with a TOP printer who is ready to print a notebook as soon as the campaign will be finished. The production will take 10-14 days. The terms of delivery depend on how far you are located from Ukraine. We will use the service of UKRPOSHTA to deliver the notebook as much as possible.\n\nHow will you know my shipping information and the quantity Notebook to order?\nOnce the campaign is over, we'll send you a survey so that you can give us your shipping information and amount of Notebook in order (if we reach our stretch goal sum).",

  "The biggest risk of completing our project is failure to secure enough funding. I am starting with a budget that is lower than I would like to secure to make this project all that it can be, but have insured that it is enough to keep us going through January 1, 2015. A lack of funding will have disadvantages and will limit the travel portion of our project and related site visits. However, if we meet our initial goal it will be an amazing experience that is sure to spread Christmas Magic and urge others to do the same with small acts of kindness and little challenges that our blog will share. I have freed up my calendar and I am committed to give this project my full attention.",
  "This Kickstarter Campaign is 30 days and an all-or-nothing platform.

  "As a start-up, we are fully aware of the risks we are facing and have taken pro-active steps to manage and reduce them. Having identified our own strengths and weaknesses, we have teamed up with best-in-class partners wherever we can, in order to have access to appropriate expertise wherever we need it.\r\n\r\nWe have identified the below as our main risk factors, and taken the following steps to eliminate and reduce risk where we can:\r\n\r\nProduction\r\n\r\nThe main concept of our speaker is to deliver superior quality at an unbeatable price. We have chosen to outsource production to a Chinese factory with a long and strong track record of delivering speakers to European markets. The factory was chosen after careful vetting, and we are confident we have made the right selection. Our research revealed that this factory has delivered with error margins down as low as 0,3% (i.e. 3 of 1,000 speakers returned after sales due to errors (this is very good in electronics, where retailers usually accept up to 2%). \r\n\r\nWe intend to keep personnel regularly at the factory once production is up and running to monitor the process and ensure our quality requirements are strictly followed. Sodapop intends to start of production in small batches to ensure we are able to monitor and adjust the production to any unforeseen issues. \r\n\r\nFor larger quantities, we run typical supply chain risk. We've done mass production before and we have existing relationship with the manufacturer, who has years of experience with large volumes and has well established connections with subcontractors for the parts needed in this product. Our factory partner can deliver well in excess of 4 million speakers per year and hence factory capacity is unlikely to become an issue in the near future.\r\n\r\nConcept quality\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure maximum sound performance, we partnered with an experienced acoustician and an industrial design studio to optimize the design and structure of the speaker. Throughout the process, we have tested the prototypes in a professional sound studio. \r\n\r\nFinancing \r\n\r\nRevolving credit facility for orders up to 10,000 units is already in place. If the product proves to be a big success the credit facility would have to be re-negotiated, but we believe the credit facility we already have negotiated, should be sufficient to handle the demand. The company also has the option of having orders shipped by air freight, reducing the time the drawn credit is used and hence can increase the rotation of the credit to handle an increased number of orders.\r\n\r\nLogistics \r\n\r\nTo ensure that the distribution of our speakers will go as smoothly as possible, we have outsourced the logistics to a professional third-party service provider.\r\n\r\nSales \r\n\r\nThis is an ongoing process which will be intensified once the first production batch has arrived. We have tested our speaker with a couple of electronics retailers and received very positive feedback, but most retailers are reluctant to make orders based on prototypes. Still, we have already secured the commitment of one of the leading electronics retailers in Scandinavia, and we believe we have already validated the commercial potential for the product.\r\n\r\nMarketing \r\n\r\nThis is also an ongoing process, where we will make use of the different resources available to us at every step of way.  We are committed to renewing ourselves constantly, staying updated on the latest tools and trends, to get this speaker on top of every potential portable speaker customer\u2019s mind. We also have the advantage of having an in-house team of great creative artists that can produce and deliver any marketing material needed, from in-store graphics, packaging and sales material to commercial videos, webpages, banners and posts for social media marketing.\r\n\r\nPatent rights \r\n\r\nThe company has already secured international patent rights for our speaker under The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) network which consists of 152 countries and states. We are in the process of securing our patent in most of this network with the help of the biggest intellectual property law firm in Norway, also listed as top tier in the world regarding trademark, copyright and patent law.\r\n\r\nLocal taxes \r\n\r\nPlease note that whilst we endeavor to ensure that import taxes and duties are kept to a minimum for territories outside of our warehouse locations, local import taxes and duties may be required to be paid. Sodapop has no control over local customs offices and, as such, cannot be held responsible should you be charged import taxes and duties in addition to your purchase and shipping price. It is always best to check the position in your country beforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n\r\nAll that's left to say is a big THANK YOU! We at Sodapop sincerely appreciate your support of our project and for backing us. May we bring real bass to small speakers together!",
  "\"The Edward Everett Horton DVD Project\" is my NINTH Kickstarter-crowdfunded  project, and all previous projects were successfully completed, and were done so on time or rather close to the expected date, and each went about $1,000 over the funding goal. Those DVD projects have been  well-reviewed in publications such as the NY Times, Sight & Sound, Cinema Crazed, DVDTalk and classic film blogs, and by dozens of Amazon  customers.\n\nThere is always the chance that a scheduling or tech issue, or a  hiccup in the life/schedule of yours truly or someone on the production team may arise during the production of any DVD project, and when that's happened  previously it has only delayed the release by a month or two. The one  exception was on \"When Knighthood\" when, just as things were wrapping up  on production, a reel of nitrate 35mm containing 6 mins of lost footage  turned up; it was worth spending the extra few months getting that  print to the Library of Congress for preservation and scanning in order  to complete the film.\n\nAdditionally, the current pandemic has made guaranteeing the scheduling of just about everything kind of a wild card. I will keep you posted on any shifts in our production schedule as they happen, and beg your patience with all this, as well as with the deliver of your copy of the DVD given the various unknown factors currently inhabiting the USPS and foreign mail services.\n\nI'll keep you updated weekly with my progress, and if there are any  unforeseen delays you'll find out as soon as I know. For background, you  can read all the updates from \"Accidentally Preserved\", \"Musty Suffer\"  and \"Marcel Perez vol 1\" and \"When Knighthood Was in Flower\" and \"The Alice Howell Collection\" and \"The Douglas MacLean Collection\" on their respective Kickstarter pages. You'll find I've kept backers up-to-date  on each DVD's progress on a regular basis, and am still sending news and  updates to backers several months after the project was completed.\n\nI have been the producer of The Silent Clowns Film Series since its inception in 1997 and have seen it through 21 successful years of  year-round shows of classic silent films in NYC as well as a number of  partnerships with different venues, and its becoming a not-for-profit.",
  "The main obstacle that I face is gaining access to the site. I don't know how much access I can have to SpaceX facilities, themselves, though I have been granted access in the past. I can only do my best in that regard. I can promise that I will shoot photos of as much as gets in front of my camera as I can. I have driven many thousands of miles back and forth across Texas and surrounding states, shooting hundreds of photos during weeks-long road trips. I'm used to the challenges of these types of trips. My main weakness is processing the photos once I've returned; it typically takes me months to go through all of them. \r\n\r\nI am collaborating with a partner to start an online space exploration education company. My plan is to use these and other photos as part of our startup. Space exploration is near and dear to our hearts, and this is a unique time in the history of private space exploration. I hope to conduct many trips like this one, to document the state of space exploration.",
  "The biggest risk with any relationship is whether or not the couple will stay together. It'll be quite the change from being on Skype all hours of the night to actually being able to be in the same room, but a welcomed change it will be! Our dedication to each other isn't something we take for granted, and anyone who's ever been in a long-distance relationship can tell you how hard it is at times. We are committed to each other and will work to insure that our love grows stronger every day. Yes, even the days she could kill him for looking at coins for hours. We are in this together, and wouldn't want it any other way.",
  "The truth is that I've never written a book, although I'm gonna hire a designer to help me make the book look good, I'm still gonna be the one who decides what recipes will have as well as other contents. \r\n\r\nMy expectation is to have the Vol. 1 ready by December or early June and, if enough funding is reached, have the Vol. 2 by March.\r\n\r\nSo the risk is taking too long making the book but my challenge will be to have it ready and published by January.",
  "Only potential risks include a later date of album's completion due to production time, availability, etc.",
  "In this digital day and age, even great music often goes unheard. By creating a network of support here on Kickstarter, I am also creating a network of people that will hear my project. Every tier of donation is rewarded with a digital download of the project, and that means brand new ears hearing my brand new music. Hopefully, you will like the music enough to share! At the end of the day, we are only doing this in hopes of touching someone's life the way other musicians have touched ours.",
  "The largest risk would be our funding for the purchase of the building falling through.  We feel quite confident that with Craft3 assisting us, the purchase of the building will happen.  \n\nConstruction costs and timelines can be very tricky to navigate and end up being more than anticipated.  We are working closely with a historic architect local to Ellensburg to help us stay on budget and on the timeframe we'd like to achieve.\n\nWe have already met with City of Ellensburg historic preservation specialists to make sure the building can be restored and we've received the green light from them.  The current owner did a lot of necessary earthquake upgrades after the 2001 Nisqually earthquake so we feel confident we will not hit any structural issues that require major funding to fix.  \n\nA study done for CWU when they were considering purchasing this building showed the theater would be in use over 150 nights per year.  Many other groups have contacted us already, seeking space to rent and venue space for their existing groups.  We feel confident we'd be able to generate a large amount of revenue from renting the facility to for-profit groups and we promise to work with our lender to be able to offer either free or very low cost rental fees for other non-profits.",
  "Every radio is different.\r\n\r\nHundreds, if not thousands of different models of mantel and tabletop radios were produced during the '50s, '60s and '70s. Because we are not using the original electronic components, their variety is not a concern. We have carefully selected a bluetooth amplifier board that is compact enough to fit in any case, with the volume control and power connection on separate wires so that they can be located wherever the case requires. The volume control has a nice universal fitting so that we can generally reuse the original volume knob, while the power connection has been selected to fit unobtrusively where the original power cord exited.\r\n\r\nElectrocution?\r\n\r\nIn the interests of safety we decided to keep high voltages out of our speakers. All speakers are 12V only, powered by a unique USB cable that connects directly to your existing phone charger or USB battery bank*. To make things even safer we've kept soldering to a minimum, and fused the power input on every conversion. By not using any old electronics other than the speaker we mitigate any risks that could occur through old failing electronic components and wiring.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\nWe chose to operate with bluetooth 4.0 connectivity to maximise compatibility. No additional apps or cables needed, just turn on bluetooth on your phone, select the speaker and hit play!\r\n\r\nCompliance\r\n\r\nAustralian Standards compliance is one of the tasks that will be undertaken with the money raised in this campaign, however we are confident that we will pass with flying colours. Our bluetooth module has been FCC tested and our 12V, 8W per channel amplifier is low enough powered that we are advised it should be a walk in the park.",
  "This is an ambitious project but very achievable with enough help. Unlike most film & video Kickstarters, this movie has already been made so the chance of you being able to see this film is extremely high if you back this project. Obviously, COVID-19 is the biggest threat to Wednesday in Space's cinema run at the moment. We believe our current timeline for release is still safe and sensible but we will communicate if government advice changes and our late November premiere has to be pushed back.\n\nWith that said, we hope you're excited as we are to bring this funny film to screens, big and small.",
  "The Covid-19 virus has turned the entire world upside, as we all know. The time frame of production and release of the film will largely depend on where we are in the world in relation to the virus. The plan is to shoot in late September/early October, if the virus situation is way better. If not, we may have to temporarily hold off on the shoot but our intention is to shoot 2 months after the end of the campaign and release the film in spring of 2021.",
  "As with any film production, there are risks and challenges associated to 'Numbleypeg'.\n\nCurrently the biggest risk to production itself is the global Covid-19 pandemic. Should restrictions become stricter in the coming weeks we may need to delay filming, although this will not delay the delivery of backers rewards.\n\nThe film's scope is achievable and realistic, and the shut-down of the global 'studio' industry actually presents an opportunity for indie filmmakers to create.",
  "Once I am finished with the project, I know that my biggest challenge will be to get the blog out and find the publicity.",
  "The biggest challenge I have is not having the  money to go to South Africa. I was accepted last year but did not have the money. This is my last chance to fulfill my dream and I hope I can make enough money to go here!\r\n\r\nIf I have enough money to go to South Africa, with the help of all you, my next challenge would be my camera; it is not an underwater camera but with the equipment sold I can easily turn it into a camera that can produce images underwater when I am in the cage taking pictures of the Great White Sharks.\r\n\r\nAnother risk is that the quality of the pictures might not be what I am hoping for. I hope when I go to Africa in December the water will be crisp and clear and therefore having an awesome environment to document the sharks in.\r\n\r\nSince the weather is flipped from the USA and South Africa, in December it will be summer there. Therefore, I am hoping the weather will not be a problem and will not rain or thunderstorm, causing the production to be postponed a day or so. Since I only have a month to spend in South Africa, I am hoping I can document and photograph as much as I possibly can!",
  "In creating my cook book there are two challenges that I plan on possibly encountering. The first being a personal one. Being an artist has its ups and downs, creativity comes in waves and then leaves you all at once for a few days even. With all my art in the past, I've encountered this mental block, but the thing that helps me power through is having a predetermined plan ahead of time, full of different projects and options. I often start a drawing by having five different options and ideas, so when I get stuck I can go right on to the other and just come back to it later. The same goes for recipe creation. By planning out a whole list of the recipes I want to tackle, if ever I get stuck or frustrated I can go on to another (even if I have to stare at my lumpy caramel for a few seconds to sulk).\r\n\r\nThe second hurdle may come with the publishing. I have currently been talking to a plethora of different publishing companies, I just have yet to commit to one and start the publishing process. I see this happening within the next few weeks, but if for any reason this is not possible, I will self publish the book and still be able to send it to backers.",
  "Aside from restraining myself from eating all the food before taking the photos, there is one element to consider:\r\n\r\nWhile the recipe cards will be printed locally with high quality stock and quick turnaround, the box production will be done oversea. Due to the nature of importation, certain delays may arise during delivery. \r\n\r\nLuckily, the box design development is close to completion once the colour and lid-closure are finalized. As soon as the campaign ends, the manufacturing shall commence, leaving lots of lead time to meet The Recipe Box's distribution deadline.",
  "Starting any new business is not without its risks and challenges. For us, that means we have 4 significant bridges to cross. .\r\n\r\nFinancial sustainability: A real (but perhaps unfounded) concern that we have is that people will simply not show up. The truth is that Fishtown doesn\u2019t have a movie theater currently in operation, and the nearest small theater is in the heart of Center City. This doesn\u2019t give us much to go on as far as what kind of attendance to expect. Keeping that in mind, we designed our budget to be able to survive for on a bare minimum. Filling just 6% of our seats per day will provide enough revenue to cover all of our operating costs for the duration of our lease. This budget also doesn't account for revenue from things like theater rentals, on-screen advertising, concessions or merchandising. We feel that this gives us a great buffer against fluctuations in attendance, and will allow us a great deal of flexibility in finding the most profitable way to operate.\r\n\r\nAcceptance: Fishtown can be a deeply political place, and we\u2019ve already encountered folks who for one reason or another are less than thrilled with the idea of someone opening a movie theater here. One of the unique things about what we are doing is that instead of destroying a Fishtown landmark and replacing it with something new, we\u2019ve found a happy medium, by partnering with a long-term resident we can create something new out of a space that's already here. In time, in we think that those who feel apprehensive about what we intend to do will realize that we\u2019re just another part of why this is such a great place to live.\r\n\r\nRenovation: As inspiring as the Liberty Vintage garage is, a movie theater it is not. The bulk of our costs will be spent transforming this space into Fishtown's only neighborhood cinema. We are confident that with a solid vision, a written plan, and a great general contractor, we can build something enjoyable  and functional.\r\n\r\nLicensing: There is also the issue of licensing films. Before we can (legally) screen a movie publicly, we must get a license to do so from the distributor. We are actively contacting distributors in order to expand our catalog for opening day. Having a great selection on opening day and beyond is extremely important to us. The challenge comes with getting the right films at the right price at the right time in order to give everyone the best experience possible.",
  "The difficulty is the extent of the renovation that needs to take place in order to get us open.  As you can see from the video, a lot of work needs to be done, and it comes with a hefty price tag.  Whereas we feel confident that we can afford the major renovation, it is important to us that the community has the opportunity to share in this historical revitalization.  We also want to stay viable during the renovation, and additional liquid capital will help us do just that.  \r\nTime, unfortunately, is our enemy.  It has taken a long time to fund our project. This is why we feel that an infusion from the Kickstarter community at this juncture will be the blessing we need to help us achieve the next level in our renovation.  \r\nOur team has the tools to make this project a tremendous success.  Each member has their area of expertise, and are dedicated to making this building a thriving part of the Stockyards community.  As we are a multi purpose facility, we have worked hard to build a strong advisory board, a strong team of consultants and a clear plan to bring this building back to life.  With the onset of two of the worst Hurricanes in history, we know that our timeline may extend, materials may increase in cost, and we may have to fill a gap to meet these new challenges.  We believe this small Kickstarter will also help fill that gap.",
  "With all their hard work done to produce their album, they just need that final push, one that comes with its own struggles. One of the unique characteristics of Eight Beat is that not one member studies music. All members are full-time students who major in engineering, computer science, chemistry and business. They simply love to make music and share their love with the world. Due to this it makes the ability of recording, arranging and performing an extra effort, one that they have continued to excel in. While this project is underway, many of the songs need to go through a post production process and some final recordings. The post production involves mixing, editing and when all is right mastering. A concept album featuring only one genre of music is something not normally done in the a cappella world, this project breaks the trend of traditional storybook albums.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith your backing we will fulfill our ultimate goal of releasing the most ambitious goal Eight Beat has ever taken upon. Thanks for your donation, you will not be disappointed!",
  "RISKS ARE LOW\r\n\r\nDigital Amplifier Company has a history of successfully amplifier designs spanning more than 20 years.\r\n\r\nConfidence is very high that we will be able to optimize the MEGAschino Cherry Amplifier board set because the modifications are minimal -- mostly parts placement. We successfully prototyped the boards for our previous Kickstarter project.\r\n\r\nWe are also confident in our ability to successfully develop a 2000W transformer to fit our existing chassis. Countermeasures are in place to accommodate a taller transformer by modifying the chassis lid if necessary. We recently built a 2000W prototype transformer that exceeded maximum internal height by less than 0.5\".  Worst case, we will get as close as possible to 2000W.\r\n\r\nOur customer-first philosophy has led to a growing and loyal customer base, so we expect sufficient participation in this Kickstarter project. We also have a track record of four successfully funded Kickstarter projects. We reached our funding goal on Day 1 of our two most recent Kickstarter projects.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGES\r\n\r\nOur biggest challenges with this project are logistics and timing. This is common for any new product development where the technology is already proven.\r\n\r\nHOW WE WILL USE THE MONEY\r\n\r\nThe funds will be used to design new boards for streamlined assembly and development of a 2000W transformer.\r\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN / TIME LINE\r\n\r\nThe supply chain for the MEGAschino is already established through previous designs and prototyping of the original MEGAschino boards. We are using the Classic Cherry chassis, so wire harnesses, transformers, faceplates, and shipping containers have all been used in production amplifiers for several years.\r\n\r\nThe time line for delivery of the new transformer and board set is approximately 3 months.",
  "We have spent years developing, testing and perfecting this product. The circuit boards have been designed and thoroughly tested, the software has been written and the enclosures + various other hardware related bits have been carefully designed and selected. \r\n\r\nBringing all of these things together is a complicated process. Manufacturer delays can happen from time to time. We have done our best to prepare for possible delays in PCB fabrication, enclosure milling/printing and component shipping.\r\n\r\nWith that said, we are confident that we can deliver a high-quality product that you will love - and most of all we're excited to see what you can do with it!",
  "The artwork in the book has already been created, the book is designed, laid-out, and is ready to be sent to the printer. Products have all been accounted for and I\u2019ve done all the prep, budgeting, and research to complete the project once funded. Although this is my first Kickstarter campaign, this isn\u2019t my first time selling products and fulfilling pre-orders. \nI\u2019m 100% confident and dedicated to getting everyone their books and extras with the upmost quality and care. And I promise to communicate and remain open and transparent about the process, including if any complications do happen do arise. \n\n\nMy goal is to have the book and rewards in backers hands by September 2020, hopefully sooner! (international orders may take a little longer due to customs and overseas shipping); \nThe current COVID pandemic may cause some shipping delays, but my suppliers are otherwise all running well, so as long as we all have that in mind, everything else should run smoothly! I will, of course, continue to monitor this and will remain open and honest if it should impact any production and will make any necessary changes accordingly.  \n\nThere is about a 10 week turnaround on production of the book that includes shipping from overseas. If the project is fully funded, and after payment is received (usually about 2 weeks after a successful Kickstarter ends) I will send everything off to be turned into a book!",

  "The Kickstarter collection is ready to go. We are fully prepared to start production at the end of this campaign in our own facility. We will reach out to every backer when the campaign is over to find out which dress shirt you would like us to send you, as well as basic information like size, fit and address. \n\nWe will also work with our backers hand-in-hand to find out which size and fit is best for you. If, for any reason, the shirt isn't the right size, we have a flexible exchange and return policy. We want to insure that you receive a quality dress shirt that fits you, and that you can proudly wear.\n\nProduction delays can happen, but Wolper team will communicate with backers directly and keep them up to date with any issue happening with their shipments.\n\nOur major challenge is reaching our funding goal. The funds from this campaign will allow us to complete the development of our online tailoring services and expand our product range. A successful campaign will also help us expand our production facility in Tunisia, allowing us to create more job opportunities in the community.",

The only thing that may hold up things is from Archway Publishing whom I asked to check back with me next March to see if I can up with the money.

  "The black and white version of the book has already been written, illustrated, playtested, and formatted, so we're in great shape to start a print run.

If we meet our stretch goal to upgrade to color printing, we'll spend a little time beautifying the color version and then will go to press. \r\n\r\nWe'll be self-publishing this book using a Print on Demand service (CreateSpace, IngramSpark, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe anticipate that fulfillment will go smoothly, as it did for our previous Kickstarter project, but have built slack into the schedule to accommodate any delays in production. \r\n\r\nWe'd love to have the problem of too many backers, since, as with all publishing products, the more orders we get, the more bang from our buck we can get via the printers!",

  "Any project with as many moving parts as the production of a six-episode comedy series is subject to risk. One of our actors could get sick, one of our locations might get damaged, one of our crew members could become unavailable. Still, we have contingency plans for all but the most extreme disasters. (Let's face it -- a Los Angeles earthquake could really mess us up.) But we've got back up cast and crew available. And low-budget filmmaking, by its nature, requires the ability to think on your feet. When we made ANALYSIS PARALYSIS, THE PERFECT WEDDING, RUSSIAN DOLL, and OUT OF BODY, we handled several last minute challenges successfully, and if similar problems arise in MARRIAGE OF INCONVENIENCE, we expect to do the same.",

I wish more could have seen it and that we could have made more after that.\" And they'll sadly know that if it only were for a successful Kickstarter campaign, that the fate of the movie and their lives would have been different.

  "Being an epic tale, our film requires us to go into uncharted waters. From a production standpoint, as the story brings Bilbo and Alex around the country, our team will also venture into new terrains, going to supermarkets, forests, and deserts. Finding these locations, as well as transforming them into what we fully envisioned, will take extensive research and time from our team. Furthermore, we will be taking on another challenge, working with our very first cow.

  "Hearing loops, though a relatively simple technology, can become difficult to install in large commercial settings such as theaters.  The design of the theater and its structure come into play,  A theater's sound system needs to be analyzed to determine if modifications have to be made. Interference of any kind (i.e. from electrical panels) needs to be identified and erradicated to enable the loop to work properly and to produce superior sound quality.  New microphones may need to be purchased and installed near and around the stage.  All of this needs to be done by experienced loop installation professionals.\r\nI have already succesfully coordinated the installation of a loop system into an approximately 300 seat theater in Albany, NY, called the Cap Rep.  Here is a link to a Fox News report that was done at the time of that installation : http://wnyt.tv/6h2g7.   \r\nTheaters need to find the funding to make such installations happen.  Costs for installations vary depending on the facilities being looped.  Estimates for looping range from a few thousand dollars to a few hundred thousand dollars depending on the venue.  I help the theater staff identify funding opportunities within their surrounding communities so such installations do not impede or interfere with their existing production budget.  And the amount of money I have requested will allow me to supplement the theater's loop funding as necessary (i.e. if a sufficient amount of money cannot be secured through grants or other subsidies) to ensure that projects that are started reach completion.",
  "The challenge: \r\nWe need the musical to be indoors.  This allows us to perform year round without the worry of sun, wind and rain.  In order to do this, we need a circus tent which is the largest expense we have.\r\n\r\nThe production size and scale is the next big challenge. We are partnering with some big names in show business to make this happen. Showtex for our stage design, BlackTrax and Performance Audio for some of our lighting effects, and Circus Arts in Byron Bay, Australia who will be training our team in the art of aerial acrobatics.\r\n\r\nWe're not a skit or drama. We're creating a full scale mobile production. Think Cirque Du Soleil with a message of hope.  The simple fact that it's mobile increases the challenge but doesn't make it impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Risk: \r\nThe creative founders behind Help!, Eric and Terry Helmick, have already invested over $100,000 in the project to date. They've purchased a bus for transporting the team, backed the creation and purchase of all the illusions which will be used in the show, and taken the tour on the road throughout the western United States to \"test\" their idea of bringing quality entertainment to community neighborhoods while serving people.\r\n\r\n\"We found that communities were very excited about having Help! come into their towns. Who wouldn't be? We offer an amazing amount of volunteer service hours for just about any need a community has. Furthermore, we bring an epic love story that inspires, is filled with hope, and gives people an opportunity to dream.\"\r\n\r\n                                               E W Helmick, Executive Director and Founder",

  "We all have full time jobs, so while OK|LA has truly become our collective priority, adulting has tried HARD to get in our way. We have refused to let it! We are taking off of work as much as we can, often meeting late at night after work and shooting into the early morning just to be sure we can pump our project out.\n\nOn top of scheduling, we have struggled with securing locations, rewrites, finding cast + crew, finding props + set dressing + lighting with such a tight budget, and more. But hey, that's showbiz, baby! *finger guns*\n\nEvery obstacle we have conquered together has taught us a lesson and made us stronger and smarter filmmakers!",

The beauty of this project is we've been there, we've done that! The major hurdles were overcome in the lead up & during the major shoot. We're not saying it's smooth sailing from here on in, but we're almost at the finish line. Our biggest challenge now is completing post within budget allocations and submission deadlines....EASY!",
  "Risks.\r\n\r\nIf we don't reach our goal, you don't pay a dime. We also don't receive a dime. And then we're left to sell our bodily fluids to science in order to fund this project. Or, I could leave a box of books in my hatchback - as I often do - and someone steals the car, along with the books.\r\n\r\nThe real risks of the project is getting overwhelmed with time and not meeting our deadlines when it comes to our promises to our backers. And of course, the connection to the backers is in every facet of production because without you...there is no production. \r\n\r\nIt's a small book and therefore risks are minimal.",

We already have the Unique Dyslexic Facebook but we need to make people more aware that its there. So far I have had zero budget for Unique Dyslexic Eye podcasts so it limits the footprint.

At times we have to initiate a plan B or C to overcome these challenges.\n\nOur industry experience with concert productions have qualified us to overcome production challenges.

  "We have been enjoying music from several versions of our working prototypes already. They play loud, quality Bluetooth music reliably, so there is minimal risk for developing Ekko for Kickstarter production.

It could take a few iterations to resolve any potential issues in order to streamline the design and process for mass production, but we are committed to getting Ekko shipped into the market and we have the skills to do so. Our working prototype is proof of our skill and commitment to succeed. \r\n\r\nOther risks to consider are shipping costs. To be fair to backers, we will not be charging a blanket rate, but instead will pass on the shipping charges to the backers outside kickstarter. This way those that live closer will not have to overpay. Please contact us for shipping cost estimates with your preferred destination address.\r\n\r\nLastly, California based backers will have to be charged sales tax separately.

  "This is our 7th Kickstarter campaign so we know enough to know that we face some risks and challenges. This same experience will be invaluable in overcoming any challenge we might face. Let's talk through some of the possible challenges.  \n\n1. Transitioning from prototype to full-scale manufacturing. Currently, we have fully functioning prototypes from the same factory that will make our full production run so we anticipate manufacturing to go smoothly. Furthermore, since there is no major tooling required, it mitigates many of the major unknowns. However, full-scale manufacturing is always different than making a small run of prototypes. We have a well-respected manufacturing partner, and they have been responsive to any feedback we've shared.\n\n2. Global supply chains and logistics. This has been an ongoing issue facing many industries over the past year. During our most recent campaign, we experienced increased container shipping costs, slower shipping timelines, and continued risk of lockdowns in countries like China.  There is the risk of additional lock-downs in the countries we manufacture in.  \n\n3. This is a project and we're using Kickstarter to create something new! That means that things such as design, features, accessories, and any/all aspects of the project are fluid and a work in progress! We've done our best to present our project transparently and honestly - and it's our full intention to deliver everything as shown on the campaign page and video. However, as creators, it's ultimately our job to bring the best version of the project to life - both for backers and for us. That means things can change throughout the campaign and after.   \n\nLessons learned from past campaigns:  \n\n1. Keep it simple. This has probably been our #1 biggest lesson learned and one that really impacted our most recent campaign. As a creator, there is always a temptation to try to do everything - add more features, more accessories, more add-ons, more, more, more! This can make for an exciting campaign, but the fun quickly evaporates post-campaign. That's why we've made neon buffalo as minimalist as possible and kept the weight variations to three options. Simple.  \n\n2. Underpromise and overdeliver. We're optimists at heart - it's essential for us as creators to have a positive and hopeful attitude. However, we've learned the need to balance that mentality with realistic expectations. Especially when setting deadlines and communicating with backers.  \n\n3. Communicate more than you think is necessary. We always strive to be transparent and keep our backers updated. However, in our most recent campaign backers seemed to want more communication. We'll communicate more frequently during this campaign.  \n\nWe hope that sharing these risks and challenges gives you more confidence in us: to be honest, transparent, and ultimately bring this project to life in the best way possible. We are excited to get going!",
  "We know that the core of any tech product is in its build quality and performance. Right now N3ptune prototype speakers have been made using 3d printed and machined components. When productions starts parts will be made using injection molding and other different processes which may affect or have a different sound output than our tested N3ptune prototypes. If sound quality or design quality is affected we will re-tool the speaker until we build a premium quality speaker that is of same sound quality or better than our prototypes. This process is not easy nor fast.\r\n\r\nPerformance and build quality is what will separate us from the thousands of different speakers in the market today, so we will test and re-test every component of N3ptune once we get the final prototype from the manufacture and if something does not meet our standard it will have to be re-designed or re-tooled until we fix it and it meets our standard of a premium built speaker.\r\n\r\nManufacturing and delivering a premium line of wireless speakers will not be an easy task but we are confident that we can meet our timeline without sacrificing quality or performance with the finished product.",

It will be all shared in my music, which will be translated through my soul.\nBudgeting will be my biggest challenge. I would have to cover costs for my band, my mixer, my producer, my PR manager, and even more people on my team, like my graphic design team, my marketing team, and my advertising. \nI would like to cover costs for time, for travel, and for special costs like studio equipment.",
  "We've already scripted and cast the next two seasons, so there is little risk that more episodes won't be released, but there could always be unforeseen challenges that prevent it from coming out as soon as we would like. \n\nThe biggest difficultly we've run into is coordinating such a large cast; in the first season it was always a struggle finding a day when everyone was available to shoot. For season 2, we'll be scheduling and shooting far more efficiently, minimizing the number of shots that feature large groups of characters so that we can shoot most things without the full cast being present, and making the most out of it on the days that we do have everyone there.",

Over the past three seasons, I've tried to make as many episodes as possible on a very limited budget. \n\nI love making this podcast and am beyond grateful to all of those who have supported this project thus far via Patreon. However, I've found that it just isn't practical for me to continue making new episodes without more substantial financial support. Going forward, I just won't be able to prioritize the work it takes to produce the show without your help. \n\nThe main risk I can foresee is that a guest expert that has already committed to joining me this season may have to cancel (but we all LOVE talking about gardening, so why would they do that?). This would require me to find a new guest or change the content of that episode. Other than that, I am confident that I will be able to release all of the episodes planned for this season and then begin planning for next year.",
  "We need to get our copyright so no one can steal our name!",
  "Scheduling the production of this show around my work schedule as a freelancer will be my biggest hurdle. I plan on counteracting this by setting plenty of deadlines throughout the show's process. Additional challenges: potentially learning & purchasing new software for sound design as well as purchasing equipment if production runs past May of 2019 (which is the tail end of my equipment rental season). These challenges are lightly accounted for in my budget.",
  "The challenge on this project is in further pushing the creative envelope on radically re-inventing how a content-rich, deeply truthful book on Chefs is physically produced and experienced by the reader. I'm always looking for ways to make information more totally exciting and fresh, and to bring a quiet yet critical humanity to all forms of creative endeavor. \r\n\r\nWe're now at the actual book production phase. There are so many major and minor details and completion expenses with self-publishing it's mind-boggling, and to produce books at this insane level of quality makes it all even more so. But having a project under your own creative control means that you don't have to compromise on content or physical quality, and give people something truly special. This mode of creation leads into a purity that makes the intense work rewarding and thrilling. \r\n\r\nHaving produced Notes From A Kitchen Volumes One and Two, we have extensive knowledge and experience in all aspects of high-quality book production, distribution and shipping.  \r\n\r\nAt this point the primary two-year documentary photography and interview phase is now completed,  with image editing, copyediting and creative book design in full force and actual pages being prepared for press. The dollars from this campaign will go towards producing these beautiful Limited Edition books and if, by chance additional funds are raised, our intention is to add more special creative components into the books, and create launch events with the featured Chefs all across the country!",
  "Timing: The biggest challenge for this project will be keeping the production of our editions on schedule; we want to make sure that the editions reach our readers while the featured ingredients are still in season. This risk is mitigated by our past experience in the publishing world and keeping our first print run to a modest size. \r\n\r\nAssembly: Each Short Stack edition is stitch-bound by hand using a needle and baker\u2019s twine. With thousands of books to bind, we\u2019ll be enlisting the help of readers through a series of bookmaking gatherings, where the featured authors will serve some recipes from their editions and bookbinding guru Jordan McIntyre will teach attendees how to make a book. On top of that, we\u2019ll be hiring a fleet of helping hands to ensure our books are stitched on time.",

I would like to thank you in advance for your patients and I will keep you updated regularly on the process.",

The process takes time, but we will get them to you as soon as humanly possible.",
  "Status of the project: \r\n\r\nWe have a working prototype for both the earplugs and the app. \r\n\r\nWe have worked for months with our manufacturer to produce the injection mold needed to create the silicone part of the earplugs, and it's basically ready for mass production. We are now waiting for different filter samples to test in real live music environment and decide which one is best, and submit for testing and certification. We are working with one of the best testing laboratories in Germany, and they just need us to send them the final samples.\r\n\r\nThe carrying case doesn't need custom mold, and the manufacturing process is very simple once we make the order. \r\n\r\nThe carrying case tray and packaging box for the earplugs has been already produced in mass when we did our proof of concept. We have a few improvements in our new design but we expect our printer to be able to execute without problems as they did last time.\r\n\r\nFor distributors, we still need to design the distributor pack, but it's a standard box that our printer produced in the past for other clients.\r\n\r\nThe app functions properly in both iOS and Android, but since we won't be able to test every model in the market, and every phone might receive slightly different sound signal depending on factors that we can't control, like how old or damaged is your microphone, we need to add a calibration section, so the users can adjust if needed. This is a quite simple implementation though. We have developed apps in the past and we are already approved as developers in both the Apple App Store and in Google Play.\r\n\r\nFor delivery, we are currently working with an award winning warehouse in the UK that will ship internationally in a professional and timely manner. \r\n\r\nRisks:\r\n\r\nWe are aware that the timeline for delivery in December is quite optimistic, but it's possible. We will do our best to deliver before Christmas because EarDial is the perfect present to any music-loving friend. Only if everything goes as expected we will be able to meet this deadline.",

  "For anyone investing in more than one issue at a reduced rate, we would want to make clear that we can only honestly deliver the full set, over the decade, if we sell enough of issues one, then two, three etc., to get us to the next issue, creating a domino effect to the conclusion of the final issue, number 10. If we create something that is compelling and significantly different to anything else out there, which is exciting and fresh (which is our aim!) this won\u2019t, we feel, be a problem. But it\u2019s a risk. \n\nWith the pandemic we are aware this horrible virus might linger or return in a different manifestation. If it did, it would of course be tragic. For INQUE, like everyone else, there could be delays. There is not a strict print deadline for each issue, as long as it\u2019s in its designated year (2021, 2022 etc.), so this isn't a major problem, but could consequently pose a challenge if we ran out of time in any given year. We are however working with printers who have the ability to stay open whilst maintaining safe social distancing.\n\nFurther, a challenge is figuring out how we package a valuable art print in each issue by our guest artist, without it falling out or into the wrong hands (i.e. someone who has not bought the magazine). We don\u2019t want to have each issue shrink-wrapped, so need to resolve this. Also, deciding against having a digital edition, we need to work out how to ensure people know about the magazine online and have the access to pre-order issues.

As theater artists ourselves, we understand what it feels like to constantly be asked to work for free, or for less than we are worth. We are part of an industry that has a vested interest in paying creatives little to nothing, an exploitative practice that has gone on for far too long, making theater, both the creation and practice, accessible only to those with the right resources, funds, and connections.

So the only real challenge is to meet the promised deadlines for shipping backer rewards.\r\n\r\nHere is are some possible scenarios that could delay the shipment of your reward:\r\n#1 - Parts do not arrive on time. In particular, the Vimex pots are not scheduled to arrive until early January. If this order is delayed, which is possible due to the high demand on the manufacturer leading up to the Chinese New Year, production will be delayed accordingly. If this happens, backers will have a choice on whether to receive their rewards on time with Alpha pots or wait for the glass-reinforced Vimex pots.\r\n#2 - Orders of my other products exceed my production capacity, which may slow down overall production. My production schedule priority will go to filling backer rewards, so even if this does happen, it should not cause a lengthy delay.\r\n#3 - January is the first month that my wife returns to work after a few months of maternity leave.

Evan is learning as we go and has been hard at work researching RSS feeds, hosting sites, playing with editing software and making sure that Pilot Co-Pilots! will have everything they need to produce an entertaining 40 minutes of listening per episode, but we're sure there will be some snags. Please feel free to offer any professional advice if you've done this all before!",
  "I've fulfilled 6 previous Kickstarter projects solo, and helped handle shipping for a further 3, so I am rather practiced at this by now, and I know my printer is top-notch and will deliver on time. My fulfilment process is also pretty polished, so I am confident of delivering as quickly as possible. If any problems do occur, I'll be sure to keep backers updated regularly.",
  "The biggest challenge is lack of financial resources. \r\n\r\nI shortened the duration of this project due to the deadline of MAY 18th and there is a 14 day collection period. This would allow me to still have time to book the flight and hotel for the performance and event mixer.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your help!!\r\n\r\nVisit DefiantSuccess.com",
  "The biggest challenge this time around is that we're actually aiming for an amount that would cover the expenses of putting out two issues next year. On one hand, given some of the past kickstarters there have been for fiction anthologies and new zines from people much more hip and cool than us, $5k is peanuts. On the other hand, it would require a significant increase in our existing readership to pull it off.\r\n\r\nThe increased number of backers would mean more copies having to be shipped out, which could either mean more time spent manually entering fulfillment information into Amazon and Lulu or time spent stuffing envelopes. Either way, there's a chance I'll be spending more time than in the past getting orders out to people.\r\n\r\nThe quarterly schedule has been pretty break-neck for us this year. However, I've made certain to get well ahead of the game on issues 9 & 10 so that nothing comes down to the wire. Even if we do get $10k, chances are we'll still go back to semi-annual for 2019. Excess funds will be used to get other projects off the ground as we look into doing more special releases like Wild Stars III.",
  "As Editors, we have found an excellent working partnership that sticks to deadlines, and that above all has a great time producing it together. This foundation will ensure the launch of No.1 as well as the energy and excitement to move straight onto No.2. \r\n\r\nAs an independent publication, our biggest challenge will be in its distribution. For the No.1 we are approaching stockists individually, but with lots of advanced planning and many existing contacts we are well on the way to ensuring it is widely stocked across the U.K. as well as in select stores in Europe and the U.S.A. Your advance sales will go a long way to helping us.\r\n\r\nWith our very trusted designers, Kris and Tom, we have a great working relationship with our printers to ensure excellent quality and expedient delivery.\r\n\r\nKeep track of our progress via www.tintedwindowmag.com and Instagram (@tinted__window).",
  "The biggest challenge we face is, of course, not losing money! Edinburgh Festival is well known for being expensive and huge. Whilst this year it will inevitably be smaller (no international artists), the audiences  will, in turn, be smaller because of social distancing.  We are therefore packing in as many shows as we can - 38 in total over 3 weeks. \nWith regard to the dreaded Coronavirus, we will test regularly and in accordance with the wishes of the venue.",
  "VOOR DE POES Magazine bestaat twee jaar! Doordat we met het magazine (nog) in een aanloopfase verkeren, is er nog geen winstmarge in beeld. Toch, dromers die we zijn, willen we dolgraag dit kookboek voor kat en baas realiseren. Om de kosten enigszins te drukken, vragen we jullie om een bijdrage, zodat we dit unieke kookboek kunnen gaan realiseren. Help jij ons kookboek de winkels in?",
  "After half a year of production Talking Machines has established a reputation for through, unbiased coverage. Because of the success we've had so far, we expect the project to continue through the end of the first season. If we can raise the funds, production pressures of season two will be essentially the same as season one. \r\n\r\nAs long as our scheduling assumptions for reward production are correct we should have all your Talking Machines swag ready for you in time!",
  "My biggest challenge will be producing Bandwagon independently. Finding stories, gathering tape in the field, and editing and mixing episodes on a monthly basis is a tall task. And that doesn't even include promoting the show so that people actually listen! That's why I need your help. Your support makes this possible.",

  "We're working with Make That Thing, who have produced and fulfilled dozens of Kickstarter campaigns. They know what they're doing and will get your books to you safely and quickly!\r\n\r\nSTW has had success with Kickstarter before, and Make That Thing was a major help in making sure everything was delivered smoothly.  This project will be in good hands with them!\r\n\r\nThe general design of the book is complete, so there shouldn't be too many concerns moving forward! In addition, I will be able to devote significant attention this summer to making sure the book is delivered to the printers with more than enough lead-time, so all systems are go!",
  "Our major challenges will stem from the actual production of physical copy of the journal. We have already solicited several submissions for this edition of Echolocation, and have a healthy pile of submissions to read. The actual literary material will, luckily, not be hard to find. Where we may be slowed down are in the design aspects of journal - hence, we've posted a tentative production deadline of April 2018. Depending on how we reach our fundraising goals, we may be able to release in early April.",
  "There shouldn't be many risks still associated with this project. The stories are already selected, and have all been handed in - so that lineup is final. The printing company is on standby. The design/layout team are ready to go. We just need the money to make it work.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, around half the target money will go to the authors, so you know that you're helping support the people who deserve it most. The rest of the money will cover layout, proofreading, printing, postage, as well as all the other goodies we're offering - the postcards, T-shirts, etc. \r\n\r\nDelivery is expected to be December 2017. We see no reason why we can't achieve that - barring an act of God, the rewards should be with you before Christmas.",

  "LOW RISK! Now in our 10th year, we have released 71 issues. So we have an established track record of creating high-quality magazine content. We already have our entire team in place, and we\u2019re running like the proverbial well-oiled machine.\r\n\r\nPlus, there\u2019s a combined 50 years of print experience between our Publisher and Art Director. The only difference with production of the physical magazine is working with an outside partner who will manage printing and shipping the magazines to subscribers.",

I will not let anything rest unless it is as good as it can be, and I plan to bring that same level of dedication to CREATEcast.\r\n\r\nObviously, a podcast such as mine is only as good as its guests. That said, I already have an incredible lineup ready to record and share with the world. Get excited.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, one might be concerned about the frequency of episodes/production. As of right now, my plan is to have episodes airing every two weeks, starting in early May. Regardless of the air date, applicable backer rewards will ship in early June - happy summer!",
  "Can We Deliver?\r\n\r\nWe've been designing and manufacturing high-end audio equipment for more than 35 years. We know what it takes to make a vision come to life, and we will do our best to deliver your AxiomAir on time and to spec.\r\n\r\nAlthough we've spent over 3 years in development, there are always unforeseen difficulties that may arise. There could be unexpected issues with the software that would result in updates happening after the product has shipped. (Requiring you to update the speaker from the interface.) There could be delays with component supplies or delivery that delay the project overall.  We pledge to keep you apprised of any unforeseen issues through regular updates.",
  "We know great quality is hard to find, and with this project we cannot afford having bad quality components. That\u2019s why we will manufacture it in UK to ensure only the best materials are being used. Any hardware project is a challenge so producing and shipping OnBlink out into the world won't be easy. We've spent considerable time assessing the potential risks, such as delays in component sourcing, issues with the process compatibility testing or fulfilment. Through understanding these processes we have strategies in place to keep the the project on time. Therefore we're confident that when we will face the challenges that inevitably come our way, we will be prepared to tackle them head on.\r\n\r\nThe reason we are shipping units in a small initial batch and a second larger one is so that we can ensure the highest quality for our backers. Assembling and shipping the first batch means we can ensure all the parts meet our spec and so we can make changes to manufacturing processes. We are confident that this is the best way to get the products to you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSince QA is such a major focus for us, we\u2019ll be testing components and subassemblies multiple times during the assembly process. Although this adds a little bit of time, it also ensures a robust product that can withstand you putting it through its paces for many years.",
  "As with any manufacture there are inherit risks. We have planned meticulously and have secured a supply chain as well as a trusted manufacturer. However there is the possibility that there may be issues with tooling or other unforeseen issues that may delay delivery.",

  "Every movie project carries with it a great assortment of risks. With so many variables in the post-production and distribution processes, the only certainty in filmmaking is that things will go wrong. Solving problems, then, is an essential part of the process.\r\n\r\nThe producers of All Sorts have over 30 years of collective experience in filmmaking and have encountered, and overcome, many difficulties. Now that principal photography is complete, our largest risks are already behind us.\r\n\r\nOur biggest challenge now is getting the movie completed and seen by as many people as possible. This can be overcome by clever and persistent promotion, generating buzz via social media, building a fan base, and getting the movie out on the festival circuit. We have already enjoyed a lot of early press and social recognition during filming in WA state, and have fed the momentum by sharing clips, stills and behind the scenes interviews on our website and social media platforms. This Kickstarter campaign will help us move All Sorts onward and upward!\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time and for supporting Independent Filmmaking!",
  "The biggest risk for any comedy is for people to actually find it funny. We all know that terrible feeling you get when you try to make a joke and no one laughs. That is why we've taken time over the last few years to make a vast number of comedy sketches. These projects taught us the many pitfalls and challenges that come with comedy. \r\n\r\nWe've learned that the writing, an actor's performance, and comedic timing are all major influences on whether or not a joke is well received. That's why we've spent over a year working on our script, going through multiple re-writes and beta readers to ensure our script is full of both humor and depth. We fully believe that each actor that has joined our team will be able to deliver an outstanding performance for their character, and we will work hard, both on location and in the editing room, to best showcase their performances visually and through comedic timing.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we face is going to be standing out amidst all of the other video content that can be found out there today. We know that we can settle for nothing less than complete excellence in every aspect of the show. A few things we feel we have in our favor is a very unique concept, a good script, and an outstanding cast.",

All of the people involved in creating Tour de Lovecraft are experienced participants in the crowdfunding process. We have our manufacturing partners in place, and a reasonable timeline in which to create and deliver all the rewards from this campaign. The majority of the essays for Tour de Lovecraft : The Destinations have been written already.

I have allotted myself cushion in terms of the time it takes to get things done. If for for some reason the timeline changes I will notify you. \r\n\r\nThe album is done. I have researched merchandise and publicity firms. I have directors, designers, promoters, actors and videographers ready to create magic. \r\n\r\nThere will always be fear in my line of creativity, but I feel that nerves are healthy and proof that we are alive. It is also more important to me to try rather to give up before I give myself a chance to start.",

  "There can be production challenges associated with any manufacturing project (supply chain issues, delays, equipment failure, theft, etc.), but we've been through this many times before and have a lot of confidence in our ability to fulfill this campaign in a timely fashion. We have built a strong working relationship with our foundry and are supremely confident in their ability to meet any level of demand.\n\nA unique challenge for us is that molds wear out over time. We have a lot of experience in jewelry design and metal casting, and we know how to plan for this. As many people have discovered, 3D scanning, design, and printing all require expertise. We are veteran users of these technologies and have worked in many high-stress situations to develop great products.",

  "We've already made 4 hilarious episodes of our series. We have an incredible crew and team assembled and they're ready to get started making more Room actors magic! The making of the show won't be difficult. We have the scripts finished and we just need the funds. \r\n\r\nWe discovered after our last Kickstarter campaign that we offered too many varied rewards and fulfillment of these on a very tight budget was costly and tough. I modeled our previous campaign on Reading Rainbow and Veronica Mars! But they made millions and millions of $$. And we made $30k. So offering the same rewards they did was unrealistic (although kudos to us for aiming high - haha!). We pared it down this time and are keeping it simpler. \r\n\r\nI already have the posters (signed and unsigned), T-shirts, mugs, artwork, DVDs and Bonus materials ready to go, so all we need to do is send it out! Last time, I needed to design and manufacture all of it!!! We are sitting pretty this go around. Thank you for joining our team and helping to make this hilarious series!",
  "As student filmmakers, finding the most cost-efficient and effective resources to implement in our film is not an easy task to come by and can be quite difficult when dealing with certain filmmaking elements such as budgeting, casting, and set designing. Most of the time, our funds come out of pocket to make up for the remaining budgeting costs we couldn't fully obtain. These funds can be quite expensive for us to donate ourselves when working with a lot of these different film dynamics.\r\n\r\nWe hope that through this Kickstarter we can fully fund this film in its entirety, including any screenings and festivals we'd like to submit to, and that our efforts in creating it will reflect your confidence in our cinematic pursuits with your generous funds.",

I plan to utilize all social media outlets to promote the mixtape and I hope to do interviews with local podcasts or YouTube music reviewers. As I began to record songs for the mixtape, I'll be thinking about ideas for promotional videos and cover art for individual songs. I will have to find someone with the talent and resources to help make this possible. Currently, I am looking for a female R&B vocalist to help me record my more soulful tracks.",

  "Every project takes twice as long as originally planned, and costs twice as much. This is why this kickstarter campaign covers only the professional services we can outsource. \r\n\r\nWe don't need to outsource the baking. Both Scott and I are competent home bakers, and we have a number of chef friends who are not only enthusiastic cookie recipients and reviewers, but who had also given us a word of advice when we needed it. \r\n\r\nWe don't need to outsource the publishing, because both of us are published authors and I have been publishing my our books through my own imprint, Mugen Press. \r\n\r\nWe don't even need to pay for all the butter, nuts and sugar we've gone through over the years. Those are sunk costs we invested out of love.\r\n\r\nFormatting a genre paranormal book, or even an illustrated anthology, is much easier than doing a good job on graphic design of both the interior and the book cover. For this reason, Chuck Beard, the designer responsible for Pittsburgh Magazine, generously offered to be part of this project. \r\n\r\nNo matter how much better the phone cameras have become, nothing can replace the quality equipment and especially the experienced eye of a professional food photographer. Laura Petrilla shoots lovely images of food for local restaurants as well as food magazines, and she takes stunning portraits of the chefs while she is at it. We are lucky to have her playful creativity.\r\n\r\nMiranda Pavelle, a professional animator, is our videographer. If you see anything animated, it was she who decided to play. \r\n\r\nThe cookbook will be ready in e-book format this spring. If there are any delays on the e-book delivery, I will let you know. The printed format always takes a bit longer, and we are have our secret internal deadlines to make sure you get the book in your hands well ahead of the book launch party. If you bring it, you can have it autographed by the whole team.\r\n\r\nSending out tins of cookies is what we always do, and those of you who donated at a level where you will receive a shipment, your tin will be the same as what we like to send our relatives and friends. \r\n\r\nAgain, in case of unexpected delays, you will be notified. \r\n\r\nWe will send out notices of milestones being met, of bloopers that happened (Hey... did you know that liquid smoke looks just like vanilla when not properly labeled?), and you just might land a surprise cookie story in your inbox. Or a lone, interesting recipe!\r\n\r\nWe will keep in touch. Thank you so much for your support!",

  "There have been many challenges in the past when it came to designing pedals and getting from idea to a physical working model. From finding the right parts to the hundreds hours of R and D, But there is always a way to overcome these challenges. Sometimes it was spending hours online looking for that one rare part or spending days and nights swapping parts and analyzing signals to get the desired outcome from the effect box. My biggest challenge has been raising money on my own to make a large order to suppliers to get the parts I need at a cost that wont kill the project before it can take off. I have overcome this by doing it in small steps, one week, purchase one part the next week get a few parts and eventually it all my designs came to life. Now that I have a few functional models it would be great to make a production run a get these great pedals out to musicians. This is why I am here at kickstarter. As for the \"if\" we are funded factor. I believe that most changes i will face from the \"funded\" point will plainly be time. I do work a full time job working audio for an event company. But so far this had not really slowed the process. When i am not working for the man, I am working on Vintage Efx. I put a lot of time into this project because i believe my years of experience in the field of audio has provided me with the skill set needed to deliver a unique and long lasting product. We honestly feel that our biggest challenges have already been overcome, its simply time to make these products, we just need a little financial push to really get of the ground and get our product to hundreds of players out there.",
  "Leo is a hand assembled piece of electronic art and the utmost care will be taken during assembly. With collective experience of delivering multiple electronic products, we are familiar with the challenges ahead. With many working prototypes, we are confident in our design. Production of electronics is a complex task and there is always a chance of error in manufacturing, or difficulties in obtaining parts, which can delay delivery. We are confident of our partners' abilities to assist us in the most complex processes of the build. Pending successful funding, we have arranged production to start in March 2015. We have already developed extensive electronic testing and benchmarking software and procedures to assure that every shipped Leo performs to the highest standards.",
  "I learned a lot from my first Kickstarter book project, and hopefully those lessons will help this one go smoothly. \r\n\r\nA bigger quantity of books means bigger logistical problems with storage and fulfillment \u2013 but I've looked into (and budgeted for) storage/warehousing solutions, and this time I'm working with a shipping company that makes sending out the physical rewards far more efficient. \r\n\r\nI've put a lot of thought into planning out a tight production/fulfillment timeline, but there's always the possibility of unexpected issues with book production or shipping, or unforseen circumstances that could delay me finishing my work on the book files. If problems arise, I'll do my best to keep all the backers updated on the situation, and what I'm doing to get everyone's rewards delivered as soon as possible.",
  "Truly, the biggest challenge will be getting the word out. Unlike other kickstarters, I have decided not to have multiple small tiers. Instead, I am only interested in selling the book. I think there are 250 people in the world who want buy this book, but I'm going to need your help! \r\n\r\nThere are two things I'd like you to do. First, buy my books. Then TELL EVERYONE!

  "As we move into the production phase, most development risks have been addressed. The finish and audio quality achieved is second to none and we are now focusing on tweaks to further enhance the user experience. With those improvements being worked on during the Kickstarter campaign, we are confident that production can begin immediately after a successful campaign draws to a close.\r\n\r\nWe are working with experienced and reputable manufacturers; delays are sometimes inevitable when creating a unique product It is with this knowledge in mind that we set a very realistic delivery schedule. The factory can build up to 100 units a day. If possible, we would like to deliver product before the estimated shipping date. That will be challenge that we hope to meet.\r\n\r\nKickstarter pledges will be critical to launching us into that next phase of production. It will not only allow us to begin the production run for the first batch of ARCHT One units, but also allow us to set up quality controls and supply chain logistics, ensuring the company builds on a strong foundation. \r\n\r\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign, our next goal will be to launch ARCHT One in retail stores.",

That being said, things outside of my control, such as technology failing, shipping delays, human error, miscommunication, etc, can always arise. In this event, I'll do my best to resolve things quickly and stay in communication with my backers.\r\n\r\nAll the comic artwork, digital files, and previous chapters' printed issues are finished and ready to be sent to you all! All that's left to be done is the actual printing of Chapter 4.",
  "Because Caitlin and Dave - as well as their collaborators Larry Buchanan, Courtney Nguyen and spiritual guide David Granger, former EIC of Esquire Magazine - all have experienced backgrounds in media, we've had a rewarding time compiling what we think is incredibly compelling editorial material.\r\n\r\nWhat we don't know much of anything about is printing - we're doing our research meticulously so that we end up working with the best partners to give us a quality product that we can put in front of our readership. For that reason, we're looking to solely raise funds to cover the cost of printing 10k copies of the first two issues of Racquet, which ends up being at least $25k per issue. We're smart people who aren't afraid to ask questions and work relentlessly, but we want to make sure we get this right so that we can serve a healthy community of tennis fans now and well into the future.",

  "\u201cK & the Crazies\u201d is a passion project in which we will release regardless of our fundraising outcomes. We have come this far and will continue to see the project through to its release. Though we are seeking partnerships for the project with hopes of reaching our full budget of $75,460, the reality is we cannot presume such relationships will be acquired. In the event we do not secure full funding, our resourcefulness of skill-swapping, gathering in-kind donations, volunteer help, and scraping between couch cushions will ensure the successful completion of this podcast. That said, your support will help us tremendously as we move forward.",
  "The risk involved will be the terms of studio rent and set up, licensing and presenters commitment and production skills. The longevity of the project means the contributers will be given training and opportunity to provide feedback on each others shows and content, maintaining a team morale with a heavy focus on innovation and inspiration. Feedback from listeners will also be heavily considered and utilised for consistency and functionality",
  "This project anticipates formerly incarcerated individuals wanting to share their success stories and the impact they are having on their communities. However, some of these individuals may wish to conceal their identity. This would present a challenge to this project if it happens too often because the entire premise is based on filming captivating interviews for people to watch. Watching the back of someone\u2019s head on camera would not produce the objective of this project.\nThe number of successful formerly incarcerated individuals out there should be a sufficiently high enough number to mitigate this risk.\n\nAnother challenge we will face is ensuring the authenticity of the stories we hear from our guests. We are developing a system that we intend to use to verify that our guests are being forthright and honest about having been incarcerated and the length of their incarceration. However, many of the finer, more personal details of their stories will be harder to verify, and we will have to take our guests at their word that they are being honest.",
  "Before launching our project, we customized all sets of molds from a top-notch manufacturer (one of DJI's suppliers) and conducted a trial manufacturing run to ensure a smooth transition from prototype to finished product.

If there are any cases of any unexpected circumstances, we promise to communicate with full transparency to you, our backers, and work to resolve all issues in a timely manner.",
  "The major challenge facing any independent film is distribution. How do you get your movie out there for people to see? With the proliferation of streaming services and video-on-demand options, the opportunities are endless, but the goal for most filmmakers is still to get their film into theaters. \r\n\r\nThe most obvious way to do that is by submitting the film to film festivals and hoping someone picks it up for distribution. Many film festivals receive thousands and thousands of submissions, but can only screen a hundred or so (if that), which makes this route of seeking distribution very difficult. In order to better your chances of succeeding on the film festival circuit, filmmakers need to develop a film festival plan.\r\n\r\nAs part of our plan we have factored film festival submission fees into our budget. 20% of our festival submission budget will go towards major festivals (Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, etc.), 50% will go towards mid-range festivals (South by Southwest, Slamdance, etc.), and 30% will go towards smaller/local festivals (Oak Cliff Film Festival, Dallas VideoFest, Dallas International Film Festival, etc.).\r\n\r\nWe have also created a festival submission timeline where we have researched each festival in-depth (their eligibility criteria, programming from previous years, etc.) and prioritized the festivals that a) our film has a better chance of getting into, and b) actually screen films versus those festivals that merely accept your submission money but don't do anything to promote it or get it in front of people.",

  "About me:\r\n\r\nMy name is Lady Pixel Heart. I'm a professional freelance artist with 6+ years of experience making art. I draw mostly monthly commissions for people of their ocs, fanart, and sometimes my own characters.\r\n\r\nI've been writing this story for over a year now (currently I'm writing Book 3)! I'm handling the whole project by myself, which is really hard to find time for inbetween projects.\r\n\r\nWhy Kickstarter??\r\n\r\nIn order to create these chapters I will need at least 2 months off from commissions. The money I usually make for taking 5-10 commissions each month helps pay for bills, groceries, and living expenses. \r\n\r\nIf I can't get this time off of commissions I won't have time to work on the comic once it comes out on the 31st of October when I release the first 3 pages of Chapter 1. \r\n\r\nIf I can raise the funds I will be able to produce the chapters right away giving my audience less time to have to wait for the next pages!  It's been a dream of mine since I was very young to make a comic series that people could follow and enjoy so I hope that you'll support me in this endeavor! <3",

  "Coming up with delicious recipes that are healthy and good to eat is challenging when it come to foods that not only taste good but have benefits of reversing many ailments just by not eating processed foods. My goal is to do just that:  create a book that will introduce people to a world without processed foods and educate them about the benefits of eating healthy foods.\r\n\r\nI need this vehicle, this book, to educate people about the dangers of eating processed foods.  Many people don't know these dangers and it must be made clear to them.  They need to know that many childhood ailments are caused by the foods they were introduced to at a early age that led to many ailments, such as diabetes and many other horrendous diseases caused just by the foods we eat everyday.",

Because of this, there aren't as many writers writing queer lit. By offering a competitive rate of pay for those who submit to our magazine, we can prove that it is worthwhile to write queer content, and encourage writers to submit to us. By running this kickstarter and gaining publicity and funding, we are proving there is a need, and there are people out there willing to pay for stories that represent who they are. All of this goes toward getting the writers and artists to create the work we want, and to give them an outlet to share those stories with the world. \r\n\r\nGetting it to the readers - This magazine is powered by a handful of young people with a passion for great fiction and great writing. We don't have a publishing company backing us up or a long list of connections in the writing world. What we do have is a strong social media presence, especially across tumblr, where we have all been active for years.

  "As with any project, there are risks and challenges. We all have families and jobs and lives to maintain outside of our passions. So, bringing a group of people together to make this happen has not always been easy. We've had issues with time management, under-funding, and distance related problems. Nonetheless, we have recorded, mixed, mastered and released an album within the deadline we set (that album can be downloaded for free at www.caryhays.com). The single from that album will be released on Pandora very soon. And we've already created an example #irepresentNW video.  \r\n\r\nIn an attempt to show that we are a solid group of artists with great working relationships, we created this Kickstarter Project having created something very similar on a smaller scale. Something to show that we have already come across, addressed and overcome such obstacles. \r\n\r\nBeing that we are self contained, the overhead is very low. We are paying our engineers and videographers and designers for their time. But keeping it in the family means patience and understanding. We're able to get work done without the weight of money issues. We simply need funding for the vast number of things needed to put together a project of this magnitude. Travel, securing locations to shoot, recording in an analogue realm, mastering, manufacturing, promotion, etc. We plan to complete the project we've envisioned in a timely fashion, and the amount we're seeking will be all we need to keep things moving.",

  "The Risks i am taking are very fragile. I am putting myself out there trying to become one of the best singers America has ever heard. I want to influence all types of people with my music and all ages. I want to show the world love is more than a definition it is the true meaning of life. My challenges are to get passed opsticles.",

  "1) We have never produced a full podcast: This will not be an issue because we have extensive experience in audio production and editing due to our experiences at both of our jobs.  It should take us about 1-2 weeks once we have the studio set up to produce a high grade podcast show.  \r\n\r\n2) Purchasing the equipment: We have done extensive research on the equipment that we will need in order to produce a professional level show.  So this was a challenge, but if/when we get funded, we know exactly what to purchase, and how to set it up.\r\n\r\n3) The final and biggest challenge we have to deal with is gaining sponsorship.  This has more to do with the longevity of the show.  The $7,500 that we need to start will sustain the show for a solid year.  But in order to keep this wonderful thing going, we will need sponsorship.  We have a couple of local companies and restaurants on the hook for paid sponsorship, but they want to see our studio and product before they sponsor the show.  But if that happens, then long live the \"Sunday Before Monday Podcast\".  Hooray!!",
  "Obviously, with any project, there may be challenges involved especially when you're self-employed but I will update you every step of the way!\n\nI have already found a printer I am hoping to use to create the journal, any issues with this I will obviously let you know about ASAP.",
  "Because the Mini Alley is handmade, it is challenging to have mass production like other typical products. We have made and sold over 4000 units worldwide with other MiniAlley designs. Therefore we are experienced and have a reliable manufacturing plan and process that can handle unexpected problems. During the first campaign, the pandemic forced our main workshop to shut down for several months and caused up to 2 months delay in our delivery schedule. However, we were able to make necessary changes and worked diligently to get back to schedule quickly. In the end, we actually started shipping early for many backers.  For our second campaign, we completed and shipped everything on time without any delay. Any issues or concerns from backers were addressed within 24hr.  The trust of our great community is reflected in the many positive reviews we've received on previous products and campaigns.",
  "While it is exciting to bring new plays to life on stage, it is always a big risk to small theatre companies. This is especially true when the play isn\u2019t something easily recognizable to mainstream audiences or an adaptation of a well-known intellectual property. However, our playwright Maggie and director Amy are long-time collaborators who have gained a dedicated theatrical fan base in Seattle over the last 5 years. In addition, Macha Theatre Works has a proven track record of producing successful new plays, and has gathered a passionate, talented group of actors, designers, and staff for this project. We are committed not only to making the best art that we can, but also making it the best experience possible for everyone involved, from the start of rehearsal to the last curtain call. Theatre is only as strong as the team behind it, both on and off stage; we know we are strong and can overcome any risk that might arise along the way.",
  "To mount this production at Park Theatre is a huge venture, and pushes my company to its limits. The overall budget required just to cover essential costs, such as venue costs, marketing, and fees for the actors and creatives involved, is \u00a350,000 ($65,500). Ticket sales have been calculated to cover 40% of our expenses. We already have raised 30% of this sum from sponsors and supporters, and will cover 10% out of our own savings. \n\nTo cover the remaining sum, we need more people to get behind this project! The money raised through this campaign will be used for set, costumes and props, to ensure a high-quality production.",
  "We have successfully completed and fulfilled three Kickstarters as a team and have learned a lot from them. One thing we have made sure before running this Kickstarter is that our book was ready to be sent to print before it even began. Our digital rewards outside of the book are also ready, and we have secured an amazing third-party fulfillment service to help us send out books.",
  "Filmmaking is inherently unpredictable. There are risks and challenges at every stage of process that could affect things like the timing of the release and the dates that rewards get delivered. But we've built a team (and have loads of crystals for good energy) that is ready to meet any challenges head on and we're confident we'll produce a film you'll love. That being said, anything can happen so please understand the risks before you make a contribution.",

We do not foresee any significant challenges ahead, at least not any so significant that they are going to cause a delay in our timeline. As long as we hit our fundraising goal, we will continue through the development process until we get DotComCrowd online.\n \nOf course, if anything unforeseen does arise, and we need to push back our timeline at all, we will keep you updated. As a contributor to this campaign, you are a part of the DotComCrowd movement. We will send you regular updates about all of the progress that we are making, letting you know of the work that we do and any important milestones that we reach.",
  "We have had to resubmit our Arts Council application for funds towards this show; if they turn us down a second and final time we will be very short of funds indeed. We have drawn up an emergency budget to deal with this eventuality - which will still make sure people get paid - but it will be tighter than we would like. \n\nOf course the London theatre market is hugely competitive, but we have honed Lipstick through two rounds of Arts Council funded workshops. We are confident it is a strong and timely piece of work, and that we have the best PR and marketing team possible.",
  "With THREE successfully funded, successfully fulfilled Kickstarter campaigns under my belt (the last two of which were fulfilled months ahead of schedule) this isn't my first rodeo. I've learned a ton about potential pitfalls, unforeseen expenses, and other assorted disasters that can cripple a crowdfunded product, and I'm confident I'm heading them all off at the pass! Additionally, with the exception of the cover and any stretch goal materials, the art to be included in this book is done. That's right, the 130+ pages of pure comics that make up the meat of this volume are 100% in the bag. This campaign is about as low-risk as they come, but that said, life is life and there is always a slim chance of unforeseen delays, etc..",
  "I do not foresee any issues that I cannot handle. Of course problems will occur however, I am very confident that I can deliver. I am very industrious and able to automate or hire friends temporary or permanently for most production work.",
  "Though this is our first Kickstarter campaign and the first interchangeable modular headphones we design, we have plenty of experience in making audio products and operation management that we are fully aware of all the potential risks and challenges we might face. We feel like we have done all the research and preparations before launching our campaign on Kickstarter. Perhaps some unpredicted problems will still happen during the production period; however, we promise you we will be completely transparent to our process so that you are always aware of how your headphones are progressing.",
  "This is a low-risk project because the director has already invested the minimum amount of money to get this movie finished.  This crowdfunding campaign is to make the movie better than the bare-minimum budget version.  If a low amount is raised, it goes toward a few more crew members for the difficult shots.  Fund beyond that go toward renting better locations, hiring more help, getting more lenses and even a B camera.  Contributions go toward any number of production costs.  But again, the bare-minimum has been covered.\r\nThis is the first kickstarter campaign, but the sixth crowdfunder for the director.  There were five previous crowdfunding campaigns on a different site (not sure if a competitor should be named).  Each was successful and the movies were completed.",
  "Our main challenge will be filming in only 6 days. That's what you get for working with talented and in-demand folks like Austin and Joe and Freddie.\r\n\r\nThing is, these methods and characters and stories are things we grew up with, and things we have hungered after for many years now. We have been ready since the third film wrapped.",
  "Other than not reaching our funding goal, the risks and challenges are very low. We have all the films in our possession (except for the Danish Film Institute scan which will be sent following payment), so can get them scanned and worked on immediately. \r\nThere's always a chance of an unforeseen technical issue arising, but if it does, it should only delay the production a few weeks at most.\r\n\r\nI'll keep you updated regularly with progress.",
  "The funding for this video is the lowest we could come up with in order to rent the minimal supplies, take care of crew, styling, locations and other obstacles that we are not able to fund ourselves in time for the video to be shot around the 'Xtreme Battle of the Bands, Drum line and Cheerleader Showcase' on Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015 (thus the fund timing).\r\n\r\n In addition to having difficulty funding the music video, we are short on additional promotional materials to help push the single and the video to the masses. We are hoping that with what we are trying to do visually and with the song (we are working with a historical Dallas high school for this video), we are able to gain the attention of the city and propel our vision a lot further than where it is starting. Every donation and those that go over our current goal can really help for us to make history for a Dallas artist. Lets all come together to support independent music and a rising star unlike any other here. Show that your voice and efforts can change the landscape of the Dallas music scene. This is a lot bigger than just making a music video.",
  "Our biggest challenge is keeping these events free. It is our goal to create such environments, where people can/will come, be inspired, and inspire others. We would never want an artist or someone who would benefit from the art, to miss out due to admission cost. We charge nothing for our events and really would like to keep it this way. Thus, assistance in funding this (our) projects is being asked.",
  "One problem that may arise with this project is that if there will come more book orders than we predicted a second printing of the book will be needed and some backers will need to wait for more time until they will have the book in their hands. \r\nOtherwise, this is a simple project that has little to no complications.",

Mother nature can sure change your plans. We have had extremely excited guests, who have been so flexible and able to quickly reschedule our interviews thus far. We are also able to do phone interviews as well, if needed. Maintaining up-to-date technology is more important than ever for our growing radio show/station.",
  "Possible risks to this production include an outside workload that will clash with post-production duties.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, will lead to a delay in the delivery of the show and, therefore, a delay in the delivery of the rewards on offer.\r\n\r\nI have an expected (and 'hoped for') completion and delivery date of April 2019. \r\n\r\nIf any outside forces (to do with my day-job) align to conflict with this deadline for delivery, the show will be delayed and delivered within the following month of May 2019.\r\n\r\nShould the funding goal not be reached, I will still do everything in my power to complete the production and distribution of this show, regardless of the Kickstarter outcome.",
  "There are many risks and challenges involved in completing a successful campaign. While this is our first crowdfunding campaign, we feel we have done an adequate job accounting for most factors. \n\nShipping is our largest concern for two reasons, tight deadlines and international shipping. \n\nIdeally will ship the first round of pledges in time for Christmas, according to the USPS shipping deadlines (domestic shipping). This is a tight schedule, but assuming minimal delays, we are confident we can meet this deadline.\n\nInternational shipping is something we were hesitant to offer. However we realize that a significant number of potential backers would be alienated by not offering an international option. As such we have done our best to  anticipate the associated costs. However while we do our best to anticipate problems, international backers will be responsible for applicable duties or tax, as well as ensuring items are not prohibited by customs in their country.",
  "- Many pickupwinders are inventive enough to build, create their own D.I.Y. machine at home for personal use. They might find our product not worth the investment. But with an easy to use machine like this, we hope to inspire musicians who don't have the time or means to build such a machine and who will find comfort in a small, reliable machine to start exploring this beautiful hobby.\n\n- As a small company, a big intrest will mean that we won't be able to comply to all the orders immediately. This might mean that we will need to go over the estimated delivery time as we will need some time to hire some dragonhunters, install more printers and crank up production.",

  "\"What About Shipping Costs?\"\r\n\r\nWell, you may have noticed that the reward to claim a book copy is $10. That covers the cost of the book AND shipping the book out to you (if you're in the US. It will cost extra to ship it elsewhere in the world. Sorry!).\r\n\r\n\"When Will I Expect to Get the Rewards?\"\r\n\r\nThe book is formatted for printing already, so everything should be done and shipped out to you by December 2016. The goal is to get it out before the absolutely bananas span of time known as THE HOLIDAYS (specifically Christmas and Samhain).\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, there is a chance that something may go wrong at the printers (the lettering may be off, the format may not be right, a machine could break, etc). If that happens, the rewards will have to be pushed back to ship out around January 2017.",
  "One of our biggest challenges has been the downloaded music. Although a caretaker or family member can download their loved one's favorite music, we really like the idea of the player being ready to go, out of the box. So, for now, we are purchasing each song, at an approximate cost of one dollar per song, and hope that in the future, we may be able to negotiate music rights. \nI hope you will consider backing Melody Matinee and helping us bring back fond memories to those who may have trouble recalling on their own. Thank you for your support.",
  "Scheduling is a potential hurdle that we've faced in the first six episodes, yet we overcame, and we expect to do the same on the second round!

We will need to hire 6 actors for small roles i.e. flashback scene, nurse, receptionist.",
  "A lot has to be taken into consideration when making a short film. However, we feel our team\u2019s experience gives us the ability to cope with any difficulties we may face. We will always stay safe on the shoot - the utmost importance and safety measures will be taken when filming on the bus and on the road - and there will always be First Aid-trained individuals on set. We will also be working with child-actors, and the appropriate members of the production team will be DBS checked. We are so optimistic, and we hope you are too. We could make something brilliant here.",

  "MARKETING: We are a small group of theatre artists in a very busy city. We hope to dedicate a portion of our fundraising to ensuring we have a strong enough marketing push to bring an audience out to see this important play. This includes investing in physical posters, targeted audience outreach, and online marketing content. This makes up $400 of the budget.\n\nSTIPENDS: While not every independent project in the city can afford to pay their actors and designers, we at Littlebrain Theatre are committed to compensating our artists for the work they do. More than $2000 of our $5000 budget goes exclusively to stipends for the artists. If we manage to fundraise beyond our budget, all overflow will go towards increasing actor and designer wages.\n\nSIMPLE TECH: We do not currently have the resources to build massive sets or sew intricate period costumes for this play. We will be working with the resources we have to make the best possible adaptation of \"Bicycle Thieves\" we can. Your donations and support go towards helping us to hire the best designers for his project, who can work within the parameters of our simple production to create something impactful. Not to mention, each designer will receive a budget to make sure they can afford to create what they need to for the production.",
  "We have a proven track record of producing high quality, accessible theatre, with extensive experience marketing these productions to a diverse audience and managing large scale budgets.\r\n\r\nWhat's most important to us is raising the funds to pay our incredible team of actors and creatives, and the only risk is that we might fall short.\r\n\r\nWe have the team, we have the theatre, we have the play.

Please feel free to PM if you have any specific questions.",
  "No project comes without risks. The art for this book is around 80% completed, and is ticking closer to completion every day. Once that's done, the primary risk lies with the printer. Thankfully, I have used Comic Printing UK for every single issue release thus far, and have only had positive experiences with the company for both comic and corporate contracts.\r\n\r\nBackers will be sent regular progress updates. I will never go radio silent, and if any delays do occur in case of an emergency, I will keep all participants updated through Kickstarter, the Curia Regis website and social media.\r\n\r\nAs the goal is to have the comic finished by the Autumn convention season, books should be in your hands in time for Christmas, at the latest.",
  "There really aren't too many risks. The only one I can think of is going into debt trying things, but I'm fine to wear that I guess.\r\nEventually I'd like to have a better computer and editing software, as well as a better camera, but for now I'm happy with what I've got.\r\nGotta start somewhere, and if that somewhere is the bottom, the only way to go is up!",
  "The biggest risk we're taking on this project is shooting in a method we've never done before. Although we are excited to showcase this more theatrical style through the camera lens, we are aware that things may take longer that expected and that not every line from our script might make it into the final product. In preparation for that, we will be consulting with a few Shakespeare and theater experts before the shooting date, even setting up rehearsals as if we were really putting on a play. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge is shooting on location rather than one of our own homes where we might have more control. This means that we have to be extremely wary of what we touch, where we put things, and making sure the area looks exactly as it did when we first got there. Think of it as being a guest in someone else's home, but having a group of 10-15 other people with you!",

I know what it costs and what needs to be done to result in a good looking product!\r\n\r\nMy biggest challenge is to ship a lot of books, since I haven't done that before. To prevent an epic failure in sending books, I have put the physical rewards on limited amounts. I have also thoroughly tested the packing of both 1 and 2 books with the packing-material I plan to use.\r\n\r\nIf I should have severe problems with shipping out the books, I have friends and colleagues who have experience in packing and shipping.\r\n\r\nIf you order a sketch, there is a risk of getting your package a bit later than the other backers.

  "When the project is fully-funded, the challenge then becomes fulfilling all the rewards. \r\n\r\nFor the most part, I have designed my rewards to be digital, so as to avoid shipping problems. \r\n\r\nIn addition, most people will be getting the same rewards (video / director's cut) so there's not a lot to make.\r\n\r\nI am a bit nervous about portraiture, because it requires emailing back and forth, but hopefully the people who select that option are up to it!\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have NEVER made a comic with a stranger in it. So if that happens, we'll all find out how that goes...\r\n\r\nThe main reasons that my reward fulfillment will go smoothly is that my rewards are digital (they require no shipping and are not custom made) and I work from home, so I have plenty of time to devote to making everything!",
  "Luckily, since our format is relatively simple, there aren't too many production risks involved. If we plan our productions properly - which we will - there's no reason we can't shoot two videos in one day.\r\n\r\nOur largest challenge will be ensuring our videos pack in enough fact-checked information and provide our viewers with the right websites, all while being entertaining.",
  "The main risk of this project is not being able to finishing filming in an efficient manner which could lead to a project that may not reach it full potential. This could come in a number of forms, including but not limited to poor organisation, unavoidable reductions in production quality (for example not being able to source quality set design) or simply a lack of time.\r\n\r\nGiven that I and everyone on board the project are still young filmmakers as well as full-time students, managing a project of this size will be difficult and presents many challenges. However, given that we are all so passionate about the project, we hope we can overcome these obstacles through planning, organisation and above all determination to create something that we can be truly proud of!",
  "If for any reason our project is not funded, we will be establishing an online store at www.thetinlunchbox.com on a pre-order basis only; the store will be set up based on the feedback we get from this campaign. \r\n\r\nPrinted copies will be delivered as soon as they are received back from the printer (this is wholly dependent upon the project being funded).",

  "Although we are originally from the Dallas/Forth Worth area, we both relocated to New York City in the early 2000s to work in the theater world.  We are so happy to be back home, but a huge challenge to producing Lilies is that we don't have the vast network of connections that we did in NYC or a built-in support structure. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, we both have years of management, marketing, and audience-relation skills.  We are confident that we have what it takes to make this a show to remember and draw in the crowds.",

  "Wir setzen alles daran, dass wir den M2 termingerecht ausliefern k\u00f6nnen. Unsere Lieferanten sind bereit und sollten alle Komponenten rechtzeitig liefern k\u00f6nnen. Die gr\u00f6sste Herausforderung wird die \u00dcbergabe der Produktion an die entsprechende Sozialinstitution sein. Gerne h\u00e4tten wir diesen Teil besser vorbereitet. Doch dazu fehlten uns die finanziellen Ressourcen. Aus diesem Grund werden wir die ersten Lautsprecher wohl auch nicht komplett extern fertigen lassen k\u00f6nnen.\r\nWir leben f\u00fcr unseren Traum. Damit dieser Traum Realit\u00e4t wird, haben wir bewusst darauf verzichtet, externe Investoren f\u00fcr Euphony zu gewinnen. Wir m\u00f6chten unabh\u00e4ngig bleiben und frei \u00fcber Gesch\u00e4ftsstrategien, Gewinnmargen etc. entscheiden. Um finanziell \u00fcber die Runden zu kommen, m\u00fcssen wir neben Euphony einen \"normalen\" Job aus\u00fcben. Aus diesem Grund werden wir nicht von Beginn an einen professionellen Support-Dienst anbieten k\u00f6nnen. Konkret bedeutet das, dass wir manchmal telefonisch nicht erreichbar sein werden und die Beantwortung von Mails nicht immer am selben Tag erfolgt.\r\n\r\nWe do everything we can to deliver the M2 in time. Our suppliers are ready and should be able to deliver all components as soon as ordered. The biggest challenge will be the transfer of production to the appropriate social institution. We would like to have prepared this part better, but we lacked the financial resources. For this reason, we will probably not be able to produce the first speaker completely externally.\r\nWe live for our dream. To make this dream a reality, we have deliberately refrained from winning external investors for Euphony. We want to remain independent and decide freely on business strategies, profit margins, etc. In order to make ends meet financially, we have to work in a \"normal\" job as well. For this reason, we will not be able to offer a professional support service right from start. This means that we will not always be reachable over the phone right away, and won't be able to answer every mail on the exact same day.",
  "In an effort to minimize risks, we have spoken with all suppliers to learn the stock of components, manufacturing times and times of shipments etc.\r\nEven so, we are not completely safe from possible inconveniences but in the case of this happening we will report to our sponsors and we will not stop until we solve it.",
  "The risks and challenges that Murel faces are very manageable. We already have a working prototype that is functioning exactly the way we want it to. We are aware that there are always shipping challenges to international backers which may be a challenge. Also, we are aware of and have experienced the challenges of shipping, customer service, and replacements. We plan to increase our shipping and customer service capacity by hiring out help for these two potential bottlenecks. But we plan to address each of these by a case by case scenario. Finally, there are quality control issues that may arise. We plan to personally do a quality control check of the shipment before it leaves China. We are confident that we can overcome any challenges that come our way.",
  "Risks and challenges\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge for a hardware crowdfunding campaign is managing overhead cost and manufacturing timeline. We have been in mass production of previous 2 Kickstarted products (M4 and Accessport), as well as several other products outside of crowdfunding campaign.\r\n\r\nWe have the right resources and team in place to bring this project into final mass production once enough fund is collected to open tooling and and gather raw material.\r\n\r\nWe have invested heavily into development, prototyping and preparing for the Kickstarter campaign. This means our biggest risk is not meeting funding goal for this project, which will mean a big financial loss as well as the timing into the market.",
  "There are risks in everything we do in life, but I\u2019ve done my darnedest to minimize them for this project. I\u2019ve been putting the book together as each monthly batch of comics is created, so the book will be ready to go to print by the time this campaign concludes. There\u2019s always a chance the books could get delayed in transit somewhere, but I\u2019ve left some wiggle room in the estimated ship dates. If everything goes according to plan, everyone will get their books sooner than anticipated! How rad would that be?! That\u2019s right! Pretty dang rad!",

I need no permission from anyone. I own this. I expect no delays to issuing all rewards. I have already completed one third of the work. Fifty percent of the daily prayers are already in the database. Plus I use them every day and so if there are modifications I make them on the fly. So you will receive your reward.",

  "Project risks include assisting backers from different countries find where to source organic ingredients and unleavened bread, for example as I am unfamiliar with overseas grocery shopping.  This risk could be overcome by providing general pointers and guidelines towards finding organic grocers, avoiding chain store bakeries and the like.\r\n\r\nProject challenges include setting up a website that links to the email and setting up a group email address from Gmail.  These challenges are in the process of being resolved.\r\n\r\nFurther challenges involve tapping into my inspiration and creativity to give each dish that special something.  This will take some thought, research and drawing on themes from family meals that have been passed down to me.",
  "A successful Kickstarter campaign will allow us to take advantage of bulk printing discounts and provide an easy to read and use tool that will help  people transition to a gluten-free diet in a healthy, economical, and tasty way. \r\n\r\nOur first cookbook \"Transitioning to a Gluten-Free Lifestyle with Healthy & Easy Recipes\" provides information on how to get the process started including tips on identifying gluten, kitchen set up, and shopping. \r\n\r\n\"Summer Recipes\" provides a wide variety of recipes to take advantage of summer fun and provides tips and techniques for avoiding cross-contamination during summertime events. \r\n\r\nWe were astounded at how expensive wedding and special event gluten-free cakes are (and how much sugar is used!) and knew we could do better. \"Wedding Cakes\" will show you how to create fabulously beautiful and tasty cakes with lower sugar cake frosting, and cakes at a fraction of the normal costs. We show you pictures of the cakes we created and take you step by step through the process including tips for decorating, staging, and serving!\r\n\r\n\"Let's Party\" will help you host parties or bring food to parties that is gluten-free, nutritious, and inexpensive.

There are projects that are easy enough to involve your younger kids with and healthy foods (cleverly disguised as a lot of fun) that will help kids make the transition to a healthier lifestyle. \r\n\r\nThe sample cookbooks have already been created and only minor changes are needed (like adding ISBN numbers) to make them print ready. If we are not successful, we will work harder to improve our campaign and continue to produce new titles to help both kids and adults through the process. We are on a mission to help our families, our friends, and others who have been dramatically, and tragically, impacted by gluten make this critical transition. We need your help to help others.",
  "Countless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the prototypes have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors, I will green-light production right away without waiting until the project closes. I\u2019m using a workshop that has produced countless insulated bottles for many years. So technical problems are unlikely. If you have supported my previous Kickstarter projects, you know I always come through. Frequently, I complete my projects ahead of schedule.

  "I have  incurred many risks and challenges being a salon owner for 20 yrs, in management 10 yrs prior to opening salon in 1994.When I started my salon in 1994 i could not get any credit because of a previous bad business deal from a former employer when the bank repossessed the building and all her assets in Dec 1992 (including the equipment i was supposed to purchase) . My husband also got laid off 3 months prior.We almost lost everything with both of us being unemployed for 14 months. So with no credit or investors ,I started with pure sweat equity & first and last rent. I know hard work & I learned perseverance as well as patience.I have had to balance between running a business , taking care of my mom who was sick with cancer , and my family; in which i also have an autistic daughter.We also had a fire and lost everything (it all worked out).These are my qualifications and they come from life experiences. So in other words I don't quit.  i will keep persevering until i succeed at getting my music played..the hardest will be getting my music on yahoo & aol.I already have some one to help with advertising etc. I am aware the internet has slow times just like the hair business.That is why i want to build my audience to keep my stats up.

  "The main challenge will be to get a print that will meet the quality criteria. When designing something on the computer you won't necessarily have the color represented in the same way when you print it, even if you use a high quality printing technique. \r\nIn order to solve this, I will go through the desired iterations until the quality of the print is to my and hopefully your satisfaction. \r\nThere could be some issues with delivering the print to you in time, based on the number of iterations the design process has to go through.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this, I will make sure to speed up the logistical process of delivery in order to make up for any lost time due to the design process.

  "Our product is still at the prototype stage, thus, to transition from prototype to finished product will pose as a challenge to our team. While the functionalities work well as a prototype, we want to continue improving our product to be more sturdy and function well as a finished product to deliver the greatest value to our backers. We have done several tests on our products to ensure that they work well consistently, and continue to execute more tests to improve the product. We are also continuing work on the prototype to develop newer and better versions of PAU.\r\n\r\nManufacturing is one of the largest challenges for our product. Every product faces significant difficulties when transitioning from the prototype to the product stage, and ours is no different. In order to mitigate the risk of this transition, our team carefully screened potential partners.\r\nIn October, we went to Shenzhen to visit hardware manufacturers. We were able to find a manufacturer who was able to manufacture and assemble both the shell and the PCB together, and had successfully manufactured for Kickstarter products before, so will be able to help us fulfill our goals.",

We are not dependant of third parties, this watch collection follows same product life cycle as any other new models from other brands within our group. We plan to start our delivery process in Jun 2021. While we are fully confident in our campaign goals, there may be some unexpected issues in our production and shipping process beyond our control. If unexpected things happen, the MERKUR team promises to keep all our backers updated and informed and handle the concerns with care. We will work closely with the logistics company in advance to make sure the process goes smoothly. Please be aware that there may be extra customs fees due to the policy of different countries. Backers will be responsible for customs fees, duties, VAT, import taxes, etc. administered by your government. They are excluded from the shipping fees. Normally, you won't be charged import duty taxes. However, given many different regulations in different countries, We can't guarantee that 100%.

  "CHALLENGES.\r\n\r\nThe issue #1: PLANNING\r\nWhen you talk to us about the play, you will hear excitement, joy, wonder, and... that it's tiring. We are working on this because it's a labour of love. We love it and many of us work on the play in our spare time and in between hours to fundraise, promote, write, create, plan and produce.\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nWe endeavour to work to a clear production schedule which maps out not only what needs to be done, but also how to mitigate risks, move times lines and help juggle the opposing time schedules of Philip and Avni! \r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue #2: A LARGE CAST\r\nWe envisage challenges on the way; preparing the actors, managing schedules, rehearsal spaces, cast expectations, as well as using the opportunity to support them to develop professionally. Importantly, we want to pay them fairly.\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nWe love our actors and they bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to their roles. They are well versed in Eastern European literature, or have personal connections to the themes. From this foundation of respect, we will endeavour to work with them to manage expectations, provide concrete and manageable schedules to work with, respond to feedback and offer them support. This kickstarter is a perfect opportunity to start this journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue #3: We\u2019re doing this for the FIRST TIME!\r\nPhilip and Avni are working towards their debuts in directing and producing, respectively, as well as bringing the play to the UK stage for the first time!\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nBoth Philip and Avni have trusted mentors who are experts in the field. They are working closely with them to identify potential issues, work through problems and offer guidance along the way. They have also spent over a year researching the play, it\u2019s ideas and the writer \u2013 speaking with academics, technicians, producers, psychologists and engaging the polish community. It is through these meticulously built and strong foundations that the play has a platform from which to succeed. \r\n\r\n \r\nTHE RISKS\r\n \r\nThe issue #1: SMELL DESIGN\r\nUsing scents as part of the performance is ambitious, and we want to get it right. It runs the risk of being tokenistic.\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nWe work closely with Harry and Sarah from 4160 Tuesdays perfume who are experts and have a lot of experience in this area. With Avni\u2019s work at festivals and in performances using scent, there is a practical and creative vision which emerges. It will be tested in rehearsals to ensure it works and enhances the play. We will ensure Harry and Sarah are present to advise and inform throughout.\r\n \r\nWe would also like to test the innovation of using scent to get into character for the actors - a unique way of preparing actors for the performance.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe issue #2 : NOT REACHING THE GOAL\r\nThis goal is one generous step in a long journey.\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nWe believe in equality, fairness and collaboration. If we reach the goal we can start the journey as we mean to go on, and do this performance justice, not only for it being a seminal piece of literature, but as a positive marker for women and help open conversations about equality in all of it\u2019s forms. \r\n\r\n \r\nAny donations that meet (or even exceed) our goal, will be incredibly appreciated.\r\n \r\nThanks again everyone and happy fundraising!",

  "This will be the first time that Concrete Temple has created a play in which all the characters are puppets. The challenge is to bring to life interesting, engaging puppet characters without relying on actors on stage. \r\n\r\nCreating just the right characters and puppets is always a challenge and will take considerable trial and error. First thoughts about the appropriate materials, sizes and range of movement needed may not be the most effective choices. The processes of experimentation of form and function and the workshop collaboration take time, space and materials - the challenge is having enough of each.",
  "The art for the webcomic pages is complete and already set up in printer-ready files.\r\n\r\nFulfillment is always a challenge for me, so I've factored in the cost of having the the printer do fulfillment of books and bookplates.\r\n\r\nFor books with hand-drawn art, I've factored in having a certain number of books expedited and shipped early so that there'll be extra time to work on art.",

In the end, we will have; a high quality and professionally mixed EP, a video of one of your favorite Theresa Payne songs, and we also walk away owning all of the material.  This includes audio, video footage and session data. Any extra funds that we raise over the $1500 goal will assist us with costs associated with marketing, promotion, and packaging.\r\n\r\nThe particular challenge that comes to mind is simply that we will be unable to afford the opportunity to record this EP.  With the help of our social media networks, and the relationships built around our city, The Theresa Payne Band, and myself are more than qualified to overcome this $1500 challenge. This is also what makes the risk worth taking.",
  "FYI - this campaign is all or nothing so I don't receive anything until I've reached my goal. When you donate, the funds will not come directly out of your account, only if I reach my goal. \r\n\r\nThe challenge?: Pushing back the album release date (right now an early December release), and not having the opportunity to fully promote it the best way possible, with an awesome PR team.",

The biggest challenge we foresee moving forward is  lack of funds raised!\r\n\r\nAs you might know, with Kickstarter, if we don't raise all of our goal, we don't receive any funds (funds pledged are returned to donors) . If this happens (and we really don't think it will), we will have to readjust our timeframe and end goal.\r\n\r\nWe've also been careful to make sure that we are able to fulfill our rewards.",

This is something that has been looked at and mitigated as much as possible.",
  "I have the earphones on stock and every order that is sent will have a tracking number using DHL. The charger cables are also on stock. Any orders after stock is sold out will be back ordered and will be delivered within 10-15 working days note this does not include shipping time but a tracking number will be available through DHL.\r\n\r\nDepending on how much orders we get will determine the delivery time. which will be between 7-21 days.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to put Hussi earphones and charger cables in the hands of retail surf,skate and adventure stores. I first need to get some sales behind the brand and money in order to invest in marketing and advertising. The next step will be to go wireless and produce more adventure products.",

  "I've already received an estimate and timeline from the Bar Dog website creators, and they'll start working on the site once the Kickstarter is successfully funded. It will probably take a few months to complete, as they have multiple projects going on, and we'll more than likely go through a few rounds of revisions. Ideally, I'd like to see the site up by the end of January and of course, I will keep all Bar Dog supporters informed of the project's progress along the way.\r\n\r\nRegarding the rewards, I've created and professionally printed a few independent comic books, and I illustrated and designed an award-winning children's book. I've already received quotes from two printers for the Bar Dog project\u2014the first will be creating the comic books, stickers and posters and the second will be printing the t-shirts. Also, in my years of working on the creative side of advertising, I've shepherded hundreds of projects from original concept to final development. In producing the Bar Dog rewards, I'll not only be creating many of them myself, but I'll also be supervising the production of all Bar Dog products, from t-shirts to coasters, to ensure that anything bearing the Bar Dog name is of the highest possible quality and, most importantly, delivered on time.",
  "I've done a lot of research and have contacted several publishing companies. There is one company in particular that is really interested (actually waiting on me) to produce the book. The only obstacle that I can foresee is getting the publishing done in a timely manner. My goal is to have the book in the hands of my supporters by Valentine's Day. \r\n\r\nThis has been a year and a half in the making. Yes, it is a lifestyle change. This project is something that I believe in, something I live and will live for the rest of my life.  Most of the legwork has been done. I have recipes in mind... It's just a matter of putting it all together!",
  "We are working thoroughly and promptly to ensure the R+D tour of 'The Edinburgh Test' reaches as many people as possible. We are doing this by working closely with family networks and services local to each area we visit to spread the word and ensure the success of these sharings and feedback sessions. \r\nWe will be taking on board all audience feedback from this Research and Development period and will continue to rework and develop the production, finding the best way to present this story to audiences, ready for our London run of the production next Spring.",
  "Some delays may occur if the financial obligations are not met by the February 2015 deadline. Time is of the essence in the music business so it is imperative to get community support to help fund the project",
  "The biggest challenge I have to face is traveling to Europe alone as a 22 year old. I will also have to make sure that the places I wish to visit are accessible for me to visit, including language. For that, I intend on learning some German. For the Netherlands and France, I am semi-fluent in French-Canadian.",
  "This project will be a continuation of the 2015 fantasy podcast",
  "Funding only covers fees. But the guest and panel are key to keeping the show fresh and worth listening to. But with each new week comes new content to talk about. With hard work, The Jason Echolls Podcast will continue to be the great show that it is today!",
  "With over 25 years of experience in electronics manufacturing (Mathias was a leading manufacturer of PC diagnostic hardware in Europe) we have many contacts in the business. The obstacles of manufacturing high quality electronic devices within the intended timeframe are well known to us. As we're relying on several local manufacturing sites, we don\u2019t have the timing or quality issues you will face when manufacturing in Asia. Our preamp will be thoroughly \u201dmade in Germany\u201d. Unexpected component shortages may result in a delay in the production schedule. In order to prevent this, our component selection strategy has always considered acquiring the components from multiple sources.\r\n\r\nThe development of the iOS app is nearly finished and at the end of the beta testing phase. The programming of the Android app is currently in progress.\r\n\r\nThe first stage of manufacturing the poets One is the acquisition of components, which will run simultaneously with the making of PCBs and the 3D-printing respectively injection molding of housings. The second phase includes electronic manufacturing, followed by assembly and testing. Shipment will start four months after the campaign\u2019s end.",
  "There should not be any risks or challenges for the campaign, but we will be transparent to our lovely backers if there is anything that happened.",
  "Most of the work is done upfront. So in fact there is no real risk.",
  "Deadlines are tight, and the unforeseen can always happen when you're shipping large quantities of goods overseas.\r\n\r\nThat said, we've been making these books for over a decade, and there's nothing short of nuclear devastation that we can't handle.",
  "I don't anticipate a September 2016 release date being a challenge. While I can't work on the book during the fall semester, if funded, I will be working full time on Multiplex (including the regular updates) for the rest of the summer and after completing my MFA in December. My timeline on the first Kickstarter project was a bit too optimistic, and I ended up going over budget as a result; I've made every effort to make this timeline more conservative.\r\n\r\nThere is one likely wrinkle next summer (my fianc\u00e9e and I making an interstate move next summer) but this has already been factored into the timeline. If it ends up not happening (I\u2019ll know in the next six months or so), the books may be able to ship early.\r\n\r\nThe biggest risk is not making our goal!",
  "Creating a free non subscription based cookbook that`s updated daily takes a lot of time, and is slowly starting to cost more and more, especially with the upgrades that i want to add to the bare bones website that is already established. The way i am going to deal with these issues is by crowd fund raising ( hello all :D ) these funds will enable me to open a small e-store , as well as to experiment with new recipes, and fix some broken equipment.",
  "We've made progress! To date, we have held dozens of interviews; transcribed and translated more than 20 interviews; Shot photos for half of the featured recipes; and completed the book layout and design. We have compiled logic models, assumptions, key strategies and metrics.\r\n\r\nOur book team of 11 talented and committed individuals are ready to move full speed ahead. However, with the holidays approaching there is a risk that our print schedule may slip into the summer of 2015.",
  "I am projecting to have this book published by February.  The timeline is 60 -90 days from the time I submit it to being printed.  I am 3/4 of the way done writing this book.  My potential obstacle would be if I should make this 2 books or one.  I want it to be budget friendly so that anyone who wants better communication between food and their health can obtain it.  \r\nYou will have the cooking sessions before the book due to timing for the publishing.",
  "There may be few delays in the production or editing process but majority is mostly under my control.",
  "Being that I am still in school balancing class schedules and studying, with studio time will be a challenge; but one that I can no doubt overcome through good time management and my passion for this project.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to get your rewards to you before December, but I am allowing some wiggle room just in case I run into problems.\r\n\r\nAll I need now is your support. Please let me reward your backing. Thanks for all of your support.",
  "Risks being when the pins can be made as Chinese new year falls at the end of my dates, which unfortunately slows down factory production. I will however do my best to keep to a good timeline and communicate with everyone what's going on at all times.",
  "Horizonphotographyaus@gmail.com",
  "It's not really risky at all.\r\n\r\nNew moon on Iceland is on 10 January.\r\n\r\nMaybe a few rainy days..",
  "Weather...here in Newfoundland the weather can very unpredictable. Especially during the winter months. So this could slow down updates of new photos.\r\n\r\nA photographer cannot work without a camera. So if I am unable to acquire the funds to purchase a camera, I am unable to work.",
  "As mentioned embarking on this campaign is a high risk as it would involve entering the suburbs or undeveloped locations which may house wild animals, reptiles or even wild insects.\r\n\r\nNatural climates also pose a risk to the output quality of the image and I would have to make a return trip to the same location on a clear weather. Please note that I do not photoshop clouds etcs to my work as it will ruin the originality of nature's creation.\r\n\r\nOther risk involved which may be beyond my control would be the production time for the calendar. However having work together with my print partner has deemed that they are more than capable of fulfilling the order on time.",
  "Running a restaurant means long hours and hard work, the challenges will be numerous.\r\n\r\nI have run a successful, busy kitchen before and have been self-employed for practically my whole working life. I am confident and more determined than ever to make this work (with a little help).",
  "Risk:\r\nAs with any new business adventure, there are risks.  Most risk can be calculated and procedures put into place to overcome those risk.  In the Vermicomposting community, the risk is always the same.  \"Consistency\".  Finding the right combination of soil composition and bedding to grow worms successfully then maintaining that standard.  Other factors are what the worms are fed and how often. Most or all of the large Commercial Vermicomposters feed straight \"Composted Cow Manure\".  We don't!  Moisture content, temperature and PH are other important factors.  Throughout the last year, we have perfected a system that have our worms maturing sexually in 8-10 weeks instead of the normal 10-12 week time frame.  Once mature they start to produce 2-3 eggs a week and each egg casing on average is producing 2-3 healthy juveniles.  The fact that we started with 1000 worms and even lost half of that batch due to inexperience in the first 3 months then came back strong is testament to our commitment to being the best in the field.  We don't give up.\r\n\r\nUnexpected Obstacles:\r\nWe\u2019ve worked out all the kinks that one usually encounters while farming worms.  Not sure of what could or would be unexpected seeing as we\u2019ve encountered most if not all the obstacles one expects in this industry. \r\n\r\nNo pending projects.\r\n\r\nMost of what we encountered in the beginning was typical of what others in the industry have gone through.  We were able to confer with other successful wormers.  However, experience is still the best teacher.  This last year has been a learning experience.  Additionally, we were not afraid to try new things based on what we were learning about what makes a good earth worm.  We have had great success and will be keeping many of these new techniques proprietary.",
  "This is my second go at trying to make THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE happen and it is not easy. I am more than qualified to making sure in creating a great 80's style horror movie. It will have some legends and things that no one has ever seen in a movie before. I want to create a movie that will go into the books as a brilliant master piece. The obstacle that I face right now is not having full funding for the movie. I am just merely asking for every horror movie fan out there to make this happen. Hey I am willing to do what it takes to make this happen. \r\n\r\nRight now due to the movie not being fully funded it makes it difficult to pay a lawyer to write up a contract for the film company to get the production staff, casting directors, art directors, lighting crews, and editors for the production. In order for this to happen you have to have a legal contract with the production company. Then also there has to be a contract with the agents and assistants that their client is pleased with what is going to be made into a movie. I feel very confident that I can make this happen and have horror fans out there love what my vision is for THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I have many challenges and I am willing to face them and work to make it happen.",
  "A film project, even a short one such as this, is a machine with so many moving parts, I can guarantee the production will run into challenges. The good news is\u2026 we love doing this. Each challenge is an opportunity to streamline the process, improve, work smarter, create, and push boundaries.  \r\n\r\nScript not working? Bring on a different writer for a new perspective. \r\nPost-Production turning into a time-hogging monster? I know excellent artists who can jump onboard. Hard drive crash? I have everything backed up at all times. Camera meets gristly demise under wheel of production truck? Call one of a dozen people that will gladly help us out. \r\n\r\nAnother perk of Kickstarter is that whatever your contribution level, you'll be kept up to date as we go, with our successes, challenges, and inevitable silly set stories.",
  "I have calculated that I can paint thirty 22\" x 60\" scarf panels per 5 day work-week. A five day schedule leaves two days for catch up and problem solving. This allows Two weeks for painting. At the end of week one the first thirty scarves can go to my seamstress for hemming. Second week, the next thirty, so as I'm painting, she is hemming. I have contracted with her before on another project and was happy with her work and delivery. Should she show any delivery problems, I have a recommended alternative for back-up. \r\n   My supplier of silk has a large and diverse inventory, in a broad spectrum of colors. The inks I use are well stocked at my local art supply store. I also have alternate sources in Los Angeles.\r\n    I have already painted prototypes of the scarves as Christmas gifts for friends and family. They were very well received. I know my painting technique and production process, which is how I calculated my production capacity.\r\n    I think the Artisan Festival is a good venue to launch the line and assess the public response. Any remaining inventory from sales at the Artisan Festival can be offered on an Etsy store and through local specialty boutique shops and art galleries. Market research shows hand painted silk scarves sell  between $45 upward to $80+ each. I intend to offer at a retail price of $80.\r\n  My studio is in my home, and has sufficient space for the production of this initial venture.",
  "This is a low risk project. The main challenge will be to make sure the individual works, which are heavier than the average panels and occasionally have fragile  additions, are crated and shipped with care.",
  "I've found that the most difficult thing in becoming a financially successful artist is acquiring the right following.  A gallery can be useful for it's mailing list, but there have to be enough art collectors, designers, and other clients interested in my work to provide enough income to live and have a full-time studio practice.  In New York there are many gallery's that can provide this for but can charge the me anywhere from 40-75% on the sale price of the artwork.  In London it is common for an emerging artist to rent a space for an exhibition but will not necessarily receive promotional help from the gallery.  I have chosen to have my first solo exhibition in The Annexe of The Brick Lane Gallery.  The space is for rent, but also gives me access to their extensive mailing list.  Hopefully, with both of our promotional efforts, this exhibition will produce a crowd capable of propelling my career and producing opportunities I wouldn't otherwise have.  Luckily, I have many friends in the art world who can help me with this DIY approach and with your help, can use this well located space and their resources to put together a very professional, well-represented exhibition.",
  "We have run many Kickstarters before, on this account and on our kawaii+fandom pin account The Grumpy Unicorn. We also sell pins at https://thegrumpyunicorn.co and are experienced at manufacturing them.\n\nThe main risk we run is that there is a problem with manufacturing the pins, such as an error in the mold. This would lead to a couple weeks delay for fulfillment. If any of these problems show up, you will, of course, be the first to know!",
  "We guarantee the quality of each belt we make and we are confident in meeting the deadlines if this fundraising is successful, as all our craftsmen are experienced in both techniques and time management. We will produce and deliver the belts strictly according to our timeline. The success of the campaign will enable us to fulfil all rewards and expand our business by introducing more products.\nWe will keep you updated throughout the duration of our campaign.",
  "As with all projects, there are some risks and challenges that might be faced in post production. This will not affect which awards will be sent out but may push back the estimated time you will receive them. For example, cd replication or t-shirt production may experience complications that would push back the release date and/or when you receive the rewards in the mail. If there are any delays with the rewards, you will be notified. You will all receive the rewards you were promised, and I will graciously mail them out to you as soon as I can.\r\n\r\nLoveGoodMusic - For those of you who are subscribers of LoveGoodMusic, know that you will be receiving the album from LGM in addition to rewards you qualify for after your Kickstarter donation.  On behalf of all previous and future artists to be featured on LGM, thank you so much for your support and patronage."
