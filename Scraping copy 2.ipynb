      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Briiv uses 100% renewable and natural materials to filter the air in your home or office environment, creating clean, safe air so you can breathe, as nature intended.\n",
      "Good air quality means better sleep, higher energy levels and improved cognitive function.\n",
      "Air pollution is linked to an increased risk of respiratory conditions, including asthma and even lung cancer. Briiv works to remove pollutants from your home to help you live, work and breathe -healthier, happier and safer lives\n",
      "Pollutants don’t just come from traffic and factories. Tiny particles and harmful gases are released into your home every time you cook, light candles, use cleaning products and even play with your pets. Briiv helps to remove these so you can enjoy life to its fullest.\n",
      "We have taken nature and given it a boost, Briiv is as powerful as 3,043 medium size houseplants. So you can enjoy the benefits of having plants in your home without the hassle.    \n",
      "15,000,000 air filters were purchased in 2019 and the filter needs to be replaced every 6-8 months.\n",
      "There is a better way. Briiv is an innovative, natural product designed to be just as effective at cleaning the air you breathe, without the environmental impact.\n",
      " Using four fully biodegradable filters, Briiv uses the natural micro-structures of moss, coconut, carbon and wool to filter air, the way nature intended. These filters can all are plastic free and degrade in a matter of months into harmless soil.\n",
      "Briiv blends beautifully into your interior and sits perfectly alongside plants or displayed as a centrepiece.  \n",
      "Inspired by the British countryside, Briiv uses natural colours, textures and materials to connect you with nature, whilst hidden within, a wealth of features works hard to keep your air clean: \n",
      "Protect cognitive function with better airflow and fewer toxins \n",
      "There is growing evidence that air pollutants are having noticeable detrimental effects on brain function, as demonstrated in a study by the Beijing Normal University in 2018;  'The impact of exposure to air pollution on cognitive performance' \n",
      "Optional integration for Alexa and Google Assistant if you'd like to integrate Briiv into your smart home.\n",
      "With one simple setup, Briiv is zero maintenance – no watering required.\n",
      "The most sustainable filter on the planet end to end. When you’re done with the filter it can be thrown in the garden or compost to become part of the earth again.\n",
      "Designed to improve your environment, Briiv is functional and looks great anywhere, bringing natural style to your home or office. \n",
      "Briiv has a smart, simple app, so you can set timers and turn Briiv off remotely. Briiv is  a smart device for a modern home and is compatible with IOS and Android devices.\n",
      " An intelligent app that tracks your filter usage as it runs, so you don't have to estimate or worry about when it’s time to change it. \n",
      "We have been featured and supported by a number of bloggers, designers.  \n",
      "Nature gives us everything we need to filter the air we breathe. \n",
      " Moss - Natural dried moss captures large particulate matter like dust and animal dander from the air. \n",
      "Coconut -  The humble coconut provides us with a bounty of uses and its husk traps harmful substances from the air. \n",
      "Carbon - Activated charcoal pulls odours from the air, so Briiv not only cleans the air, it smell better too.\n",
      "Sheep -  Briiv’s secret weapon. Developed to be used by NASA as air filters in the orion capsule, this wool filter is as effective as a plastic HEPA filter but its 100% biodegradable. \n",
      "Our wool is sourced from New Zealand, from an amazing breed of sheep called Astino. They are very well cared for and all of our farmers practice safe and humane shearing to keep the sheep happy and healthy.\n",
      "Briiv wool filters have been scientifically tested by Nelson Labs in the USA, using the following tests:\n",
      "Particle Filtration Efficiency - Results: Filter captured 99.85% of 0.1um latex particles.\n",
      "Bacterial Filtration Efficiency - Results: Filter removed 99.99902% of the bacteria.\n",
      "Cytotoxicity - Results: Test gave a pass.\n",
      "Full test reports can be found here.\n",
      "The manufacturers of the wool have also put together a video using a test rig showing the effectiveness of the wool that can be viewed on Vimeo here.\n",
      "For even more test details we've also included a full description of the tests and results in our Q&A. \n",
      " Briiv will effectively improve the air quality in a 36m² (387ft²) living space in just one hour.\n",
      "In total we have worked through 37 variations of this design, and the full filter was modeled and tested at every stage using the BS EN 1822-1:2019 standard as basis for testing and evaluating with sensitive air monitors.\n",
      "We also run comparative tests on existing products to provide a baseline of how these perform under these same testing conditions with a high consistent particulate input  Briiv removed 97.84% of all the particulates in one pass compared to an alternate HEPA that removes 97.92%.\n",
      "The tests were designed to push Briiv to the limits, using levels of pollutants several hundred times higher than what would be found in the home. So it can handle any environment it is placed in. \n",
      "The graphs give an indication of the filtration efficiency of set particle numbers over a 10 minutes period.\n",

      "Briiv has been designed to pack a punch, but to do so very efficiently. The bonus you get for helping the environment, is one of the most effective money-saving air filters around. \n",
      "Instead of opting for oil-based plastics, Briiv uses a new bio-plastic derived from elephant grass which is grown where agricultural crops can't be. This crop captures carbon in the process and fully biodegrades. \n",
      "This is seen as far superior to recycling as standard plastics can only be reused a few times before so they have to be put to landfill. \n",
      "Using a biodegradable material is the best option for our environment.      \n",
      "The power of the humble coconut. The fibres are from the outer husk of the nut and have been used since ancient times, reformed into a patented structure to make an environmentally friendly filter that easily returns to nature.        \n",
      "Every component of Briiv has been meticulously considered. Parts that are not biodegradable, such as the glass, can be easily recycled. This leaves only the electrical components. We hope to be able to replace these in the future with more sustainable alternatives when technology allows us to do so in a safe way.   \n",
      "Having spent many years in the design industry, we have seen hundreds of products marketed as \"sustainable\" that in reality, usually due to economic decisions, fall very short of the promises they claim. \n",
      "We were fed up with sustainability being treated as an afterthought in design. \n",
      "So our commitment is to the circular design process. Simply put, this is where products are designed with the end of the product's life in mind. This approach removes a lot of conventional material options. We decided early on that being recyclable was not good enough when it comes to plastics, as most can only be recycled a few times.  \n",
      "We prioritise biodegradability and the use of materials from natural sources above all else. This means some parts of Briiv cost us more to produce and the design process has been more complex, but also ensures we make products that do not harm the environment. \n",

In 2019 I had the chance to prepare three big exhibitions in France, under the overall name of ‘Pugna´, which means opposition, rivalry between peoples, nations, parties or groups, especially of ideological type.\n",

This book compiles all the works that were shown in these three spaces, as well as some extra that weren't exhibited. Besides pictures of the works, the book collects images of the exhibition spaces, of the installation from St. Eloi and some process pictures and sketches of some of the pieces.

Our goal was to create a story full of mystery and horror that can actually take place in a real life setting. The story is about three friends who set out on adventure to find the castle they heard about from old wives tales throughout their childhood. What they find is much more sinister than what they could have ever imagined. Kips Castle will be a mini series full of horror and mystery with occultism and other mystic teachings. We started a Kickstarter last year and it was unsuccessful. I have been speaking with different producers and was able to get a Netflix interested, however I would have to produce the first episode with my own budget. My goal in raising this  is to create a pilot episode to present to Netflix as a mini series. The castle is set in New Jersey.  The cast, crew, and myself would be filming on location at the actual Kips Castle. We would need to rent it out for at least a week. If you love horror and mystery this is the story for you.\n",

This 414-page collection features every existing page of Blake's Illuminated Books.

Every page of this book features a full-size (8\"x10\") full-colour reproduction of Willliam Blake's original engravings. Previous collections have featured reduced or low-quality versions of Blake's art. However, we have carefully assembled the best available copies of Blake's work for this unique collection.\n",

      "NAIPO’s oFlexiSpa™ is the world’s first smart steam massager, bringing the comforts of a foot spa into your home. It requires just under a cup of water and a mere 30 seconds to get up and running. In addition to its impressive use of electric rolling massagers with the soothing effects of steam, this innovative device boasts a minimalist style and elegant design to fit discreetly into any modern home decor.  \n",
      "You shouldn't ignore any foot-related conditions or try to suffer through them because they're \"only\" affecting your feet. Achiness or pain in your feet can have many causes. If pain in your feet is keeping you from exercising or simply moving around as much as you’d like, it’s time to think of your feet and get an oFlexiSpa™.\n",
      "The soothing effects of steam have been proven to improve blood circulation, eliminating fatigue and making you feel more energized. A good foot spa treatment obviously offers relief and healing from foot pain, but it also has a dynamic effect on your entire body. \n",
      "Create a more pleasant sleeping environment with oFlexiSpa™. Treat it as aromatherapy diffuser combats problems such as insomnia and headaches. Natural plant extracts like lavender and rose add another layer of relaxation to your experience.\n",
      "The oFlexiSpa’s full coverage design ensures your feet are completely surrounded by steam, creating a more immersive and effective steam spa experience.\n",
      "We certainly put our feet through a lot each day. We wear high heels, work long hours and spend down time running or playing sports. Our feet deserve a break. A pleasant foot massage can provide stress relief, relieve joint pain and eliminate foot soreness after a long day of standing. \n",
      "The oFlexiSpa’s 3D electric massage rollers offer a kneading massage to tired and aching feet, targeting acupressure points for full-body relaxation.\n",
      "Say goodbye to lugging a half gallon of water from the sink, waiting a long time and struggling with a convoluted setup. Just grab a cup of water, pour it into the water box, and you are all set. Sink into your couch and space out as you wait a mere 30 seconds for steam to build up. It won’t take long for you to feel the pleasures of a foot care treatment you’ll immediately want to add to your daily routine.  \n",
      "The oFlexiSpa™ is environmentally friendly and water-conserving. Unlike a traditional foot bath, which uses a half gallon of water, the NAIPO’s foot bath runs on less than a single cup (0.18 L / 6 o.z.). In other words, you can conserve gallons of water a month by switching to the oFlexiSpa.\n",
      "Best of all, you don’t need to carry around a heavy bucket. With the oFlexiSpa™, enjoying a foot steam massage has never been easier.\n",
      "The oFlexiSpa™ is equipped with a modern, super-efficient steam system. This system allows steam to be generated in just 30 seconds, so you can start your spa journey with little to no lead time. Once heated, the machine stays warm and comforting for up to 20 minutes.\n",
      "The ergonomically-designed electric massaging rollers of the oFlexiSpa™ provide a gentle massage to your feet to ease tension and relax your muscles. Its specially designed 3D electric rollers automatically adjust to any foot size, rotating as needed to create a deep massage that alleviates pain and helps you unwind after a long day.\n",
      "Because it generates warm steam instead of warm water, you don’t need to wipe your feet off after using oFlexiSpa™. The oFlexiSpa™ can be used on any floor surface, since it does not spill or splash.  \n",
      "The oFlexiSpa™ eliminates time-consuming cleanup. Unlike a traditional foot bath, there is no filthy pool of water to dump out when you are finished.\n",
      "The oFlexiSpa™ accommodates different foot sizes so that everyone in the family can enjoy its benefits. It’s designed to treat feet up to US size-13 (Approx. 31 cm).\n",
      "With an intuitive timer and temperature controls on a smart touch panel, getting started is easy. Turn the electric rollers on or off at any time with the touch of a button. The temperature is also customizable, with 3 levels of thermal control.\n",
      "The two indicator lights tell you if the water is low or overfull.\n",
      "Cleaning your oFlexiSpa™ is a cinch. The lid and massaging rollers both detach, so you can easily clean them at your convenience.\n",

Because of that, we’ve made sure to account for some amount of craziness or unforeseen problems that may occur in our schedule. If something does go wrong, we promise to keep our backers updated and informed about any issues and about the way in which we are solving them.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Hi!\n",
      "Five years ago, we launched our first keyboard, the Model 01, on Kickstarter. Since then, we've shipped thousands and thousands of keyboards. We couldn't have done it without you. Thank you!\n",
      "We’re thrilled to be back on Kickstarter to launch our second keyboard, the Keyboardio Atreus.\n",
      "This project is a collaboration between Keyboardio and Phil Hagelberg. Phil designed the first Atreus in 2014 because he needed a go-anywhere ergonomic keyboard. We fell in love with his design as soon as we saw it—we hand-built our first Atreus in the summer of 2014, even before we launched the Model 01. \n",
      "Last summer, we started talking with Phil about collaborating to produce a new, professionally manufactured, version of the Atreus.  \n",
      "Fast forward a few months.\n",
      "The design is done. We’ve passed FCC and CE certification. Our factory has already built and tested the pilot run.\n",
      "We’re ready for mass production. The only thing we still need is you. So please back our campaign to help make our new keyboard a reality.\n",
      "We can’t wait to get the Keyboardio Atreus into your hands.\n",
      "Until you see an Atreus in person, it's hard to comprehend just how compact it is. But don't let that tiny package fool you. This is a real mechanical keyboard, with full-travel keyswitches mounted in an anodized aluminum plate and the same generous 19mm key spacing you'll find on a traditional desktop keyboard. Inside, it's powered by a Microchip ATmega32U4 MCU, the same chip that's inside an Arduino Leonardo and a Keyboardio Model 01. It comes with firmware source code, as well as a graphical configuration tool. It connects to your computer or tablet over USB.  \n",
      "But it really is very small. At just 24.3 x 10 x 2.8cm (9.6 x 3.9 x 1.1 inches), it's easy to bring your keyboard with you everywhere.  \n",
      "To get a better sense of just how compact the Keyboardio Atreus is, you can print out this PDF:\n",
      "Downloadable papercraft Keyboardio Atreus\n",
      "(Make sure your computer is set to print things at actual size, rather than shrinking or stretching them to fit on a sheet of paper. It should fit on a standard sheet of A4 or letter / 8.5\"x11\" paper.)\n",
      "The Atreus’ layout puts all the keys in columns aligned to your fingers, so you never need to stretch or twist to reach a key. The keys are the same size as on a regular desktop keyboard, but they're laid out in a much more compact way that matches how your hands work. Everything you need is easy to reach. (Since the keyboard is so compact, your mouse or trackball is closer, too.) \n",
      "Rather than being arranged in rows like a typewriter, the Atreus' keys are arranged in columns, with each column just right for the finger that hits it. Each half of the keyboard is angled inward at 10 degrees, to help keep your arms and shoulders in a more neutral posture.\n",
      "A traditional keyboard has 104 keys. A compact laptop keyboard typically weighs in at 78 keys. The Keyboardio Atreus manages to fit all the same functionality into just 44 keys. We do this by assigning keys to different \"layers\". \n",
      "The default layer is where you'll find your letters and most of your standard punctuation. \n",
      "Tap or hold the Fun key and your Atreus will shift to the Fun (Function) layer, where you'll find numbers, arrow keys, and the rest of your symbols. \n",
      "From there, press the Upper key to get to the Upper layer, where you'll find media keys, F keys, and other similar stuff. \n",
      "Learning to type on any new keyboard layout takes patience and practice. If you've never typed on a split keyboard before, it can be quite an adjustment, but one we think is really worth it. Your hands and wrists will thank you.\n",
      "Similarly, learning to type on a keyboard with multiple layers can be a bit of an adjustment. At first, it may sound a little bit exotic, but it's something most folks can adjust to relatively quickly. After all, the symbols above the numbers on a \"regular\" keyboard are just a layer you access with the Shift key. \n",
      "The standard Atreus layout has been refined over the past few years and is a great option if you're just getting started with split, columnar keyboards. If you're coming from the Model 01, you might end up preferring a Model 01 style layout, which we're still refining. This layout will use the standard Atreus keycaps and will be available on all Keyboardio Atreus keyboards.\n",
      "Of course, one of the great things about having a customizable keyboard is that you can customize it. If the layout the Atreus ships with isn't right for you, it's easy to change it to match where your fingers think the keys should be.\n",
      "The easiest way to change the Atreus' layout is using our point and click configuration tool— no programming required. It runs on Windows 10, macOS, and Linux. (And, of course, it's open source and available on GitHub.)\n",
      "Once you've customized your layout, you can rearrange the keycaps to match—all of the keycaps are the same shape. Additionally, the laminated layout card that comes with your keyboard is blank on one side, so you can fill it in with a whiteboard marker as you learn your custom layout.\n",
      "The firmware powering all our keyboards, Kaleidoscope, is open source and freely available on Github. If you want to build complex macros, add in joystick emulation, change how the Atreus speaks USB, or make keys do things we haven't thought of yet, Kaleidoscope is where you'd start.\n",
      "Kaleidoscope is incredibly powerful, but we've done our best to make it newbie-friendly. We built it on top of the Arduino core, to make it easy for folks who aren't familiar with embedded development or C++ to be able to do amazing things. At the same time, you're not restricted to the Arduino IDE when working with it. If vi or Emacs is your weapon of choice, everything's set up to build from the command line using standard tooling.\n",
      "Kaleidoscope supports all the things you'd expect, like layouts stored in EEPROM, serial communications, full NKRO, mousekeys, and crazy USB tricks. Most new features can be added to Kaleidoscope as plugins, of which we have many already. \n",
      "Your Atreus comes fully assembled with your choice of four different kinds of switches:\n",
      "All of our switches are made by Kailh, one of the best switch makers in the world. Kailh rates all of these switches for at least 70 million keypresses. \n",
      "Not sure which one will work best for you? Don't worry. You don't need to choose today. After the campaign wraps up, we'll email you to confirm your shipping address and switch preference.\n",
      "The Keyboardio Atreus features hot-swap sockets designed to let you remove the switches with a standard keyswitch puller (not included) and replace them with just about any MX-style switch, no soldering or disassembly required.\n",
      "The standard keycaps shipped with the Keyboardio Atreus will be black, laser-engraved keys in the XDA profile. They will be made out of PBT, a high-quality plastic beloved by keyboard enthusiasts for their resilience. The standard F and J keys installed on the keyboard include homing bars. \n",
      "If you have backed for an August-delivery keyboard, you'll have an opportunity to choose between keycaps with English-language legends and blank keycaps without legends after the campaign ends. \n",
      "If you choose a keyboard with labeled keys, your keyboard will come with extra F and J keys without homing bars. If you want to rearrange your keys to a layout like Dvorak or Colemak, you can use the alternative F and J keys so you don't have homing bars in the wrong place.\n",
      "All keyboards will come with Keyboardio Butterfly and 'Any' keycaps.\n",
      "Some of our reward tiers include a travel case custom-designed to securely carry the Atreus. Its shell is made of a tough 600D polyester fabric wrapped around internal plastic structural panels and just a bit of cushioning foam.\n",
      "The travel case perfectly cradles your keyboard, with a separate pocket for your USB cable. \n",
      "While it's small enough to slide into your backpack, the case is sturdy enough to carry on its own. It has a handle made from nylon webbing and two D-rings you can use to attach your own shoulder strap. If instant access to your keyboard on the go is critical, you'll appreciate the case's fold-flat velcro belt loop.\n",
      " We designed the Keyboardio Atreus to be small and light, so it's easy to bring everywhere, but many of us spend our days at a desk. \n",
      "Drawing on the experience building our first keyboard's body out of wood, we've designed a gorgeous solid hardwood palm rest for the Keyboardio Atreus. \n",
      "The palm rest features a gentle five degree tilt, contoured edges and a wide, deep area for your hands. Each palm rest is precision-milled from warm, beautiful walnut. Non-marking silicone pads on the bottom of the palm rest ensure that it will stay put on your desk.\n",
      "No matter which reward tier you choose, every Keyboardio Atreus comes with:\n",
      "As a Kickstarter backer, your Keyboardio Atreus and accessories are also priced at a significant discount off our expected retail pricing.\n",
      "We have a limited number of keyboards from our factory's pilot run available as early delivery rewards for Backers. Because these keyboards are already being manufactured, we will only have 75 early delivery keyboards with BOX White switches and 75 with Speed Copper switches. \n",
      "As of right now, the only difference we expect between these keyboards to have from mass-production keyboards is the color of the cardboard box the keyboard comes in (plain brown vs. black for mass production).\n",
      "If you back for an early delivery keyboard, you need to choose your switch type as you back.  \n",
      "If you choose an early delivery unit, you will have the opportunity to buy accessories at the Kickstarter price after campaign end.  Please don't manually add money to your pledge within Kickstarter. \n",
      "All of these specs, are, of course, subject to change, though we don't expect them to change much, if at all.\n",
      "* Due to an internal error, we initially said the plate was steel, not aluminum.  We're really sorry for the mixup.\n",
      "We designed the Keyboardio Atreus to be easy to field-strip with a standard Philips screwdriver, though it's not something you should generally need to do.\n",
      "The anodized aluminum plate is secured to the bottom tray with 12 countersunk flat-head tapping screws hidden underneath the keycaps.\n",
      " Once you lift the plate and circuit board out of the tray, you'll see that all of the components on the circuit board are mounted to the bottom side. This makes them easy to access without separating the circuit board and the plate.\n",
      "The circuit board is secured to the plate with seven pan-head machine screws. If you ever need to separate the circuit board from the plate, just unscrew it—no soldering iron required.\n",
      "Your keyboard and accessories will ship from our Hong Kong warehouse partner, located just across the border from our factory in Dongguan, China. We've been working with them since the beginning of 2018. As a global shipping hub, Hong Kong is a convenient and efficient origin point for shipments to just about anywhere. \n",
      "The discounted shipping rates we're able to offer you are \"DDU\" rates, which do not include prepayment of tax or duty. You will be responsible for any include duty, tax, or import charges. \n",
      "As of March 2020, we don't believe that you will owe any duty on keyboards or accessories if your shipping address is inside the United States.\n",
      "We will ship to just about any country in the world; if your country isn't already listed as an option in the rewards drop down, send us a message and we'll add it if we can. \n",
      "Keyboardio is a tiny company making beautiful, comfortable keyboards. We're a husband-and-wife team that got started when Jesse couldn't find a keyboard that didn't make his wrists hurt, and so decided to spend a month making his own. One thing led to another, and now we've got thousands of happy customers.\n",
      "We've always tried to be open about what we do. Phil Hagelberg, the designer of the original Atreus got his start, in part, from our early blog posts.\n",
      "Thank you to first and foremost to our Model 01 backers. Your support, patience, and enthusiasm kept us going.\n",
      "And special thanks to algernon, Blaine, Brady, Connie, Evan, Frank, Grant, Jared, Ken, Lainy, Linda, Marty, Phil, Richard & Ready, Rob, Roy, and Russel.  \n",
      "Design and development work for the keyboard is complete. We're only a few months away from shipping.  \n",
      "This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The biggest risk for any project is shipping late. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our first Kickstarter project shipped late. Since then, we've learned a lot about design, factory and supply chain management, and fulfillment. Our second Kickstarter project shipped early. \n",
      "\n",
      "We think we've provided a conservative timeline with this project. We have already completed design, selected a factory, had tooling made, obtained FCC and CE certifications, and completed a pilot run with the factory. Our keyboard firmware has been running for several years on thousands of devices. We believe that we're now past most of the milestones that cause shipping delays for Kickstarter projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our biggest concern for delays comes from the ongoing spread of COVID-19 / coronavirus and how that might affect our supply chain. Our keyboard factory has re-opened after the Chinese New Year holiday, but some of their supplier factories have not. \n",
      "\n",
      "As of this writing, we're confident that we can get you your keyboard in the timeframe we promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that the electrical components for the keyboard should be readily purchasable in the quantities we might need them, and that the greatest risk of supply chain disruption would be for the travel case and wooden palm rest. If the keyboards are available significantly before the accessories, we plan to ship the keyboards separately and absorb any increase in costs.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "An empty airport terminal hall on the eve of the New Year proved to be a perfect environment for self-reflection. Since graduating from St Andrews University, (Scotland), as a documentary photographer, I have travelled far and wide to research and to advocate for causes that are meaningful to me. I realised from the endless conversations I had with my closest friends that we share the same views. My name is Qi Tian and together with Pang Jian and Guo Shu we founded Perspectives Foundation, and we would like to share with you our vision.  \n",
      "Perspectives Foundation connects NGOs in China with documentary photographers worldwide to present to a wider public the work, the challenges and the results of those organisations, while supporting and furthering local talent. We believe that there is a substantial lack of representation and visibility at the level of Chinese NGO and we aim to fulfil this need. \n",
      "We are grateful to have the confirmed support of internationally renown photographers, including Magnum’s Chris Steele-Perkins and Steve McCurry.  The talented Gilles Sabrié, Theodore Kaye, Liu Tao and Qi Tian are taking part in this initiative as well.  \n",
      "Chris Steele-Perkins is the mentor of the Perspectives Foundation and he is taking on our first commissioned work. During the whole month of May he will be documenting China’s care of terminally ill and elderly in the Beijing Hospice. He will also travel across the country (Qing Hai, Yun Nan and An Hui provinces) and create a body of photographic work focused on the changes in rural China since the founding of the ‘Hope’ primary schools by China’s Youth Development Foundation. \n",
      "We believe that, with your help, this connection between art and civic involvement will attract substantial funding, support and attention to the work of Chinese NGOs. We endorse their ceaseless efforts in the areas of child protection, education, animal conservation, environmental conservation, marginalised communities, and others, and aspire to make their work visible. \n",
      "We are glad to share with you another of our projects: an innovative educational programme which offers free workshops to talented NGO workers and aspiring Chinese photographers. Besides his photographic work, Chris Steele-Perkins will personally lead the first workshop with 5 talented Chinese photographers and 5 NGOs workers from the sectors mentioned above. The places in the workshop were allocated free of charge, based on photographic portfolios. Chris Steele-Perkins’ tutoring and the bringing together of photographers with an interest in social issues will create a community of artists who will further take on commissions and work on behalf of the Chinese NGOs to make their work visible. \n",
      "This is a unique opportunity for you to acquire valuable and remarkable artworks from the photographers Chris Steele-Perkins, Steve McCurry, Gilles Sabrié, Theodor Kaye, Liu Tao and Qi Tian, and to know that this money supports the crucial work of Chinese NGOs.  \n",
      "We hope that you will appreciate the multitude of perspectives these photographers offer on contemporary China, and become part of our growing community of supporters by purchasing these artworks. \n",
      "In the reward section, we are offering posters and \"signed edition prints\" for each of the photographs (except for Steve McCurry's photo). The prints will be given out on first-come-first-serve base, so please leave comment about which print you wish to have, thanks!\n",

He is the holder of numerous prestigious awards, amongst others 'The Robert Capa Gold Medal' (1989) and Arts Council Great Britain Award (2010). His wonderful photobooks such as The Teds (1979), England, My England (2009), Fuji (2002), A Place in the Country (2014), and many others, account for a lifelong dedication to documentary photography. \n",

      " \n",
      "Where We've Been:\n",
      "Edward + Jane began as (now husband + wife) duo Timothy and Emilie Carpenter. Timothy and Emilie met in high school in Cincinnati, Ohio where they spent most of their early years before moving south to Tennessee for college.\n",
      "In the midst of our time at Lee University in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we began to write songs telling the tales of our lives and love for one another and soon after began going by our middle names Edward + Jane. In the fall of our sophomore year, we found new friend Spencer T. Smith (electric guitar & harmonica) and we recorded our debut EP Grow in a basement in the suburbs of Cleveland, TN. Since recording our first EP Grow two years ago, we have gotten married, been on 3 tours, played 100+ shows, covered over 5000+ miles, and made many, many friends. We have since moved away from our newfound home in Tennessee back to where we were raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. After spending the past year learning to do life together in our quaint new family, and the past two years writing together, we feel as though it is time to get back into the studio and share these songs with you. \n",
      "Where We Find Ourselves:\n",
      "Leaving our Ohio family behind was difficult for us. But we learned that you can find family wherever you are. All you have to do is look around and show a little love. We began to understand that family is important and no matter who it is that makes up your family, you ought not take them for granted. Family is all we have. \n",
      "The more we travel and play our music, we discover that people are meant to be together. Spending time with old friends and meeting new ones on the road is so neat to us. We have found a special community of sorts at our shows and throughout our tours that is gradually making up the Edward + Jane \"family\". For this reason, we decided to name the EP As Family We Gather. Mainly because the phrase has become somewhat of a mantra for us. This project for us is about bringing everyone together in a culture that is continually driving people apart.\n",
      "Where We Are Headed:\n",
      "We are recording this 5 song EP with Jonathan Class at Varsity Studios in Anderson, Indiana over 5 days in late September and are currently booking a fall tour to follow. We are investing more time, energy, and money in this project than we were able for our first EP Grow. These songs are near and dear to our hearts and we need your help to make this project a reality.\n",
      " - E + J\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Recording As Family We Gather will be our second studio experience, and if there is anything we learned from the first go-round, it is that while recording is one of the most amazing times for creativity, there can also be some difficulties along the way. (i.e. delays in studio, manufacturing snags, etc.) We will keep you updated frequently as to our progress and simply ask for your patience if such snags occur.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Lion of Grace is an album of stories close to my heart.  They are simple songs of hard-working farmers and immigrants (like my 96-year-old Grannie); shipwrecks on the great lakes, where I spent much of my time growing up; quirky stories from the news; and cerebral lyrics inspired by the vast and beautiful rural Canadian landscape.  \n",
      "When I've been involved in Kickstarter projects before it was always well before we went into the studio to record.  For this album, the record has already been fully recorded.  The only things that are needed are mixing, mastering and printing, which are all expensive and necessary parts of making a professional album.  The good news is that if you support my project, all of those things can be done in short order so I'll be able to send you your copy quickly - likely within a month!   \n",
      "I’ve worked hard on my songwriting over 17 years and 10 albums with Enter The Haggis.  Some of the songs I wrote for Enter The Haggis such as “One Last Drink” and “Down With The Ship” have appeared in movies and garnered hundreds of thousands of plays online thanks to the enthusiasm of amazing fans. There are few things I’ve experienced that are as satisfying as connecting with people through lyrics and seeing my songs come to life with the help of talented musicians and friends.\n",
      "I consider myself a simple guy who loves spending time playing in the dirt at the family farm with my Grannie, my wife and our two young boys.  My other passion is songwriting, which I do nearly incessantly; in the kitchen, the basement, out walking the dog, cutting the lawn, standing in line at the bank... it’s a bit of an addiction really.  By supporting my kickstarter make no mistake: you will be responsible for feeding this addiction!\n",
      "I love being creative and collaborating with other people and I think this Kickstarter speaks to that - let me draw you a picture or sing you some songs!  Let's make a great music video together!  \n",
      "I want to thank you beyond words for any and all support you are able to give to this project and can’t wait to get \"Lion of Grace\" into your hands and ears!  \n",
      "Musically yours,\n",

      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "As part of the band, Enter The Haggis, I'm not new to crowd-funding.  I know that it takes a lot of time and energy to get the work completed and to fulfill reward packages in a timely manner.  As a band, we learned lessons about doing crowd-funding over the years and I'm bringing that experience to my personal Kickstarter campaign.  \n",
      "One of the things I've done in order to make the campaign more manageable is to keep the packages simple but valuable and, I believe, fairly priced.  I understand that anyone can get any music they wish online for free these days so your financial support is a choice that you've made to help me make this album a reality.  \n",
      "I've also mitigated risks and challenges by having already recorded the album in full with high quality equipment in a home studio.  This means that there is very little to do to bring the project to completion.  As soon as I reach my goal I will have the funding necessary to send the album away for professional mixing and mastering, at which point I will be able to send it to you.  Thank you again for your support!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "For the past few years I've had a blast playing party tunes all over New Zealand and further abroad. I've released two cover albums including one very generously funded by a Kickstarter campaign in 2014. \n",
      "For over 10 years I have been quietly writing songs in the background but I had never really even attempted doing anything with my original music. In early 2015 with a bit of prompting from some key people in my life I started taking some first steps. \n",
      "I released my first single 'Alive' and started touring my original music across NZ and Australia. The response was nothing short of astounding- I've really been blown away by people's support and things have gone better than I ever could have anticipated. 'Alive' was played on both commercial and independent radio stations and has gone on to pick up over 120,000 streams on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.\n",
      "With two studio albums and over 600 performances under my belt I really feel like I have served my apprenticeship and I feel very ready to take this next step and see where it leads. \n",
      "Over the course of the last 6 months I have been recording my debut original album 'News from Nowhere' in various locations around New Zealand. Over the last two months that record has been mixed, mastered here in Wellington at Organik Muzik Workz by the very talented Benny Tones The album is ready to go....almost. We have a few final hurdles to jump.\n",
      "I made the decision a while ago to be independent artist. In this day and age there is a lot that you can do without a record label. Never before has there been such a possibility of direct communication with your audience without interference from vested interests. It really helps guarantee artistic freedom and a very natural direct link between the producers of music and the people that want to see that music produced. \n",
      "For all its benefits, being an indie musician has its challenges too- especially if you are wanting to do something well. The music industry is a very peculiar one and it has taken me a long time to figure out how any of it works. I'm still very proud of the last album I released but I didn't really know how to 'release' things at the time. Since 2015 my brilliant wife Zoe has been full-time music managing and she is doing an absolutely stellar job. This means that we actually have some knowledge about workings of the industry and how to handle an album release. We have secured an online distribution deal through DRM and we have the brilliant Janine from Noise PR onboard to handle publicity.\n",
      "There is a real opportunity to make a bit of a splash with this album. I'm so grateful for the radical generosity that has been shown me over the last four years. It has been quite the journey- thanks for coming along for the ride!\n",

      "2. Sponsor the making of a magnificent Art book, based on her sketchbook with preparatory sketches and HQ images of the paintings Ellen Marie made.  Get as a reward, your own copy of her artbook sent to your home!\n",
      "Long Version:\n",
      "For her debut show \"Metamorphosis\" in March 2019, Ellen Marie wants to make an art book with all preparatory sketches, studies and a lot of the behind-the-scenes work that is never shared with the public. All the paintings and drawings in the exhibition will also be included with a word of explanation by the artist. \n",
      "In order to make this financially possible, she needs your help. Pre-order your own Metamorphosis Book whilst supporting this project!\n",
      "ELLEN MARIE, introduction \n",
      "Ellen Marie Moysons, born on July 22nd, 1994, grew up in Kampenhout, a small village on the Belgian countryside. Surrounded by forests and open fields, with a mind exploding with imagination, there was nothing that impeded Ellen’s freedom of expression. Ellen’s parents very much nurtured in her an open-minded attitude towards life and allowed her to explore the world freely. A strong connection with nature was formed at a young age. This later turned into long, contemplative walks in the forest. Something she still does very often. \n",
      "As a young child, her main outlet was writing, most often in the form of short stories. However, when at the age of 14 she met Belgian artist Kaat Tilley, Ellen Marie was fascinated with the elegance and expressiveness with which Tilley portrayed the female figure. It had such an impact on her that it sprouted in her the desire to manifest beauty visually in the world, just like Tilley did. \n",
      "Ellen Marie was captivated by the idea of using the human form to express deeper-lying concepts or emotions. \n",
      "Even though not directly involved in any creative industries, upon seeing her talent, Ellen’s parents were very supportive of her application to the Fine Arts program at the Willem de Kooning Academy in 2013. As an academy very rooted in the conceptual side of modern art, Ellen Marie explored the full stretch of modern artistic disciplines: from building installations to performance art, from sound and video art to digital experiments, she did it all. \n",
      "After one year, she realised she hadn’t drawn or painted a single thing. \n",
      "This was when she came across the Barcelona Academy of Art, where traditional drawing and painting techniques were taught following Renaissance methodologies: from plaster casts to nude figure, from portraiture to still life. Ellen Marie felt like she had discovered a gem in the chaos of modern art. Initially having signed up for one trimester only, she graduated from the three year intensive course in June 2017. \n",
      "Ellen started teaching drawing and painting at the Barcelona Academy of Art after graduating. \n",
      "Alongside teaching at the academy, Ellen Marie has her own studio in Barcelona, where she works day and night on her personal work. \n",
      "ART BOOK\n",
      "To make the artbook for her solo show at De Camme in Perk, Belgium, she needs some funds to be able to do this at a high-quality level.  She would like to work with professionals to make it just on the level of how she sees her paintings.\n",
      "She will need to work with the following people:\n",
      "- Graphic artist: layout and treatment of the RAW pictures in Photoshop and Indesign (cost: around 7.000 Euro)\n",
      "- High quality printer: to print these type of images without losing the essence of the work. (cost: around 4.500 Euro)\n",
      "The quality of the book will depend on the support of the sponsors.  We currently have a budget of around 4.000 Euro to execute everything (with regular, but not great printing). In order to bring forward a high-quality book we need about 7.000€ more.\n",
      "Eternal gratitude will be shown if we get to the amount required because this will mean we can make a Kickstarter impression!\n",
      "Ellen Marie is already grateful for the help she gets now!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "As the project will go ahead, the risk is limited.  The expo is organized, all the paintings are ready, the basic artwork for the book has been made, there is practically no risk involved.  You will get a beautiful book for a very modest price, all whilst helping a young artist to start her career in a difficult art-world.  Her aim is to make a living with her art, so I want to help her achieve that goal.\n",

A coffee barista dreaming of raising a family and buying a lake house. A mother singing a lullaby to my baby, realizing that the stakes of global warming and economic instability are stacked against him. A divorced mom embracing both the uncertainty and possibility of change and new beginnings. All these stories reflect on the American Dream and what that means to our global generation.

Folk music, with its mix of fidelity to tradition and freedom of expression, beautifully allows this.\n",

It's the proudest moment for all of us. Far From The Tree was a collaboration in every sense of the word; every track a mediation between three musicians meeting at least once a week over the last goodness-knows-how-many months.\n",
      "The whittled down collection of ballads and tunes is a condensation of all we've created over the last two years since we formed. It's an incredible moment, to see all these concerts, jams, composing sessions and rehearsals suddenly coalesce into a single listening experience, and we want you to be a part of it.\n",

      "As with any album project there are a myriad of hurdles to cross. With the recording now paid for and complete, the creative wrangling, sweat and toil is over. But much remains - now to the task of shaping those sounds onto something physical.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll be relying upon the skills and availability of several key characters. The mixing talents of our producer (he's a very busy man), a mastering engineer, an artist to create the cover, a passionate publicist and of course our own selves, pushing and organising the whole operation and the upcoming album launch tour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the tracks on tape, we've set ourselves the conservative deadline of releasing the album in Spring 2016. With so many pieces to the puzzle, we're being careful not to rush. That way we can be sure to have the most beautiful sonic package possible ready to deliver to the world when that day comes.\n",

The universe removed my safety net and so, with a pocket full of ideas, my partner and I are now pursuing our dream of building a brand SubCult Society that focuses on all things esoteric that we have a passion for. Determinedly working together on this new business venture where we design pins and apparel that we ourselves would buy. It seemed fitting to start off with our personal love of the goth subculture and music scene. \n",

This can be changed or canceled at anytime and won't leave your bank account until the end of the kickstarter. If we don’t meet our funding goal within the campaign duration, we  will not receive any funds and no backers will be charged. If our goal is met a rewards survey is sent out asking backers which rewards they wanted along with their addresses. Rewards are then sent out once they are  ready/manufactured.\n",
      " The project been changed around a little and rather than having the band pins as stretch goals we have decided to include them as the designs you can choose between all 6 designs. \n",
      "This pin collection is influenced by my life in Goth scene of the late 90’s. Fast forward two decades and now with the help of my partner, we are designing products that your inner goth teen would sqeee at and your current selves could indulge in.

      "Why did I paint We Are Here To Love?\n",
      "I felt this was an awesome way to start 2018.  I started painting the 100 pieces of art right after Christmas and for the whole month of January.  2017 was kind of an intense year for a lot of us.  I wanted to start the new year on a positive note - what's more positive than LOVE and making art? \n",
      "What are the Make 100 Paintings?\n",
      "Each painting is on 5x7\" canvas. Most of them are acrylic paintings however, I love experimenting and playing with color.  I created a few different abstract varieties.  I will posting random pictures of different styles throughout the campaign.       \n",
      "You select the series and the paintings will be randomly selected for you.  Once the campaign is completed, I will send an email to everyone, asking for a suggestion for their personal affirmation.   I love writing affirmations for people!!\n",
      "Humanity needs Love.\n",
      "My hope is these paintings will remind you to keep your heart open.  No matter what else is happening, it is important to keep an open heart.\n",
      "What does the campaign fund?\n",
      "My public art project, the Magic Passion Love (MPL) Manifesting Mobile, a vision/dream board for humanity.  The hanging mobile is a collection of cardboard circles that people have shared their wishes and intentions for themselves and the world.   The circles are hung on a string in a room so people may walk through the strands.   The intention for this project is to show how everyone really wants the same thing.   The thing we need most is Love!\n",
      "I traveled with this project in 2012 across the United States.  After returning to Savannah, I spent the next few years getting grounded in my new town.  Now that I have a place to live, an art studio and a great community, I am ready to take the Manifesting Mobile to the next level.   I feel like it is a perfect time to activate Magic Passion Love with more people!\n",
      "The Manifesting Mobile and these 100 pieces of art are ways to remind ourselves to LOVE.  There is more power in LOVE than hate.   \n",
      "I am excited  to share that I have a exhibition booked this March.  The Mobile will be part of a collaborative art show in Beaufort, SC.  This show will be the first time there will be a sound healing element to the art project.  The ambient sound will allow the viewers to enjoy a walking meditation while reading the circles.   I believe when more people are able to experience a walking meditation through the Manifesting Mobile, this will help raise the positive energy vibration of our planet.\n",
      " My goal is to take the Mobile to every state and potentially around the world.  This project is a collaborative project.  I am currently working with some friends.  If you would like to co-create with me - call me!\n",
      "I am a community activist.  I believe in the power of thinking globally and acting locally.   I am currently the festival director for the Savannah Earth Day Festival.  All of my work is funded by people and businesses who see the value in collaborating with each other.  I am grateful to work with a lot of people who LOVE our planet and want to protect it.\n",
      "Part of the intention of the Manifesting Mobile is to give people opportunities to get involved in their own communities.  When the Mobile is on view, I invite community organizations to be involved.  Because we are here to LOVE and to take responsibility for what we LOVE.  \n",
      "There are many kinds of LOVE – sister love, brother love, romantic love, pet love, city love, friend love, nature love, spiritual love, human love. This series reminds us that we must LOVE one another – especially those who we do not like. In order for us to make real change, we must LOVE everyone.\n",

      " UPDATE 1-16-18: See table below for New Funding Goals!\n",
      "For the last few months I have been creating abstract oil paintings as a way to experiment with color combinations and texture. The paintings are done with different palette knives instead of brushes, and I use high grade oil paint from a few of the top brands.\n",
      "When I saw the announcement for the MAKE/100 event, I knew this was the perfect opportunity to share a limited run of the paintings with the public.\n",
      "This specific run of paintings will all be done on 8x10 canvas panel. The size allows for easy and inexpensive shipping that I can include in the price of the pledge, and is a standard frame size for those that want to add a frame for display. (Frames not included.)\n",
      "The photos shown are paintings that I have done in various sizes but in similar style to the 100 I will make for this project. These new paintings will be 100% original, each one unique and will only be revealed as each backer receives their painting.\n",
      " \n",
      "First and foremost, support the arts! Visual Art is a vital way for many people to express themselves. Sadly art is too often thought of as unimportant, when more than anything it is our creativity as humans that greatly separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Keep art alive!\n",
      " \n",
      "Yes and no. Ideally I would love to have the freedom to just \"create\" each painting as I do them. My goal, if nothing else, is to absolutely make a beautiful piece of art that would look stunning in a nice frame, hanging on the wall of your home or office. I do understand that at minimum some people will have a color palette preference, so I will give each backer the opportunity to give me the main color to use in their painting and I will create it from there. The surprise will be part of the fun and I am more than confident that you will love the painting.\n",
      " \n",
      "Once all paintings have been shipped and received, I will upload photos of each one to my website and to social media. This way everyone gets to see all of the paintings together. In the future I may do a book or set of postcards and may also include these images in those collections. Please note that although I do retain some rights to the usage of these paintings I will NOT be making individual prints or duplicates of these 100 specific paintings available to anyone else at any later date. \n",

      "We're in the studio recording our second CD, \"Boomtown Ghosts\", and we are psyched!  Our first CD, \"Blue Sky Earth\" was a home studio recording, and it was very well received, with nearly 800,000 streams so far through online radio stations.  Our new project is shaping up to be a huge leap forward in every way; from songwriting, singing, musicianship, to excellent production.  It deserves the best we can give, and we think you'll enjoy it! The songs on Boomtown Ghosts are personal, but touch on universal themes that will resonate with many; songs of love and of place, of struggles with a changing world, and with changes within.  Songs that need to be heard! We've been touring and saving for the studio time with the amazing Howlin' Dog Records, but that's just the beginning, and the expenses are adding up faster than we anticipated.  We want to make this as good as possible, and reach as many people as possible!  If we meet our goals, we will be able to mix, master, press and package 300 to 500 physical CD's to get out to the world.  We'll also be able to get the album out to Apple Radio, Spotify, iTunes Radio, Pandora, etc. Our stretch goals could help get these songs even further, with promotional content necessary to reach radio stations, music reviewers, magazines and blogs, as well as venue booking folks.  With your help, we intend to take our music as far as possible! Some of the expenses that would be covered with our basic fundraising goal; these are required to get a CD out to the world after it has already been recorded in the studio: If we can exceed our Basic Goal of $4,000, a lot of opportunities open up!  This would allow us to get the CD into the hands of reviewers, radio station directors, promoters, movie and synch license directors, and other industry people. We'll also use anything extra to reach a larger audience through social media advertising, print ads in select magazines, etc.  If we stretch it enough, we would hire a radio promoter with established connections to nationwide radio stations specializing in Americana and Roots music!  \n",

      "We create music; it's what we do, and that will never change!  But to express it to as many people as possible, presented as well as possible, is work, and it's expensive for independent artists!  We've taken a leap of faith and started recording in a fantastic studio with an amazing engineer and producer because we feel the music we're making deserves a chance to be expressed as well as it can be.  The risk is that it is put onto a hard drive and that's as far as it gets. With help, we can present our songs to new audiences- and you as a backer will get a physical disc and/or other premiums, as well as the knowledge that you were an integral part of filling the world with new music!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We've been through this process before at a smaller scale.  Our first CD, Blue Sky Earth, was recorded at home, on a laptop, learning how to use the software ourselves, writing all the songs, playing nearly every note, every instrument, mixed ourselves, distributed, promoted, etc.  It took many months, and help from a lot of friends, but we did it!\n"
