      "Social Credit System? Darunter können sich leider die wenigsten etwas vorstellen. Doch was genauso gut aus einem dystopischen Roman stammen könnte, ist in China leider bereits Realität. Der Staat ermittelt an Hand deines Verhaltens einen Punktestand. Dieser verändert sich mit deinem Handeln zum positiven oder negativen und entscheidet dabei maßgebend über dein Leben. Ob man ausreisen, öffentliche Verkehrsmittel nutzen oder zur Universität gehen kann, hängt ganz vom eigenen Credit Score ab. Dabei werden nicht nur moralisch oder gesetzlich falsche Taten als ausschlaggebend für die Verschlechterung des Scores aufgeführt, sondern auch der Konsum von zu vielen Videospielen o.ä., da dies als nicht für die Gesellschaft produktives Verhalten angesehen wird. \n",
      "Auch andere politische Meinungen werden diskreditiert und sanktioniert. Private Chats werden analysiert und auch der Kontakt mit Personen, die einen niedrigeren Punktestand haben, wird bestraft. \n",
      "Die Realität geht in diesem Fall noch weit über die Ausmaße der Black Mirror Folge hinaus, die sich mit einem ähnlichen Konzept beschäftigt. Zuschauer der Serie mag das ein gewisses Gefühl für die Ausmaße geben. \n",
      "WARUM IST DIESES THEMA RELEVANT?\n",
      "In China sind derzeit über 170 Millionen Kameras im Einsatz, die rund um die Uhr laufen und mit neuster Gesichtserkennungssoftware und Gangerkennungssoftware ausgestattet sind. Die Bürger werden so für die Regierung zum gläsernen Mensch. Kaum kann man noch auf die Straße, ohne dass ein System dieses registriert und vermerkt. \n",
      "UND?\n",
      "Überwachungsstaat? Nicht bei uns. Zumindest nicht, bis die EU die gleiche Technik zur Terrorismus-Prävention einsetzt, wie unser Freund im Osten. Die EU macht derzeit Pläne eben diese Technik auch bei uns Einzusetzen. Falls es dazu kommen sollte, dann ist die NSA-Affäre und Snowden mehr als nur Schnee von gestern. Privatssphäre würde komplett ausgehebelt. Alles zum Gute unserer Sicherheit. Doch ist dieser Preis es wert, die komplette Kontrolle über das eigene Leben in die Hände des Staates zu geben?\n",
      "China zeigt uns bereits die Abgründe und Möglichkeiten die sich für die Person hinter den Kameras auftun. Wie weit, darf Überwachung gehen?\n",

      "Now for the second edition of the waxed canvas anorak, as well as introducing the wool coat / anorak liner. This is for those who missed out on an anorak last year, and those waiting patiently for the wool coat / anorak liner to release this year. Both will be delivered in November. \n",
      "For those new to Peak Oil Company and our waxed canvas anorak, please review our initial campaign from 2021 and the comments and reviews there. You can find more images and reviews on our Instagram and Youtube.\n",
      "Please head to our website to find out more about The Wool Coat / Anorak Liner and place your order for delivery in November 2022. \n",
      "We wanted to launch The Wool Coat / Anorak Liner as a separate campaign here in Kickstarter (to simplify ordering, fulfillment and data), but it turns out Kickstarter doesn't allow two campaigns to run at the same time. So, we've decided to list The Wool Coat on the Peak Oil Company website to take orders for the coat. \n",
      "Regarding the sheepskin vests, we're still having trouble finding an Australian factory that can take on sheepskin garment production. The ones we knew of have closed down, leaving the few remaining factories at full capacity for now. We're looking hard and it will be put up here for orders sometime around August.\n",
      "In short, we're making extremely hard wearing outdoor clothing and equipment in Australia, using Australian materials that are free of plastics, petro chemicals and fluorocarbons. We develop products with early adopters, then bring them into production through Kickstarter. Our producers are accredited by Ethical Clothing Australia, and operate at the highest standard possible in our region.\n",
      "After the success of the 2021 campaign, we're increasing the production target to 200 anoraks. 200 anoraks affords us some efficiencies in scale to help sustain the business and develop more products ready for production. We hope this is a realistic target, after delivering 170 anoraks from last year's campaign. \n",
      "The design of the anorak remains mostly the same. We're changing the zipper a little, only because we've found a YKK brass zipper that is still made in Australia. This new zipper also helps us simplify production and the anorak's function.\n",
      "We're doing 4 sizes this year, for the anorak and the wool coat. The following measurements are of the wearer's body, not the garment. Measure yourself wearing what you would likely wear under your anorak:\n",
      "During this campaign, we will post updates with photos of people with their measurements and size they are wearing. \n",
      "After you place your order and the campaign ends, we will contact you to confirm your size.\n",
      "Here are some photos and reviews of the anorak 2021 edition.\n",
      "Many thanks everyone, your encouragement, support and orders are greatly appreciated by our team. You're helping to keep high quality garments and materials made here in Australia. There are a lot of people affected by your choice today, so thank you. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "While we have worked hard to ensure material supply and production readiness, there is always a chance external factors will impact on our timeline. Covid has hugely impacted Australian textiles production, bringing many brands back onshore for their production. Demand on local materials has also increased. While this is great for the industry as a whole, it is putting stress on the local factories and suppliers who have remained small due to those same brands going offshore in the years prior. Smaller brands like Peak Oil Company may be temporarily put off by suppliers and the producers while they work to cope with the stress of larger orders. We have mitigated this risk by drawing out a longer timeline for our small orders. If we unexpectedly go over our estimated orders, we may have to break production into two periods, which could mean some people don't get their anorak by December 2022, but a few months after that. We consider this scenario highly unlikely, though we're prepared for it if it does come about.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Why do we need kickstarter you ask? I allocated the maximum legal withdrawal from my pension fund and am \"all in\" but have come up short. The moving target regarding upgrades to the space with both the City and Province has been, although enlightening, costly beyond my business plan. \n",
      "1958 is a project that has been in the planning stages for almost half a century. It is a restaurant offering always fresh, always local and sustainable food for the entire community. The restaurant is located in West Broadway, on the fringe of Wolseley and is part of a diverse, eclectic neighborhood where homes valued at over half a million dollars and gated communities are situated in close proximity to rooming houses and apartment buildings providing housing for those less fortunate. \n",
      "This business model is based on my belief system that simplicity is elegant and less is definitely more. Our offerings will be based on recipes that have stood strong for generations and are based on the flavors brought by quality ingredients and love. We will offer daily specials prepared with fresh, local, GMO free ingredients sourced direct from farmers or purchased from local purveyors buying direct from same. There is nothing trendy or pretentious here, you will not find menu item descriptions with truffle oil or chocolate treats adorned with edible gold, no molecular gastronomy, no sous vide or liquid nitrogen, what you will find is good old fashioned cooking...we are not about the bling, just the bang! All takeout packaging etc will be made from recycled product and be recyclable and/or compostable with no exception. \n",
      "If we meet this fundraising goal our opening will be January, 2015...a new beginning in a new year. Should we come up short and ultimately receive no funding, as kickstarter is an \"all or nothing\" funding opportunity, we will not open.\n",
      "The Dream: For me, living the dream is being able to do what I love and share the bounty with those around me. This is not a get rich quick scheme and the dream has nothing to do with amassing \"fat stacks of cash\" or shiny new toys. There are no illusions of grandeur at 1958, we have no desire to build an empire, we are not interested in growing to become Stella's or WOW Hospitality. Over the past 4 months while doing renovations at 1958 I am regularly engaged in conversation with passers by who are all excited to have this restaurant join the community and are looking forward to our eventual opening. We have definitely created a buzz and are raring to go.\n",
      "The Plan: As in any solid business plan, we have crunched the numbers, done the market research and associated due diligence. Our plan is simple...work hard, have fun, make new friends, pay the staff, pay the bills and be happy.    This restaurant is about food, family, and community. Leftover prepared foods, soups, days old breads etc will be donated to local organizations in need...nothing is wasted or needlessly thrown in the trash, ever. \n",
      "The Hope: Our hope is to give back to the community through various offerings, such as teaching those on a budget how to feed a family of 4 people for under $10 a day; offering a fun day school lunch on occasion for a modest donation and provide adequate \"extra\" portions so no child goes without; ensuring everyone who walks through our door is fed something, regardless of their means. A portion of any monies raised over and above our goal will be shared with the community through goodwill offerings of \"share packages\" with baked treats and prepared foods for those in need, no charge community bar-b-ques, taking it to the street initiatives etc\n",
      "The Space: Our building has no natural gas service, so all appliances and fixtures are electric, including the heat which greatly reduces our carbon footprint. Our humble space at 761 Westminster Avenue with 12 seats, take-out and catering is more than enough to reach our goals, sustain and live the dream.\n",
      "The Now: what we have; refrigerated prep table, commercial cooler, ice cream freezer, stainless prep table, stools, tables and chairs, cabinets, dishes, flatware, most smallwares, shelving, pastry display case, vintage Coke cooler, signage, registered name \"one nine five eight\" with the Companies Office, most renovations complete (some plumbing yet to be done), all electrical complete, recipes, menu design, domain name, customers waiting in the wings and the desire to excel.\n",
      "The Future: what we need; your support through donations and of course, being a customer, commercial grease trap, flooring upgrade in prep kitchen area, commercial cooking appliance(s)...stove or convection, counters, permit and license fees, start-up inventory. Although tight, this fundraiser, if successful, will get us open and the rest will be up to us.\n",
      "Thank you for considering 1958. Together we can make this happen!\n",
      "Cheers,                                                                                               Ross\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The greatest challenges faced by 1958 have been the indecisiveness of the bureaucracy at both municipal and provincial levels...don't need commercial stove, then suddenly you do, a grease trap will not be required, then mysteriously it is, the floor will be OK as is, then later tell us the back area needs a new floor and on and on. For every challenge there is always a solution, the issue for 1958 is these challenges require money to resolve and I am all out of cash. Risks are obvious as in any start up, how long will it take someone to walk through the door once we open it, will there be enough revenue stream to offset expenses, will 1958 stand the test of time, will we do a good enough job etc. Our market research says we will be fine on all fronts.

      "We need money for three things. Film festival entry fees, to put it on IMDB (International Movie Data Base), to pay our actors and to fix the sound. OK four. We plan to do a festival run (submit it to festivals) for at least 6 months. This will gain us visibility and credibility. Get our work known. After that it will be distributed in some form.

      "OUR VISION - More than just a bakery and a cafeWe love food, and we want to share that love with Arkadelphia. We believe even the most familiar foods can be made into luxurious treats with fresh, local ingredients and a bit of care. From muffins to grilled cheese to pork tenderloin, we promise to wow you. Plus we'll prepare mouthwatering dishes you won't find anywhere else in town. In addition to a full bakery complete with fresh breads, cakes, and pastries, The Wild Hare will serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner six days a week in a roomy building downtown. A covered outdoor patio will add to the downtown's growing nightlife, and an inviting indoor dining room will also serve as a showcase for local artists. We'll have Arkadelphia's only kids' area, which is designed to provide calm activities to occupy the little ones while parents eat or visit with friends. And we'll have cooking classes, tastings with local artisans, and other inspiring events. We hope you will adopt The Wild Hare as your favorite place to meet a friend for coffee, study, get away for a special occasion, or play games with a group. Come often and stay as long as you want. (Check the FAQs below for additional information.)\n",
      "AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THE DOORS SOONERWe're already making changes to the building, purchasing equipment, and meeting with suppliers. The menu is complete, we have all our dishes, and we're about to start sprucing up the patio and building exterior. These are all things we anticipated. But in preparing to upgrade some of our utilities, we discovered that most or all of the building's wiring will need to be replaced, and we need to replace the existing air conditioning system in addition to installing a system to handle air in the kitchen. By supporting this Kickstarter campaign, you can be the difference we need to get the doors open sooner while making The Wild Hare \"your restaurant\" and earning great rewards!\n",
      "HOW WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPENKickstarter allows you to support projects you find compelling by choosing a reward and pledging at a level that is comfortable to you. You can back The Wild Hare by choosing one of the rewards to the right of this description and making a pledge (click the big green Back this Project button on the top right of the page--all financial details are handled by Amazon for your peace of mind). We only receive the money you pledge if our project is fully funded. That also means you only get your reward if we're fully funded, so be sure to encourage your friends and family to pledge, too! Make your pledge as soon as possible to contribute to the momentum!\n",

      "A FEW WORDS ABOUT REWARDS Most of our rewards are intended for folks who can pick them up at the restaurant once we open. A few rewards such as t-shirts, aprons, and some baked goods are available to our out-of-town supporters, and you can identify these by the \"Only Ships to the United States\" designation. If you don't see a reward that interests you or you have another reward in mind, please contact us using the Contact Me button above the rewards column. We'll add something to suit your needs.

However, the overwhelming outpouring of enthusiasm we have received from the community for The Wild Hare makes us optimistic that we will easily surpass our goal.\n",

      "We're far enough along in this process that we think we've identified the remaining challenges, which are primarily the electrical and air handling upgrades. However, until the doors open, there's always the possibility of encountering other difficulties including additional unforeseen remodeling challenges (though again, this is unlikely). If the project is funded and we encounter additional remodeling challenges, we anticipate continuing the project, though it may result in additional delays both in opening and in delivering rewards.\n",

In the event that sales do not meet our projections, we will consider changes to the menu, service structure, or other factors that may improve our chances of success without jeopardizing our commitment to use fresh, local ingredients and provide a quality experience for our customers.\n",

      "In a desperate attempt to escape one of his parent’s dinner parties, Brett takes off at a run down his driveway and runs straight into Corinne Calhoun. She’s carrying a metal box and claims to be delivering it to her uncle Jordi, but won’t tell Brett what’s in it. She offers to pay him in cigarettes if he’ll walk her there. He does, but the visit doesn’t go anything like he thought. He quickly realizes that he’s ended up in a part of Corinne’s life that she doesn’t share with anyone.\n",
      "About the project :\n",
      "Hello! I'm nearing the end of my time in film school and Borderline is going to be my final project. The story itself is something my writing partner and I created almost 3 years ago, and it's one that means a lot to both of us. Getting to make it now means more than I can put into words here, but needless to say, the goal is to execute what's been in our heads since the beginning.\n",
      "In order to do that, we need your help, lovely hero! Any money donated will go directly into the project in three very key ways: \n",
      "This will be small production overall. I will be rehearsing with the actors for the rest of this month into the beginning of September, and the shoot itself will take place over the 20th, 21st and 22nd in a variety of locations around the Seattle area. The finished project will be completed on the 15th of October and will then be submitted to open festivals.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The biggest problem I've run into on any set is a lack of planning and communication. I have made it a point to keep my crew members in the loop all throughout preproduction, and I made it a point to fully schedule the project as early as possible. We have dates for rehearsals, shot lists, production, foley and post-production set through October 15th of this year. I will also be rehearsing tougher scenes with my actors to ensure they are all comfortable with the material and with each other. I hope through a clear line of communication and planning that we will be able to cross bridges as they come rather than tackle mountains.\n",

      "Hey everyone! Erinn Peet Lukes here. I've been a pro musician for almost ten years. For the lion's share of those years I was working hard with my bluegrass band, Thunder and Rain. We started in Golden Colorado and ended up playing all over the state. We also toured Ireland and the UK . You may know me from our viral cover of Guns n Roses \"Sweet Child o Mine\", which reached 6 million views on YouTube in the winter of 2019. \n",
      "I had vocal surgery in November 2019 that put everything on pause.  It was the first break I took in years. It was scary, but by February 2020 I was ready to perform again. I was gearing up for a fun summer of tours with the band and getting back in the saddle. Unfortunately, the world had other plans!\n",
      "Thunder and Rain released our third album (that was generously funded on Kickstarter!) at an ill-fated time- January 2020. We had a second tour of the UK planned as well as festivals and gigs all over the country. I spent thousands on T Shirts, Vinyl, albums and publicity. \n",
      " I sat alone and watched my gigs get cancelled, one by one. My voice was healed, but I wouldn't have a chance to use it for.....at that time no one knew how long it was going to be! \n",
      "So I broke down to my core pieces. I rescued a dog. I wrote songs that popped out while doing home work outs. I was inspired by podcasts and Britney Spear's Instagram. I did a song challenge where I wrote everyday about different topics. I realized that after getting though a vocal injury and a global shutdown,  I was ready to take a risk. I sold my band van and all my furniture and moved to Nashville, TN.\n",
      "I came to town with some recordings from the quarantine that I was eager to finish. February gave me inspiration for two more, for a total of seven brand new songs!\n",
      "I reached out on a very helpful Facebook group for a woman to produce, and I was very lucky that Rachel Baiman answered the call. Rachel is a multi instrumentalist, singer, songwriter and producer who has been working it in Nashville for over 10 years. \n",
      "We listened to the influences and references I was inspired by - pop, 90's alt rock, bluegrass and country.  She assembled and truly badass team to record including Grammy award winning engineer Sean Sullivan behind the controls. We got electric guitar whiz Anthony Da Costa to set the mood for each track. We holed up in the Tractor Shed in Goodlettesville, Tennessee for a few days and laid down the tracks,\n",
      " I was able to pay for the studio time and musicians, the mixing, the mastering, two live videos, a music video, two photo shoots, album art, social media promo and a single premier with the money left over from selling the old band van as well as money from my own pocket that I made teaching lessons. The total I've spent so far on this project is $8,365.\n",
      "There's still more to go in terms of creation, promotion and cost. In this day and age there's no use recording something without promoting it, and Krista Mettler at Skye Media is already working hard on promo for the next single and video. Heartsville Records in Australia is working on international distro. I also have plans to make another music video for the third single.\n",
      "I have another problem on my hand- my closet is filled with Thunder and Rain merch. I never got to sell it because the band broke up before we had a chance to tour on the new album. \n",

      "After years of hearing people talk about it, I’ve been finally taking the time to read Rilke’s “Letter’s To a Young Poet” and there’ve been a few treasures in there. Today I read:\n",
      "“Being an artist means: not numbering and counting, but ripening like a tree, which doesn’t force its sap, and stands confidently in the storms of spring, not afraid that afterward summer may not come. It does come. But it comes only to those who are patient, who are there as if eternity lay before them, so unconcernedly silent and vast. I learn it every day of my life, learn it with pain I am grateful for: patience is everything!”\n",
      "I’d begun to feel that pain at the end of 2020, and it was accompanied by some guilt for not creating immediately during our mind-bending pandemic…and of course, not being able to tour and do what I do best took it’s toll on my sense of self and well-being. I definitely felt that a summer may not come.\n",
      "But...I surely wasn’t going anywhere.  Being stuck made it necessary to learn a new rhythm of life, how to walk daily and eat well, how to breathe intentionally and be present to my friends. I was learning patience, I guess.\n",
      "And then sometime in January of this year, I began to feel new growth around a set of songs and hymns that I’ve loved for years. I began to map them out in the studio, tweak arrangements and melody, discover what alternate tunings and new harmonic structure might do to these long-sung songs. And like anything that’s been growing in hidden places, I felt a strength and sturdiness to what was emerging.  \n",
      "So here I am, with a set of songs that already feel so strong.  I hope you'll come alongside and partner with me to see them fully grown!\n",

By combining art and music into a digital booklet and recording, a fuller, more expressive and passionate audio/visual experience can be experienced. In collaboration with renowned  composer Greg Hansen, we are creating a full 13 track album with each song dedicated and influenced by the traits of each historical dragon.  The album is already half finished so this kick starter is for the remaining amount of money to create the rest of the tracks and digital booklet.  \n",

The music has been recorded (it's gorgeous!) and the book has been written, but we need your help to bring it to the world.\n",
      "This album honors some of the greatest artists of Arabic music: Oum Kalthoum, Hamza el Din, Saleh and Daoud al Kuwaiti, and the music of the Mevlevi Sufi mystics. The book is a collection of 22 little stories that speak the history of these magnificent musicians and explore the concepts of lineage and healing. It's also filled with artwork painted while we recorded the album, and wonderful old photos of the artists.\n",
      "As musicians, we are profoundly indebted to all the artists and teachers who went before us, whose musical explorations and devotions became the notes that filled our heads as children. We wanted to honor all that we've received, and make it new. We recorded three original compositions alongside the classics. \n",
      "This is the 3rd studio album from The Epichorus. Based in Brooklyn, we are a melting pot of sound, rooted in the Arabic tradition, with other influences including Greek, North African, Jazz and more.  This is our first attempt at an instrumental recording. Ten of us gathered to record live in a circle at an old church converted studio outside Woodstock known as Dreamland. The Epichorus is led by composer and oud player, Rabbi Zach Fredman.\n",

      "Hi everyone!\n",
      "This is my first album as a singer and songwriter.\n",
      "I feel so excited about it that I can't wait to get you listen to it.\n",
      "This album came as a result of a 20 year personal research for  freedom of mind, spirit and body. \n",
      "\"Gotas de Libertad\" means \"Drops of Freedom\". \n",
      "After questioning myself about the urgency of \"being myself\" but still a part of my community, I eventually found my way. These are my first steps to a long career I wish to have as an Artist. \n",
      "I put all my heart in it and I am willing to share it with those souls who, like me, are in search of their truth. \n",
      "Each song represents a spiritual step forward, along this journey that is our life. They are, in a way, those things I found essential for keeping my soul truthful and I hope they be helpful for you as well. \n",
      "I think music can really help our souls to go back home. \n",
      "I hope this work will go to the hands of those of you who are desperately in seek of themselves and I hope this CD will help you somehow to find your own way to find happiness. \n",
      "It all started when in a lazy afternoon in October 2018,  I was trying to get myself entertained by playing the guitar. \n",
      "I had been going thought a very creative moment at that time. I used to hear music in my head all of a sudden, while walking along the street, or especially just as I woke up in the morning.\n",
      "I eventually decided to record those melodies that kept spinning around my head and one lazy afternoon in October 2018, as I was getting very bored being all alone at home,  I decided to take the guitar and get myself entertained. Whenever I do so I don't really know how long it is going to last! Sometimes it can be for long long hours.\n",
      "Anyway, that day I decided to find some chords for a melody I had been hearing in my head and I eventually succeeded to find the chords and the lyrics, too. \n",
      "I couldn't believe it! At the age of 40 I discovered I could write a song!!!\n",
      "I went back to it, to see if it was a true talent of mine or if it was just a stroke of luck. \n",
      "Well, you know what? I found that it was quite easy for me to put into music what I had been keeping in my heart for many many years: my thought, my feelings and wishes. \n",
      "I felt as a miracle was happening to me. Actually I had been seeking it for quite a long time! \n",
      "Since my early ages I felt I loved music very much, but only as an adult I really understood it was a real mission for me. \n",
      "After graduating I spent some years in Japan, England, then back to Italy and eventually in Spain, where l am based now. \n",
      "Music has been always there with me. I've always looked for opportunities to learn and share music with other people. \n",
      "When I decided to set my mind on music, I came across a wonderful book called \"The artist's way\" by Julia Cameron. \n",
      "This book took the best out of me. \n",
      "After discovering and applying her methodology, it happened to me to feel like a river was flooding out of the deepest part of me. I wrote my first song in English and then another in Italian and then another one in Spanish and all music was mine, too!!!\n",
      "I felt so blessed. I could really talk throught music about all the things that really matter to me: love, music, nature,  my beloved ones, my homeland, how to find myself as sn artist and the world around me!!!\n",
      "But making it into an album wasn't an easy thing!  \n",
      "I went through tough moments, ups and downs, that always come along together with happy ones.\n",
      "Eventually in April 2020, as the quarantine started,  I found myself caught in a great desire of sharing my music with people, that I couldn't help it.\n",
      "So I called Jaga Joel Gómez Arroyo to help me at the recording studio, César Vasconcelos and André Marchiori, two of the greatest Brasilian musicians in Barcelona to work on \"Il mare\" a bossa nova I wrote to express my deepest devotion for the sea and\n",
      "\"Samba blues\",  a fusion between two of my favorite styles. \n",
      "However my repertorie was quite varied and I needed more musicians to help me out to make my dream come true.\n",
      "For \"The Crescent moon bear\", I song I wrote which is based on the Japanese folktale Tsukina Waguma, I could count on Shyam Sunder at the bansuri and Jordi Rallo, at his wonderful tumbak, too. \n",
      "I couldn't believe it, it was really happening.\n",
      "Now I needed Raúl Sandin, with whom I've been making a duo for more than a year. He is an excellent guitarist and a great friend, too. I needed him to help me out with \"Chiaroscuro\", a song inspired by Caravaggio's paintings and \"Il mio Angelo\", a song for my dad. \n",
      "Objective achieved! My joy increased more and more!!! \n",
      "For \"Chiaroscuro\" we could also count on Andrea Duca with her violin and Frances Bartlett with her Cello! Wow!!\n",
      "If you wish to see Chiaroscuro video clip, check my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2e_nc34Vlc&t=12s\n",
      "I also had the great joy to have Danilo Blaiotta play \"Calabria\" and \"Estoy cambiando mi piel\", this time together with Filippo Bianchini.\n",
      "Least but not the last,  I had another song I had been wondering about as I didn't know how to arrange it: \"La hija de la Fortuna\". \n",
      "This song is based on the famous novel by Isabella Allende \"La hija de la Fortuna\".  \n",
      "I must say that was one of the biggest challenge I had to face. The song, in fact, is divided in 5 little songs. Each of them recreates one of the most signficant moments of Eliza Sommers' adventure between Chile and California.\n",
      "Thanks God, we could make it together with Cesar Vasconcelos at the guitar, Carlos Zambrano at the  trombone, Nico Correas at the drums and Joel at the second voice.\n",

Since this is a movie with a small cast, we won't need to worry about having a lot of money to pay a lot of actors. We will use locations we have at our disposal, and props and costumes will come from thrift stores, so we won't need much for those either. This project will be minimal, with as little spending as possible, due to the fact that a smaller budget is much easier to obtain than a big budget.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Since we started Bon Vivant as a local 100% grass-fed business in 2010 we have dreamed of bringing Real Food to a casual dining experience. We were baffled that such good food, which is so plentiful in our neighboring farms, was so hard to come by if we wanted to eat out, especially for a quick bite. Opening the café is a dream come true, and we are especially excited by the wonderful reception we have received from the local community.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a menu of 100% grass-fed meat, raw cheeses, dairy from 100% grass-fed cows and a plethora of other local foods, our menu is truly unique, and delicious! Whether you want to come in for a quick smoothie, almond butter brownie, or bring family and friends in for a full meal, we have you covered. In addition to having a great time, you’ll know you’re eating the best food local farms have to offer. We also have great options for people following Paleo, gluten-free and vegetarian diets without compromising a dash of flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "You may have already seen some of the improvements we’ve made to the space since we took over the business in July. We are so excited to be able to bring Real Food to our Del Ray neighbors, but we have a few improvements we’d like to make that are beyond our current scope of finances. We feel these improvements will be such a wonderful addition to your experience at Bon Vivant that we hope you may want to be a part of it! \n",
      "\n",
      "Del Ray is such a friendly neighborhood and being able to sit outside a café watching people walk by, and bumping into friends without leaving your comfy seat and good food is what life is all about. We’re excited at the possibility of offering that experience for you at our café.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for taking the time to read about us and our pending projects, below are the details of what we are hoping to achieve, and we truly appreciate your donation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we raise $18,000\n",
      "We can add a beautiful patio in the front for outdoor dining. Permits are already in place, we just need the funding! It will give everyone a great outdoor environment to enjoy, something that we have been sorely missing during the summer. We still have a few good weather months left and we’d love to have the outdoor seating there for everyone to enjoy year round, weather permitting! Don’t worry about the flowers, while the planters will be taken out, smaller planter boxes are part of our outdoor dining design. \n",
      "If we raise $29,000\n",
      "We can do the outdoor dining and upgrade our kitchen. Unfortunately the kitchen is not a full kitchen and this prohibits us from being able to offer many things like a full breakfasts (with our local eggs and bacon!) or grill up our delicious 100% grass-fed steak or hamburger. Imagine the possibilities! \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We have done our homework on the two projects we'd like to complete, but that doesn't mean things will happen in the time frame we'd like! We know what it is going to take to complete the outdoor patio and the kitchen upgrade. However we are still at the will of the contractors. We anticipate that we can complete the patio in about two weeks from breaking ground, and we have estimates approved for all the costs. While there is a possibility that the job may take longer due to unforeseen circumstances (weather, conflicting schedules of contractor vendors etc), the cost is set in stone, so we know it will be finalized with the funding we are hoping to raise.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to this we have already done some work on our space and have very reliable contractors that know what they are doing. They are also great at getting work done when our cafe is closed to minimize the affects on our day-to-day business.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the kitchen, we have also fully evaluated the installation of a hood and stove. There is already a gas line to the kitchen, and since we are lucky to have a large kitchen area, the disruption to regular business for the process of adding these things will be minimal, and it will definitely be an improvement that everyone will enjoy!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "• In January 1976, the first issue of PUNK Magazine #1 was published. It changed the world. That first issue created the anti-disco movement, transformed Lou Reed from glam-rock burnout into “The Godfather of Punk,” and heralded The Ramones as the most important punk-rock band in the world. Its hand-lettered graphics also inspired a fanzine movement that featured many more crude and badly-produced fanzines, such as England’s “Sniffin’ Glue” (by Mark P.), “Ripped and Torn” (by Tony P.) and Scotland’s “Next Big Thing” (by Lindsay Hutton), as well as “Slash,” “Flipside” and “Search And Destroy” in the USA, among many, many other ‘zines across the universe.  \n",
      "• The first issue of PUNK Magazine was developed, created written, drawn and printed in a very short time: Mid-November 1975 to New Year’s Eve 1976. It appeared three months before the Ramones first album and a year before the first Sex Pistols record were released. It didn’t cash in on a popular movement; PUNK Magazine created it.  \n",
      "• The radical look of PUNK magazine—hand-lettered editorials and page layouts, feature articles presented in photo-comic formats, and a cover that caricatured Lou Reed as a horror comic icon—created an authentic visual \"punch-in-the-mouth\" for what we insisted was a genuine social movement, and it became a knockout. “Punk Rock” before PUNK magazine appeared was a vaguely-defined term that described the New York Dolls, the Bay City Rollers, AC/DC, The Standells, the pub-rock bands popular in England at the time (Eddie and The Hot Rods, The Stranglers, etc.), and many mediocre rock bands who appeared atat CBGB. After PUNK Magazine appeared, punk rock was about the Ramones, The Dictators and the Dead Boys in the USA and the Damned, the Sex Pistols and The Clash in the UK. Thousands of great bands have emerged since then. \n",
      "• PUNK was the first media outlet that viewed the downtown scene at CBGB as more than just a new music scene: It was a social schism separating the previous late ‘60s-based rock culture that was dominating the East Village at the time and replacing it with a new aesthetic, based on the original bohemian and beatnik elements that preceded the hippie movement. In other words, PUNK foresaw a \"New 'Hood Order.\" Within a few years, most of the hippie shops in the East Village had disappeared and a few dozen punk rock shops were doing good business. \n",
      "• PUNK Magazine was often descibed as a “fanzine” in the 1970s, suggesting a small circulation and a limited editoiral viewpoint. In fact PUNK was a legitimate newsstand publication, publishing 25,000 copies that went to newsstands and subscribers before its demise a few months later. Although it sometimes utilized the elements of fanzines for parody, PUNK would be more properly described as an “artzine.” It was definitely the first “punk ‘zine.” inspiring many other magazines and fanzines in its wake, notably “Sniffin’ Glue” and “Search And Destroy” in England, and “Slash” in the USA.\n",
      "• On January 14th, 2016, PUNK magazine’s artists, cartoonists and illustrators will mark the publication of the first issue with a group gallery show at “Howl! Happening: An Arturo Vega Project,” located in the heart of the East Village, a stone’s throw away from where the CBGB club and Arturo Vega’s loft (where Joey and Dee Dee Ramone lived with him in the 1970s) were located until a few years ago. \n",
      "• This kickstarter campaign will enable fans of PUNK (and non-fans who think this is a good investment), to purchase stuff from the Howl! Happening gallery space, as well as PUNK Magazine stuff. For instance, PUNK #19, which featured The Bullys on the cover, will be a more interesting item now that the band’s music can be heard on the PUNK kickstarter video. They’re great, right? \n",
      "• The exhibition catalog will include writing from James Wolcott, Steve Heller and Carlo McCormick, as well as an article about Ged Dunn, Jr., PUNK Magazine’s founding publisher (by John Holmstrom), as well as lots of graphics and stuff from the original PUNK Magazine and details about the artists in the show: Each of them contributed to cover images for PUNK. I think this catalog will become the next PUNK Magazine collectible. As everyone knows, our back issues sell for too much money on eBay, well, this is an effort to reprint them and make them more accessible. So if we make enough money from this kickstarter, we can plan reprinting other issues. But we will need a huge response to do that, reproducing PUNK #1 and putting together this kickstarter campaign? UGH! Too much work! \n",
      "Okay, that’s our pitch.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "All of the kickstarter incentives have been produced, the show opening on January 14 at Howl Happening: An Arturo Vega Project is being handled by a very professional crew, and PUNK Magazine, Inc. was reincorporated in 2001 and has published several new issues and produced a pretty cool book (The Best of PUNK Magazine by Harper/Collins imprint: !T Books). \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Godlis, whose book of his wonderful photos he took at CBGB, has been an unofficial advisor on this kickstarter project. \n",
      "\n",
      "We don't foresee serious obstacles, unless someone breaks a leg or something. This is, after all, New York City, site of Hurricane Sandy, several blackouts, many riots, and other crazy things (like punk rock).\n",
      "--------portahl/the-watch-you-are-missing-peacemaker-by-portahl------\n",
      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Women have their little black dress. Men will have their staple black watch, designed and engineered by pOrtahl. We at pOrtahl designed and created the watch you are missing, inspired by high-end watch customizers from around the world. \n",
      "Below is a list of reasons why pOrtahl's Peacemaker is the watch you are missing:\n",
      "This is your chance to own a 'Founders Edition' Peacemaker watch, packed with features and designed with you in mind at just a fraction of the retail price. Your reward for believing in us so early on. Bragging rights incoming!\n",
      "Allow us to tell you our story.  👇\n",
      "We have for a long time been inspired by the creations of famous high-end watch customizers such as MAD Paris, Blaken and Artisans de Genève - often referred to as watch artisans. They challenge the status quo and rethink classic watch designs to fit today’s design standards. A customized watch like that can easily set you back tens of thousands of dollars. \n",
      "So, we decided to take matters into our own hands. We started pOrtahl to incorporate these customized watch styles popularized by the artisans into our brand DNA. We do this by making it our mission to create watches that are remarkable by their color, material and design.\n",
      "After two years of blood, sweat and tears we are finally launching The Watch You Are Missing.\n",
      "We did a ton of research in order to find and incorporate the best features for your money, with the goal of creating a mid-range everyday watch. This watch was designed by us at pOrtahl, incorporating our vision on watch design and inspired by the boldness of the artisans. We interviewed peers on their frustrations, we scoured countless of watch fora and we worked closely with our focus group of over 3,000 members on Facebook. After lots of experimenting and four different prototypes these are the features you will get when you purchase your very own pOrtahl Peacemaker.\n",
      "Peacemaker was forged from aerospace grade 5 titanium, also known as the metal of the Gods. It is ~5x stronger than stainless steel, at only half the weight. We optimized for the perfect weight so that the watch feels hefty in the hand, but effortless around the wrist.\n",
      "Titanium offers many benefits over stainless steel, more commonly used by watch brands. Titanium is more expensive to source and harder to work than steel, however we strongly believe that the advantages of titanium are more than worth the extra cost.\n",
      "Our titanium case and bracelet are fortified with a matte black 'Diamond-Like Carbon' (DLC) surface treatment. Additionally we added a fingerprint resistant coating and a sweat resistant coating. Your watch shall remain rust and stain free and oh yeah, unlike most stainless steel watches it's anti-allergic!\n",
      "We paid extra attention to the quality of our DLC surface treatment. We have tested and re-tested several coating methods in collaboration with our coating partner, to improve the quality of the coating to the highest standards. \n",
      "Every link in the bracelet has been coated individually, allowing for a more even distribution of coating molecules along the surface of the bracelet.\n",
      "The beating heart of Peacemaker is a customized Swiss made STP 1-11 Hi-beat automatic movement. It has 26 jewels and beats at a rate of 28,800 vibrations per hour. That's 8 beats per second! With a 44 hours power reserve it's no problem to enjoy a mindful Sunday without knowing the time, only to slide it back on your wrist on Monday morning - still running.\n",
      "A Little Bit About STP...\n",
      "“Driven by passion, powered by innovation”\n",
      "In 2006, a small group of entrepreneurs decided to develop mechanical movements and produce them in Swiss Jura. In keeping with the motto \"driven by passion, powered by innovation\", fascinating mechanical movements of outstanding quality were created and are produced on state-of-the-art assembly lines, some of which have been developed by STP itself. \" (source: swisstp.com)\n",
      "Curious to learn more about our movement manufacturing partner, Swiss Technology Production? Have a look at the video below to discover how they manufacture outstanding movements such as the STP1-11.\n",
      "Let's compare our STP1-11 to the most popular movements used by microbrands today and you'll see why we chose the STP1-11 as our movement of choice for Peacemaker.\n",
      "Peacemaker sports a 40 mm case - ideal for the average size men's wrist. We wanted to make this watch as slim, yet robust as possible and we did just that. Peacemaker's case is just 11 mm thick (!!), yet has 10 ATM water resistance. Engraved into the sides of the case are the pOrtahl brand name and the titanium periodic element (Ti). Peacemaker's movement is visible through the open sapphire glass caseback. \n",
      "The bracelet's solid end links connect seamlessly to the case - which means no ugly gaps. We hate ugly gaps. The lugs of the case reach slightly past the second link, reducing rattle of the bracelet. The links on the oyster bracelet can be individually removed through its pin system, ensuring lasting sturdiness. No loose screws. We also hate loose screws.\n",
      "Fixed to the top of the case around the sapphire glass you'll find our scratch-free matte black ceramic bezel sporting our signature seconds engravings. The inscriptions are only showing the prime numbers on a sunburst circumference. The 'EIGHT PER SECOND' inscription is a reference to the amount of beats per second of our Swiss automatic movement.\n",
      "An everyday watch should be able to take a punch. Our sapphire glass on the front and back of the case offers the very best clarity and scratch resistance your money can buy. We applied not one, not two, but five layers of anti-reflective coating to the inside of the glass, ensuring an unblemished view of the passing of time.\n",
      "Our DLC coated milled solid steel clasp is your security against sleight of hand thieves, who are sure to want a pOrtahl of their own. But they won't get yours. We did hours of research to find the right balance between security and ease. This fold over, double push-button clasp with safety makes for a two-step removal, giving thieves a hard time trying to steal your pOrtahl. The clasp provides 6 micro-adjustment holes for the perfect fit.\n",
      "Every King needs a crown and on the Peacemaker it's located off-center at the 4-hour position. This makes for increased visibility of the pOrtahl ring on the face of the crown when holding a glass of wine or a beer. The lume portal on the crown will illuminate at night catching the eyes of passersby. The perfect conversation starter.\n",
      "The Peacemaker's electroplated black dial provides a minimal, yet mesmerizing aesthetic. In the top half of the dial you will find our brand name, with the '◯', representing the (soon to be) iconic pOrtahl logo at the center line. \n",
      "In the bottom half you can find the name of the watch -  'PEACEMAKER'. Underneath is the proof that you were here first and are part of the pOrtahl Founders Collective. Exclusively for Kickstarter backers we added a 'FOUNDERS EDITION' inscription.\n",
      "The Hours and Minutes Hands\n",
      "Our polished gunmetal hour and minute hands tell the time on the Peacemaker. The hour and minute hands were inspired by both the Rolex Daytona and Zenith El Primero. The hands are injected with 5 layers of bright blue BGW9 Super-LumiNova®, allowing you to tell time in the dark.\n",
      "The Seconds Hand\n",
      "Our customly designed seconds hand sports our signature counterweight on the back and the pOrtahl blue tip. It's designed to nearly reach the edge of the dial where it draws its perfect circles along the border of the dial.\n",
      "During the day Peacemaker is designed to be modestly minimalistic, but at night...  At night the watch comes alive as our signature lume portals light up in the dark. These lume portals, powered by Swiss Super-LumiNova® are featured around the dial and on the crown.\n",
      "We were aiming for the perfect size for everyday wear. Not too big, as slim as possible and effortless around the wrist. We believe this is it.\n",
      "We have designed pOrtahl's Peacemaker from scratch and in this chapter we want to share our vision on watch design with you. We'll explain the reason behind some of the choices we've made so that you may better understand what makes Peacemaker so special. \n",
      "At pOrtahl we have 5 design goals that make up our design ethos for any watch that we are ever going to create.\n",
      "1. Something you choose every day - Our watches are tempting to put on every single morning.\n",
      "2. A conversation piece - Our watches are conversation starters and we'll give you a story to tell.\n",
      "3. Lasting lifetimes - Our watches are engineered to last and to be passed on from father to son.\n",
      "4. The best possible experience - Our watches are designed with you in mind.\n",
      "5. Making every time telling occasion special - Our watches invoke the same feeling of excitement as when you saw your pOrtahl for the first time - every single time you look at your watch.\n",
      "Surface Treatments (DLC)\n",
      "One of the things we are most proud to bring to you is our matte black DLC (diamond-like carbon) coating, a best in class surface treatment. This coating provides some damage control and makes sure that your pOrtahl is able to take a punch. This provides  some extra peace of mind. \n",
      "Feedback from our focus group pointed out that black DLC coatings can vary in quality and durability, which is why we decided to test several methods of surface treatments. We created a coating process that coats every link individually, allowing for a better and more even distribution of the coating molecules along the surface of the bracelet, hence a more durable coating.\n",
      "'Men's Staple Black Watch'\n",
      "Why did we choose black? Women have their little black dress. Men will have their staple black watch, designed and engineered by pOrtahl. Peacemaker is a unique addition to every watch collection and at the same time it is also the perfect everyday watch for the one-watch-guy. A black watch just goes well with anything you wear. \n",
      "Another reason we chose black is the paradox of choice. Successful people such as Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Barack Obama are known for wearing the same outfit every day. This is mainly to limit the number of choices they have to make and to save their brain capacity for more important decisions throughout the day. Your matte black pOrtahl Peacemaker will always be a good option.\n",
      "Minimalism\n",
      "We firmly believe a watch is no longer worn for its primary function - i.e. telling time. It is worn to make a statement. That's exactly what we were going for with many of our design choices. A statement. You'll notice that the indices we designed have a minimalistic aesthetic. They disappear and appear depending on how the light catches the dial. Combined with our custom seconds bezel inscriptions they are more than enough for getting a quick glimpse of the time.\n",
      "Super slim\n",
      "Slimness has been a persistent trend in modern product design. Slim phones, slim laptops and many other products that we use daily take up as little space as possible in our lives. We wanted to make our watch as slim as we possibly could so that it easily slides through sleeves and doesn't look or feel clunky on the wrist like many other watches do. \n",
      "To create a watch this thin (11 mm) there are a couple of choices we have made to make it all possible. \n",
      "1. The movement. A movement for the large part decides how thin the case can possibly be. Our Swiss made STP1-11 offers the perfect balance between the features and quality we want to offer you and its sexy slimness.\n",
      "2. The glass. We chose flat sapphire glass on both the front and back of the watch.\n",
      "3. The bezel. We chose a non-rotational bezel as rotational bezels significantly increase the thickness of a watch. \n",
      "4. Water resistance. 10 ATM water resistance again gave us the perfect balance between slimness and the right features we want to offer. More than 10 ATM is just unnecessary for most people. Casual swimming with a 10 ATM watch is perfectly fine and let's face it, how many of us are really scuba diving with our favorite watch? Yeah, that's what we thought.\n",
      "Getting rid of tiny frustrations\n",
      "We tried to get rid of all of our little frustrations that both we and our friends have had wearing various types of watches over the years. \n",
      "1. Off-center crown. We put the crown off-center on the 4-hour position so as to prevent it from poking into your hand too much when bending your wrists (for instance when you play sports). This also prevents the watch from getting stuck behind things.\n",
      "2. Extended lugs. Some watches have watch bands with too much sideways mobility in between the links of the bracelet, making the watch feel cheap and flimsy. We have extended the lugs on the Peacemaker slightly past the gap between the end link and the second link. This prevents the bracelet from \"rattling\" too much and provides a more sturdy and high quality feel.\n",
      "3. Knurled pattern. The pattern on the side of the crown is knurled allowing for more grip when pulling it out, setting the time or hand winding the movement. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to get your freshly cut fingernail under the crown of a watch to pull it out.\n",
      "4. Pins over screws. We have experienced this ourselves and clearly, we are not alone. Watch fora are full of complaints about screws in bracelets loosening over time. Pins may be a little harder to replace, but they add lots of longevity to your bracelet.\n",
      "Safety\n",
      "Thieves will always want what you have. But even if it isn't stolen, losing something you love is one of the worst feelings one can have. That's why we added a fold over, double push-button clasp, with safety - which makes for a two-step removal - providing some extra security around the wrist.\n",
      "After reading horror stories from people losing their watch because they didn't tighten a loose screw in time, we found yet another reason for pins over screws. \n",
      "Additionally, we chose not to add a quick release spring as this too creates a single point of weakness for either theft or loss of your watch.\n",
      "These are all decisions we've made to ensure your watch stays around your wrist.\n",
      "Doing things differently (instead of creating another silver diver)\n",
      "We love product design and are always looking for ways to improve on current design standards. That's why, instead of creating yet another silver diver, we wanted to create something different. Something inspired by the bespoke watch artisans that go against the grain. \n",
      "1. The '◯'. Most brand names, like regular names, are written with a capital letter at the beginning of the word. In our case, however, pOrtahl is written with a lowercase 'p' and an uppercase 'O'. \n",
      "The '◯' is the very core of our brand DNA. It represents the portal through which you escape from the often immense pressure of modern day life on every time-telling occasion. The '◯' is therefore what we want to emphasize in our brand name. It is incorporated into the design in many ways.\n",
      "2. The off-center logo. It may take some getting used to, but it was a conscious design choice to have the '◯' at the centerline of the dial, putting the rest of the brand name off-center to again emphasize our brand identity.\n",
      "3. Lume portals. Although the Peacemaker may be humbly minimalistic during the day, it comes alive at night thanks to the different Swiss Super-LumiNova® lume portals lighting up around the dial and on the crown. This will soon be a way to recognize who is one of us, even in the absence of light.\n",
      "Packaging\n",
      "We started out sketching and designing metal and lacquer high-end watch boxes for our watches. During this design process, we gathered feedback from our focus group on Facebook on this idea. When we told them what we were working on, however (to our surprise) most people in our group recommended us not to go for a metal or wooden box since they would just throw it out anyway. It seems most people will not save watch boxes (or any boxes for that matter). It was recommended to us that we'd go for a hard paper box as this can still provide a very high quality experience, yet at the same time, it reduces our carbon footprint and it is much easier to recycle. That's how we pivoted to luxury hard paper boxes for our packaging.\n",
      "pOrtahl offers a 2-year international warranty on our Peacemaker watch, meaning we will repair or replace your Peacemaker watch within 2 years of delivery if it suffers any mechanical, manufacturing or assembly defects. This warranty does not cover damages resulting from misuse, or any cosmetic damage such as scratches or marks to the finish, which under the conditions of the warranty constitute regular wear and tear. Opening of the caseback outside of an authorized repair will render the warranty null and void. In the unlikely event that your Peacemaker suffers from a mechanical defect, please contact us immediately and we will offer you a fitting solution.\n",
      "Our campaign is designed to deliver\n",
      "As you may know, many Kickstarter projects offer their backers tons of design options to customize their products, creating not just a paradox of choice for the backer, but also a lot of logistic complexity to the project. After all, all variants have to be manufactured according to order and shipped out to the right person.\n",
      "After analyzing tons of projects and meticulously going through their comment sections to learn from their mistakes it became clear to us that almost every project that offered customization would not deliver on time or too often delivered the wrong goods.  \n",
      "At pOrtahl we are focused on our promise to deliver. We have worked tirelessly for the past two years to bring you the watch you are missing and we firmly believe that this is it. No customization needed. We aim to deliver your watch on time, to your doorstep, as promised.\n",
      "Here's a timeline of some of the milestones we have achieved leading up to our launch. It's been an amazing journey and we are so grateful to finally launch our watch on Kickstarter. There is much more to come for pOrtahl!\n",
      "My name is Alain (on the right) and I co-founded pOrtahl together with Jordi (on the left). We met when Jordi became my supervisor, back when I was doing an internship at a marketing agency in 2015. We became best friends over our shared love for product design and we started working together shortly after finishing my internship. We have been talking about creating a watch together ever since we met, but we finally started working on it right before the pandemic hit. \n",
      "For the past two years we have been working on 'The Watch We Were Missing'. Now, after many setbacks, successes, obstacles, victories, coffees, beers and tweaks we are extremely proud to show you what has since become 'The Watch You Are Missing'! This is Peacemaker. It's been an incredible journey and we are so, so close to making this dream a reality. We need your help to do it. \n",

      "We launched our first campaign on Kickstarter over 8 years ago. Since that time, we've evolved as a company and learned a lot. Your support has been integral to where we are today and we cannot thank the Kickstarter community enough.\n",
      "Kickstarter has opened doors we didn't even know existed. We've formed genuine friendships with backers, hired backers as employees, traveled around the world with backers, and developed trust and community with backers.

      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "This is our 7th Kickstarter campaign so we know enough to know that we face some risks and challenges. This same experience will be invaluable in overcoming any challenge we might face. Let's talk through some of the possible challenges.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Transitioning from prototype to full-scale manufacturing. Currently, we have fully functioning prototypes from the same factory that will make our full production run so we anticipate manufacturing to go smoothly. Furthermore, since there is no major tooling required, it mitigates many of the major unknowns. However, full-scale manufacturing is always different than making a small run of prototypes. We have a well-respected manufacturing partner, and they have been responsive to any feedback we've shared.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Global supply chains and logistics. This has been an ongoing issue facing many industries over the past year. During our most recent campaign, we experienced increased container shipping costs, slower shipping timelines, and continued risk of lockdowns in countries like China.  There is the risk of additional lock-downs in the countries we manufacture in.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. This is a project and we're using Kickstarter to create something new! That means that things such as design, features, accessories, and any/all aspects of the project are fluid and a work in progress! We've done our best to present our project transparently and honestly - and it's our full intention to deliver everything as shown on the campaign page and video. However, as creators, it's ultimately our job to bring the best version of the project to life - both for backers and for us. That means things can change throughout the campaign and after.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Lessons learned from past campaigns:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Keep it simple. This has probably been our #1 biggest lesson learned and one that really impacted our most recent campaign. As a creator, there is always a temptation to try to do everything - add more features, more accessories, more add-ons, more, more, more! This can make for an exciting campaign, but the fun quickly evaporates post-campaign. That's why we've made neon buffalo as minimalist as possible and kept the weight variations to three options. Simple.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Underpromise and overdeliver. We're optimists at heart - it's essential for us as creators to have a positive and hopeful attitude. However, we've learned the need to balance that mentality with realistic expectations. Especially when setting deadlines and communicating with backers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Communicate more than you think is necessary. We always strive to be transparent and keep our backers updated. However, in our most recent campaign backers seemed to want more communication. We'll communicate more frequently during this campaign.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We hope that sharing these risks and challenges gives you more confidence in us: to be honest, transparent, and ultimately bring this project to life in the best way possible. We are excited to get going!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "cord 1 is a cable management object from artifactual, a product design studio based in Atlanta, Georgia. Precisely-machined from solid 6061-T6 aluminum, cord 1 provides a secure anchor point for the many wires, cables, and cords that power our modern lives.\n",
      "Designed to be a beautiful and functional addition to any desk, cord 1 features an inverted channel that ensures cables remain securely captured during use. Reusable micro-suction pads on its base enable it to attach to a wide range of surfaces, again and again.\n",
      "Design \n",
      "cord 1's geometry is simple; it was designed to be a functional object that seamlessly integrates into any setting. To properly retain cables, cord 1's channel had to be large enough to accommodate a wide variety of cables, but small enough that those cables' plugs could not pass through. After a number of iterations, cord 1's 4mm channel is compatible with all of the most popular cables that power our favorite devices, from Magsafe to Lightning to USB-C.\n",
      "Material\n",
      "cord 1 is machined from solid billets of 6061-T6 aluminum, an aerospace-grade alloy of aluminum that has excellent material properties. It is anodized to a beautiful grey finish, providing it with an aesthetic and protective coating. \n",
      "Attachment \n",
      "cord 1 is secured with 0.8mm-thick micro-suction pads, which feature millions of tiny cavities that function as suction cups, each forming partial vacuums when pressed against surfaces and producing a strong suction force.These micro-suction pads don't leave a sticky residue, and can be rinsed under water to restore their \"stickiness\". cord 1 has been tested on a variety of surfaces; sealed wood, metal, plastic, ceramic, glass.\n",
      "Manufacturing \n",
      "Our production partners are located in Shenzhen, China, the manufacturing center of the world, and we have been working closely with them over the past few months to prototype cord 1 and to ensure that it is optimized for full-scale production. \n",
      "Manufacturing is the main driver of cost for cord 1. In the CNC-machining production process, cost is directly tied to both the setup time and the cutting time required to machine each part out of metal. With larger production runs, the cost of the setup time can be distributed, bringing down the cost of each unit. Our funding goal reflects a production run of 100 units, bringing the unit cost down enough for cord 1 to be manufactured, shipped to artifactual HQ, packaged, and then delivered at a reasonable cost to our backers.\n",
      "Project Timeline\n",
      "About Us \n",
      "Hi, I'm John Kiernan-Lewis, a mechanical engineer with over six years of experience in product design and manufacturing. From camera tripods to child car seats, I have had the opportunity to guide products through all stages of development, from first sketch to mass-production. \n",
      "artifactual was founded in 2021 to foster the development of functional, thoughtfully-designed objects. We are so excited to launch our first product, cord 1, and to deliver it to desks, nightstands, and countertops all around the world!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The past few years have taught us that the global supply chain is fragile. We are confident in our manufacturer, and in the wide-spread availability of materials required to make cord 1. We look forward to tackling the unknown challenges that inevitably arise when making new things.\n",

      " Environmental disasters are occurring around the world with increasing regularity and severity, and they are affecting larger portions of our Earth and devastating ever-greater segments of the population. Disasters are becoming a more frightening reality no matter where we live. Most of us watch televised images of these disasters, separated from their wrath by the relative safety of distance, as if we are watching a movie and not a real event. \n",
      "A previous work of mine, “War: Ongoing Project,” stirred viewers and brought them to a new realization of the costs of war. This environment  project will alert them to the emotional costs for humans as a result of global warming and climate changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This project aims to immerse viewers into the aftermath of a natural disaster, allowing them to experience the personal trauma and loss so many suffer. \n",
      "The “ENVIRONMENT/MAZE”, created with Hugh Levick, will consist of several large areas, each with a distinctive environmental disaster-related theme. Maze passages will connect each area, but false leads, police barriers; artistic structures and a variety of storm debris will present obstacles to the participants. The idea is to disorient the viewer, causing confusion and frustration similar to what would be felt in a real disaster where one would not find clear paths to relief or safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "The themes of each area will vary, representing fire, storm, flood, wind, rain, etc. Within these areas will be constructed sculptural debris, abstract figures of distressed people or animal bodies, sometimes hung from the ceiling. Fans may be used to generate winds, and mirrors may be installed to create illusions of space and to further the sense of disorientation. The viewer will be exposed to these elements from all angles, increasing the sense of complete immersion into the experience.\n",
      " \n",
      "A very loud and intense sound will emanate from one area. This sound, a combination of music and the actual cries of distressed people, will be an audio theme throughout the exhibit. \n",
      " In another area, overhead projectors will cover the floor with an image of rippling water. Against one wall there will be an oversized, blackened canopy bed in ruins. It will be covered with debris, the moldy canopy intertwining with lathe and plaster. Over the bed and cascading, like a waterfall or broken levy, from the wall to the floor will be a flow of crumpled paper.

Space won’t limit the effectiveness of the project, but it could alter its appearance somewhat by location. \n",

      "\n",
      "Paintings and sculptures breathe life into empty spaces; so much so, that the many mannequins seem to move on their own. \n",
      "Nowhere else in the world can you see its equal. It has attracted attention from all over the nation, and has been featured in documentaries in at least two other countries. Once it nearly spawned a television program when it became one of the top attractions in the State of West Virginia. \n",
      "Just when it seemed that things could only get better, in 2013 the House of Art had to suddenly shut its doors and journey forward once again to find a home for its Appalachian artists and their creations. \n",
      "A year passed, and it seemed like nothing was going to happen.\n",
      "Then a generous donation was made. \n",
      "A private investor has given us the opportunity to fix this building up and three years to return the investment. The property at 900 Mercer St. is nearly 100 years old and was, for many years, the old Virginia Bank of Commerce. Other than a drably painted vault door, there was little to be seen in this now deadened place, but quickly The House of Art began restoring the building back to its former glory. \n",
      "In no time  carpets were pulled up, revealing the original tile floors. Walls were torn down, along with drop ceilings and useless mechanical equipment, revealing a three bay coffered ceiling that was nearly two feet thick and filled with dental molding. After only a month, the original historic qualities of the building began to shine through. \n",

      "Gary Bowling is the president and co-founder of the gallery. His art is his autobiography. It reflects moments of his daily life, fingerprints of his emotions, thoughts, and attitudes at the time of execution. Using a wide range of mediums (watercolors, oils, acrylics, etc.), he transforms wood, paper, and canvas into transitional reflections.\n",
      "His art is inherently versatile, and depicts progressive-microcosms with universal appeal. With varying degrees of subtlety, Bowling incorporates pundits, philosophy, satire, and humor. Beauty embraces wit and wisdom. With adaptations of materials, techniques and forms, Bowling integrates traditional basics with unique treatments. The unexpected embraces tradition.\n",
      "Bowling has participated in art shows from New York to Miami. His paintings, however, have spanned the globe with their popularity. Private collectors are responsible for his global recognition. His national recognition comes from state and federal governments, as well as private collectors. Examples of his works can be seen in state and federal exhibits, including, but not limited to, the Smithsonian.\n",
      "Jody Queen\n",
      "Queen is a self-taught artist who is ever-focused on the minute detail that makes every subject unique and ultimately brings it to life. his work is startlingly realistic and invites us to examine more closely the meticulous regard for the textures that give everyday objects their singularity. Queen works primarily in layered graphite, enjoying the range of expression the medium allows. he also works in wood, acrylics, and mixed media. Following the dream of sharing his love of art, Queen is the co-founder and vice-president of Gary Bowling's House of Art,  His work has also been juried into Tamarack, the Best of West Virginia.\n",
      "Jamie Powers\n",
      "Powers is an acrylic painter and a mixed media artist.  The paintings are usually horror-themed, of which some are fiction, while others are based on reality. He was born in the dark hollows of southwest Virginia, the son of a coal miner, and grew up in McDowell County, West Virginia.\n",
      "He graduated Big Creek High School in 1996, then went on to study at the Columbus College of Art and Design, majoring in Illustration. He graduated in the spring of 2001.\n",
      "He has worked as a freelance illustrator, but now focuses more on the fine arts.  He has shown work at The House of Art in Bluefield, WV from 2010-2014, in a group exhibition called “Thinking Like a Mountain” at the Southwest Virginia Community College in 2010, and later at Bluefield College in 2012. He  also displayed work at Kulture Klash 7 in Charleston, South Carolina in 2011, and at The East End Artmares exhibitions in Charleston, WV from 2010-2012.  He was just juried into The Allied Artists of West Virginia show at the Huntington museum.\n",
      "Jamie is still creeping around the coalfields of southern WV, being inspired by all the real monsters in the region.\n",
      "Isaac Preston \n",
      "Preston has been with the House of Art crew for roughly six years, and many of his works have been created and displayed at the gallery. He presented an art show with 'The Artful Lawyer' gallery in Blacksburg, VA in 2013, and his work is also featured in the Appalachian Arts Center in Wardell, VA and the Riff Raff Arts Collective in Princeton, WV. Preston uses recyclables as his primary medium, and he is also known for his works in wire sculpture. He is also active with the Hinton, WV theater group Ars Creo, and  acted with the Planet Extreme Teen Center in Princeton, WV in their production of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' in which he played Willie Wonka. When time allows, he poses as a live model for artists, and performs hand percussion and spoken word at open stage events. He has also conducted workshops for his wire work. Originally centered in Bluefield, WV, Preston hopes that reestablishing in the Princeton area will give him, and other artists, a great opportunity to share their passion with others. He seeks to inspire  new generations to follow their passion and spread happiness whenever possible.\n",
      "Rita Montrosse\n",
      "Is a native to West Virginia and has taught art for 34 years at Princeton Senior High School in Mercer County. Presently, she is an adjunct instructor of Watercolor and Metals Smithing at Concord University.\n",
      "Her paintings reflect a personal relationship with her environment, either at home in the mountains of West Virginia or in her travels. Her many sketches and photographs provide material for her watercolors/mixed media paintings, and have even influenced her jewelry designs. Whichever media she uses, she works in a series starting with a representational theme and pushing it as far as she can in developing the concepts. She doesn't set a limit to the number in a series, instead working it until it seems complete. Often, a series will be revisited because she can’t release it, or has had an insight into a new compositional arrangement. \n",

He is one of the key artists behind the library mural in Princeton, and has created set pieces for the Hinton, WV theater group Ars Creo, in which he also performs as an actor. Clark is a member of the Appalachian Artists Collective, for which he designed and built the Paper Theater in the Clay Center in Charleston, WV, and his work has been used and published by the internet artist community founded by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, HitRecord. Clark's work captures scenes of intricate fantasy, often encompassing sinister, unusual, or otherworldly tones. The creatures he has created at the House of Art and elsewhere are the fully realized visions of a mind that sees no impossibility in the realms of creation, and works to bring elements of spectacle, wonder, and imagination to life. Many of his pieces are visual staples of Princeton life, appearing in shop windows, parades, and productions. Clark has been part of the House of Art for six years.\n",

      "When you look at the bottom of a plastic container before recycling it, do you ever wonder who created that ubiquitous system of triangles and numbers?  Milly Zantow, a little known woman from south central Wisconsin had a vision, set out to make a difference in the world, and did.\n",
      "Although many have never even heard of her, she is one of the most important people in the recycling community.  Milly is responsible for creating that system of numbered triangle symbols on the bottom of plastic containers. \n",
      "Raised to reuse and recycle, Milly was always sensitive to waste.  Back in the 1970s she was surprised to hear that a rural Sauk County, Wisconsin garbage dump was to be closed early because it was filling up so fast.  Milly went to the dump and sat and watched as people dropped off their garbage. One thing she noted was that a majority of what she saw was made of plastic.  She believed that something had to be done.  She contacted a local milk jug manufacturer and came to an exciting conclusion – that the plastic could be ground down and reused. \n",
      "According to the Wall Street Journal, \"Zantow pushed to introduce plastics recycling to the area.  After laying groundwork with lawmakers, communities and industry, in 1979, Zantow co-founded the first complete recycling service in Sauk County, E-Z Recycling, which handled more than 200,000 pounds of materials in its first full year.\" \n",
      "Milly died in 2014 at the age of 91.  She never saw a monument in her name, but a group of Sauk County Institute of Leadership program participants wish to raise funds to place at least one memorial for this inspirational woman who did so much with so little.  Our goal is to place a personalized bench with a custom-made art piece in the newly constructed Harvest Park located in Reedsburg, Wisconsin.  The art piece is to be made of recycled metal materials; the bench will be made of recycled plastic and feature a memorial in Milly's honor.  We would also like to place an informational sign describing her contribution to the world of recycling.  \n",
      "We have contacted a local bench company that will assist in providing the bench and have been in discussions with local artists that will create a one-of-a-kind sign befitting such an icon. \n",
      "Harvest Park, in Reedsburg, Wisconsin is the home of The Ruminant, a must see as a part of the county’s up and coming Fermentation Fest.

      "For your consideration, \n",
      "\"Beyond The River Bridge\" is based on the unsolved murder of Mary Faye Hunter. This is a true story that took place in Decatur, Alabama in May of 1967 when Mary Faye went missing. Her remains were found by two children 5 months later. For 50 years her murder went unsolved, until now. Motivated by my grade school friend, Brad Golson, I decided to write a screenplay about this and he launched his own investigation into her death around December 2017. Since then, not only have we solved the case beyond a reasonable doubt, but we have uncovered a local conspiracy to conceal the truth about her death and those surrounding it. Also I have been motivated to return to film-making. When I was a teen my father, Dr. James W. Hunter produced two movies for me. The movies are available to watch for free on youtube.com/jwhiiiproductions. I have been working in film for almost 30 years. You see, Mary Faye was also my dad's sister. Please help us bring justice to Mary Faye by getting this film produced. Our hope is that through this film, we may spark renewed interest locally that might put pressure on the local government to close her case once and for all and give this closure. The local D.A. has refused to release any information to me, her only living relative interested in the case. They are withholding the autopsy report. They have shown no interest in our new evidence.

      "This film will be a period piece, set in the early stages of Mary Faye Hunter's life beginning in 1954. The film with span the two decades preceding her murder, and will also follow her brother Jimmy's life. Our goal is to create an immersive experience to transport audiences back to the past, in search of the truth. The film will be a love letter to the 50's and 60's, and we plan on paying attention to every detail in order to keep the movie authentic to the period.  Our youtube page will tell you more about us.  \n",
      "Depending on our budget and needs, I plan to shoot the film digitally with possibly some 16mm and 8mm footage thrown in for authenticity. I will be able to pool my old resources in order to keep costs down and work faster. We expect a 30 - 60 day shoot with locations in Alabama and Tennessee. Possibly Georgia and California also. I would like Julia Garner (Ruth from Ozark) to play Mary Faye due to their uncanny resemblance. I am currently in negotiations with her representatives. I am very serious about this project. \n",

      "I am the type of filmmaker that likes to work with the same people. So it will be cost efficient in that respect. However, \"Beyond The River Bridge\" is a period film set in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's. So the set decoration and costumes must reflect those time periods. This can become costly. In addition, I would like Julia Garner (Ruth in Ozark) to play Mary Faye, and her salary as well as any other big name actors salary can be steep. I'll make the movie without them if I have to, but having popular names attached to my project increases the chances of success. \n",

      "Sam’s Log Cabin is a special place to a lot of people, and we are very excited to finally announce our plans for the backyard!\n",
      "  Almost 4 years ago, Rhasaan Fernandez and Mike Daillak took over the cabin from the original Sam’s family.  Since then, they have worked tirelessly to craft it into a different kind of restaurant experience:  A cozy and warm place where the community can enjoy a great breakfast or lunch in an atmosphere that is as local and organic as the food, all while engaging with each other and the local arts scene.  \n",
      "The backyard is a big part of that vision!\n",
      "Imagine enjoying live music while waiting for a table on the weekends (the added patio will also help cut down the wait times!) or bringing the family to a movie night or feature stage performance.  These are but a few of the plans we have for our new space.  \n",
      "As our community has expanded, we've put all of the profits towards increasing our use of local/organic/sustainable ingredients on the menu.  We plan on continuing in this direction as we move forward.  Yet to do that, we first need to expand our seating and kitchen capacity.  \n",
      "That brings us to why you’re here! \n",
      " Our goal is to raise 40k for several big additions to the backyard, including:\n",
      "- An additional larger patio for added outdoor seating \n",
      "- A stage featuring live local music on Saturdays and Sundays as well as evening performances on a monthly basis  (Saturdays will be various genres - Sundays will be a “Bluegrass Brunch!”) \n",
      "- Vegetable/Herb gardens, native grass and other landscaping \n",
      "- More fruit trees (we currently have figs, blackberries, apples and lemons) \n",
      "- A brick oven for some more creative dishes (breakfast pizzas, baked egg dishes...etc) \n",
      "- A space that can be used for community events (meetings, concerts, parties, movie nights...etc) \n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Some structural changes we’ll also need are: \n",
      "- An outdoor walk-in refrigerator \n",
      "- New hoods for an expanded kitchen range \n",
      "- An enclosed storage area \n",
      "- A new perimeter fence\n",
      "- An outdoor service station \n",
      "- Cement foundations for the patio and walkways \n",
      "- Drainage systems \n",

      "After 3 1/2 years of planning for this project, we're quite certain that, given the resources, all shall come to pass.  Up to this point, all of the improvements to Sam's have been achieved with our own \"4 hands\" (Mike and Rhasaan's), and with the help of our friends.  This hard work has earned us a sense of confidence - one that's got us chomping at the bit to finally bring the Cabin to it's full potential.\n",

In the last number of years we have explored different musical avenues and have worked with an array of incredible artitsts and started writing songs as a band for the first time. It has brought me to a place where I was drawn to start to write and sing my own songs. They are the songs of my own personal history, and, in that great tradition of folk singing, telling the stories of ordinary people who lived extraordinary lives.\n",
      "I have recently had the great honour of performing and filming some of these newly written songs with the Ulster Orchestra in The Titanic Drawing Room in Belfast. I performed with the incredible talents of Sean Óg Graham and Nicola Joyce and enlisted the help of my good friend and long time collaborator Michael Keeney to score the orchestra parts. It has given me a real push to get into the studio with these brilliant people and make my own recording and share these songs. \n",

      "There are no risks,since the models are made in advance. We take a responsible approach to our work. Each model is carefully moderated. We are open to everyone. You can always ask us a question. We thank everyone who takes part in our project. We ask everyone to support our project in any way. If you can't support our project financially, just tell your friend about it. Any recommendation helps the project move forward. My 3D Studio has already released many projects on kickstarter. You have no reason to worry about any risks, as our Studio not only values its reputation, but also strives to achieve excellence in each of its work. For our Studio, creativity is not just a job. It is a goal and a way to achieve excellence in art. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your support is invaluable! We are improving every time, we understand that people do not like to use support in 3D printing, since the need to use support forces people to spend significantly more time preparing a 3D model for 3D printing, so we try to create 3D models with the minimum number of necessary supports. You must understand that in some cases, it is impossible to refuse support in principle, since the shape of the 3D model dictates its own conditions in order to get a satisfactory print result on most 3D printers. Our 3D models were tested in 3D printing before publishing them on kickstarter and are regularly updated and improved throughout the funding period here. If you have any questions, you can always write to us so that we can help you. You don't have to worry that you won't be able to download the 3D models you bought from our Studio, because we store the entire collection of 3D models on Google drive, which guarantees the safety of your files for a long time. However, we strongly recommend that you download your 3D files in the archive prepared for you within 3 months after the end of funding for our project on kickstarter from the moment of publication of the link to Google drive from where you will be able to download the archive. We will send you a link to your email address and duplicate the link to your archive in private messages on kickstarter within 3 weeks after the project is successfully funded. You should understand that the print quality you get depends on the system you use. All our high-resolution files allow you to get excellent results on high-end SLA machines. While the same 3D models will be produced with lower resolution on standard FDM printers. Nevertheless, the 3D models have passed the necessary pre-printing test and have been pre-tested on SLA and FDM printers. We received a satisfactory performance and were satisfied with what we did especially for you. If you want to achieve the highest quality 3D printing, we recommend using SLA printers with a layer height parameter of 60 microns. We will try to divide our 3D models into prefabricated elements so that our 3D models can be printed on printers with a small print area. Large parts require a minimum of 220*220*250mm. Which is the approximate standard for the famous entry-level 3D printer Ender-3. 3d models are tested and cut using absolutely free software \"Cura\". We recommend this program because it is available to everyone, time-tested and proved to be a professional tool for working with 3D models for 3D printing. You can count on our support! Dear sponsors of this project have the right to change 3D models as they want at their own risk and solely for their own personal use. However, if a user has purchased one of our commercial licenses, they have the right not only to sell models in their original form, but also to sell them in any modified form! All rights of this project are protected by copyright and are subject to conditions that allow us to change and improve our 3D files in all available ways throughout the entire period of funding in order to improve the quality of 3D printing. We thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts who did not remain indifferent to our favorite business. Your help here is the key to the success of our creativity! You are the best!

The first 100 backers can also get the travel companion, the ExBag, featured below, for only $9!! This is $16 below our MSRP of $25.

      "What makes the ExBar better than the competition? Standard dumbbell and barbell designs haven’t changed for thousands of years, dating back to Ancient Greece. They are bulky, costly, and take up valuable time to assemble and disassemble. Most other innovative products on the market cost several hundred dollars. As you will see below, the ExBar is in a league of it's own.\n",
      "Our Story\n",
      "Two years ago, Andrew was in the process of setting up a small home gym and quickly became frustrated because there was no products on the market that allowed him to perform a full body workout without having to order many different products and spend hundreds of dollars. He thought, “Why isn’t there something better?”\n",
      "The idea for the ExBar was born that week. After a quick prototype was assembled, Andrew quickly told JR, his brother-in-law, about his new idea. JR was the perfect partner for ExBar as a Certified Fitness Trainer, gym owner and US Military Veteran.\n",
      "The ExBar team has spent the last two years designing the perfect product. R&D, patent work, speaking with manufacturers, potential licensors and many fitness professionals.\n",
      "Multiple prototypes were received from our overseas manufacturer which were tested rigorously and improved every time until arriving at the product offered to you today. Our manufacturing facility is standing by ready to produce the product and the team is ready to fulfill your orders and exceed your expectations. We are passionate about bringing the ExBar to millions of homes and fitness centres across the world and improving lives.\n",

First, unlike many Kickstarter campaigns that are raising funds to produce the initial product, we have already received multiple prototypes which we tested rigorously and tweaked to deliver the ultimate fitness performance. We have manufacturing, freight and shipping in place and ready to go at our call. At Ex Fitness we have an outstanding team of designers, engineers, and fulfillment experts to ensure the entire process from design to manufacturing to fulfillment is executed without a hitch. If a problem arises, we are confident that we will solve them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, there are still risks in the global economy at this time that can be out of our control. These include lockdowns, closures and unforeseen freight delays. We have accounted for some of this in our fulfillment schedule. Should any delays arise, our team will keep you up to date every step of the way. \n",

Toby Kuhn (Cello, France) left a lifetime of Classical music behind when he began to discover and invent new exciting ways to play his instrument, always fluently pushing boundaries with power as he journeys joyously into a musical world of boundless possibilities. \n",

      "This album is a series of original tunes that we wrote in a collaborative process over the last three years, getting our influences from the folk music that we hear every day, principally from the Balkans but also from further afield, from Celtic to Flamenco, Azerbaijan to Mali; as well from our training as Jazz or Classical musicians; from the music that we have listened to including Funk, Pop, Metal, Jazz and of course World Music of all persuasions; and finally from three lifetimes of improvising freely in jam sessions in cafés, bars, on the street, on big stages and backstages, by ourselves, together, and with amazing musicians from everywhere (Uzbekistan, India, Sweden, Iran, Bulgaria, UK, USA, Spain, Chile, Czechia, Serbia, Morocco, to name only a few... and of course our native Slovakia, Slovenia and France!)\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "We are 3 on the Bund, an exciting band that came together in March of 2019 after meeting in the University of Limerick's renowned Irish World Academy. Our complex, layered arrangements consist of both traditional and newly composed tunes which are played with an energy and a passion that is completely authentic.\n",
      "Just before Covid hit Ireland in early 2020, we decided to take our next major step and record our debut album - a plan that was quickly hindered by the first lockdown in March 2020. Since then, we managed to arrange our music remotely and record our album in different locations when regulations allowed for it. Also, the lack of performance opportunities over the last year and a half limited our capabilities of creating our debut album. This is why we need YOUR help! \n",
      "The band's 4 members are from varied musical backgrounds which contributes to our diverse sound; Aisling Lyons who plays harp and concertina is from County Clare, Rebecca McCarthy-Kent on fiddle and piano is from Tramore in County Waterford, Seán Kelliher on guitar and banjo comes from County Kerry and finally, Simon Pfisterer who is originally from Bavaria, Germany, is the uilleann piper of the group. As individuals, we all are award-winning and accomplished performers and as a group, we have already travelled to Beijing, Shanghai, the UK and the United States.\n",
      "On our album you will find our own compositions alongside traditional tunes and songs, all arranged with an intricate and modern twist. As we play a wide variety of instruments (Fiddle, Guitar, Concertina, Uilleann Pipes, Harp, Banjo, Piano, Mandolin, Whistles), we often change up the instrumentation and make every set sound unique while keeping our original \"3 on the Bund\" sound. The album title, \"Frenzy\", is the name of one of the tunes on the album, a polka composed by Breanndán Begley. We chose it as it best describes the initial feeling we had when we started playing together as a band.\n",
      "We are also delighted to welcome a few guest musicians on the album: Róisín Ryan on vocals, Trevor Hutchinson (Lúnasa) on double bass, and Dermot Sheedy (Hermitage Green) on bodhrán and drums.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Most of the recording is already complete and while this campaign is running, the mixing process is underway. Possible risks we face are delays in the mixing/mastering process or with the physical production of the CD. To minimize delays we have allowed time for both mixing and mastering and we also plan to hand in the final data to the CD pressing plant ahead of time.\n",

      "Hi! This kickstarter project is to cover a stipend while I write and research an upcoming screenplay based upon the often little-discussed and known facts of the Civil War - very much relatable and timely to today.\n",
      "For instance, did you know that President Lincoln was actually very \"fun\" and personable to be around often, even during the midst of handling a serious crisis? Did you know that General Sherman had a \"spy\" who was so to eager to single-handedly win the war that he volunteered for a suicide mission, was caught, imprisoned, and picked up later by Sherman in a raid, only to volunteer for an even bigger mission after that? Were you aware that Union soldiers held a mock trial in a seized courtroom and actually \"tried\" the case the South was making, and voted to agree with it? And are you aware that women often knew of their \"limited\" role(s) of the time, and were actually cunning and smart to operate and successfully in a 'supportive\" function, knowing that their day was on the horizon and that a country that offered that horizon needed their presence now?\n",
      "This screenplay will incorporate all of this and much more. \n",
      "I am looking to cover a stipend for the three months that it will take to fully research and write this (I have already begun part-time). My first book is releasing later this year - look for \"Twelve Angels: The Women who taught me how to act, live, and love\" on Amazon - and, as you will find from the book, I have the connections to help realize this screenplay. \n",
      "Your investment will not only come with the associated rewards, but you will also be contributing to a \"voice\" of positive reasoning and binding much needed today.\n",

It's a story of love, loss, and victory. In December 2017, Cyclone Ockhi destroyed Kerala and nearby towns on the banks of Arabian Sea, as a result, 661 people went missing, George and Anil too, for the 7 longest days of their lives in the Arabian Sea.\n",

He has directed many short films and has won many awards for his Short Curtains. He has been working on this story from the past 9 months and waiting to tell the story to the world.\n",
      "The story is of two young boys' struggle for survival in a turbulent sea for 7 days will also create impact and more awareness for increasing the rescue and relief facilities at the disposal of the government. This will also encourage people at large to hold on in such adverse conditions for their own survival and a better life. The climate change is bringing more such difficult situations all over the world.    \n",
      "We want to tell the true story of survival which will not only show the world how people stand together at the time of crisis but also reveal the government functioning and how the system works.\n",
      "Whatever we get through the funding, 20% will be kept aside for Kerala relief fund and will be used whenever such natural disaster happens. This film is for the people who survived, saved, and also in the memory of who lost their lives in the sea.   \n",
      "As we move towards the production of the film, the main challenge is to get the Visual Effects right. As we all know, Vfx cost a lot for a feature film, But we will try to make it as real as possible. The initial target is £8000 and we would go ahead for a target of £100,000 as we want to give pure cinema experience. \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "“Carlos Seixas for classical guitar” is a project I started many years ago while I was studying my bachelor’s degree in Spain. I was drawn mostly by the interest I have in transcribing music for guitar and by the undeniable quality of Carlos Seixas’ music. The fact that Seixas is one of the greatest portuguese composers was also an important point: I always felt the need of performing music from my own country. \n",
      "\"Carlos Seixas para guitarra clássica\" é um projeto que iniciei há já alguns anos, quando estudava a minha licenciatura em Espanha. O interesse surgiu principalmente devido ao gosto que tenho pela transcrição e pela qualidade indubitável da música de Carlos Seixas. O facto de Seixas ser um dos melhores compositores portugueses foi também um ponto a favor, já que sempre senti vontade e necessidade de tocar música do meu país. \n",
      " I started an extensive work of transcribing, arranging, practicing and publishing a set of Sonatas from this composer. Now it’s time to put all my work and effort in a CD!\n",
      "Iniciei assim um trabalho extenso de transcrição, estudo e publicação de um conjunto de Sonatas deste compositor português. Chegou agora o tão esperado momento de gravar um CD com estas sonatas. \n",
      "A great deal of love and thought has been put into this CD, a very unique and exciting project, I might say! I have been practicing and preparing a whole program only with Carlos Seixas’ music that include a vast and contrasting repertoire that represent the apogee of baroque portuguese music.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Since its unveiling at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1963, the Porsche 911 has captivated motoring enthusiasts around the world. Throughout its eight generations of models, the 911 has largely retained its iconic rounded profile.\n",
      "This CNC machined aluminum speedform sculpture is an interpretation of the Porsche 911 ethos done in collaboration with professional automotive designer Andhika Dimas. It is designed to exaggerate the 911's iconic timeless proportion and capture it in sculptural form.\n",
      "A Speedform is a common automotive designing style which helps automotive designers hone proportions and create movement in the design. The placement of lights, mirrors or air intakes is often disregarded at this stage as designers are striving to make the design as dynamic as possible. \n",
      "Traditionally, speedforms are sculpted from clay by an automotive designer (#dontforgetthemodellers). There is no substitute for freshly machined metal, so in typical AltDynamic fashion, we had to elevate the speedform to sculpture quality. \n",
      "We have spent countless hours virtually simulating toolpaths and have machined nearly two dozen prototypes to sculpt an elegant speedform. The outcome is a flawlessly machined finish fused with flowing contours. \n",
      "All Speedforms are machined in the USA. We have done extensive prototyping to make sure we can deliver them on time and with the utmost quality and craftsmanship.\n",
      "We know Porsche and automotive enthusiasts have high standards and are very particular about colors and the spec of their cars. We are starting this campaign with a base offering of 5 color options. Based on feedback, we will add more colors, the more backers there are, the more options we can offer. \n",
      "We are using anodized color coatings which are extremely durable, corrosion-resistant, scratch-resistant and won't stain or rub off. Porsche, Lamborghini and Ferrari use anodizing for their center locking wheels. \n",
      "If you have a particular color, finish or texture, we will gladly try to accommodate you. Custom colors, materials or paints are all possible. Inquire within. \n",
      "Customer service is a top priority for us! We use the milestone timeline system we pioneered on Kickstarter to keep backers updated. Each blue dot represents a milestone where we will send a campaign update so you know how development is advancing. We will not be like other Kickstarter campaigns who leave their backers in the dark and guessing as to what is happening. Every order will be emailed a tracking link.\n",
      "Once the campaign ends, you will receive a Backer Survey email from Kickstarter where you will choose relevant options (such as color) for your pledge and provide us your shipping information. We are planning to ship pledges this July. Message us if you have a question on how to pledge. \n",
      "We have a track record of successfully completing and fulfilling our campaigns. View our prior AltDynamic campaigns to see what our backers are saying. We only ship quality!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "With more and more screen time, people are starting to invest a lot in appropriate hardware. In return, they boost their performance. As a monitor only weights about 5 kg nowadays, we decided to come up with a stand to allow you to set up your monitor easily, and anywhere you need it.\n",
      "There are 2 types of threads 3/8 or 1/4) possible on tripods fittings. We use 3/8-16 and for those who only order the bracket we include an adapter to the other standard 1/4-20. The bolts and plastic spacers required to connect the bracket to your screen are always included.\n",
      "If we reach €10 000 during the lifetime of the campaign we will include this adapter in all pledges!\n",
      "At a certain time, 1 out of 2 office workers will suffer from ergonomic concerns like back or neck pain. A wrongly positioned screen may not only cause injuries (for example MSD) but is also uncomfortable and may lead to eyestrain. All these health related issues have a negative effect on your productivity. The ergonomic risk is even higher for people working form home as they often do not have a dedicated office but are working at a counter or a regular table. For all of you, we are the solution!\n",
      "There should be 4 holes with thread at the back of your screen. If you don't see then straight away, they might be hidden by the existing stand. These holes are made following a universal standard of measurements. Most brands like Samsung, Dell, LG, MSI, Lenovo, Huawei, Acer, Philips etc. stick to this standard. Reading this you realise, your screen will probably be one of the 90% screens that fit our product! We will provide the necessary screws and other essentials to connect the bracket.\n",
      "You don’t have your own office at home? Don't worry! Switch between your kitchen counter, living room table, bathroom counter and always have your screen at the right height. The possibilities are endless! We even tested the screen with indoor cycling or rowing.\n",
      "We have a small tripod (height range 29 – 87,5 cm) if you intend to use the desk in the sofa or at the table, like on above pictures. If you want to set the monitor directly on the floor to watch the screen while standing, our large tripod (height range 46,5 – 143,5 cm) is better suited. \n",
      "Having the television on in the background while “no one is watching it”, is enough to delay language development for your kids. Normally, a parent speaks about 940 words per hour when a toddler is around. With the television on, that number falls by 770 words! With our product, you can hide the screen when not in use. This makes it less likely to seduce you to start watching when you do not intend to so. For optimal ergonomics, it is best to watch television on a monitor and not on a mobile phone or tablet.\n",
      "This is likely the case as on average, we watch around 4 hours of television a day. If you sit more than 10 hours a day, the chances of dying early increase by 34% compared to those who only sit 1 hour a day. With this product you kill two birds with one stone; you can use it to work standing and you will watch less television because the television is stored when not in use.\n",
      "Or inmates with who have access to natural light are less likely to relapse? Students will process information quicker after a hike in nature and will experience less stress. Direct your sofa to your window so you can enjoy your garden and natural light. When you decide to watch television, close your curtains, light some candles and set-up your screen in front of your curtains.  Your body will tell you at which height and position to set-up the screen, watching television was never so comfortable.\n",
      "The bracket and the thread housing are both laser cut and machined in Ghent. The tripod is made in China by the same supplier as we use for other projects. We are well aware of its capabilities as we have supplied over 2 000 customers without any problems. \n",
      "The product is extremely user-friendly thanks to its portability because of the handle and the lightness of the unit (also depending on your screen of course). Besides these positive points, it also takes up little space. The unit is especially suitable for those who want to work in different places or want to take the screen with them when traveling and working in another location.\n",
      "We have more than 3 000 customers and over 150 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - reviews on Etsy and on our website. It all started on Kickstarter and we are proud to say that we have always kept our promises. We are here for the long run!\n",
      "If you got special requests, do not hesitate to send me an email, info@notadesk.com or contact me through messenger chat, m.me/notadesk .\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We took learnings from our last two campaigns and localised the customised parts of the production in our home country, Belgium. Like this, we will be able to visit our suppliers even if travel restrictions are put in place. Secondly, we have designed a product which is very compact to ship and therefore can be sent easily around the world with low costs. Lastly, we have been intensively testing and using the bracket over a period of 3 months (this was not a task as we are using the product everyday anyway 😀). The tripods have been in use for the last 3 years. We will pay special attention to making sure that the screen is perfectly horizontal and that the right bolts and tools are included in the box.\n",

      "Our gallery in Karatsu is called JI's \"French Art Gallery\". Its goal is to discover French art in all its forms of expression : exhibition of pictorial, sculptural, artisanal art, bookstore, design, French \"savoir-vivre\", etc.\n",
      "To open this gallery, we need to make repairs.\n",
      "This place is an old restaurant, which before that, it was a tatami store. Three generations of the same family have succeeded each other in this place (around 80 years of family and commercial history). It is rare to find places like this located in the city center. It is for this reason and for its development potential that we have chosen it. But there is still a lot of work to be done to make it consistent, to create spaces and give real beauty to this place to create a gallery worthy of the name. We have estimated the budget at 50000 € if we do all the work ourselves. We both have experiences in renovation.\n",
      "We know that this is not a negligible amount that's why we hesitated to create this crowdfunding. But we strongly believe in the success of this project and we come to tell us that to offer you the most beautiful, to offer you to share our dream and also to promote our culture, we had to take this step.\n",
      "To present you the project in a more concrete way, the local is about 115m2 with several dedicated spaces. We want to create a space that is both modern and minimalist (so that the artworks have their place). Its design will blend French culture with its creators and Japanese culture with its history and location.\n",
      "With this zoning, we want to explain a little more the distribution of spaces and show you the flow of displacement :\n",
      "Today the gallery looks like this :\n",
      "At the end of the renovation, this is what the project should look like.\n",

      "In the spring of 2020, I was preparing to release my debut folk EP, North Branch River -- ordering CDs, working on merch, and spreading the word about my release show, scheduled for March 21st! As you can probably imagine, things did not go to plan. The release show was cancelled, along with so many other things, as the world shut down to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
      "I did release the album, and I received so much lovely feedback from friends, family, and strangers from afar about how the music impacted them. But I'd be lying if I said the pandemic didn't take some of the wind out of my creative sails. What use was there for my music, in a world that was struggling to survive? What future could I see for myself -- as a musician and performer, and storyteller and community balladeer -- in a world that was feeling more and more out of control? \n",
      "I found myself in a creative \"egg\" stage for much of 2020 -- not playing much, not writing much, and certainly not thinking about a new album.  But new years always bring new energy, and 2021 brought with it a desire to bring more music into the world. As winter rolled into spring, I found myself hatching from my little egg, singing more, playing more, and thinking about what I was being called to bring forth. \n",
      "The result is Ghost Story - a full-length album of traditional and original folk songs arranged for banjo, guitar, and bouzouki. Ghost Story is my attempt to answer  questions that I think about deeply: What is the role of traditional music in my life? What stories do I want to continue singing into the world? What stories do I want to leave in the past? And what stories do I want to change, reinterpret, and reframe so that something new can emerge from them?\n",
      "The answers to these questions, like so many of the most pressing questions of this moment in time, are both/and sort of answers. Yes, let us engage with and grapple with those hard stories we have inherited. Yes, let us transform them into something that can feed us in a changing world. \n",
      "In literal terms, this means creating an album which blends original and traditional music, one that matches songs of trauma with songs of resilience and resistance. It means queering old ballads, so that they represent more of the range of our experiences, both historical and modern. It means combining new sounds and styles with more traditional approaches to musical storytelling.\n",
      "Most of all, it means pouring my heart into all that I love about traditional folk music and creating something which -- I hope -- is worthy of our past, and worthy of our future. \n",
      "This is the essence of Ghost Story. \n",
      "Work is already underway on this project! I've already clocked several studio sessions with my producer, Colin McCaffrey, getting down good bones on the tracks that will be the foundation of the album. I've even designed my own album art, and have recorded and edited a music video for one of my original songs! My hope is that with the funds from this Kickstarter, I'll be able to work at a quicker pace and release the album by the end of the year. \n",
      "I'm asking for $5,500 to complete this project. These funds go directly to paying my producer for recording time, for his work laying down accompaniment, and for the process of mixing and mastering the tracks. It also will fund my purchase of the physical CDs, which is a large out-of-pocket expense at the end of an expensive process. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I am confident in my ability to follow through on this album. I produced and released North Branch River without any outside funding, simply by moving slowly and paying for studio time as I could afford it. \n",

      "The learning edge for me in this process will be managing rewards. I think I've set reasonable expectations for myself, but if there is any delay in delivery of rewards, I will communicate clearly with all my backers.\n",

      "\"A Sacrifice of Praise\" is a series of bilingual musical settings of the entire Divine Liturgy in Byzantine chant, available in both Byzantine and Western staff notation, that can be utilized by chanters, choirs, and congregants alike. The Greek musical settings are drawn from renowned composers of the Ecumenical Patriarchate such as Petros the Peloponnesian, Gregorios Protopsaltis, and others, while the English scores utilize the official translation of the Divine Liturgy published by our Archdiocese and set to music by a number of well-known composers such as Nicholas Roumas, Samuel Herron, Phillip Phares, and others. As Byzantine Chant continues to flourish in the United States, this project will prove to be of inestimable value in helping Church musicians to offer the “sacrifice of praise” in both Greek and English.\n",
      "The Dynamis Byzantine Ensemble will be recording the First Mode Hymnal from the set. The subsequent album will serve as both a didactic model for the First Mode Hymnal as well as a traditional model for singing Byzantine Music in the English Language. \n",
      "We need support to be able to record and produce the recording of the Divine Liturgy, so please consider giving to our fundraising campaign!\n",

Please, help us to spread our work and continue our mission of providing high-quality Byzantine chants and compositions in the English Language.\n",
      "--------227837846/a-catalog-of-screams------\n",
      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Concept\n",
      "A collection of anonymous screams gathered in New York City. People are invited to enter a soundproof booth, the portable catharsis, and unleash their most intense, primal sound. Their scream is recorded and catalogued. \n",
      "Why\n",
      "Screaming is such a visceral, involuntary act, and as adults we are generally discouraged to scream. The idea of cathartic release as a healthy way to cycle your energy is not only appealing to me, it’s logical. It is necessary to liberate and then regenerate energy on a normal basis to feel present and grounded. The Scream Box is a public service, a space where you can emotionally purge and free yourself of the responsibility of any negative energy you that may be festering. In today’s blistering political climate, a public catharsis is more necessary than ever. There’s something really powerful about making the choice to scream.\n",
      "The Box\n",
      "The Scream Box is 7’ x 3’, soundproof, portable, and will show up wherever it is needed. Parks, bars, record stores; almost anywhere is a viable location for the Portable Catharsis. \n",
      "The Catalog\n",
      "A catalog of screams does not yet exist. A collection of peoples’ most unedited vocal escape feels mystifying and powerful. There are so many things to be done with this collection of energy. Most notably, I plan to slow down these tones to various speeds, and then create a collection of calming ambient music from them with the help of my many musician friends. I love the concept of shifting the vibrational energy of something from negative to positive. Collecting low vibrational energy, letting it sit, and then turning it into a positive, higher vibration.\n",
      "What Happens\n",
      "You enter the box. You are given very simple, straightforward instructions. 10 seconds to prepare, 15 seconds to scream (cued by a red light), then 15 seconds to collect yourself before you reemerge into society. Your decibel level is recorded and given to you on a card. Screamers can visit CatalogofScreams.com (coming soon!) to see stats- where the box has been, where it’s going, the highest decibel scream, how many screams cataloged to date, etc.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The actual box construction was incredibly difficult and costly. However, the biggest challenge I face will be gaining the trust of my patrons. It is a tall order to ask someone to step inside a 7x3’ box, disregard the world, and really let it rip. With the right resources, I can successfully create a safe space that will not only encourage them to let go, but to want to come back.\n",

      "O Passeio… “a tour” or “a ride”...  The name O Passeio represents both the title track from my new CD and also embodies the roller coaster ride that making this CD has been. Inevitably, the process becomes the music and this is certainly reflected to the listener on this project. O Passeio features eleven original compositions inspired by AfroFunk, Reggae, South Indian, R&B, Cape Verdean, Flamenco, Cuban, Brazilian, Peruvian, Argentinian and Jazz genres. These exciting musical hybrids are the heart of this project and represent my passion for exploring diverse sounds from around the globe. The idea germinated in the late 1980's when I got to be part of the WOMAD festivals and experienced so many new artists and forms of artistic expression, all in one place. Those early experiences also factor largely in my grad work where I write about the musical impact those festivals and this city has had on me. I first began creating the Los Variants theme of blending artists, genres and influences in 2012 and released my debut CD jass/blues in 2013. It spanned several genres from country to reggae to Afro-funk to avant-garde jazz. Here is a sample from the first CD entitled \"Che Che Toronto\"  It features Kobe Aquaa-Harrison and Lydia Persaud on vocals.\n",
      " The past three years has been about collaborating with many talented and generous Toronto based musicians and I can honestly say that it has been a privilege. As co-producer and bassist Justin Gray mentions in the \"Behind the Scenes\" video below... “the musicians who joined us in this recording each brought so much of their own musicality to the compositions; we basically asked them to do their thing.” A sample of the music on the upcoming CD and some recording footage can be seen here:\n",
      "Guest artists such as: Ana Lia Garrido, Kevin Turcotte, Natalie C. Morris, Fernando Galleo Torres, Markus Moses Jackman, Louis Simao, Dominic Mancuso, Kobe Aquaa-Harrison, Maryem and Ernie Tollar, Benjamin Barille, Waleed Abdulhamid, Ravi Naimpally, Tico Souza, Marito Marques, Luis Orbegoso, Michael Occhipinti and Justin Gray are part of the Canadian musical mosaic and their contributions to this, and many other projects have been immense. \n",

      "This story is a very person and real story for me and I feel that the making and completion of this film can go on and help others who have and are going through this very thing. For the film is not only about suicide, but about what we cant do to prevent it and, if it does happen, how we can deal with it.\n",
      "          Robert and Victor are brothers, not by blood but by bond. But one tragic morning flips Roberts world upside down when he wakes up to multiple missed calls from his mother and Victor. Robert calls his mother back, and she begins to inform him that Victor has passed away after committing suicide. \n",
      "Robert immediately rushes to his Aunt Samantha's home in Northern California, from the Greater L.A. Area, where he moved for work a year and a half earlier. There, he is greeted by his mother Marie, who before taking him to see his aunt, tells him that she (his aunt Samantha) wants him to give Victor's eulogy.\n",
      "Ushering him into the living room, Samatha does, in fact, ask him to give the eulogy, but Robert is hesitant because he does not understand how Victor could do this to not only him, but to his family. More importantly, to his Mother. What would he say? He begins to question whether he actually knew Victor as well as he had thought he did all these years. Were they even brother? However, In the effort of comforting his aunt, he agrees to do it.\n",
      "In his room, he begins to think on what he is going to say, but the more he thinks on it, the more frustrated he becomes. He then begins to think of the conversation he and Victor had just before he left for L.A., and how badly Victor just wanted to get out and leave as well. How he felt like he was being left behind. But Robert tells him, if he ever needs an escape, just call him and he'll be there. \n",
      "But this thought only makes Robert's anger brew even more. Enraged, he throws the notebook he had began writing the eulogy in, across the room.\n",
      "Marie hears the commotion and enters the room, picking up the notebook on her way in. She tries to console him, but Robert lashes out at her stating that he does not want to do this and that he does not understand why he has to pay for Victor's choices. Marie quickly reminds Robert that this is not about him but about the family and more importantly his aunt, and that he is not the only one effected by Victor's Passing. \n",
      "Ashamed and heart broken, Robert reveals to his mother that Victor called him that night and that he ignored it and went back to sleep. He begins to state how he thinks he could have saved him if he had only answered. \n",
      "Marie tells him that there was nothing more he could have done and that they wont ever know why he really called. That all they can do is move on and remember Victor for the bright, always smiling, and funny person that he was.\n",
      "At the funeral, Victor, begins to give the eulogy but before he can get the first sentence out, everything goes dark and a single person is left standing in the congregation, Victor. \n",
      "All the anger and frustration that had been brewing finally erupts and Robert confronts Victor, asking how he could be so selfish. How he could have done this to him, the family, his mother and the people he claimed to love. How they were supposed to be brothers, but apparently were not.\n",
      "Victor takes it all until Robert anger fades away. Victor explains he never meant to hurt anyone, and that he has always thought about him, his mom and the family, but that he was suffering and in pain. Robert apologizes for not being there for him but Victor tells him that what he did had nothing to do with him and was his choice alone. \n",
      "Victor tells him that although he was in pain, he is now ok and at peace.\n",
      "Looking into the congregation, Robert continues his eulogy, speaking of their favorite chill spot that looked out over the city, and how they discussed everything from girl problems to travel plans to life goals. \n",
      "And that that is how he will always remember him as: the bright eyed, always smiling, and funny person that he was, who loved life.\n",
      "That no matter how Victor left this\n",

      "As we embark on opening our first restaurant, Scrum-did-dly-ump-tious, at the top of 2022, we invite you to go on this journey with us as we walk by faith, in and on purpose, with talent and passion, pouring our hearts and souls into this project.\n",
      "On Tuesday, October 12, 2021, we officially signed our lease on a shell of space formerly a barbershop in Historic Downtown Lawrenceville. As we enter this space and embark on this journey, it is with great pride that we honor those that came before us who were not afforded similar opportunities.\n",
      "Our vision for this 2200 square foot space is to make it our own and transform the environment into one that gives alluring vibes and speaks to our unique personalities, interests, and tastes, those of which we desire to engrain and permeate into the atmosphere to create genuine connections, deep resonance, and invaluable relationships with our patrons.\n",
      "As a double-minority owned business, we are staunchly committed to making extraordinary strides and breaking barriers for women-owned businesses, especially those developed and operated by Black and Brown Women, to build bridges and close gaps, creating financial stability for our families and community. To strengthen our efforts, we humbly ask for your championship and support to build with us by sowing a seed into our restaurant venture.\n",
      "We are raising money for startup costs including build out of the space.  Given the times that we are in and the rising costs of materials we find ourselves looking to get additional funding on top of the 150,000 that we have put in ourselves.  This will be more than a restaurant, it will be a hub for the community, a place where we can constantly and consistently pay it forward to the community itself through employment, food drives and so much more.  This is a much needed space in Downtown Lawrenceville.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We have a very aggressive timeline for buildout completion with hopes of our grand opening being Feb 2022. Our lease begins on February 1, 2022.  The sooner we open the sooner we can serve our community.\n",

      "We are in constant contact with the City and County, who have been extremely helpful with outlining the necessary steps to take with realistic timelines for approvals. We are aware that hiccups and delays that may occur due to sourcing available materials needed to complete the buildout. We have began ordering supplies in advance to avoid any delays but have been taking into consideration the possibility. \n",

We aim for a sound that embraces the various components and influences of our music, from root unplugged Colombian Cumbia to the Beatles, as well as all the nuances our songs naturally carry: afro-beat and funky guitars, Latin acoustic guitar rhythms, bluesy and brassy harmonicas, Argentinian rock dynamics and guitar solos, Brazilian rhythms and work on spoken words.\n",

      "NOW - until the campaign ends all the money raised beyond the 12k goal will fund the upcoming bike-music tours + \"Ecotopia Now!\" high school assemblies! \"We have come this far, we're not gonna turn around, we feel just like goin' on!\"=======================Tiny Bio:SHAKE YOUR PEACE! is a music project created by Gabe Dominguez in 2005, formerly based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and recently relocated to Salt Lake City, UT. The project is most well known for its ebullient live performances, Ecotopian perspectives, and bicycle-music tours. \n",
      "Kick-What?SHAKE YOUR PEACE! is trying to raise the last 20% of funding needed to finish an album of original music called \"Whup Music.\" Kickstarter is all-or-nothing. If the project isn't 100% funded by the time the campaign finishes, ALL the money you may have pledged is returned to you.You're 80% Done!?! Rad! What's in the Last 20%?The last 20% includes: tracking (the horn section, the gospel choir, some percussion, some bass, some electric guitar, some lead vocals, some orchestration - including a mariachi band - and some special effects/ sound design - including fireworks explosions ;), mixing (mountains of tracks), mastering, and printing. Whew!\n",
      "The album will be mixed by the incomparable Blake Henderson.  Blake also engineered the majority of the album, and has acted as an assistant-producer since we began working together in 2012. As you can hear on his website, he’s as good as they get.\n",
      "Project Management:$12,000 is a lot of money, and I don’t take it lightly. I plan to work as efficiently and frugally as possible, and take my deadline of “the end of the summer” (Aug 31, 2018) seriously. People who know me well know that I’m irresistibly drawn to doing things myself, so in classic SHAKE YOUR PEACE! style I’ll be doing as much of the remaining work that’s left on the album myself, and trying to keep costs down at every step, without compromising the quality or vision. Amazingly, this giant budget includes the work of friends (like Blake) who are cutting me ridiculous deals for their work and time! (Making records is expensive!) This is truly a community-powered piece of art. \n",
      "Those who know my wife Sonya Cotton (who has an impeccable track record of getting high quality albums out the door), will be pleased to know that she's co-project-managing the completion of this album with me. When we team up, we make good things. Victory is assured :)\"Let's Get Workin' On It!\"Whup! http://www.velovisionaries.com/\n",
      "What're You Gonna Do With the Finished Record?In short: the usual things that we independent musicians do when we release our albums: contact the press and hope they’ll listen, shop it around to indie labels with hope brimming in my little heart, and play shows! But the 2 things I’m most excited to do with the album that are more unusual include:\n",
      "1) Bike tour! I plan to do my 5th bicycle music tour of Northern Utah, and 3rd bicycle music tour of the SF Bay Area. Also being considered are a bike tour of the Northwest, and a Hudson River canoe tour! Coming slowly to a town near you... \n",
      "2) “Ecotopia Now!” high school assemblies. I've successfully tested out this concept at 3 different high schools in Utah. They're essentially Ecotopian pep rallies/ recruitment-fairs for local ecological and social justice organizations (including the schools own student clubs). Pedal-powered by the kids themselves (if they so choose), the assembly features whup music alternated with 3-minute long impact-speeches passionately delivered by representatives from the local Ecotopian orgs. Each speech invites the kids to join-in on some kind of immediate, concrete, hands-on action that the org is up to. No platitudes allowed. In my experience so far, these assemblies have been deeply transformational. Students, teachers, band, orgs - everyone felt stoked and ready to get to work.\n",
      "A Unique Copyright:In my effort to “contribute whup music to the soundtrack of those who are marching” as I say in the Kickstarter video, I plan to release the album’s songs under a unique copyright that designates them similarly to the way a National Park is designated: held in the commons for everyone to enjoy, but defended from industry. Unlike in a National Park though, where humans are meant to be visitors and the ethos is to leave-no-trace, I’d hope that people would leave-plenty-of-trace and fully inhabit the music. The license is a standard Creative Commons (CC) license, mixed with an invitation to all Ecotopian entities (those working for social & ecological justice) to freely use the music for their: documentaries, flash mobs, memes, conferences, parties, whatevs, for free and without needing to ask permission. It’s called: “Wild-Aligned/ Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International.” The CC part of the license puts up a legal fence (the park boundaries) to keep for-profit entities asking permission.\n",
      "A Different Album Format: I’m stoked to release the physical album in the form of a first-class stamped postcard that comes with TWO download codes - one attached to the postcard itself, and one stuck to the paper backing of an accompanying SHAKE YOUR PEACE! sticker. The sticker, with its download code, is intended to be for the buyer, while the stamped postcard with its code is intended to be snail-mailed by the buyer to a friend.\n",
      "In addition to it being a great excuse to send a snail-mailed postcard to a friend, my thinking here is that whereas CD’s are: non-ecological, heavy (which matters on a bike tour), and often seem to be ripped onto a hard drive and then long-forgotten in CD books, an album-postcard is more ecological, lightweight, doubles as a form of promotion, and can be used as a nifty bookmark (ideally holding your place in the pages of Edward Abbey’s “Monkey Wrench Gang”).\n",
      "Thanks for reading!If you've read this far, you've got stamina! I like ya shtyle kid.\n",
      "If you've felt inspired by what you've seen/heard/read here, I hope you'll consider sharing this Kickstarter with your friends. It's a massive help to me. THANKS!!!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Given that I'm a dad of one, and soon to be two children, the biggest challenge is going to be the balancing of finishing this album, with dadding it up (and being sleep deprived). But given that my parents are stoked to help with babysitting, and my partner is 100% in support of this project happening, I feel confident that I can do it.\n",

I am also glad to be able to present an unusual style / system of concertina playing and to make my own arrangements.

      "Fàrsan started last summer as a way for all of us to spend some time together. We booked a week-long tour and rehearsed over Skype in Boston and Antigonish. Màiri sent recordings of her favorite songs and puirt-à-beul and Neil, Elias, and Katie arranged them into sets, paired them with tunes, and sent the results back up to Nova Scotia. As we played and danced together, we realized there was more to the project than an excuse to hang out and that's when we decided to record our first album.\n",
      "Last month, we spent 9 days rehearsing and recording in Nova Scotia. Between Màiri's Gaelic classes at St. FX, we played and cooked and laughed together. We carefully selected our favorite material, polishing and getting it ready, testing it out on a wonderful audience at the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre on a snowy night, and finally driving up to Point Aconi to record it all at Lakewind Sound Studios. We're so excited to share this music with you. We have a wide array of sounds on fiddle, pipes, whistles, piano, accordion, percussive stepdance, puirt-à-beul and Gaelic songs and we think we've created something really special. We hope you do too!\n",

      "    It was out of the ashes of the diagnosis of my daughter with a life changing disability that God began to plant a vision of Champions Concessions Treats and Eats into my heart. I began to look at those with disabilities with a new set of eyes, seeing the unique challenges that they face and how much joy they give to the people who allow their hearts to be touched by their lives. I also saw the fears of each parent as their children fall further and further behind their peers. The greatest fear that I have and many parents of children with disabilities, is what happens with our child when we are no longer here to take care of them. Will they be able to care for themselves when we are gone? How will the world around us receive our children? Who will be their champion outside of our home?\n",
      "    A champions is defined as one who fights on behalf of another; One who overcomes the odds, struggles through the hard times, and overcomes. A champion is undefeated and unbeatable. My daughter is a champion, and there are many others like her that are looking for an opportunity to let their voices be heard. They want to add value to the world around them. They want to work, love, live and have friends. They want community. Champions Concessions Treats and Eats wants to provide that place for them. We want to create a brand that uses their gifts and talents to shine.\n",
      "    We are in need of $250,000 to get started with this vision. The money would be used to secure a building for Champions Concessions Treats and Eats to operate out of, to purchase commercial restaurant equipment, and to hire a special needs coordinator to ensure that each person coming into our café is fully supported in their job.  Any additional funds raised will go to ensure that Champions Concessions Treats and Eats is set up for the long haul.  \n",
      "    We will be serving Cotton Candy Burritos, Snow Cones, Funnel Cake Bar, Crepes, Soups, Salads, Sandwiches, Nachos, Hot Dogs with all the fixings, home made pies and sides, but our greatest product is our staff. Champions will have a staff that is filled with persons with disabilities both hidden and seen, as well as support staff and advocates for them. We will create a environment that allows each employee to be celebrated for who they are and what they are championing for.\n",

This market is ever changing in their pricing and availability.  We have an excellent commercial real estate broker that is committed to helping us find the perfect location to maximize our business plan while addressing the liability of needing larger parking spaces to accommodate accessibility for each of our Champions.  This may delay our open date as we search out the perfect location for our business. \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Hey folks, thanks so much for stopping by and supporting the Kickstarter for my new album, \"Songs for Hard Times\". \n",
      "For as long as I've been writing songs and putting out records I've wanted to make a solo album: just me and my guitar. After spending a year and a half off the road at home with my family during the pandemic, it seemed like the right time to hit record on this project. \n",
      "It's a handful of traditional and cowboy songs that takes you on a journey from the Appalachians to Texas, with a few stops in between.  These are songs that I've been singing for years, whether during sound check or in green rooms across the world. When I managed to find time to pick up the guitar during the pandemic, these are the songs I found myself gravitating towards, so it felt right to finally get a recording of them. I traveled up into the Algonquin Highlands to a cottage with just my old Martin D18 and one microphone, and \"Songs for Hard Times\" was born. \n",
      "I wanted this recording to feel and sound organic, like you were sitting right there in front of me - no bells and whistles or second takes. If you listen closely, you'll hear the birds who were nesting right outside the window, the wind blowing through the trees and the lake splashing up on the shoreline. \n",
      "Upon finishing the recording session, I shipped the songs out to Edmonton, Alberta, where engineer Scott Franchuk mixed, mastered and readied them to be put onto vinyl and CD. \n",
      "It was also around this time I stumbled across Pilgrim Creative, based out of Kansas City. I immedietly fell in love with Logan's work and knew that it would accompany these songs perfectly. After a few short e-mails we were able to come up with the artwork for \"Songs for Hard Times\". \n",
      "So what comes next? The songs are done - the artwork is ready - and I want to get this album into your hands and onto your record players as soon as possible! At this point I could go ahead and release this album on Spotify and AppleMusic, but I've always felt that this kind of music was made to be listened to on a physical format like a record or CD. The funds raised from this Kickstarter are going to help pay to press and manufacture the vinyls, CDs and T-Shirts that feature the album's artwork. It will also help cover the costs of mixing, mastering, artwork creation and licensing of songs.\n",
      "I couldn't be more excited to get this album onto your record players and shirts onto your backs. Thanks for taking the time to stop by and support this project.\n",
      "Stay well,\n",
      "Zachary \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I started this Kickstarter to help raise the funds needed to release these songs on a physical format. I feel like many of you folks who listen to my music and have come out to my shows are like me - you enjoy having something physical to listen to - a CD or a vinyl. I've always felt like the listening experience is different. You create a space for the songs and hear things that you wouldn't hear out of earbuds or in the car. Will these songs be released if I don't reach my goal? They certainly will see the light of day in some digital capacity, but they would never be released on vinyl or CD.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Who we are\n",
      "Two friends who bonded over bourbon and then wound up obsessing about biscuits. And that’s how Harlem Biscuit Company was born. Harlem Biscuit Company was founded in 2020, and in our beloved Harlem, NY.\n",
      "Melvin Chef Boots Johnson: Chief Biscuit Officer/Founder\n",
      "Chef, Baker, and Head Biscuit Maker. \n",
      "\"I’ve been at this for over 30 years.  I’ve been doing this for other brands for such a long time...now, I’m doing this for MY brand and it’s exhilarating( and exhausting).\"\n",
      "Warren Satchell: Chief Operations Officer/Co-Founder\n",
      "A fashion & tech industry exec for over 15 years. \n",
      "Southern born and bred, hugely passionate about biscuits.  \n",
      "\"A foodie who is hungry for more. I love it when a plan comes together.\"\n",
      "What we are creating\n",
      "Biscuits! A Biscuit Shop! A Biscuit Brand!  But most importantly an experience that revolves around biscuits. From our own Harlem Biscuit Company storefronts, to supplying our local community with our products, to stocking grocery store aisles and freezers; we’re looking to take this brand around the world.\n",
      "[Please note: we are not offering our actual products here - that's not legal...]\n",
      "What we offer\n",
      "Harlem Biscuit Company offers biscuits and biscuit sandwiches are made from the freshest ingredients from locally sourced markets, and are made from scratch daily.  Our sandwiches are filled with the tastiest ingredients. From fried chicken and thick-cut bacon to our house-made pork sausage and savory white gravy, to our signature “hot” chicken.\n",
      "Where we are in the process\n",
      "What started as a pop-up experience(opened on November 3rd, 2020) has quickly morphed into a brand, a brand with local and national recognition.  We like to think of this brand as opportunity in a time of chaos.  We're currently operating a cafe experience out of a bar during the day while they are closed.  As you can imagine a bar's kitchen isn't well suited for a business that relies on baking. We’ve outgrown our current arrangement and now it’s time for our own physical storefront so we can take this brand to the next level.\n",
      "Why we’re Crowd-Funding?\n",
      "This is a change of pace for us. We’ve been blessed with a huge following and massive support from our community both near and far but it hasn’t replaced our daily grind. I’m proud to say that the Harlem Biscuit Company has no debt. We have strong cash flow but no physical assets to borrow against. We don’t have rich parents to take a startup loan from or a trust fund that can support this endeavor.\n",
      "The numbers are solid. Having our own physical storefront for operations gives us the opportunity to scale up right away – we’ll be able to bake more, sell more, supply local businesses with our products, offer catering, add staff as we grow and support local students in pursuit of their academic endeavors at HBCU’s.\n",
      "Why you should back this project\n",
      "We’re 100% black-owned and looking to do something impactful in our community and beyond. We’re on a mission to make biscuits trend again and we do this by pushing the boundaries of flavor profiles.\n",
      "We’ve got a proven track record of creating jobs, even against the challenges of the pandemic. You can count on us to succeed in what we’re building; we’re planning conservatively and scaling appropriately.\n",

      "We are OrnâmatiK, a band out of Ann Arbor, MI that brings you original compositions, infectious grooves, and unique interpretations of Eastern European folk music. In 2012 we released our debut album as a larger ensemble with all traditional songs. Since then, we developed our sound, stripping down to the bare essentials and blending the spacious combination of three live horns and drums & bass with electronic effects and vocals. We continued our exploration of music from the Balkans and, most excitingly, spent countless hours writing and rehearsing new compositions that we are ready to record and share with the world!\n",
      " \n",
      "Our current lineup consists of the visionary Drew Schmieding on drums, the lively Ben Rolston on bass, the experimental Derek Worthington on trumpet, the improvisatory Eric Schweizer on reeds, and the intuitive Bethanni Grecynski on trombone, kaval (Bulgarian shepherd's flute), and vocals. \n",
      "THE PROJECT: About This Campaign \n",
      "We cannot wait to share this music with you. We are extremely proud of the unique compositions we've been working up and the distinct sound we've developed as a band. But there are many costs involved in producing a record, which is why we're asking for your support. The money we raise here will go directly to pay for the costs of this project:\n",
      "Your support will bring our vision of this music to life! The album and all the rewards offered in this campaign are original - including CDs, vinyl, drawstring backpacks, aprons, and more - and we know you'll enjoy them. Certain items will require a decision of color or design so we'll get in touch after we've been sucessfully funded (fingers crossed). Bethanni and Ben are in the process of creating amazing artwork which will be featured on the album and the rewards. \n",
      "Throughout this process we've been working with some truly inspiring recording engineers, Rishi Daftuar and Don Godwin. Their dedication and craft are showcased in each of the songs you'll hear on the record.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Manos and Mikis successfully married poetry with music for more than 50 years, leading the cultural history of our land, Greece, through a fascinating journey. It is because of all the influential poetry they set to music, that Greece is possibly the only country in the world where a large percentage of the population was able to know, listen, and sing this poetry in their every-day life, something that would have never happened without their contribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The creation of this double CD, dedicated to the music of Manos and Mikis has been a long-time project for the Greek Music Ensemble, and one that is very close to our hearts. \n",
      "Our approach, interpretation, and arrangements of Manos and Mikis music is unique and it represents the perspective of the ensemble artistically, aesthetically and emotionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept behind this project is the representation of the powerful relationship between Greek Art Music of the 20th century and Greek poetry of the past two centuries. Manos and Mikis not only combined effectively Greek poetry with music, but they also managed to integrate the Folk, Byzantine, and Urban music tradition of the land in their music, creating an aesthetic product of high artistic and emotional value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was more: Mikis and Manos embodied two core concepts: Eros and Revolution --reminding us Yiannis Ritsos’ beautiful verse: \n",

      "It has been a challenge for the Greek Music Ensemble to use creatively the emotional attachment, the positive bias that we have with the music of some of the monumental figures of 20th century Greek Art Music, such as Manos and Mikis. Most of us have been raised, with their songs always around us since, in Greece of the 70’s and 80’s, it was mostly the music of those artists that was widely played on the radio, TV, concerts, and other public and private events.    \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Jerry Goldsmith is one of the most popular film composers of all time. You might recognize him for his score and theme to Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Or his thundering score for Disney’s Mulan. The echoing trumpets of Patton that lead into one of the most memorable marches in any war film. The soaring theme for Disneyland’s California Adventure’s most popular ride, Soarin’. Or his Oscar-winning choral/orchestral score for The Omen. Overall, he scored more than 250 projects.\n",
      "Due to his popularity, nearly every film score Goldsmith composed has been released in some form. But at least two works remain unreleased for the simple reason that the  original recordings are missing. One is his first theatrical film score, the western Black Patch from 1957. The second is The Man from 1972, about America’s first black president. These are noticeable gaps in his discography and the only way to fill those gaps is through new recordings of the scores.\n",
      "This is where Intrada … and you … come in. Intrada is one of the foremost record labels focusing exclusively on film music and has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with the composer and his legacy. Since 1985 (that’s 36 years for those counting), we’ve been releasing soundtracks from composers from all periods, featuring all types of music and genres. We even have a series of recordings in which we meticulously restore and authentically re-create film scores of the past. This series, in fact, started with Jerry Goldsmith. Back in the 1980s, Goldsmith himself spearheaded an Intrada recording of his favorite score, Islands in the Stream, and then, a few years later, Rio Conchos, a mid-’60s western recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra. Both releases were quite successful. Over the ensuing decades Intrada has made new recordings of scores by Bernard Herrmann, Miklós Rózsa and Dimitri Tiomkin.\n",
      "Our latest recording, the Kickstarter-funded Dial M for Murder from director Alfred Hitchcock,was done in 2018, with renowned conductor William T. Stromberg leading a striking and passionate performance by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. Simon Rhodes engineered, and Douglass Fake produced. The recording was enthusiastically received by Kickstarter patrons, critics and soundtrack collectors alike. For this new proposed project, we are reassembling the same dream team with plans to record this fall.\n",
      "Let’s dig a little deeper into each of these scores.\n",
      "Black Patch (1957) is the Warner Bros. western film that introduced Jerry Goldsmith’s feature film scoring talents to the world. The assignment gave the young composer the opportunity to demonstrate to everyone that his talent for scoring westerns resulted in music that was both melodic and fresh. Composed for orchestra without trumpets, the music is rich with inventiveness. The absence of trumpets results in an overall darker sheen to the music, befitting the somber, dark-edged storyline of the film. The absolutely ravishing centerpiece of the score is the haunting minor-key love theme, introduced in a quiet manner and richly developed into one of the composer’s finest early themes. The lean black-and-white film, set right after the Civil War, was directed by Allen Miner and written by Leo Gordon, who plays one of the protagonists in the film, alongside stars George Montgomery and Diane Brewster, with Sebastian Cabot playing a delightfully “Frenchified” villain.\n",
      "Listen to a few minutes from Black Patch taken directly from the film soundtrack.\n",
      "The Man (1972) is a fictitious political drama that starts when a freak accident makes the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, played by James Earl Jones, the first African-American president of the United States. This time Jerry Goldsmith not only uses trumpets but deploys them in fanfare-like passages drawn from the richest and most splendorous Americana mode! Taking his inspiration from Aaron Copland, Goldsmith fashioned a brief but powerful score befitting the extraordinary images of the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial and the magnificent portrait gallery of past U.S. Presidents. The film was produced by ABC Circle Films and intended for television but ultimately deemed of such superior quality that Paramount Pictures released it into theaters instead. Rod Serling penned the script, drawn from a bestselling Irving Wallace novel. Joseph Sargent helmed the picture and kept the primary story in focus with little distraction.\n",
      " Listen to a few minutes from The Man taken directly from the movie soundtrack.\n",
      "Leigh Phillips is reconstructing both previously unreleased scores—Black Patch from Jerry Goldsmith’s own surviving scores and The Man from the film print. Leigh was essential in our presentation of Jerry Goldsmith’s 1977 score forDamnation Alley, having re-performed the missing electronic overlays that allowed us to present the entire score back in 2017.\n",
      "William T. Stromberg, veteran of numerous classic film score recordings for both the Marco Polo label and his own Tribute Film Classics label, follows up on his magnificent and authentic interpretation of Dimitri Tiomkin’s Dial M For Murder score by again stepping up to the podium and leading the orchestra in this splendid new performance of two Jerry Goldsmith film scores being newly presented by Intrada!\n",
      "Having said all this, we can’t do this project without your help. So please join us on this journey to making two of the last Goldsmith scores to see the light of day available to everyone. We hope the many different rewards tiers are enticing.\n",

      "New album Lica Cecato & Stefano Scutari  \n",
      "DUE COMETE\n",
      "Why do we want to make a new album right now?\n",
      " The pandemic has had and is having unthinkable effects of a certain destruction on various fields of profession, including fields that are already fragile in themselves, such as art, and within it, music. Human beings have survival resources that they only use in extreme situations. Stefano and I met 40 years ago in Treviso, near Venice in northern Italy, through music and specifically, having in common a passion for acoustic guitar and Brazilian music. We made our first album exactly 30 years ago, \"Our Favorite Songs\", which is long out of print, but you can hear it on Spotify, Deezer, YouTube and other digital platforms. After our first recording, our professional lives were divided as I went to live abroad, we made, separately, about 12 albums each, with various line-ups. For at least 10 years we have dreamed of making a second album of our own, \"DUE COMETE Lica Cecato & Stefano Scutari\". During the pandemic, apart from 6 months in Rio de Janeiro last year, I arrived in Venice in mid-August 2020 and was no longer able to travel, as I usually do, living in Japan, Brazil and Italy. Confined in Venice for almost a year of lockdown, both Stefano Scutari and I started to meet to play guitar and sing for pure pleasure, and without a precise plan, we pulled out old compositions and created new ones, and when we saw, after about 3 months, we had 12 original songs, with varied rhythms, not only the very Brazilian flavour, but the Mediterranean one, with a rich variation that goes from milonga, to samba, to English pop, to Italian canzone, with lyrics in Portuguese, Italian, English, and one in Venetian dialect, which is where our story begins and continues until today.\n",
      "How is this album special \n",
      "For us, living as musicians for over four decades, even if a little counter-current, we both continue to love and praise acoustic music. Our album has a lot of it! For some songs we invited, besides the duo, the percussionist Leo di Angilla and Donatella Castellani as backing vocal. We recorded in Venice, at Waterland studio, whose sound engineer is Cristiano Verardo, a well-known guitarist who has won gold and platinum disks with the Venetian group Pitura Freska. Knowing each other for so many years, linked by this island-city, makes a recording very relax, cozy, takes away the normal tension of entering a studio.\n",
      "The Studio  \n",
      "The album is being recorded in “Waterland” studio, Venice, Italy, in June 2021. As I mentioned before, we have two guests, percussion and backing vocals. Now and 30 years ago, we enter the studio with only voice and guitar. The musical and sound quality is focused on the spontaneous live energy, presence and intimacy. High quality sound recording, warm, pure and rich.\n",
      "Rewards  \n",
      "With this campaign we offer you some very nice rewards. Besides a kind of \"pre-order\" of the digital album for download, CD or vinyl you also have the possibility of an exclusive concert with our duo! We are looking forward to doing shows, online or at your place, if it's in Europe, as we haven't been able to do live music for so long. We can forget the geographical problems and the cost of airfare and hotel and bring the music to your homes. During the pandemic we studied the best way to do online concerts, if you wish, exclusive for you and your friends. We also offer a digital songbook in pdf with all the sheet music, lyrics and a part of guitar tabs.\n",
      "We've known each other for over four decades and shared our love for music and art all through it, even taking different paths professionally. We grew older together and the music is still growing within our minds and hearts.\n",
      "We are really excited about this new album and hope that you will be too. We will be very grateful for any contribution and participation in making this happen!\n",

Alan, a published writer and enthusiast for philosophy, offers an unfamiliar character with a powerful message underlying his oddities; “Here’s to life, and to this moment.” With thought-provoking writing as the catalyst, our creators aim to evoke its audience's sense of wonder while rekindling curiosity. \n",

      "Our location in Scotland \n",
      "and how this story came to fruition is an example of how sound and imagery play into our most intricate emotions; inspiring ideas, changing minds and creating stories. With the setting as the source of inspiration, Wonderwritten and the story it tells were born. Wonderwritten and our main character are the product of creativity evoked by both visuals and music in relation to our setting in Scotland.\n",
      "OUR CROWDFUNDING GOAL \n",
      "Our Kickstarter goal is set for $40,000. A $40,000 minimum budget covers airfare, transportation, meals for cast and crew, lodging, acting talent, music licensing, shooting permit fees and location reservation for production in Scotland, as well as pledge perks such as reservation of the premiere venue, VIP dinner and after party venue costs.\n",
      "PRODUCTION SCHEDULE \n",
      "Production for Wonderwritten is slated for early May of 2018. Pre Production began in December of 2016 and Post Production is summer of 2018.\n",
      "TALENT AND CONNECTIONS IN SCOTLAND\n",
      "Professional acting talent is being sourced locally in Scotland. Producers, and designers for Wonderwritten are working through pre production with the assistance of artists and creators local to locations for the film. \n",
      "INTENTIONS AND OBJECTIVES \n",
      "Runtime for Wonderwritten is an estimated fifty minute length, planned to premiere November 2018 at the Historic Elsinore Theatre in our hometown of Salem, Oregon. Specific premiere date will be announced shortly following completion of campaign. Following this event, our plans for the film include submission to Film Festivals around the United States, Scotland and beyond, as well as a tour of screenings across the Pacific Northwest. Our Kickstarter campaign features backing levels that include standard and VIP tickets to see the film. Higher levels include VIP dinner and drinks with the creators as well as a VIP ticket to the after party in Salem, Oregon.\n",
      "\"We are excited to take on this huge project. I am excited to be telling a story that speaks to a lesser explored conversation about humanity and how we perceive experience during our brief time alive on this planet. How we embrace or disregard each moment, and each experience, how those experiences shape our thinking, how our minds change and how they don’t, and the overall intricacy of our behavior and interactions. From this project and this film, you should expect close attention to detail, and an encounter with characters that are utterly relatable, yet utterly unique and compelling. My goal is for this film to feel like an intimate conversation. Rich in substance, quirk, and thought, and warm with emotion. We have a story that focuses on how a particular character perceives heartbreak; the strongest emotions that overcome us as humans intimately interacting with other humans. Alan Ainsley is a writer, that published his first and only successful work titled “A Portrait of Awe” while deeply in love and living life with someone named Anna. So our audience is introduced to Alan, after having separated from this woman. And as the audience, you’re observing Alan in this aftermath of emotion. You’re coming up with ideas about his unique character, his situation and probably rather struck by his thoughts and behavior. There is a sense of wondering what exactly has happened here, and a mystery to Alan’s small journeys over the course of his story. The film is primarily monologue driven. We hear both Alan’s cultivated and spontaneous thoughts. Over the course of this story, we’re exposed to some really stunning imagery of our setting. The Scottish Highlands being one of the most grand visuals and Alan’s town and home, both very charming and full of character. I think that if all of us can get this project in front of Salem, even just Salem, we can reach our goals for budget, and we will premiere Wonderwritten at our historic theatre. Watching people over the past year look at this lovely, growing city in surprise and excitement for the community at work, makes me so thrilled to do exactly that.\"\n",

      "Filmmaking presents plenty of challenges and unforeseen circumstances. With a professional crew of experience ranging from 5-10 years in both the creative storytelling and business financing industries, we are taking every precaution to well-equip ourselves for the obstacles that may lie ahead. The challenges of crafting a story that takes place in Scotland with talent local to that area, and a crew flying in from overseas, are in the travel costs that it takes to get on location for the duration of time needed to produce the film. Our main character and the events that take place over the course of his story were written for the Scottish Highlands and all that this location has to offer. It is an adventure worth challenging ourselves to and only leaves us further inspired and passionate about this project.\n",

      "I've lived and worked in Whitby (a small town on the northeast coast of England) as an artist for several years now, but when I discovered the building I live in was going up for sale, I realised it was time for a new adventure. I've been given notice and have just a few weeks left to relocate myself and my business. That of course takes funds, so I thought it would be nice to combine my efforts to secure somewhere new with taking the chance to have one final long look at where I am now and celebrate Whitby in one last series of drawings.\n",
      " The drawings are done in charcoal pencil on watercolour paper and come in a black 8\" square frame (approx 20cm), with a white mount. The limited edition prints are on quality eco friendly paper and come bagged up with a 6\" white mount (approx 15cm).  I normally reuse photos for small drawings and repeat work to offer an entry level range - as this is a special project I'm offering unique one-off drawings. Each round of prints is a limited run of 50, hand signed and numbered.  \n",
      "   I am also including time lapse of the drawing being created and both rewards get an information sheet with more on the chosen subject - a bit about its history, location and what makes it special to me. Shipping is included at all levels - with that in mind, please note that if we hit stretch goals, additional bonus prints will be supplied bare (no mount) but still signed and numbered of course.  That way, backers get the best possible value and I retain enough funding to deliver the project (and myself to somewhere new).\n",
      "The setup of this project is very simple - I've costed producing one original and a limited run of prints from that artwork. If we double that target, I'll produce a second and so on - the great thing about this one is that for every additional round we manage, everyone gets a bonus print whether you've pledged for a mounted print or an original drawing.  So, the more we raise, the greater the rewards :) \n",
      "  I already have some photographs of iconic locations in and around Whitby that I haven't worked from before, some of which I may use for this project, I will also be taking more images in my final few weeks here as I revisit some of my favourite walks. The pictures shown above are samples of two existing Whitby drawings, featuring two of my very favourite spots so you can get a sense of my work and just how beautiful this place is. \n",
      "Since we've sailed past the initial target, I've started on the first of the new drawings - here's a quick work in progress image of the abbey ruins.  For more gothic gorgeousness, check out this quick video with some of the photographs I take my inspiration from, including that abbey shot.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The big risk with this project is of course the house move itself - although I am usually back up and running in a couple of days, there's a lot going on so I've allowed enough time after the move to get settled in and complete the drawings if I don't get chance to do the work before I go. The print company I have worked with several times before and I myself have run several successful projects already so it should otherwise be smooth sailing.\n",

We feel it is past time to set down the fruits of our labors on a record. A number of singular artists both old and new have inspired us. To name a few: Andy Irvine, Alasdair Fraser, Nic Jones, Martin Hayes, Dick Gaughan, Andre Brunet, and Nightingale. A common thread between these artists is their ability to thrive on playing old music with their own voice, to deliver their own version of these timeless songs and tunes. Like them, we're trying to build on the depth of this material by adding our own layers to what is already there, and adding our own story to the mix.\n",

Jim has quietly been creating many amazing records in the past five years, and we trust his ability to interpret our music. He is definitely the man to help us push this album forward. We also made an easy decision to invite the incredible Jeremiah McLane to join us as a guest on this album, playing accordion. He has paved the way for us with some of the singular recordings he has made in the past, and he is a huge inspiration to both of us. His presence on this recording will not only add color but a huge amount of depth that we could not achieve without him. \n",

My very first deck was an Alice deck, which makes this project even more special to me. Creating my own Alice deck and seeing this project come to life feels something like a world moment; mostly because I learning tarot through the story of Wonderland. \n",
      "The Wonder World Tarot is playful, fun & full of little surprises. It also includes references from Through the Looking Glass, which is also pretty awesome. I covered all costs for this print run out of pocket and all decks are currently in my possession. That said, I have only printed 500 copies, some of which I am sure will have some bruising. Because of this, I had to limit the number of all pledges. On the bright side, Push Kitty is still a very small name so no worries, that is still plenty!\n",
      "Specifications:\n",
      "Check out this flip-through video of the deck on Youtube, like & subscribe :). \n",
      "A'down the rabbit hole we go!\n",
      "The Wonderland stories & all of its renditions are captivating, both visually and textually. Alice's journey is very unusual. I find the world of wander to be quite magical, especially since the stories that really made no sense were always the most relatable & memorable to me. I spent a lot of life trying to make sense of things, but why worry? Life is weird, fun, and tumultuous at times; you get ups, downs and all sorts of in-betweens. I am a visual learner, so seeing the stories unfold were often teachable moments. Anywho, I am super excited to share this project with you all, The little Aimey inside of me jumps for joy!  \n",
      "The Major Arcana features many of the main characters including concurrent appearances of the star of the show, Little Alice. From the Fool to the World, Alice meets many friends and gets advice along the way, each encounter providing her with some rhyme or reason, trial or tribulation, and so on; all contributing to her accomplishments at the close. Alice is illustrated in a cooky little art style with some character changes, most obviously her red shoes. The red shoes are a nod to the Wizard of Oz, as the protagonist travels through the fools journey, swooning (mostly) everyone she meets. 🤪🥳\n",
      "The Wands suit feature both characters with major roles and supporting roles. The orangey (is that even a word? lol) fall colors are pretty consistent throughout the deck, but they are more prominent in the wands suit. Alice's journey through the suit starts with giving her something to fight for. This gift of passion is followed by plenty exchanges of... sorts, along the way.\n",
      "The cups suit finds that sweet spot between warm and cool colors. Autumn, with an emotive feel as the purples and peaches dance harmoniously throughout the imagery. With the suit of water we see plenty of emotional interactions, some bitter, some sweet, some...meh, like the Hatta in the four of cups; but hey, isn't that the name of the game? The game called LIFE... for most of us anyway. \n",
      "The swords suit leans on the blues and purples to give us that cool-airy feel mental process. The cheshire cat appears more in this suit because of his ability to engage one in thought. The cheshire cat's ability to answer a question without answering it is quite brilliant. This method encourages one to think for themselves; this way they are accountable for their own decisions and results. Oh, cat with the grin, guide us through the blues of the swords suit gently... or just slap us with knowing there is a hungry walrus that wants to eat us (7 of swords), or a pot-smoking ex-caterpillar who keeps asking us who we are (King of Swords). Lmaoo, haha! Okay in all seriousness, the swords suit lowkey leads with an air of anxiety. When I pull a card with swords I automatically think deeper into the reading. Mental health is so important and so is awareness. Take care of yourselves! Now off to the coins we go!\n",
      "Sweet mother of wander, the radiance and warmth pulsing through the coins suit is contagious... that is until you grow too large and get stuck in a \"nervously shilly-shally\" ol' rabbit's house that plans to blow you to smithereens (3 of coins)! lol. But hey, who likes a negative Nancy? Let's move on like our cute little flamingo and hedgehog friends (5 of coins). The suit of coins feature some characters from Through The Looking Glass folks, as well as the first Wonderland tale. The character selection is always done thoughfully, some of my favorite being the 3,5,10 and King of coins. Any true Alice fan will get it, otherwise you will be confused about why a large Dodo bird sits in the Kings position; but just so you know, this bird did lead a traumatized group of creatures into a caucus race that they all won. If thats not an entrepreneurial spirit, I dont know what is!\n",
      "This is the original Sun card which is almost identical to the other except the brothers have a snotty nose & the number (19) is a different color. I personally love this version with the snot, but I try not to be selfish for those who would prefer not to see mucus on their tarot cards lol 😂😂😂. Hear me out! external mucus represents impurities leaving the body, which makes lots of sense for the Sun card (at least I think so) lol. With both Sun cards we all have the option to keep one, the other or both. Maybe they can mean different things or just add a little more joy to your deck. I mean, how many of us experienced a happy little snotty nosed kid running around? Lol anyway, your deck, your choice. Can we make that hash tag?\n",
      "When the idea first came about, I thought of all the amazing Alice decks that were out there, all beautiful & unique in their own right. I thought about how my vision of the art would contribute to the brilliance of Lewis Carroll's creativity. I learned that creativity is a process, and most of us will experience some doubt along the way. I questioned my ability to re-image the world to make it feel a little more like... me. A little more unusual... a little more whimsey... a little more warm... a little more... fun! I thought of all the characters illustrated in this super unique, children's-book-like art style & the concept just felt so right!\n",

      "As many of you know, I have taken a leap of faith with this project, so i have already paid all costs to print and have the deck shipped to me. All of the Wonder World decks are currently in my possession, so turn around will be quite prompt. I believe in this project 100% so this was a no brainer for me. Then again, I am a bit of a risk taker so I would not regret a single thing if the project did not turn out how I'd hoped. \n",
      "Further, this deck has been elevated to the max! I paid extra for every single spec that I love to see in a deck. The magnetic box, the matte painted edging for longevity, even the silk matte finish cost me extra. The deck even better than I'd imaged, it was worth every penny. \n",
      "That said, we are all receiving a top notch deck as is, but I am happy to order some extra little goodies that can get to me quickely for the yum of it! These stretch goals apply to all backers with tangible goods. I'll add more if by some chance we get to some wild number with funding. If there are more backers than decks I will print another edition, but there will be changes to the back design, box design, edging and. card finish.

In 2020, she published her first book, “Bruxaria Hekatina” (Hekatean Witchcraft), and in 2021 she published “As Faces de Hekate” (The Faces of Hekate).

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "The Marlin Briscoe movie project, titled The Magician, recounts the amazing, true-life journey of Marlin \"the Magician\" Briscoe, the first starting black quarterback in professional football. However, this is not merely a football movie, it is a gut-wrenching and inspirational story about a man who never gave up, despite the worst of odds.  The original screenplay was written by Gregory Allen Howard, writer of Remember the Titans and Ali.\n",
      "Marlin grew up in a single-parent home in the racially divided housing projects of South Omaha.  From an early age, he was forced to endure, and overcome, many of the discriminatory practices of that time.  But with the guidance of his mother and a father-like cousin, Marlin escaped a lifetime of working in the packing plants with a full-ride scholarship to Omaha University (now the University of Nebraska at Omaha).\n",
      "The late coach Al Caniglia saw something special in Marlin, and made him the starting quarterback.  Upon graduation in 1968, after a record-setting career in college, Marlin was drafted in the 14th round by the Denver Broncos, but not as a quarterback, as a defensive back. However, at the prophetic advice of \"Coach Al,\" who knew that the Broncos were one of only a few teams that held training camps open to the public, Marlin negotiated a three-day tryout with the quarterbacks. He agreed that, after the three days, he would quietly move to defensive back and \"start tackling people.\"\n",
      "Marlin's abilities out-shined the other quarterbacks in camp, but at the end of his negotiated tryout, he was moved to defensive back.  About halfway through the 1968 season, after injuries sidelined starter Steve Tensi and his backups proved futile, the Broncos reluctantly moved Marlin into the role of starting quarterback.  In a short season, Marlin set the rookie record for touchdowns, a record that still stands today, and was runner-up for Rookie of the Year.\n",
      "Despite his success, Marlin was released from the Broncos without explanation and returned to Omaha jobless.  Marlin had done the unthinkable, and broken the color barrier for black quarterbacks everywhere, but the writing was on the wall.  He knew that to stay in the league, he would have to change positions.  With the help of former teammates and his cousin, Bob Rose, Marlin trained as a wide receiver, a position he had never before played.  But all the while, he never gave up hope that he would once again play quarterback.\n",
      "Within two years, Marlin was named an All-Pro wide receiver with the Buffalo Bills.  Legendary coach Don Shula traded a first round draft pick to bring Marlin to the Miami Dolphins, where he earned two Super Bowl rings and was an integral member of the 1972 Dolphins, the only undefeated Super Bowl champion.  Marlin ended his football career in 1976, never getting the opportunity to play quarterback again.\n",
      "On top of the world after a successful football career, Marlin moved to Los Angeles looking for new challenges.  Job offers were plentiful and Marlin quickly adjusted to the fast-paced life of LA.  But it all came too easy.  There were no racial hurdles to jump and no competition to be found; the things that had always driven Marlin to succeed.  He no longer had to be disciplined.  He was lost and, in spite of all his success, still bitterly anguished the the role of quarterback had been taken from him.\n",
      "A dark obsession began to reveal itself; something to which Marlin had no answer.  And what started out as innocent partying turned into what Marlin calls \"the real story,\" an addiction to crack cocaine that took his job, his house, his marriage and on several occasions, nearly his life. Marlin's life spiraled out of control, as he spent days, months and years chasing that high.  He conned passersby for drug money and isolated himself from family, friends and teammates.  At one point, he even spent the weekend locked in the trunk of a drug dealer's car.\n",
      "But just as Marlin had persevered in his battle to overcome racism in professional football, he would overcome addiction as well.  Many people played pivotal roles in his recovery, but ultimately, it was the Magician himself who had to turn the corner.\n",
      "The Magician will chronicle, not only Marlin's historic accomplishments on the football field, but his meteoric fall from glory at the hands of a crack addiction.  It will also dissect his life experiences and past relationships that enabled him to finally overcome his demons.  The Magician will be a strong character-driven film that will focus on the man himself and his life-long struggle for self-discovery and self-fulfillment.\n",

      "This project is near and dear to my heart. I started working on this screenplay April 30th 2007. Since then a lot has changed in my life. I have an 8 year old son, I've written 4 screenplay so far but the time for writing and waiting is over. Its time to bring these projects to life starting with Unsalted Butter my 2nd full length screenplay. \n",
      "My goal is to take $50,000 to hire a novelist to convert this screenplay into a novel while simultaneously hiring a play-writer to convert this screenplay into a play. Once the play-write and novel has been completed I will release the novel onto kdp.amazon.com. We will do several shows locally for the play-write and depending on the success of the two plus the leftover funds, the full length feature film will begin pre-production. I will collaborate with the other two writers to strengthen the screenplay and hiring actors in addition to using the stage actors as well. \n",
      "The success of all three platforms will help spawn my film production company Blue Journal Studios to create the other projects and help bring other writers works to life as you have for me.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The risks and challenges that come with this project are simple. This will require me leaving my job and writing full time. Finding a play-writer and novelist that share my vision and can bring some perspective to my work. Now I plan on having 3 different endings. The play should have one, the novel another but the movie may be a blend of both the play and novel or something completely different. Finding the 3 endings will be a challenge. A fun challenge, but a challenge none the less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the money is in place and the scripts are complete, finding the actors to fill the play and films role, paying the actors and negotiating pay, booking the locations for the play, getting the word out, promotion, marketing, buying the wardrobe, renting the equipment and finding men and women to operate them. The novel will need a good publisher, paying for the prints. Copy-writing all 3 projects, building the interest through social media, local word of mouth, YouTube. Those are just some of the challenges that come with this project. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know what you're thinking. What makes me qualified? The truth is I am  not. This project is my passion and I will make a lot of mistakes in the process but the money will not be wasted. I have and associates degree in business administration and a passion for film and art. My creativity has led me to this path. This project is just the beginning. After all three stories have been produced the revenue from this will full the other projects that are in the works. The end game is to open Blue Journal Studios. This company will create opportunities for other artist, musicians, actors, directors, producers, etc. My goal is to make movies, music videos, commercials, TV Shows, books and any other form of art. My goal is to bring new forms of art to the world. To break the mold and destroy what is defined as the norm. My true challenge is to bring the world fresh perspective!\n",

International shipping will be harder to determine. I've sent packages to Canada for $15usd and to Australia for over $40usd for the same package weight.

      "Because.... \n",
      "This is DUB. This is ROOTS. This is REGGAE influenced music with a touch of ELECTRONICA.  A vinyl record has a groove carved into it that mirrors the original sound's waveform. This means that no information is lost. The output of a record player is analog. ... This means that the waveforms from a vinyl recording can be much more accurate, and that can be heard in the richness of the sound.  Alison's deep meditative bass is the common thread throughout our album; binding together beats, rich tones, deep lyrics and ethereal vocals that create a unique dub experience.  \n",

Carla has been a self-educated music producer since 2006, engineering most of the trance vocals she's performed, and producing three of her own albums.  'TRUE NATURE' is her debut as mixer alongside Lucius Borich.   'TRUE NATURE' is a culmination of tracks written over several years drawing influence from the happenings in the world we live today, including musical inspirators Alpha & Omega, Massive Attack, Fat Freddy’s Drop, Lee Scratch Perry, Grace Jones, Thievery Corporation and Bob Marley.   The album was produced and partly recorded in the US and completed in New Zealand during the lockdown period of 2020, forcing Carla to work remotely with various musicians/artists in the US, Australia and New Zealand including Alison. In the lockdown, a remix emerged of the album's flagship track 'One To Ten' by producer Paddy Free (NZ) (‘Salmonella Dub’ - ‘Inside The Dub Plates’). ‘One To Ten - Paddy Free Remix’ was released October 1, 2020 and features as an extended dub version on Paddy's own album ‘Paddy Free In Dub #2’ released in April, 2021. \n",

      "With $5000 raised, I can kick start my PR campaign, backed by a seasoned consultant, and cover my album production costs. In the event we exceed my goal, I will use the extra funding toward exciting extras. If we reach $7000, I can make a professional music video for one of my singles. If we reach $9000, I'll put the money towards a radio campaign and put the album on vinyl, which would be a dream come true! Eveything I raise will go toward this album. \n",

      "It all started with a song. It's a bright, funny, adorable, get-up-and-dance song that was just begging to be illustrated. I could see it as soon as we put our lyrics together with the music. I could see our main characters, Larry & Joe, coming to life on the pages of a book. \n",
      "My name is Stephanie (Beppie). I'm a JUNO-nominated children's artist. My fourth album (Dino-mite!) is coming out this fall, and right along with it will be my first-ever children's book! The album itself has been a labor of love for the past two years. This dream of mine to create a children's book began long before that. Three kids, three albums, and three million cups of coffee later, I can finally say that IT IS HAPPENING!\n",
      "Last year I teamed up with a local artist, Robyn Slack, to start the process of bringing these dynamic dancing dinosaurs to life. Larry & Joe were not new characters in my world though, in fact, they made their grand debut on my JUNO nominated children's album back in 2019. Since then, Larry & Joe has remained my number one selling, my most streamed, and my most requested song. It only made sense for them to make a comeback in a BIG way.  \n",
      "Robyn and I are almost done with our first draft of the book! To make our project come to life, we will need to raise funds. Funds for printing, marketing, mastering, and editing. All of the funding so far to create the book project has come from my own personal bank account. I believe in this song and this story so much that I have invested my own money, hundreds of hours, and all of my creative energy for the past two years into making it happen. We are so close we can almost taste it (but we won't taste it, cause it's a book, and people shouldn't eat books....duh!).\n",
      "This fall will be so exciting! We will be embarking on a virtual Jam & Draw tour, a music tour, and a book reading tour all across the prairies here in Canada and virtually across the globe. We are pulling out all the stops to share the love and the energy that Larry & Joe bring to the world.  I know that you will love this song and story combo as much as I do! It's time for the kids of the world to get up and dance with Larry & Joe. As Joe would say:\n",
      "Wiggle that Dino tail tonight and ROAR! 'Cause, you're Dino-mite!\n",

      "Nothing is without risk. And this project has definitely come with its fair share of challenges.  The pandemic alone has presented a wealth of obstacles such as the absence of physical touring, restrictions to in-person performances, and limited resources and funding.  Acquiring funding for a full-length album on top of raising funds for the book project has also been a challenge.  \n",

      "Although we are faced with many difficult barriers, we are working hard to make sure that our work gets out to our audience.

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "If Taylor Swift and Paul McCartney can do it, so could I.  And I did; I recorded an album during COVID lockdown. Thanks to the internet, I had lots of help.\n",
      "Like many songwriters, I’m an OK singer who sometimes backs himself up with more trained voices. David Taylor is a dynamic singer with whom I’ve been in several bands over the years. He’s also appeared on a few of my previous records.\n",
      "Another former bandmate and songwriter Leslie Sanazaro added a few notes of her lovely voice, as did Nicole Colombatto. These three add a striking finale to the gruff male musicians playing and singing “F-kt Up”.\n",
      "Folk veteran David Helling adds his soothing baritone and guitar in our little “Lullalbye” duet.\n",
      "Two hot-shot guitarists, Mark Youngbauer and Scott Rockwood, are also from the Saint Louis rock scene. Mark has played in a few bands with me, as well as many others over the years. He plays with effortless taste and ease. I’ve seen him play a few gigs with Scott, who is a founding member of Madahoochi. Madahoochi were fan faves in town, and made a name for themselves regionally. He himself is a brilliant songwriter as well as virtuosic guitarist. Once you hear his guitar on “Coming To Terms”, you’ll understand his reputation.\n",
      "So far, everyone I’ve mentioned is a Saint Louis resident. Or in Scott’s case -- was -- but he moved to Florida a few years back with his partner, Shawn Hartung, yet another excellent musician.\n",
      "But this album was recorded in the COVID era, so we actually didn’t get to record much in person. Recording and playing music, live or in the studio, is usually done in person. But, as you probably recall, that was a luxury none of us could enjoy during that time span. No eye contact, no pats on the back, no taking breaks together. Most importantly to the groove, no ensemble playing! That created many challenges, and this album benefits from modern technology. Not just that we had to simulate a live band while playing one at a time, but also distance. Again, even with my beloved fellow Saint Louisans, they may as well have been hundreds or thousands of miles away. And some were. But thanks to the internet, we were still able to share files.\n",
      "The two exceptions were the lullabye I did with David Helling, and the other is the pseudo-ska song, “Do What You Do (Don’t What You Won’t)”. The basic tracks (bass and drums) were recorded in The Before Times, when my friend Matt Kaden came to town a few years back. Mr. Kaden is a veteran songwriter himself, a multi-instrumentalist who also appeared on my previous albums, Pop Another Cork and  Down. If ever there were an act that fit the title The Greatest Band You’ve Never Heard Of, that would be his. He was part of a three-headed monster called Soothing Sounds For Baby, a cult-classic Boston band from the 1980s and ‘90s. Fellow Soothing Sounds member Al Hifi played also appeared on this album; I’ll get  to him in a moment.\n",
      "The silver lining to making music over the internet, with distance irrelevant, was that I reunited with some former bandmates and collaborators from younger days. My buddy Matt Schickele joined in the fun for a few tracks, including the super-happy organ part on that aforementioned ska song, and some harmonies elsewhere. Reuniting with old college buddies was especially satisfying. It wasn’t just that we had a reason to talk and work together, which was fun, but we share a history. We understand each others’ mental shorthand, preferences, and logic. Let’s just say it’s nice to be understood.\n",
      "Which brings us to the heavy hitters, without whom this album would not be as great. Dan Sonenberg and Allan Heifetz, aka Al Hifi, both made enormous contributions. They’re both bandmates from younger days, and to collaborate with them was a joy. Dan is a composition professor at University of Maine, whose opera “The Summer King” has drawn national attention and praise. He’s also a mad-cap songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, especially featured as this album’s main drummer. Al is also a mean drummer (another member Soothing Sounds for Baby), but mostly plays guitar and bass, abitof singing as well as drum programming. Speaking of robots, I arranged orchestral instruments more than usual, and that in some ways dictated our workflow. They were often the foundation upon which we built. Knowing that, it impresses me all the more that the music flows as organically as it does. Al Hifi is a one-of-a-kind artist, a hilarious yet deep songwriter and videographer. He was a great influence on me in our formative days, and it’s a delight to reunite artistically.\n",

The greatest hurdle is money, and that's where you come in.  The goal set for this Kickstarter project is a mere fraction of one of the actual costs involved in making the album.\n",

We have spent the last twelve months crafting our dream in its natural, authentic state, and turning down outside investments that would compromise that. We have the consumer buzz, capability, passion & drive to succeed, but need capital for a successful explosive growth.  Every dollar we raise from the support of this Kickstarter community would help our mission to fuel community wellness and promote positivity with nutritionally dense and accessible avocado dishes.\n",

Her passion for cooking has grown as she’s sought out a variety of foods that support a competitive athlete’s lifestyle. Avocados have become a daily staple in her diet due to the high nutrition and fuel they provide.

      "The main intention of this redemptive mission is twofold: the creation of a neighborhood coffeehouse, and through it, the establishment of a leadership development program. The program consists of three intermediate objectives and one final objective. The three intermediate objectives are Hard Skill Training, Soft-Skill Training, and Holistic Assessment. We will teach them teamwork, problem-solving, time management, and more. Lastly, we will address the mental, emotional, and spiritual health needs of our employees. This includes life coaching centered on addressing all aspects of their personal well-being. This will enable our trainees to arrive at the final objective of developing a solid skillset, becoming well rounded and self-sufficient, to the point that they are able to transition to long-term, sustainable employment.\n",
      "Rail//Line Coffee is a work of Community Leadership and Development Inc. to reclaim, restore, and promote community renewal. It will serve as a neighborhood coffeehouse to which locals can come, enjoy coffee, and grow their relationships. We will employ at-risk youth and women from within the community. Due to the nature of our community, most of our trainees do not drive, which makes our location and mission unique. As we live and serve in South Billings, we understand the lack of economic opportunities that currently exist south of the tracks. It is our hope and goal that Rail//Line Coffee will function not only as an impetus for economic growth and stability, but also provide a practical job and leadership training program teens and women will find advantageous for furthering their own personal growth and employment opportunities.\n",
      "‘South Billings’ is generally recognized as the area hemmed by rail lines running east-west through downtown; from there, south to Interstate 90, and bordered on the east and west by Interstate exits forming a distinct area of demarcation. It is home to the City/County Jail, the Montana State Women’s Prison, the Yellowstone County Youth Detention Center, and Probation/Parole Offices; CLDI recognizes that it is also home to over 9,000 persons, primarily families. The population is unique with a distinct community identity, and is arguably one of our state’s most ethnically diverse communities. While Montana is 89% Caucasian, South Billings is comprised of 27% Native American, 25% Hispanic, 8% African American and 40% Caucasian individuals. These families are served by three elementary schools plus a middle school, all of which have Title I designation. \n",
      "According to US Census data (2010), the two primary census tracts where our clients are located (Billings’ tract #9.02 and tract #3.0), the median family income is $29,000 and $25,000 respectively. The median family income for the entire zip-code (59101) measures $42,986, which shows a great disparity in finances for those served by our programs. As many as 69% of these persons rent the spaces where they live compared to a city-wide ratio of just 37% rental occupancy.\n",
      "CLDI is a faith-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has been working since 1981 to invest in and foster transformation in Billings’ oldest and most marginalized community, the South Side. Our mission is to seek transformation through the gospel by rebuilding lives, restoring families, and re-neighboring communities. Our work has included: job-skill training for men coming out of prison; building and offering quality, affordable housing to persons in need; life-skill training and development for older teenagers and adults in order to help advance career opportunities; work with pregnant and parenting mothers to counsel them, as well as providing transitional housing to women exiting incarceration and drug abuse; and lastly, staff and volunteers to work with at-risk youth, family members, partner organizations, and schools serving the South Side. A core belief of CLDI is that all people have Imago Dei, meaning they have been created in the image of God, therefore, all people have intrinsic value and worth. Driven by this belief, CLDI intentionally engages those we serve in relationship to emphasize dignity, hope, and cast vision for living life to one’s fullest potential. We believe that through this relational investment, change is obtainable and that such change will greatly impact individuals and families, thus, communities and the city as a whole.\n",
      "Mission Statement – We aim to stimulate economic growth on the South Side and provide a strategic work and leadership development program for at-risk teenagers and women.\n",
      "Core Values:\n",
      "Rail//Line Coffee will serve the South Side of Billings as a neighborhood coffeehouse. Within its walls, we will employ at-risk youth and women. Each employee will participate in an employment and leadership development program constructed by management. This program will serve several objectives such as providing meaningful employment, higher-wage paying jobs, skill development, and holistic coaching for the purpose of self-sustained employment elsewhere down the road.\n",
      "Our youth truly desire to be involved in the mission of CLDI, and to employ them as part of Rail//Line Coffee would provide great opportunities to encourage their growth and development. This redemptive mission model can serve as a bridge between our various works, such as Youth Works (our program to serve at-risk youth) and the Hannah House (a sober home for women stepping out of addiction and to be reunited with their children) by providing an avenue of employment and job training opportunities that will not only enhance the individual, but the community as a whole. By providing intentional leadership development and job skill training for some of the women and youth we serve, it will provide real hands-on experience in business development and management, paving the way for higher-paying wages upon graduation from the leadership program.\n",
      "Additionally, the building is located in a highly visible and accessible area, as 1st Avenue South serves as a central vein for those commuting throughout the various parts of the city. With the ability to include a drive-through into the building design, along with our goal to fully fund the renovation and first-year operating costs of the project, this is a redemptive mission model that has every opportunity to not only be sustainable, but lucrative.\n",
      "CLDI has a reputation for undertaking projects that are not only challenging but also complicated. Due to location and local history of the gas station, one outcome will be a greater connection to the community through the provision of a local neighborhood space and aligns with the ministry and work we engage in, to restore and transform our community.\n",
      "We will evaluate the success of our project’s objectives through a specific set of performance measures. Our first performance measure will be the financial viability of Rail//Line Coffee. We will measure our profit vs. loss and get an understanding to how well we are doing economically. This will provide insight into ways we can continue to save money, steward it wisely, or grow the program even more. If the coffeehouse begins to lose profit we will reevaluate and identify avenues so that we may continue the program. If Rail//Line Coffee is growing its profits, we will then look for ways to bring on more individuals or utilize our income supporting CLDI programs.\n",
      "The second performance measure of Rail//Line Coffee will be a measure of how well the job and leadership development program is working for the individuals who are participating. This will be measured through employee assessments. Each assessment will cover the employee’s performance as well as provide a means to evaluate their supervisors. It will look for ways to improve the system, ways to help them individually, and ways the managers can lead better. Leadership within Rail//Line Coffee will also fill out personal and employee assessments. These assessments will help employees learn their strengths and shore up weaknesses. It will also help the managers learn where they can do better professionally.  If necessary, the program will be adjusted to become more efficient.\n",
      "Lastly, our final performance measure will investigate the number of graduates from the job development program who have found employment within a new business elsewhere. Through this, we will get quantitative data behind the actual number of graduates currently employed outside CLDI. Furthermore, we will follow up and collect qualitative data from employers and graduates of how their skills are being utilized and whether they see success from the program. This information will be gathered by tracking our trainees after they have graduated and have obtained long-term sustainable employment. These external assessments will be collected and combined into a quarterly report to be used as an evaluation tool by Rail//Line Coffee’s leadership.\n",
      "We have established three intermediate goals and one overarching goal of our job development program. In no particular order, our first goal of success is the hard-skill training goal. We aim to teach our trainees how to be a successful barista when it comes to drink making, using espresso machines, cash management, using a point-of-sale computer, customer service, and more. This goal will be reached through the hands-on work our employees will do every day. The second goal we have established is our soft-skill training goal. This involves time management, interpersonal skills, communication training, problem-solving, teamwork, etc. Through successfully meeting this goal we will enable our employees the ability to work beyond coffee bars, as these skills translate to any job. Our third goal is to holistically assess and address our employee’s emotional, mental, and spiritual needs as they progress through the program.

      "Our Pro Forma encapsulates our project’s total costs including the land purchase and soft, hard, and other costs. In total, our project will cost $867,003.

Soft Costs include architectural/design/consulting, site analysis, civil engineering, and reimbursables. This total will cost $43,080. Other Costs include a cash contingency, real estate taxes, and insurance, title &/or builders risk. This will cost $45,134.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Chef Marc, chef of Renaissance Café, started as a small chef providing meals for friends and family. Chef Marc has grown up around cooking and restaurants his entire life. He remembers his father making the best meals, particularly around the holidays. He can still remember when his talent for making something with limited ingredients clicked. He was living in France and he wanted a thanksgiving meal. He was able to make an entire meal without the use of a recipe.\n",
      "He spent the next 10 years working in various restaurants and bakeries learning the skills it took to run a business. His pride and joy, however, came from a yearly tradition where 20 of his friends would rent a cabin and he would be the live-in chef for the week. He loved the memories they all made as they ate great food and they all liked that it only cost $20 a person for an enormous amount of food.\n",
      "Chef Marc knew that he could provide the same amount of joy to anyone that sampled his cooking. His flair and creativeness still runs throughout his cooking and he truly believes that the devil is in the details.\n",
      "His first deli job was at the Draper Historic Theatre. Chef Marc finds in funny that his first café will be at the same location he started learning about the art of cooking. As a start-up company, Renaissance Café will provide brunch items, soups and salads, sandwiches, and boxed dinners catering to the busy homemaker of Salt Lake City.\n",
      "The Draper Historic Theatre has always been a hidden jewel in the heart of Draper City, Utah. With a jewel such as this, a delicate café would be the icing on the cake. A café would also benefit the theatre for concessions and events such as dinner theatre. Having this café will cater to the following:\n",
      "· Clientele of the theatre.\n",
      "· Draper community, homemakers, and workers around the rapidly growing city of Draper\n",
      "· Busy Homemakers including working moms and dads\n",
      "Right now is the perfect time to start up as the holiday season begins to make its time-consuming way into the lives of the projected clientele. Having easy and affordable meals available during the busiest part of the days is exactly what everyone is looking for, whether they want a quick stay, passing by or a comfortable area to sit and relax for a few minutes. Renaissance Café can provide exactly what clients are looking for.\n",
      "Renaissance Café believes that every meal is a gift and in doing so, each meal (To Go) will be boxed and tied with ribbon. Carry out bags will look like gift bags, making every dining experience a gift.\n",
      "With the few cafés that sparsely populate Draper City, Renaissance Café will join the few already seasoned restaurants in the area. Our biggest gain is the theatre goers that attend the theatre every weekend. The expansion to the theatre concession menu will start of the Café clientele strong and stable.\n",
      "Profitability will follow the rule of all business. We presume the equation will be as follows: Labor 30%- Food and supplies 30%- rent, insurance, ect 20%- profit 20%.\n",
      "With expected low start up costs, profitability is expected end of 2nd quarter. Start up costs are expected to be under $45,000. The café will have 20 indoor seats, (with outdoor not included), income is expected to be 21,600 per month.\n",
      "What makes us unique is that we are working with the Draper Historic Theatre( A 501c nonprofit organization) to mutually benefit each other in providing clientele and with the projected economic growth in Draper of 41.4% , the need for a café is unanimously needed for the heart of draper.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "As with any restaurant, it always is a big risk. The biggest challenge is finding  customers that are aware of the business. Our first plan to overcome this challenge is a gift as we get free advertising and awareness by the 1500 people that walking into the location, monthly, to see plays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our second plan of action is to have a catering manager, that will visit the surrounding business that will deliver cookies and other product. This will also raise awareness of the cafe.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our final challenge is dated kitchen, that although already in working order, needs to be updated for use in a commercial setting. It needs a commercial fridge, commercial stoves,  ventilation, and cosmetic upgrades. We are raising funds to supply these items.\n",

      "I couldn't agree more!  Where is Alice P  is a very special cookie and dessert bakery located in Lake Charles, Louisiana. At the moment, I only sell my gourmet cookies and desserts at home. I have decided to open up my very own production facility/bakery. This kickstarter campaign will help me financially handle many unexpected cost overruns of opening my bakery. But most importantly, make some of my most unique cookies (and baking sessions with me Enola Henderson) available as Rewards to our Kickstarter backers and the general public for the first time ever. \n",
      "Not only will you be helping Where is Alice P,  but you would be helping another local business as well Tracy’s Sweet Connections  with the financial security she would need to continue to take care of her family.\n",
      "\"Not just a cookie or dessert, but a whole different experience\"  - Enola Henderson\n",
      "Where is Alice P Cookies are big, decadent, unique and seriously delicious, gourmet cookies that are intended to warm the heart and nourish the soul. These huge cookies are between 4.5 to Five ounces in weight and as big as your palm, they are baked with love every single morning with the utmost care and created out of the best ingredients I can get my hands on. They're soft, crunchy on the outside and gooey, chewy, on the inside. They are not too sweet, but perfectly salty, savory and very special - there is no other cookie in Lake Charles, La like Where is Alice P. But it's not just one cookie, it's over 90 mouthwatering varieties that will rotate on a weekly basics. \n",
      "Where is Alice P desserts are decadent, unique and take your taste buds to a different level with each new dessert you try. From my over the top double stuffed apples, my delicious over the top cheesecakes. I like to play on flavors that pair well together like my raspberry, lemon pistachio cake. My red velvet pralines or a pink champagne cookie topped with a moist chocolate cake with a raspberry fruit filling the combinations of flavors are limited at Where is Alice P.\n",
      " From my mother, to me,  to you made with love and passion!!\n",
      "A healthy meal will always nourish your body and mind but, a cookie and slice of cake will nourish your heart and bring love into the world.  Enola Henderson\n",
      "After my mother who was the baker in my family passed away, I decided to share her passion with the world. I wanted to focus on making the best cookies and dessert in Lake Charles and make them sharable with the world, I knew this would make people instantly happy and fill their hearts with love. My mother Alice Papillion was big on helping others and making them happy through the sweets she so loved to bake. \n",
      "So I started baking  full time out of my home. The word spread fast and success soon followed. I went from one store to 10 in 1 month! It was amazing how much joy a simple cookie brought to my wholesale customers, but most importantly, their customers. I was beyond shocked because never in a million years would I have thought. Something that I baked that me and my mother shared would bring so many people so much happiness. \n",
      "Where is Alice P is now ready to take her place in the baking world. The next step is to own a commercial building here in Lake Charles, La. A space that will not just be any space, but a  home to welcome all desserts lovers, a place of comfort, love and warmth, a dream come true. \n",
      "And so, I am asking the community for help. And if I can reward people with cookies and other desserts in exchange for their support, everyone wins. \n",
      "I am turning to Kickstarter not only as a way to help fund opening my business, but as a way to build something wonderful and delicious - an incredible new cookie and dessert community in Lake Charles, La. A place where after i get the business situated in the new space, for the first time ever, Where is Alice P cookies and desserts will be directly available to the general public once again. The way they were meant to be, warm fresh out the oven and made to order. \n",
      "Kickstarter funds will be used to help complete any construction I may need once in the building.  The funds will also go towards start-up capital to help me grow from a \"one woman show\" into a full scale establishment with real employees. Also it will help with start up supplies and equipment. \n",
      "My goals are sweet & simple. I want to build beautiful long lasting relationships with my supporters and become an integral part of the growing artisanal community that is putting Lake Charles on the map as one of the most vibrant, exciting retirement and delicious food destinations in the world. Along the way, it wouldn't hurt to try and make the world a better place one big chewy cookie or one delicious slice of decadent dessert at a time. I believe in the value of doing good and giving back. This is what my mother believed in as well. It is with these thoughts that I move forward, hopefully with your support. Please check out the sweet rewards I have created  for your generosity. And thank you in advance!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "As many of you know, the risks and challenges associated with an independent start-up business are many. At this point, being terrified is not an option. In the beginning, my immediate challenge is to bring in enough business to keep the business going. Not only to sustain it, but to grow it with many new expenses I didn't have in my home. Which brings me to my next forseeable challenge of growing without compromising the quality of the product. Both these challenges will be addressed head on as they come with hard work and integrity. Finding good people to work at the shop is another challenge I forsee. We plan to seek out like-minded individuals who yearn to be part of something great and grow professionally and personally.\n",

      "The idea behind +BLUE (More Blue or Mais Blue in portuguese) began when I sang for Caetano Veloso in 2012. His song \"A Little More Blue,\" which he wrote and recorded while in exile in 1971, became a staple in my performances and inspired a collection of new original songs that pull from my own experience of leaving home and belonging. \n",
      "The sounds of vintage tropicalismo, jazz, samba, and soul, plus a trace of modern elements are the backbone for 8 new compositions and 3 selected covers that make up the album. They are my immigrant love letters to Brazil and to other artists before me who left Brazil, like Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, and Carmen Miranda. A special nod also goes to influential groups from the 70’s like Os Mutantes and Os Novos Baianos. \n",
      "Here's \"Ladeira Da Praça\" by Os Novos Baianos. I blended their samba with a Motown groove!\n",
      "I reharmonized Caetano’s melancholy cry for his country, \"A Little More Blue,\" and recorded it with a modern jazz/blues production. Check out the Os Mutantes inspired psychedelic final verse of the song. The album title, +Blue, was born of this song’s title. \n",
      "In the samba-funk song “Pois É E Tal” (So It Is And Such), the ambiguities of “where is home” can be resolved at the ubiquitous crossroads where Exu is called upon to point the way. \n",
      "“Guerreira Vai” (roughly translated to \"you go girl!\" :-) fuses baião and 70’s funk as a backdrop to a magical story starring Roberto Carlos, Gal Costa, and my \"patron saints” Carmen Miranda and Caetano Veloso. Here's a bit of the demo:\n",
      "“South American Way,” made popular in the 30’s by Carmen Miranda is re-imagined as a lamenting ballad with jazz, samba, and electronic elements.\n",
      "\"We Belong Here,\" with the energy of a 70's samba from Jorge Ben or vintageSergio Mendes, takes you on the back and forth of my upbringing between São Paulo and Chicago...and where ever you land, well that's where you belong! \n",
      "The samba, \"Quando Me Desamericanisar\" (when I dis-americanize) is my answer to Carmen Miranda's \"Disseram Que Voltei Americanizada\" and pokes fun at my expense of trying to re-acclimate to Brazil after a long absence. \n",
      "Reminiscent of Baden Powell & Vinicius de Moraes' Afro Sambas, \"Sangue Da Terra\" (Blood Of The Land) traces the immigrant story and the ever pulsing blood of the homeland. Check out the demo:\n",

But I have all sorts of plan Bs: alternate musicians and studios will help to accommodate scheduling issues and alternate production approaches could help with both scheduling and budgeting issues that might come up. \n",

      "We areSiddhartha School, a rural school in the Himalayan region of northern India called Ladakh. Through continued partnership with the Ladakh Arts and Media Organization (LAMO), we seek to provide our students with new opportunities to learn traditional and modern forms of Ladakhi music by bringing back a six-week music camp for interested children. Last year's camp was a great success and the children made a wonderful DVD of their songs for backers and for world music fans everywhere. This year we'd like to prepare them for a weekend of live performances on LAMO's outdoor stage, so they can share their music with the local community and help them gain confidence for recording sessions culminating in a new DVD.\n",
      "What's more, this year we will involve our students more in the recording and production of their new DVD product, challenging them to learn more about the media arts entailed in creating their own recording.\n",
      " Ladakhi music is an amalgamation of many influences – located as it is on the crossroads of high Asia. It has taken from other cultures but retains a special sound all its own.\n",
      "Curious?\n",
      "Listen to an excerpt from a PRX documentary on Ladakhi music by Conor Gilles, a Siddhartha School intern, and local musicians.\n",
      " Why have a music camp and why make a DVD? At our school we strive to offer a sensitive curriculum that honors our rich traditions and life ways.  We find traditional music and song cycles are being forgotten as new forms of media take over people’s lives and children have no venues to engage with the past, as Ladakhi art forms are seldom taught in schools.  We've found that when our kids are given the chance to meet local artists and musicians, they are left wanting more. They want to learn by playing and mastering the forms under the guidance of real performers. We'd like to give them that chance again this year, and build on our prior success by engaging them in the production process with LAMO and videographers, graphic designers, and sound editors. Our children are eager to work with local musicians and the professional media staff at LAMO, our partner in this meaningful project. Will you join us?\n",
      "The Basics:\n",
      "Our first goal is to create a six week music camp for 30 students as an extracurricular activity, encouraging the children to build on skills they've been honing in traditional music and contemporary song writing. Thanks to a generous foundation grant, we already have the funding necessary for this year's musicians' salaries and additional instruments. We are confident the students will grow and improve musically with this year's instruction.\n",
      "Our second goal is to build on last year’s success and this year's project by improving the quality of our product and the experience for the children engaged. We’d like to get the children more involved this year in the creation of the DVD, from the graphic design of the packaging to the scripting and editing of the product so that they have a greater engagement with and ownership of the project.\n",
      "We are asking for backers to invest in the equipment and mentorship/training for the DVD production. Your contributions will enable us to purchase computer, camera, and audio equipment that will become a part of the LAMO-Siddhartha School Sound Studio, so that it can be utilized by artists and young people from the greater Leh area and inspire other schools to work with LAMO on similar projects. We estimate the costs for these basic tools to total $7,225 with a negotiated education discount. The remaining funds ($475 approximately) will supplement our workshop budget for media professionals to mentor our students on the recording equipment, video editing software, and graphic design applications necessary for producing their DVD.\n",
      "Music Matters:\n",
      "Together we can kickstart a rich music and media experience for the young people of Siddhartha School and generations of youth from the area in the coming years. And as the students work with LAMO and local artists, they are challenged to create a product for you of increased professional quality. This builds confidence and pride, instilling a message that they can create work valued by an international audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impacts of this investment will be far reaching. By serving as a community resource for local musicians as well as those with an interest, the sound studio will enable countless performances so that everyone in the community can share in the music.\n",
      "Thank you for thinking of us and Jullay!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We learned last year that it is essential to improve the sound and video quality of the children's product by improving the studio equipment and enhancing the media side of the experience. We experienced delays last year due to the instability of Ladakh's internet connection, a common enough occurrence exacerbated by the flooding in Jammu and Kashmir over the fall. \n",
      "\n",
      "While there is little that we can do to mitigate such delays do to power outages and system shut downs, we can focus our efforts during those times on maximizing the training experience for the children interested in learning more about the recording, design, and production of the DVDs. Last year's supporters were very understanding that we took longer than we anticipated to complete and ship their DVDs, and every backer we spoke with said it was worth the wait.\n",

There's a little more pop influence in the album overall, compared to our last release, but don't worry... there's still rock in there!

      "More than 18 years ago I started on my culinary journey.  My mission was to gain a diverse experience working in some of the best restaurants.  During my journey, I ventured to Maui, where I learned local dishes and preparations.   During my time on the island I worked along side Chef Raul Bermudez, a very well known and talented chef where I learned dishes from his family and it thought me how important family meals are with love ones... It was around that time that I embraced the name and the creation of Viola and Agnes' Cafe evolved.   \n",
      "The dream I had on the islands has come true for me and my family in a way I could have never imagined! Here is Nassau Bay Texas for the last 3 and a half years the crew and I have worked so hard to be a great neighborhood cafe for our surrounding community and we are asking for a bit of help to keep the dream going!  \n",
      "I received information about a potential space available just around the way from us so that we can keep the business right here in Nassau Bay where we feel it should be. I gathered my savings and investments, and I applied for a small SBA loan to cover the cost of unlocking the doors.  Although excited, reality kicked in very fast. Nothing in the building was reusable.  The space needed a total and complete makeover, all the old equipment and furnishings had to be removed– literally EVERYTHING!\n",
      "Accordingly, I have to start from scratch.  The overwhelming number of changes and upgrades quickly blurred my vision of the beautiful family-owned restaurant that I always dreamed of; which is why I am reaching out to you on Kickstarter asking for your support. With your support and donations, Kickstarter will be used to purchase necessary kitchen equipment and will help “bring life” to the dining space by adding art, tiles and good ole southern charm to the space.  Many prayers have made my dream a reality by bringing my exciting new restaurant to Nassau Bay  But, it takes a community to raise a restaurant, which is why I need your help in order to bring the best new restaurant to Nassau Bay Tx.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "My name is Evan Vang.  I am the oldest brother of 10 Children.  I have 3 sisters and 6 brothers.  I am a father of 3 girls and soon to be husband of the beautiful and incredible lady Nicci Maggard. \n",
      "  My father and family are Hmong refugees from Laos following the Vietnam war.  They arrived in the United States in the late 70's shortly after the story of our family would begin. My father met my mother in late 1979 early 1980 and I was born August of 1980. We are the Vang's as I know them. Our mother God bless her and everything she did for us in the beginning but had her hands too full. Clinically she was with bi-polar disorder and mild schizophrenia.  She did the best she could but in the end our father was the only parent to raise all these kids for years. As children in this home we did not have a lot but found comfort in certain foods my father would prepare.  \n",
      "  On the weekends my father and mother would either take us to the Farm Fresh Grocery to pick out or just show up with donuts. These weekend breakfast moments were priceless for us kids.  Sometimes my father would really make us happy and prepare sticky rice and his famous rice wrapper fried spring rolls.  We didn't have a lot of money growing up so whenever he had the extra money and time away from work he would make these incredible treats in a large pile.  Soon our neighborhood friends and their parents would find out about these Hmong rolls with sides of sticky rice and they would remain legendary to them until this day. \n",
      "So what is Kung Food Kitchen Experiment. The name comes from my father's love of old Kung Fu movies and my love of cooking. In Kung Fu and in cooking there are many different styles and techniques that can used alone or combined to create something extraordinary.  The Vang Roll is my interpretation of my father's rolls and is named to pay homage to my family.   A Vang roll on the outside can be seen as a spring roll or lumpia but the insides are what make them different.  They are filled with fresh ground pork, rice noodles, carrots, cabbage, green onion, yellow onion, celery, Sriracha, black pepper, garlic powder, and soy sauce.  \n",
      "The goal of Kung Food Kitchen Experiment is to make simple and incredible comfort foods from all over.  To experiment with cross culture fusions, new dishes all together, or  a traditional take on a dish that we hope to make more popular like Congee.  The culture I would like to have in our business is a creative food culture where cooks young and old can try new ideas.  Whether we fail or succeed on a recipe we are moving in a forward direction. The dynamic of the business will not be a full service restaurant but more fast casual with area to eat and gather.  I want to be part of the change in kitchen culture and compensation as Danny Meyer sees it.  I want to build my team up with ongoing education and make sure there is a next step for them whether with our company or their own leap of faith. We want to support them wholeheartedly. The Big Vision/Dream is that Kung Food Kitchen Experiment expands to multiple locations in different states and becomes the creative arm to other concepts on the horizon.  \n",
      "So how did I get here.  Originally I had started this idea about 9 years ago.  I was rolling upwards of 600-900 Vang rolls a week.  I was overwhelmed with it back then and the focus was not there to continue with a new job I had started. For 7 months I rolled upwards of 700 a week until I eventually put the idea to rest. This past summer my beautiful and amazing Nicci was concerned I would be out of work due to rain.  I work at an outside bar The Shack that is incredibly busy all of the time unless it rains. She was convinced from the forecast it was going to rain for 15 days straight. So I tried looking for a second job but I also thought I would try and bring Kung Food Kitchen back to life. Within a few days I had 1600 rolls worth of orders for friends and family.  Fast forward to today I am working out of a catering kitchen and we are just over 30k Vang rolls eaten.  The number of dumplings and chili beef wontons are somewhere around 5-6 thousand but I have lost count.  A friend of mine asked me to think about doing a Pop-Up from her Beer bar.  I had never done a Pop-up before but figured why not.  I love cooking for friends and family this would give me an outlet to do this on a much larger scale than my home. The Pop-up would also give me the opportunity to cook  recipes new and old rather than just the rolls, dumplings, and wontons.  With the most incredible load of stress and anxiety in the lead up to and the beginning of the Pop-up it was a complete success.  We had over 150 people show up between 12pm and 8pm that day. We sold out. We have now done 2 more Pop-ups since and have 3 more on the books and more to follow. \n",
      "What originally came from necessity and concern over supporting my family has taken on its own life. From post after post the web of people that enjoy our food and rolls has continued to grow.  Eventually my brother would take some of my rolls to Buxton, NC about a 3 hour drive from Virginia Beach.  He brought them to a local bar and had given them away.  Shortly afterwards I would be bringing my products in mass to the awesome people of Buxton, NC.   I love to cook for people and this also is a largest part of the experiment.  For years I loved to invite friends and family over and enjoy great food and drinks. These days when we would get together we would always try different dishes. I was always curious to attempt new recipes or putting spins on old ones.  For the past 9 years this has been essentially a bi-weekly thing. Bringing friends and family together over a meal and drinks is always a positive situation.  The great thing about the Pop-up is that I am able to bring a larger group of people together from all walks of life.  A true melting pot of good people, foodies, friends, and family. We will always have that common thing we all share no matter and that is the love of great food and the sense of belonging. That is the environment I will create in Kung Food Kitchen Experiment.  \n",
      "Why the Kickstarter? I have reached a point where I need to purchase the kitchen I have been working out of and it will be shutting down within a month or two.  Where the Pop-ups have been busy and profitable I haven't been able to raise the capital necessary for purchase of catering company and support my family at the same time.  I am at a wall at this point where until I own the business and have a full time lease I am limited on how I can generate revenue. Once I break through this wall I know the possibilities are endless.  After all this time I know now my purpose and what I am meant to do.  \n",
      " My name is Evan Vang.  I love to cook for people. I am a Father, a Son, a Brother, a Friend, a Nephew, an Uncle, a soon to be Husband to the Incredible and Beautiful Nicci Maggard:) \n",
      "I am the Founder of Kung Food Kitchen and hope to grow this concept as far as it allows me to.  I look forward to being a Great Leader in my company and building up the great people that help me to expand Kung Food Kitchen.  Thank you everyone in advance for your pledges and support. Thank you for helping this story continue.  I look forward to seeing you in Kung Food Kitchen when we open here in Virginia Beach or in your town someday in the near future. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The ultimate Risk at this point is losing momentum.  I have to secure my location or I will be without a kitchen to work from.  The reason for the amount needed is minimum necessary to secure location, renovate, have working capital, and purchase needed extra equipment.  The goal of the kickstarter is a large pre-sale of goods to make this dream come true. Thank you again everyone for shares and comments.\n",

From there the three decide to invade his home in the woods and attempt to rob him. From there, they find themselves stuck in a terrible situation that pushes their loyalty and their own morality.\n",

      " \n",
      " \n",
      "THE REASON we are so gung-ho on making this film the right way? Well, we all believe the story is deserving of it being in the right locations, the right lighting, the right camera movement, the dramatic pacing, and the right actors to make it work. The Characters are so unique, but are they any more unique than any others out there hoping for the money to complete their project? Maybe, maybe not, but we do know that we have a fantastic team of people that are all deserving to see this put together properly and watch audiences like YOU enjoy them as much as we do!\n",
      "WE ARE a group of independent filmmakers that are incredibly passionate about intriguing films with great story-telling and we all have a vision for this film to appeal to both niche cinephiles as well as the casual viewer that is in need of a good visceral, emotional whirlwind of a ride!\n",
      "DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n",
      "WHERE SLEEPING DOGS LIE is the journey of one long terribly tragic night. I believe these characters all have a specific reason for being part of this story, each one drives the nail in the coffin (so to speak) individually, not ever realizing how one single action is causing an adverse reaction.\n",
      "I’m a big fan of films such as Rear Window, No Country For Old Men, Blue Ruin, and The Game. There is an emotional piece to these films that we as a viewer are completely able to see ourselves as one or many parts of each of these characters, which helps us to relate to the tragedy that befalls them. We are given a journey of puzzle pieces to put together, never knowing where the next clue will drop, or if it ever will.\n",
      "This story is truly about the emotional toll that a family member has on his brother that has the ability to rip every ounce of trust and love you had for that person, completely away. It is a tense situation, a test in loyalty, brotherhood and how to keep the puzzle pieces moving forward as the rest fall off around you and don’t quite fit together.\n",
      "MY GOAL is for every viewer to be so entranced in these characters that their palms are sweaty, and they're literally sitting on the edge of their seats with a nervous excitement of “what will happen next” mentality.\n",
      "OUR TEAM AND OUR LOVE AND VISION for this project will drive us to make it the best possible film, but with YOUR HELP, we can ALL, TOGETHER make this film something that you can tell people for years to come you had a hand in and be forever engrained the history of this film.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",

We have everything ready to roll on this and as we continue to progress through the remaining one month of pre-production, and into principal photography, we will ensure we are very vocal and communicate to all of our backers 110%!!\n",

Our blend of traditional and contemporary music, passionate and lively performances with dynamic vocals and instrumentals has changed many people's view of traditional Welsh music. The group presents a vibrant spirit with its roots in the language and living tradition of Welsh song and dance music. We've previously recorded 3 CDs with Welsh language record label Sain, but now we feel its time to have complete control over our recording, its creation and promotion. \n",
      "It's nearly 20 years since we recorded our first album Ysbryd y Werin and it's 11 years since our third CD Profiad, where has the time gone! We are now in a position to record and start touring more regularly again, maybe even another tour of the US and Canada. \n",
      "In 2013 we were able to make a 3 track EP, 'Y Cadno', but now we're keen and excited to make a full new album of Welsh traditional songs and tunes, as only Carreg Lafar can.\"Carreg Lafar treat Welsh traditional material with a freshness and a skill that deserves to be heard far and wide.\" fROOTS \n",
      "We would love you to be part of our new album, to help us raise the funds to record a whole new batch of great songs and tunes at a wonderful studio in Abergavenny, Stiwdio Felin Fach. The new album will have all the things people love about Carreg Lafar, \"a dense flurry of vocals, fiddle, pibgorn, flute and guitar\" But now we have a maturity that comes from many years of experience, profiad yw mam doethineb! experience is the mother of wisdom! Our new album will have all the drive and passion of our previous CDs but also encapsulate the lessons and wisdom gained form the last 20 years.\n",
      "To celebrate our 20th anniversary in 2015, we want to make this the best Carreg Lafar album yet, even better than Profiad, \"This is the most impressive album yet from Welsh band Carreg Lafar.....excellent arrangements make this stand out as one of the finest albums of Welsh music I have heard\" - Living Tradition. Welsh language songs, stunning vocals, harmonies, driving tunes and soulful airs will all be included, some songs and tunes that we've been playing around with for many years and some that we've just discovered.\n",
      "We already have some funds but not enough to hire the studio, record, mix, mastering, design work, new photographs and distribution. Please help to realise our dream, you can make a range of donations and everyone will receive a reward for your support and generosity of spirit.\n",

      "My name is Rita Leydon and I want to invite you to share in a dream.\n",
      "I’m a filmmaker and for the last dozen or so years I’ve been documenting a variety of Swedish folk musicians, concentrating mostly on mature masters of the nyckelharpa and the fiddle in order to ensure that their repertoire and style of playing is safeguarded for future study. My desire is that students as well as lovers of Swedish folk music the world over will have access to authentic source material.\n",
      "This filmmaking effort is an exploration into the loam that holds my roots. This is the music I love, the music that speaks to my soul.\n",
      "So far, I’ve produced nine documentaries which have cost me many thousands of dollars from which I have no expectation of financially recovering. Because my husband and I are now retired and no longer have as much disposable income as we once did, I fear that my strong desire and motivation to continue this important project is financially threatened.\n",
      "Trusting that the grass roots magic of a KickStarter campaign might be a solution to the challenge I now face, I’m forging right ahead and planning a filming trip to Sweden from mid May to mid June this year. I have four fabulous musicians on board willing to subject themselves to a day of my ungainly intrusion: Thore Härdelin, fiddler from Hälsingland;Peter Puma Hedlund, nyckelharpa, tunes from Uppland and Hälsingland;Christer Wesström also from Uppland, who plays the older silverbasharpa; Pelle Björnlert, a fiddler, who plays tunes from Småland and Östergötland\n",
      "My husband likens what I’m doing to the work of Alan Lomax, the great American field collector of folk music. Perhaps, to a small degree.\n",
      "My appeal is for your participation in this dream by taking ownership with me and thus enabling me to continue to expand our archive of Swedish Folk Music Treasures.\n",
      "Keep in mind that there is no expectation of financial gain. This is strictly a labor of love.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "It started when Mary McGeown owner of ‘57arts’, a creative workspace in SE13 approached our stall at Brockley Market and asked if we'd like to take over her space for one month. The thought of getting involved in something with the community that we’d come to love, made it an easy decision to make. We went about creating a vibrant foodie environment offering a creative tapas and natural wine menu alongside a deli and ingredients section, where customers could sample and learn about the ingredients they were enjoying so much. L’Oculto was much loved by the locals and in December 2015 went permanent.\n",
      "L’Oculto is considered by the locals as a true neighbourhood restaurant, a local gem and we consider all of our customers to be part of our extended family. With the help of this Kickstarter campaign, we want to not only continue to provide them with the kind of dining experience they truly deserve but also expand our offering by running regular cookery classes, tastings and events where we'll be inviting chefs and artisan producers over from Spain to share their knowledge with you. For all of this we need a bigger space.\n",
      "“Best eating in venue in london\n",
      "- One of the best restaurants going in London with excellent organic foods and wine lists from small family estates throughout the spainish region and which is exquisite, delightful and can not wait for the new restaurant to open in brockley....well done….” Luigi\n",
      "“Fabulous in every way - “It is always such a fabulous treat to return to the warm welcome at l’oculto and we’ve been delighted to bring friends and family and now our newborn son. Everything is of the highest possible quality. The food is unparalleled in its flavour, originality and quality, the service and wine never disappoint. We can’t wait for the new venue to open too. Can’t recommend highly enough. Thank you and keep on doing what you’re doing!” Msejs\n",
      "“An absolute gem! - “We ate here last night, the food is spot on, a small, seasonal menu sourced from producers the owners know personally and all of the highest quality, the service is spot on and you truly feel like you are in a restaurant in Spain not Lewisham! A real find and an absolute gem. If you can, GO! “ John\n",
      "“Spain Comes to the Streets of Brockley -\n",
      "“L'Oculto is, for my money, the best restaurant in the greater Brockley area. This is made more miraculous by the fact that it doesn't really have a kitchen, and that the team behind the counter is turning out superb tapas on a hotplate and little else. They rely on the best Spanish ingredients to make it authentic and delicious, and they deliver consistently great stuff.” Marshall\n",
      "L’Oculto holds a Certificate of Excellence for consistently earning great reviews.\n",
      "We have secured the lease on our second site and some of the works are already underway. We have big plans for this space and we’re super excited about them, plans that we know our customers are going to love and the neighbourhood is going to benefit from as there is nothing similar in the area for our local residents to enjoy and be part of.\n",
      "- We are totally stripping out the interior of our new space including gutting, extending and rebuilding the kitchen with brand new equipment - you have no idea how much this means to us after working for three years in a kitchen space smaller than anyone can imagine and working off nothing more than an induction and an oven. The re-build will enable us to breath firstly but most importantly the space and new equipment means we’ll be able to experiment more with ingredients and new dishes and ultimately creating exciting new menus for our customers. \n",
      "- Not only are we creating a whole new kitchen area but we’re taking down a wall and opening up the kitchen - this will enable us to not only create a connection between the chefs, the food and the customers but make cookery classes much more interactive. \n",
      "- We want to transform the neglected back yard into a space that can be enjoyed by everyone, with an ‘edible garden' growing plants and herbs for use in the kitchen and within our cookery classes. This means a costly rubbish clearance and garden design that makes the area fit for purpose.\n",
      "- Everyone that knows us knows how much this new venture means to us and how hard we’ve worked to get to this stage. This is not a flashy refurb, that's just not us, its simply a matter of creating something special that we can share with the community, a place with heart, a place for everyone to enjoy and be a part of. \n",

      "The Peasant Sabbatical:\n",
      "The title says it all!  I have spent most of my adult life traveling, studying, performing, and living the music in unlikely places at unlikely times. In the past I have had some financial support in the form of grants (studying with the Gypsies of Spain in Andalusia, or after the tragic war in the Balkans), but most times it has been without funding, often producing non-commercial music, on an absolute shoestring budget.  \n",
      "The \"Peasant Sabbatical\" is a CD is where acoustic 12-string guitar meets world music, with some help from other talented musicians, particularly on violin and acoustic bass.  I also add instruments such as tamburitza, brac, prim, mando-cello, button accordion, and tambura. It is a project very dear to me, and perhaps my best work so far. This is the first project where I took great care to create a musical score for each song prior to recording.  If the project is successful, I plan to offer a corresponding musical songbook as well.\n",
      "This will be my sixth CD project, and I have a history of producing quality recordings.   My prior CDs have also been critically acclaimed.   For example, \"American Gypsy\" was clearly a groundbreaking CD that was nominated \"Album of the Year\" at the \"American Independent Music Awards\".   Notably, this was a totally instrumental CD competing against all musical categories.  However, being solely an independent artist, the process of producing the CD left me without the necessary resources to adequately promote the final product.  \n",
      "My last project, \"12-string Guitar\", a very ambitious exclusively solo 12-string guitar CD, was nominated \"Solo Guitar Album of the Year\" at the JPF Music Awards in Nashville.  However, due to financial restrictions, I was again unable to promote the project in any meaningful way.\n",
      "All my CD projects are unique and varied in their musical approach.  For example, \"World Blue\" is an ambient - yet melodic, pensive   \"new age style\" CD, that many people consider my best work so far.   \"Cold Fish\" is a live performance CD inspired by great jazz-fusion artists such as Pat Metheny, Spyro Gyra and Weather Report. \n",
      "I am a composer and performer, not a salesman, and I have no clever video to entice you. My music does not fit neatly into any particular genre, so I am aware that one must truly enjoy music for music's sake to have an interest.  That being said, I would sincerely appreciate your support, and have tried to create pledge contribution packages that reward your contribution.\n",
      "I might add, that this project is already nearing completion, that the music is already scored, arranged, and recorded, and that your contribution will be used for the critical final steps that include: artwork, mastering, production, and promotion of the CD. \n",
      "I would be delighted and honored by your support, and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "One of the most exciting parts about becoming involved in this project is that it is essentially nearing completion, with final funding being the main obstacle. This will be my sixth CD project, and I have a history of producing quality CDs.  I am aware of many of the pitfalls in producing a project, and I am confident that the difficult and most time consuming aspects of the project have already been completed.  In many cases, the performing artist underestimates the time and cost associated with the arranging and recording, as well as the tediousness of the editing process.  Thankfully, “The Peasant Sabbatical” has moved into the final phases of completion. The artwork development is underway, and the mastering session has been scheduled.  Plans for promotion are underway.\n",

We all shared a love of Jamaican music, and began practicing to forge a sound inspired by all the classic Ska, Rocksteady, and Reggae artists we admire. Shortly thereafter, a band name was chosen that was in part a tribute to our ska heroes The Skatalites: The Georgetown Orbits.\n",

      "The songs have been written and recorded for our 3rd full-length studio album. However, we still need the funds to get these recordings mastered and pressed. To all that contributed to our last Kickstarter campaign for 'Super Sonic' we give a heartfelt thank you. That album was a success thanks to your support. To everyone new to our sound, we bid you welcome, and hope to get a chance to meet you at one of our shows in the coming year. \n",

      "My name is Mia. I'm a small illustrator from Hanover in Germany. This is my fifth Kickstarter campaign. While I started making enamel pins back in 2018 I decided that for my first project in 2022 I wanted to get back at a project I started in the beginning of my art career.\n",
      "In 2019 I created my second kickstarter and it featured 7 pride flag enamel pins. Over the 2 years people have asked me to make more of the pride flags into pins and as someone LGBTQIA+ myself without a pin made that would fit me I decided to dive right into it.\n",
      "If this is your first Kickstarter project check out the \"How Does This Work?\" chapter down below.\n",
      "Update: Although the stretchgoals on Kickstarter have not been reached, I decided to make every pin available as of january 27th. The reason for that is that during Pride Potions 2.0 I have had significantly more orders with Pride Potions on Etsy than before. I thought there might me a connection between both and it would just be fair to make more pins available. 😊\n",
      "Every pin is now available through Kickstarter. The 7 new designs and the 7 original designs.\n",
      "You can check out my former Pride Potion Projects here. \n",
      "All pins will be hard enamel with a smooth surface and a precious look. They all come with two needles on the back and two metal pin backs for a secure fit. All pins will also have the Miamouz logo on the back and a backing card made out of printed recycled paper.\n",
      "I tried to create Kickstarter tiers as uncomplicated as possible so there is only a 1 item tiers and special offers for bigger preorders.\n",
      "If you want to purchase more than 1 pin but less than 6, you can use the add-on option. For prices please check the graphic below.\n",
      " All special offers will be Kickstarter exclusive.\n",
      "With this Kickstarter you'll also have the chance to get one of the original Pride Potions created back in 2019. All original Pride Potions will count towards the new goals and stretchgoals so if you want to get your hands on a lovely lesbian potion and help this project out there's a way to do so.\n",
      "You can add all new and original Pride Potions to your pledge by either getting a discounted Kickstarter Tier or by adding add-on extra pins. Check out my Etsy for more pictures of those potions.\n",
      "If you have any question feel free to message me or to use the FAQ feature.\n",
      "The initial goal for the Kickstarter campaign will be 600€ (approx. $680) which will be enough to get one pin in production and cover the costs for reorders of the original pride flag pins so I can offer those for Kickstarter backers as well.\n",
      "In total there'll be 6 different hard enamel pins. They will be available through stretchgoals (see stretchgoal text above for prices).\n",
      "If the campaign is fully funded you'll be able to choose your rewards from all unlocked designs. If it isn't successfull you won't get charged at all.\n",
      "You can become a backer throughout the whole time this campaign runs and won't pay anything until the initial goal is funded and the campaign ends. You are also able to change your backer tier and extras with just some clicks while the project is still up for funding.\n",
      "After the project is funded, Kickstarter will gather all the funds and forward them to me so I can get all the new pins into production. Following this there'll be a Kickstarter survey for every supporter so you can choose which products from the unlocked designs you want to receive. You'll also be able to provide your shipping address in said survey.\n",
      "All items will be ready latest in march I guess but I try my best to get them ready for shipping as soon as possible.\n",
      "I ship all my items in sturdy boxes made out of recycled cardboard. I like to use environmental friendly packaging such as paper tape, cute paper bags and tissue paper as packing material.\n",
      "All international orders are sent with tracked shipping. Orders within germany are sent without tracking but if you insist on tracking you can still raise your pledge for that. Simply check out the add-on graphic above.\n",
      "There might be additional costs such as taxes for which I'm not responsible if you're from outside the EU.\n",
      "There will probably be a delay in shipping internationally due to Covid-19. While my Etsy orders took approximately 2 weeks to arrive in 2019 orders now take up to 3 months.\n",
      "To help funding my project firstly I really appreciate every active backer. Even if the stretchgoals are not unlocked yet everyone who backs for a certain amount of tapes/pins increases the odds of unlocking said items. As you won't get charged until the end of the project you can still reduce your pledge before the campaign is over if your desired washi or pin hasn't been unlocked by then.\n",
      "It would also be awesome if you could spread the word about my project. Sharing nowadays can be a huge support because every share might reach someone who someday decides to preorder my tapes. I'm very happy about every share on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and so on. Links to my social media are at the bottom of the page.\n",
      "I have already created more than 80 enamel pins, 7 washi tapes and several other stationary items so far so I have some experience with manufacturing them. I have also shipped over 2000 pins for my last Kickstarter projects (plus ~5000 for etsy and patreon) and I definitely have some experience with shipping.\n",

Also there might be a delay in shipping due to the possible high amount of preorders or Covid-19. Another reason for a delay could also be a manufacturing mistake which doesn't happen a lot but could occur.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "When I was growing up, I dreamed of owning my own restaurant. Living in Ethiopia and Paris instilled a love for both of these cuisines. Each one so rich in history, and so similar in so many ways. When I had my daughter, Anais, I knew that I needed to take a risk to secure her future. I decided to finally take the plunge.\n",
      "DC is a becoming a melting pot for cultures from all around the world. Which is why I found it so puzzling that no one had a restaurant that infuses cuisine from the birthplace of coffee with the feel of a Parisian cafe. The more I thought about it, the more I wondered - how come no one had thought to marry buttery croissants with dark and dreamy buna (Ethiopian for coffee). Why hadn't anyone given the choice between fluffy injera with shiro or sweet and savory crepes? The idea seemed so simple to me, and the more I questioned why no one had thought to open a space featuring these cuisines, the more I realized - I am that somebody! That is how the Addis-Paris Cafe was born.\n",
      "Even the most powerful chefs and restaurant owners will tell you that owning your own restaurant is the hardest business in the world. They are not lying. The feedback I got when I opened the space was overwhelmingly positive. That's the first step - and I nailed that out the gate! My customers loved the food. They loved my innovative twists on Ethiopian classics, like turning the classic tomato salad up a notch with a healthy dose of avocado. They loved having a quick bite of crepe with a sip of a creamy latte. They loved having a space in the Mount Pleasant area where they could come and enjoy music, take in art, and still enjoy a delicious meal with family and friends. However, their praise could only sustain my business for so long.\n",
      "An influx in customers meant a higher demand in the kitchen. Waiting tables and cooking all by myself became nearly impossible. But how could I pay someone when I was still getting my feet grounded in the space? \n",
      "An influx in customers also meant that my makeshift kitchen wasn't going to work forever. I can't crank out food at the volume I need without having the proper tools - that's like asking a plumber to fix a sink without a wrench!\n",
      "I knew that in order to keep the Addis-Paris Cafe alive, I would need to think of something and think of something fast. That’s where you come in.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The biggest challenge that I face is an immediate influx of customers without finishing my campaign. As I state in my video, I am currently trying to manage my growing business by myself. If my campaign is a success, and we grow instantly, it's possible that for the interim until my campaign completes I will be challenged with an even bigger customer base. However, if that is the case, I have selected individuals who can help me at the restaurant until the campaign is complete.\n",

      "So we're making you Koselig - a Norwegian-style Christmas magazine. \n",
      "Since the late 1800s, Norwegian publishers, organisations and charities have published julehefter –Christmas magazines. Some are special editions of famous cartoons; others are beautiful literary magazines with removable art prints. The latter is what we want to give you.\n",
      "Koselig will be a little break in the busy time before and around Christmas. A beautiful magazine made for those moments when you just want to wrap yourself in a blanket, put your feet up and relax.\n",
      "The magazine is designed to share with you a touch of that old-fashioned, postcard-y Christmas feeling we get when we celebrate in Norway.\n",
      "Updated 28/10/2021\n",
      "With 3 days left of the campaign, we’re 153% funded and we've reached our first stretch goal! Thank you all for your pledges and support – we're so excited to see this magazine come to life. \n",
      " Our next stretch goal is a reach with 3 days to go, but here it is!\n",
      "We are Amelia and Nica, a Norwegian/British couple living in Weston-super-Mare on the west coast of England. Amelia is Norwegian, and has grown up reading julehefter – Christmas magazines – all her life. As she grew older, literary Christmas magazines, filled with stories, artwork and articles, became one of her favourite Christmas traditions.\n",
      "Nica is British. She fell in love with the concept of koselig while falling in love with Amelia. When visiting Amelia’s family farm in Norway, she couldn’t get over the cosiness of being surrounded by handmade quilts, candles, cinnabuns and knitted jumpers, and never being more than a stone’s throw away from nature and hiking trails.\n",
      "It was Amelia’s mum who gave us the idea for Koselig.art – our website – and this Christmas magazine. She is a big knitter, quilter and koselig facilitator, and she acquires a stack of Christmas magazines every year.\n",
      "“Maybe you should make one in English,” she said one year.\n",
      "“Maybe,” said Amelia, too busy stuffing her face with cinnabuns to notice the idea that instantly set root in her brain.\n",
      "Since then, we’ve written, published, designed, consulted on, edited, translated and produced a number of books and art projects through Amelia’s company, Thought Library Media.\n",
      "We’ve even run a successful Kickstarter campaign before, back when we were Ink & Locket Press. We learned so much from that adventure, and we’re excited to put that knowledge to use.\n",
      "It took a few years for the idea of the Christmas magazine to spring into life, but this year we’re ready: we’ve launched Koselig.art and we’re ready to share our super koselig Christmas magazine with the world, to give you – our English-speaking friends – the art of koselig living.\n",
      "Koselig is a true labour of love, and we’ve worked hard to make it look beautiful. The magazine will be filled to the brim with hand-painted illustrations, beautiful page frames, full-page artwork and moving stories.\n",

      "Socrates will offer specialty gourmet coffee and middle-eastern pies(Cheese, Zaatar etc...) to consumers in West Dearborn, MI. We are more than just your average run-of-the-mill coffee shop and offer more than just coffee. Socrates provides an environment for the growing vibrant and innovative scene in West Dearborn. We also offer a unique atmosphere through our contemporary and industrial design, alongside with a special Italian brewed coffee named Illy. https://www.illy.com/en-us/company\n",
      "By inviting local bands, singers, public figures, professionals and college students, we will establish ourselves as a hub for Detroit’s best destinations to visit. Nightscape will be focused on a diverse group aged consumers, for a chill and relaxed atmosphere. The purpose of this plan is to raise $200,000 to set up our shop and begin our marketing campaign using all available resources and focusing on social media.\n",
      "Socrates will offer three products: coffee beverages, coffee products, and middle-eastern breakfast style. Coffee beverages will be our main seller and sold by the cup in three sizes. All our beverages will be made from organic fair trade coffee beans supplied by Illy, an Italian coffee roasting company that specializes in the production of espresso, and sourced worldwide. It will be distributed by a local distributor named Cadillac Coffee. We will also offer coffee products such as grinders and French presses for those who want to match the quality of Socrates in their own home.\n",
      " Our target customers are students, music lovers, coffee-holics, young professionals and also general professionals around the area. Our longer hours of operation will allow us to widen our customer base within each segment. Our large part of our marketing strategy will be to have live music throughout the weekend or every other week, depending on client’s taste, to allow non-music individuals to be able to have a good time as well. Using the social media profiles of our guests will allow us to reach a wider audience and increase traffic into the shop. Joining the Dearborn Chamber and Arab-American Chamber of Commerce will also help in increasing traffic and be able to have access to a wide range of professionals and non-professional clients within the chamber by sending e-mail blast every week with promotions. Socrates will provide the most stimulating and unique coffee shop experience by providing a relaxed and harmonious space for excellent coffee to be consumed, and culture to be enjoyed. \n",
      " The population of Dearborn, MI is over 99,000. The surrounding cities include Dearborn Heights with a total population of 60,000 and Detroit city with over 700,000. We estimate that the total market of Dearborn that drinks coffee is 40,000. Of this 40,000 people, we believe that 3,800 people are within reach of Socrates. Within this group of 3,800 people, we estimate that 1,400 people drink coffee. Of this 1,400, half drink coffee every day and the other half drinks coffee three times a week. This represents 29,400 cups of coffee per month. (The above information is estimation) .\n",
      " Daily consumption of espresso-based beverages has nearly tripled since 2008, according to the latest data from the 2016 NCDT. Between 2008 and 2016, past-day consumption of gourmet coffee beverages soared from 13% to 36% among 18-24-year-old, and from 19% to 41% for those age 25-39. For espresso-based beverages alone, the jumps become 9% to 22% for the 18-24 age group and 8% to 29% for those aged 25-39. \n",
      " Socrates will market its line of specialty, gourmet coffee through social media, word of mouth marketing, mailbox flyers, and initial discount coupon offering. It will price its products comparably to its nearby competitors, while saving in labor and expenses in order to maintain profitability. Socrates intends to use the trending vibrant and positive energy scene around West Dearborn to attract its initial customer base and create the ultimate experience. These strategies combined will create a foundation of loyal customers from which Socrates can attain profitability and later expand. Our goal is to provide a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere for our customers. Socrates will be about more than just coffee, but will also strive to create a strong feeling of community.\n",
      " Every other weekend, Socrates will hold a live music night. This will be the company’s most effective method of promotion as West Dearborn has quite a vibrant young crowd. The bands and artists for each night will be promoted through social media, the company website, and flyers. Consumers throughout West Dearborn will come to see their friends and family play. By featuring hot new upcoming artists, we expect to also bring in new customers that otherwise wouldn’t visit our store. This increased traffic to Socrates will help to boost sales of our products. \n",
      "Strengths: By offering a wide selection of coffee products, Socrates can appeal to every type of coffee drinker. Provide an atmosphere drastically different from our competitors. Hold live music nights to attract new customers and establish Socrates as the hub for students, professionals and non-professionals.\n",
      "Weaknesses: There are already two competitors in our area which will make it difficult to take a sizable portion of the market share. Since we are a startup business we will have limited resources to compete with our competitors and expand our brand.\n",
      "Opportunities: The growing constructive sites in West Dearborn and the 60-million dollar investment by Ford is a market through which we expect of business can take advantage of. The project will result in the consolidation and relocation of up to 600 Ford Motor and Ford supplier employees and could create as many as 200 jobs. In addition, the project is expected to create approximately 50 permanent full-time non-Ford retail jobs at the site.\n",
      "Threats: The increasing price of coffee beans presents a threat to our business. Coffee bean prices have risen to a two year high. At this time, it is uncertain as to whether or not these price hikes will continue in the long term. We will lock the price with the local distributor for at least two years before seeing any changes.\n",

      "My Churro is an experience of delight and happiness. \n",
      "Select the presentation (Bites, stuffed or crunchy) and the sweet sauces you prefer.\n",
      "In a small trailer equipped and specialized in churros, we will be present at events and in a semi-trailer of similar presentation we will join shopping centers with the aim of reaching more places at a lower cost.\n",
      "We designed a differential product with the objective of operating in network and generating employment for entrepreneurial families and at the same time facilitating knowledge to be a better franchise business owner. \n",
      "Select (bites, stuffed or crunchy), you favorite flavor and enjoy.\n",
      "Three simple steps that allow you to enjoy a delicious snack.\n",
      "My Churro, is prepared in an artisan-made way. We have incorporated multiple flavors, achieving a perfect and crispy combination.\n",
      "All you need to do is simply select the desired flavor, enjoy and share.\n",
      " The churros are handmade and include natural ingredients (wheat flour, vegetable oil palm) to preserve their freshness and aromas. They are accompanied by sauces of different flavors. They look pretty simple, right?\n",
      "Well, that's what we wanted: make My Churro the easiest way to enjoy a crunchy churro and the perfect combination of flavors.\n",
      "It took more than 1 year and a half to develop the brand concept, the preparation recipes, the required equipment, select the flavors and achieve a product that simply delights.\n",
      "Finally, we managed to unify resources, products and people to serve churros of excellent flavor and presentation.\n",
      "Now we need to carry out marketing, install ourselves in a commercial place, acquire two additional semi-trailers, create an agenda of participation in events and give to taste the product. \n",
      "Crispy, delicious, something to look forward to. This is how we see a Churro, which goes back a long time, outside the school or church in different countries of the world in an informal market.\n",
      "I felt the need to share my passion for delight, and I gave other people a glimpse of the magic I see in a good snack. What was once a product in an informal market could now become an opportunity for entrepreneurial families who will also support good business owners through a franchise model.\n",
      "I had the opportunity to spend time outside of my country (Colombia) and eat different fresh snacks, and I noticed that many products that have been commercialized informally can take a higher quality to other countries and create jobs, delight and expand the offer of foods. Places where people from different cities can have the opportunity to taste whether they are locals or tourists. That is why we have done our best to combine the flavor and crispy in a snack.\n",
      "After 1 year and a half of working with our team and allied businessmen with experience in this project, we can say that we have almost everything ready to start producing My Churro in the right way. However, some of our manufacturing partners and trusted allies in China and the US They need a minimum financial commitment on our part to start an important production execution, so we can reduce costs and production times.\n",
      "That's why we have set our funding goal at $ 30,000 that will add to the $ 46,000 we have invested in a trailer, a semi-trailer, a vehicle, supplies and some equipment, which will give us a boost to our dream. By reaching this financing goal, we can produce our final product in larger quantities, make our first order with the quality we want, so that we can meet the demand of each possible franchise in a short time.\n",
      "That said, all those who help us in the development of My Churro will get the product firsthand and will be the first to receive exclusive and superior quality benefits in the future.\n",
      "I love being an entrepreneur, but I love serving people even more, especially if it's something I can enjoy! I'm obsessed with marketing, good experiences and happiness for consumers and the people who work behind each of my projects.\n",
      "I have been in the technology and marketing industry for more than 10 years, and my career has focused on favoring the commercial operations of other companies and helping them to market their products with meaning.\n",

      "Our Reason? \n",
      "We are all locals of Tameside and Stalybridge and often commented on what we believe is a large gap in the market allthough we want to create a space for everyone we recognise that currently there is little in the way of offerings for the younger demographic. We believe Stalybridge would benefit from a place catering to the new influx of residents who work in Manchester and surrounding areas that have chosen to make Stalybridge their home. We feel we can bring something different to the local community to create a buzz here in the town we call home and in doing so will help in bringing people to Stalybridge as well as offering something unique to those who already live here but perhaps don't frequent it's nightlife or eateries. \n",
      "Our Plan? We want to open a venue where our friends and customers can enjoy a feast of fresh and exciting food including our chefs wildly successful World Burgers and Raman dishes alongside a wide selection of beers, spirits and wines. We plan to source produce from local suppliers and ensure that products sourced from further afield are ethically sourced and adhere to fair trade agreements.

      "This project made its funding on December 4. It all happened suddenly toward the end, so there was not time to write about stretch goals. A \"stretch goal\" is a new or added goal, beyond the original goal, in the event the project exceeds its funding. In our case, we have a number of people lined up who are ready to pledge, so I want to emphasize that we can still take those additional pledges and that they will continue to advance our cause. Here, then, is our stretch goal.\n",
      "Funds beyond our target will go toward a commission. We will approach Johnny Simons with a proposal that he create a new original theatre work that will complement the archived works on our website. The idea is that he will write a piece -- perhaps to be premiered at the Hip Pocket Theatre in 2014 -- that will round out the works that we are digitizing from the early Simons and Balentine years. We will find a way to videotape the performance, using some of the digitizing/editing activities that will be underway at that time. This -- the newest in a long line of Simons originals -- will then cap the website archives, demonstrating the ongoing vitality and creativity of live original theatre in Fort Worth.\n",
      "We hope that we can raise enough in these final countdown hours to award this special commission to Johnny as a special thank you for his prolific output, and as a tribute to Douglas and their very special creative relationship. So please, keep those pledges coming!\n",
      "New pledges from this point may request that donor names be associated with this new commission, as well as with the website itself.\n",
      "At the end of this one-year project there will exist a website with 25-30 of Doug and Johnny's shows (video and audio), plus early home-made tapes, garage recordings, and the visual reference material that goes with them. An archive if you will, of the important collaboration between Johnny Simons and Douglas Balentine in those early years of the seventies and eighties at Fort Worth's Hip Pocket Theatre.\n",

      "digital form. I al­ready have more than 50 hours of material on my hard drives. Digitized music is in the form of 44.1 KHz stereo .wav files, and video is MPEG2. But it\n",
      "is very time-consuming, and I have a full-time job. I am increasingly worried\n",
      "that the material is vanishing faster than I can get to it.\n",
      "What’s\n",
      "needed is a professional who is paid to do the digitizing. This professional\n",
      "needs to have the following skills:\n",
      "We have located and lined up those professionals. But it costs money. The first phase of this project involves getting these fragile tapes digitized and secure.\n",
      "Phase I: There are three phases to our plan. The first is by far the most important: digitizing the analog tapes to stop their continued degradation. We have found several firms able to do this work both in San Antonio (where most of the tapes are) and in Fort Worth (where video cassettes are stored). My brother Jim is in San Antonio to supervise the tape work there, and—since the Hip Pocket Theatre is located in Fort Worth—that area holds many long-time aficionados who can help with labeling and indexing. During digitizing, the transfer specialists will set levels and ensure the best copy. They will also encounter old worn-out splices and broken tapes, requiring splicing and other repairs. In some cases they must “cook” the tapes (due to an unfortunate design flaw in a particular brand of Ampex recording tape popular at the time). We have the appropriate tape decks, cooking and splicing equipment and will provide them to the audio company. We will also work closely with them to assist in this digitizing phase.\n",
      "Here is a breakdown of the tape collection:\n",
      "That's 280 audio and 165 video tapes -- a total of 445 tapes representing some 720 hours of material. Many of the tapes will run easily at real-time (for example, it's been my experience doing this in my home studio that most of the cassettes have remained in good shape and experience no problems). Others -- the larger R2R tapes especially -- will exhibit a lot of damage. We'll go from easy to hard to make the early phase produce output quickly. Almost half of the budget is targeted at Phase I based on the expectation that we'll experience problems with about a third of the R2R tapes but little problem with the rest.\n",
      "Phase I digitizing will require six months.\n",
      "Phase II: Once we have the tapes in digital form, we can distribute the rest of the archiving effort thoughtfully across many people The second phase is for organizing, labeling, tagging, and preparing the material for uploading. Most of this work will be done by me at no cost, but some significant budget is set aside for data entry and cataloguing tasks that must be done by team members associated with the Hip Pocket Theatre. Peggy Bott Kirby is the main person assigned this task. We expect to receive offers of assistance by the many scores of Hip Pocket exes who have enjoyed this remarkable theatre for so many years to help with this effort instead of (or in addition) to their backing pledges, as described in the rewards. Phase II will require six months.\n",
      "Phase III: The third phase develops the website and populates it with these materials -- audio, video, and images. Much of the work can be done by website talent already working with the theatre -- for example Robert Bourdage -- who maintains the current hippocket.org website now. But we will need to bring in outside expertise for some of the details associated with content management and copyright protection issues. We have dedicated the rest of the budget to that technical assistance. Phase III will require four months.\n",
      "The phases overlap as shown in the figure above. Phase I will begin with the easy tapes. So we will have several shows ready after two months to begin the indexing and cataloguing effort. Phase I and Phase II then proceed in parallel for the majority of the project, which is scheduled to last exactly one year. By the seventh month, we will have a very large body of material ready, and can then begin the website itself. That development is expected to take four months, during which any difficulties with the digitizing and cataloguing of the \"problem\" tapes can be addressed. In this way, we'll meet our schedule even if an unexpectedly large number of tapes exhibit difficulties.\n",
      "There are more than 30 full-length musical-theatre productions that represent the Simons and Balentine early years. See the video for the top 14 (approximately 2:30 in the Kickstarter video above). When this project has ended, the website will contain as many of these 30 shows as we can locate and catalogue -- one page per show. Each page will hold the musical selections and any video footage that we have been able to recover, as well as photographs and images of scripts, programs and posters.\n",
      "Above is a wireframe showing one concept for the home page of the website. Design details will be worked out in the early phases with the finished wireframes presented to the web developer for rendering.\n",
      "The wireframe above shows one concept for user-selection -- in this case, material from the early years prior to the founding of Hip Pocket Theatre. Songs from the Christmas albums, \"The Lake Worth Monster\", and Casa Playhouse shows contain many of the concepts that seeded the theatre and its early burst of creative output.\n",
      "The wireframe above shows what one of the show pages might look like. In this case, we have a well-archived show called \"Elder Oaks.\" Along the right, the user can listen to and/or download each song from the show (in mp3 or wav format). In the gray boxes will be promotional materals, a synopsis of the play, and other visual (scanned) material. A scrapbook link and download buttons are placeholders for other materials, which may grow to include scrapbook photos, scripts, cast listings, and a video of the original show performance (if it exists).\n",
      "There will be some 25 or 30 of these pages, depending on how many shows have survived and what kind of condition the tapes are in. We cannot know for sure the exact page count until Phase I is complete.\n",
      "I have a detailed project plan showing budgets, timelines, and the technical inventory of all of the tapes. Get in touch with me if you want to see and review it, or if you want to contribute some of your time to assisting in its execution. - Bruce Balentine\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The first and most important part of this project is the digitizing, and there is ample money in the budget to accomplish this. There will be snags -- tapes will break, some material may be lost forever -- but getting it into digital form is the immediate goal. We have lined up several different recovery specialists, and failure by one will lead to hand-offs to another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The greatest risk is that we experience more problems than expected with the analog tapes. In severe cases, the plan is to try to locate alternative sources. There are thousands of ex-Hip Pocketeers scattered around the world, and one of them may have the cassette of a show that otherwise is taking too many hours to digitize. This Kickstarter project will have the added value of exposing our predicament to all of those performers, stage hands, audience members, and backers that will now have a central focus -- recovering this material -- and we may receive many tapes from people with whom we've long lost touch. In other cases, we'll have to settle for fragmentary pages -- for example a show that has no audio record other than the original piano rehearsal tape recorded by Doug in his home studio. Making these choices will be the dominant activity by those of us immediately responsible for this project, and, of course, we will keep every one of our backers notified as we discover the state and demands of a given show.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Loss of material by having to ship tapes is another obstacle, so we have selected local specialists for most of this work. We also will deliver the tapes (now secure in air-conditioned storage) in small lots to prevent unexpected loss due to theft, fire, incompetence, or other contingencies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After digitization, there are two major hurdles: first, the material must be annotated, labeled, and organized. Second, the website must be brought up. Much of the former is an act of love (read: no charge) by those who know this material well. But we must pay someone to organize and coordinate the tagging and final labeling, the metadata, cross-referencing, and the uploading. There is money in the budget to accomplish this if we're careful, but the contingency in the event that this task is underestimated is for each of us on this project to chip in the extra that will be required to get everything upload-ready. Luckily, once the material is digitized, this activity will be safer -- we'll be working from copies, and the digital version will not be degrading like the analog tapes are doing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The final part is the website, and this requires technical skills (i.e., a webmaster) who can develop an effective and accessible website using content-management software. The domain names are already purchased, but there will be server costs (this is a lot of audio and video) and development costs. All of this is budgeted, but unexpected setbacks could delay the work. In such a case, we plan to go to our backers and ask their indulgence as we bring up a subset of the website -- something that they can see and touch and hear -- while we complete the rest in phases.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "As you know, for 24 years, I've been sharing music with friends and family in the form of THREE CDs EVERY year.  These CDs include hand-picked music from around the world and often follow a theme, an idea, an artist, an era. The CDs are professionally replicated and include custom on-disc labeling and informative and entertaining disc inserts. Every year I spend months listening to music, making selections, arranging the selections, creating labels and inserts, negotiating with the replication vendor, assembling the jewel cases with inserts and gift wrapping each set. Then every set goes in a padded envelope, and I buy postage for each. Then, like musical magic, it arrives in your mailbox. \n",
      "This has been a tough year for me and I'd love your help in getting the music out the door for this, the 25th year. \n",
      "Components of my cost for the project include: purchasing music, buying blank CDRs to create multiple iterations of masters, purchasing the heavy paper insert stock, printing the inserts at STAPLES (the paper is too heavy for my desktop printer) , the replication (usually 70 sets (i.e., 210 CDs) by Cassette Works in Pasadena, CA), gift wrap, and postage. I send most of the 70 sets out by US Mail, domestic as well as overseas (to England, Hong Kong, So Africa, etc.) at an average cost of $2.40 postage per set).  Total cost of the project is usually between $800 and $1,000. \n",
      "If you've enjoyed the music, if you've been turned on to new artists and feel richer for it, please help share me the music. For some of you, you've been getting the music for 20+ years. Some of you have only been receiving the package for a few years.   If you can give $20, that would be great; if you can give more, even better. \n",

      "My name is Mari but everyone calls me \"Dee\". Why? I'm still not exactly sure. But I like it so it stuck. I've worked in the food business for 17 years and have been the proud owner of The Cake Countess and The Poisoned Apple for the last 7. The industry is fierce. The field is competitive. And there is absolutely no shortage of cake decorators/bakers/chefs...etc out there (honestly, everyone knows someone who knows someone who bakes these days). But I digress...\n",
      "Most days my feet hurt, my hands cramp and I have my first meal waaay past noon.\n",
      "Do I love it? \n",
      "Hell friggin’ yes I do.\n",
      "Am I insane for loving it? \n",
      "Debatable.\n",
      "But again, I digress….\n",
      "Growing up hugely misunderstood for my love of all things dark and weird, I know what it's like to be served a nice hot pile of censure. And that's why I do what I do. I like my work to appease the most discriminating of eyes (yes, we're looking at you grandmas), but to always remain true to form. “Those aren’t gemstones, they’re faces, those aren’t ribbons, that’s a strait jacket, that's not a tree, that's a spinal column”. I love wielding the superpower to make someone’s jaw drop with a show stopping centerpiece or to celebrate a first birthday with an eccentric cake that says “Hey kid, your parents are nuts and you might not fit in with the rest of the world, and that is absolutely perfect”.\n",
      "But mostly, I LOVE having the knack to make people feel comfortable, welcome, and if need be, cheered up with something as simple as a complex form of sugar. \"Feeling sick? Crappy day? Spouse left you?\" No worries, I can fix that right up be it through a slice of “Drunken Piano Pie”, a “Grave Dirt Cake Jar”, or a birthday cake that shrieks when you cut it. It’s my passion, and my curse.\n",
      "I could not possibly love a human baby more that I love food. (Just want to make sure I still have your attention).\n",
      "    Of course, I’m lying through my teeth as I have an 11 year old whom is the coolest person on the planet and whom I love to death. But back to the point, I love food. GOOD food. I will happily eat bread crusts all week if it means getting a meal that will knock my socks off on the weekend. The problem is most times, that’s usually not the case. Most times, I’m treated to overpriced disappointment. I don’t believe in an $8 slice of pie with a $2 side of whipped cream. I don’t believe that cake should be boring and bland for the sake of structure and appearance. Over the years, I’ve worked hard to perfect my craft. I still think of ways to improve on it today. My work is a reflection of years of trial and error, obsessively researching until my eyes practically fell out of my head, and enthusiastically figuring out ways to unearth awe and beauty in that which is \"unconventional\". \n",
      "After years of saving, I decided to take the calculated plunge of leasing a larger commercial space closer to my hometown of Los Angeles. On the downside, I am still in need of two key pieces of equipment. Slowly throughout the years I’ve acquired the basics (commercial mixers, fridges, freezer, and the like). Unfortunately I was never able to attain a commercial convection oven of my own and it goes without saying that ya can’t bake anything without one of these bad boys! \n",
      "Another much needed item is a dough sheeter. If I had a penny for every time someone said “can’t you just do it by hand?!” I would have a dough sheeter. Like, as of yesterday. The harsh reality is, baking is a blood sport. What popular Food TV shows neglect to mention is just how huge the toll on the body it is. You get scrapes, burns, cuts, puffy feet, and sleep deprivation. But all of that is a “piece of cake” (pun intended) compared to screaming joints after rolling out endless batches of dough, fondant, and cookies. And unlike those TV stars, this is a one woman show, at least for now anyway. A reliable oven and sheeter would hugely increase production levels and enable the reach of larger markets, making day-to-day tasks “easy as pie” (ok, I’ll stop). \n",
      "In a nutshell, having the much needed extra space and equipment would afford the opportunity to branch out in ways not feasible before as well as take on a higher volume of orders, thus growing this little beast of a business. Participating in farmer’s markets, offering classes, catering to a wider demographic, shipping our products nationally, and even a food truck is all part of the evil plan.

      "The process of opening a restaurant from scratch with a new concept requires finances, bold actions, confidence and experience. I love cooking, but just love will not make a restaurant's cash flow positive for long periods of time. My love of cooking is very important, but I believe that it is just a small part of a successful business.  This summer (2018) I started the process of building a restaurant in Fort Worth Texas. When I set out to hire a general contractor for the project I interviewed and got quotes from fifty different contractors. I needed to find the best deal. I had to be very resourceful in order to make everything happen to open this restaurant. After researching tediously I hired a general contractor. The space I'm currently leasing is never been utilized for a restaurant. I had to do everything such as new; plumbing, grease trap (on the sidewalk), air conditioning system, ventilation hood, electrical works, gas, walls etc. I have been at the construction site almost every day for past four months and counting. I planned to open my restaurant at the end of the August, unfortunately construction got delayed. We had issues installing a 2000 gallons grease trap at side walk. It required more permits, and we had to close the side walk for a month. At one point we had to close the whole street to connect the grease trap to city lines. The issue with a grease trap could have been avoided if the general contractor had checked the work of a plumber. At the end of the day I blame myself for not double checking both of their work. So here I am on Kickstarter asking for Your help. It is difficult for me to ask for something unless I have given you something of value.  I feel better being on other side, the helping side. I know that I will find a solution for my current obstacles. I am almost ready to open, and I have my team with me.  With your help we will bridge the gap between the start up costs, and the unexpected setbacks that delayed the opening date.  \n",

      "Hello all, welcome to my Kickstarter page and a glimpse into what I'm looking to do and why I want to do this. First, I would like to say that I'm the last person in the world to ask for help, but the first person to try and lend a hand when I can. Recently I was jammed up and facing a roadblock that I just could not get around. Luckily my husband knew that I needed help  and made a call.  Thankfully I was able to receive the professional counseling I needed to put things back in perspective, and gave me a new outlook on my future.  During that time I reflected back on my 25+ years in emergency services, my life, my friends and family, what is important to me and what makes me happy, and I made a decision; I need to redirect my focus in a new venture!\n",
      "The public safety field is unforgiving and unyielding.  I became an EMT when I was 22 years old, started dispatching shortly thereafter as well, and just 6 short years ago, at the age of 41 (what was I thinking) went out and became a firefighter.  I’ve seen a lot, I’ve done a lot, and I have heard a lot, most of which I don’t forget, and can’t forget.  No one in this field, and I know I’m talking to a lot of you who are reading this, know what I mean. I’ve decided it’s time to take my management background and life's expertise and find a new path, and I have that opportunity knocking! I just need a little help getting off the ground. \n",
      " \n",
      "So here's my redirect; recently a very close and dear friend of mine, after 16 long years of being a restaurateur has decided to throw in his bar towel. His establishment was the third longest running restaurant in our town, that is until Wednesday, September 12th with the beer almost gone, we had the last Wednesday Night Trivia at The Copper Stallion.  Owner, Terry Light has decided to turn the page in the book of his life and start a new chapter after his long career in the pub, just as I am, and he is looking for a buyer. I've known Terry and and his wife Joni for a number of years and we've grown to be good friends. I know the pub still means a lot to them and I am looking for backing to take over his proud establishment yet make it my own.  Remodel, re-branding, a new menu, and new exciting events to draw in a new crowd and bring back the loyal customer base that was already established at The Stallion.  Yes, I want to buy the bar!\n",
      " \n",
      "The Fiskdale Tavern will occupy the space on the second floor of 538 Main Street, Fiskdale where the Copper Stallion is currently sitting vacant and waiting for someone with heart, drive, a strong spirit for adventure, and dedication to working hard to breathe new life into her. The building itself is of historical significance to town, having served multiple purposes since it was built in 1887 which will lend quant charm to The Fiskdale Tavern's theme. With exposed chestnut beams, rough exposed granite walls, a small brick fireplace and rough-hewn barn-board walls, the space is full of history including having once been a hotel, a rooming house, a shoe shop, along with several other restaurants that have also occupied the space. There is even rumor it was brothel at one time; how naughty!!?\n",
      " \n",
      "So the stage is set, that’s the plan, now if you will bear with me just a bit longer I can tell you a little more about the plans for the Tavern that so many will all enjoy because you all made it happen. Imagine, the neighborhood Tavern that folks from all over helped  bring to life!  This couldn’t be a better plan, seriously.  But, work needs to be done, hence the need for financial backing.  The bank won’t touch the project without investment; that’s where you all play a part!  Unfortunately this is not a typical turnkey flip of ownership opportunity, well it is sort of, but the old Stallion is in need of renovations in all areas; the kitchen, the restaurant area, and the bar. The punch list is a little extensive and I won’t bore you with all the particulars but there is a true need for additional equipment, especially behind the bar, replacement equipment in the kitchen, and small things that add to the expense list like uniform shirts, menu printing, eye catching SIGNS noticeable from the street to help attract people to stop in and sit fora spell.\n",
      " \n",
      "The space is charming, it's old, and it works perfectly for the Tavern vision we have. Like any other business with aging equipment, newer, more energy efficient pieces need to be purchased and they are not on the higher end of the $$ scale. Even after looking online at used commercial outlets who resell used commercial appliances and bar equipment, we've decided it's better to buy new and pay a little bit more than inherit someone else's problems (and get a warranty).\n",
      " \n",
      "The atmosphere in the Tavern will be VERY laid back and casual, out of the way of the hustle and bustle of life that seems to be just flying past us every day.  The décor will be simple and include vintage photos of historical buildings, locations and points of interest around Fiskdale (and Sturbridge) which will be provided by a local town historian. We will be putting in new flooring, adding new equipment behind the bar to put eight more rotating beers on tap, and many more exciting things!!\n",
      " \n",
      "We will be offering a wide range of food choices but wish to set our sights on being the best gourmet burgers and specialty wings joint this side of Worcester, Springfield, and Hartford!  We’ll have numerous tavern appetizers, Garlic Parm Bacon Knots, Nachos Grande, Fried Ravioli, Ragin’ Cajun Popcorn Shrimp, Humus & Pita Chips, Poutine, and more. We will be offering two soups; New England clam chowder and French onion soup, as well as chili daily, and a soup special that will change weekly. We will have several salad choices including House, Caesar (toppings include chicken, shrimp or steak tips), Honey Garlic Salmon, Chicken Bruschetta and several others, as well as numerous made from scratch salad dressings. \n",
      " \n",
      "Lunch is served Thursday through Sunday with a Sunday Brunch & Lunch that starts at 10:00am and runs through 4:00pm. Dinner will be served nightly Monday through Saturday starting at 4:00pm. We will be offering daily specials in addition to our set menu which will have several chicken, beef/pork, seafood, pasta dishes as well as two Copper Stallion classics, Cottage Pie and Bangers and Mash.  Our menu offerings are competitively priced with other area restaurants with similar styles with 99% of our menu being available gluten-free and or Chefs using only the freshest produce and meats from locally sourced farmers and butchers.  Who's hungry!!?\n",
      " \n",
      "Now, if all of this sounds like a restaurant/tavern you would like to sit down for a meal at or just stop in and relax at the bar with a drink and an appetizer, we would love your support. We will be offering some great incentives including VIP Cards as well as well beer mugs, pint glasses, T-shirts and other Tavern logo items and a brass name plate on a plaque that will hang in the entry vestibule proudly displaying our supports who made the Fiskdale Tavern dream a reality!!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The biggest risk at this time that I am facing is time itself.  The lease on the space runs out at the end of the month. It will take time to get the backing to fund for the purchase.  When I get the backing and I'm funded I can proceed with the purchase, pay the landlord for September and October rent and then start the process of pulling permits to start the renovations, apply for the required licenses, hire the contractors for the renovation and  installation of new equipment.  While that is taking place more time will be needed to recruit the kitchen staff, bar staff and wait staff.  Training will need to take place on the Point of Sales system, what is expected of the kitchen service, what is expected of bartending and waitstaff.  The purchase of stock can then begin to restock the bar, the kitchen and the kitchen staff can start working on their culinary skills to put out all the dishes on our menu.  We're going to have some well fed employees that week.  But I'm fearing the lease expiration may put me in a bad position, but then again, if my kickstarter can come through in less than 20 days, I'll be the proud new owner of The Fiskdale Tavern!!  I want to thank everyone in advance for any and all support.\n",

      "Hello and thanks for checking out our kickstarter campaign for a truly unique recording project called Joty Drums! My name is John Churchville and back in 2010 I was lucky enough to spend a day at Sage Ct. Studio in Ann Arbor Michigan recording an album with the legendary drummer Muruga Booker and world renouned tabla master Pandit Samar Saha.  It was a magical day, the connection between the musicians in the studio was immediate and deep.  Egos were put to the side and the only driving force was making great music.  We spent the next three years plugging away, adding tracks and other insturments, but at core this album is an improvised world percussion experiment gone right! Now we need your help to get the album in print.  This coming Fall Pandit Samar Saha will be coming to Ann Arbor on Tour and our hope is to have a C.D. release party for Jody Drums. So check out the rewards and let’s make this happen!\n",

      "Pandit Samar Saha - A master tabla maestro from Kolkatta, India, Pandit Saha has performed in the U.S. Japan, Canada, and all over Europe as both a soloist and along side some of the biggest names in Indian classical music.  He has performed at world class venues including Carnegie Hall in N.Y., the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. and Englands Royal Albert Hall.  He is a household name in India and has been a featured artist on the prestigious All India Radio. When not on the road, he is the senior most faculty member at the prestigious Sangeet Research Academy in Kolkatta.\n",

He is a grammy nominated recording artist and has worked with such greats at Dave Brubeck, Weather Report, Baadal Roy, George Clinton, and Baba Olatunji. Muruga has also developed a signature drum known as the Nada Drum, which was manufactured and sold by Latin Percussion and was also blessed on a a 1969 recording by the world famous guruji Swami Sachinananda. \n",

      "1. Getting the C.D. printed in time for the C.D. release party.  This is always a concern based on the complexity of getting these projects through the assembly line of production in a timely manner.  We have given ourselves about a month to complete what usually takes 2 weeks.  Hopefully that will be enough of a cushion.  If they do not come in time, they will go out as soon as we get them!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Getting Pandit Saha to Ann Arbor safely and in time for the C.D. release party.  Of coarse it is always a risk when you are dealing with international travel, especially when professional musicains are involved.  Pandit Saha has been touring every year in America for the past 15 years and he knows the hoops he has to jump through to make it happen.  If things go wrong and he can not make it for some reason, we will most definitely reschedule and make it up to you!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "in the company of growing women.\n",
      "Dear Lois is a bi-annual independent magazine for all women, starting as young as 12-years-old. We believe we continue to grow and learn through all stages of life, so why not have a place to pursue and encourage that together.\n",
      "Each issue invites everyday storytellers, casual life changers, and unassuming heroes to share their stories. In a world filled with comparing and competition, we wanted to create something different. Here you don’t need to be the best or the first at something to be given a platform to talk. We feature all voices, big and small.\n",
      "We meet you where you are.\n",
      "ISSUE #2\n",
      "This is the home issue. We decided to focus on the theme of home because whether we feel like we’ve found it, we’ve always had it, or we are still searching for it, we all have our own definition of home.\n",
      "Inside, we talk about the people who make up a home. The people who make it messy, and the people who tidy it up. We talk about the feeling of home — why some people feel uncomfortable with the home they are given, and how they discover a new home in new places. We talk about how certain memories remain in our brains forever, and how ultimately you have the ability to shape your home and create a place of belonging wherever you go.\n",
      "We learn that home is much more than a physical structure. It’s about comfort and safety, a place where your true self can shine. Houses can come and go, but your home moves with you.\n",
      "OUR JOURNEY\n",
      "Issue #1 was fully funded on Kickstarter and since releasing the issue in November 2018 we’ve been blown away by the seemingly endless support and kind words from our growing audience. We are super proud of our first issue, which was originally a school project primarily aimed at learning more about typography and layout. However, we were clearly on to something and it caught on, becoming so much more than we ever could have imagined. It’s now found all over the world.\n",
      "With issue #2, we are hoping for an even larger reach. We’ve tried out new things, met new people, and we’re ready to share these new amazing pieces with you.\n",
      "So why another campaign you ask? Because printing and shipping is expensive (70% of our budget!), and Kickstarter helps us secure funds in advance while we grow organically with your support. In addition to production costs, we’ve also made a commitment to have the money necessary to pay our contributors for their time and talent. Because we are currently ad-free, we rely entirely on our readers’ support, and we find kickstarter to be a fun and safe way to gather the necessary funds.\n",
      "By supporting this Kickstarter, you’ll be putting us in a better position to keep making and releasing issues, to keep growing our readership by printing more copies, and ultimately to make Dear Lois a sustainable project. The more issues we create and the more readers we gain, the more opportunities we have for grants and sponsorships in the future.\n",
      "WHY PRINT\n",
      "There is a lot of great work online, and we hope to add to that space sometime in the future. However, we strongly value the idea of sitting with the work within Dear Lois for as long as you need. You can take it with you wherever you go, or you can keep it on your bookshelf until you need to revisit it later on. While Dear Lois isn’t considered a self-help publication, we understand certain articles will impact different people at different times. Consider it a friend you can call on when you need someone.\n",
      "REWARDS\n",
      "CREDITS + THANK YOUS\n",
      "As always, projects like this take a village, and Dear Lois issue #2 is no exception. \n",
      "Our sincerest thank you to all our contributors:\n",
      "Artemie Li, Adrienne Oliver, Alejandra Macouzet, Amy Huber, Anna Nguyen, Bonnie Alderfer, Breeze Pollard, Dayna Behrens, Divya Das, Ella Lama, Ellen C.

      "And endless love and admiration for every single pal that helped us prep this campaign:\n",
      "To all our friends and family, thank you. Truly couldn’t do any of this without you.\n",
      "And finally, our deepest thanks goes to our Grandmother Lois, the magazine's namesake. Dear Lois is our way of sharing our desire to connect all generations of women together and to pay tribute to one the strongest ladies who ever existed. She was also one of the most talented crafters we will ever meet, and we can't think of a better way to spend our creative energy than by producing this magazine for years to come.\n",
      "ABOUT US\n",
      "Dear Lois grew a little bigger this time around, and now it's 100% a sister dream team. Mariah Behrens is a graphic designer, illustrator, and toy maker, insistent on always finding ways to empower young people. Hannah Behrens joined the team and has been an incredible second eye throughout the process of building issue #2. Hannah is a fitness guru with all the knowledge on oils, acupuncture and self-care you could ever need. \n",

      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "There is always a chance this could not succeed. We're still asking for a lot of money! But we're already starting this campaign with more experience than before. We ironed out all the unexpected kinks when we made Dear Lois Issue #1. Our biggest challenges we can think of are probably related to unforeseen printing or delivery mishaps, but we’ve established a great relationship with our vendors over the last year to ensure that it doesn’t happen.\n",

      "Tropic Zine is a forum for critical engagement with contemporary culture that seeks connections between Hawaiʻi and the tropical diaspora worldwide. Based in Honolulu, we are a print publication, digital platform, and creative collective. Our editorial content includes visual art, essays, poetry, interviews, photography, new media, and research-driven explorations; we are a collation of new cultural material that defies any singular narrative. We embrace queer modes of thinking, discontinuity, and hybridity, while prioritizing under-represented, emerging, and under-recognized artists.\n",
      "In March 2018, Tropic Zine raised enough funds to produce our first issue thanks to the generous support of our friends, families, strangers, and extended community. We released Issue 1 in September, started a non-profit publishing imprint, Tropic Editions, and received our 501(c)(3) tax exemption from the IRS. \n",
      "We have continued to evolve and expand our reach and our mission through online publishing (e-Tropic) and print stockists across the United States and abroad in Mexico, Japan, Canada, and the Philippines. We've partnered and collaborated with Nā Mea Hawaiʻi, Lil' Deb's Oasis, Aupuni Space, TRADES A.i.R., Tropical Futures Institute, HIZAB Library, Analog Sunshine Recorders, and have built relationships with many other organizations.\n",
      "With our second issue, we seek to decolonize, deconstruct, and reimagine the Filipino(x) diaspora by posing a series of questions about what it means to identify as, and to be, a contemporary citizen in an age of movement and dispersion (both tangible and virtual). Rather than speaking to national identity, the editorials present complex, entangled, multi-generational stories of place. More than half of our contributors are from Hawaiʻi, but they are, as you might imagine, located all over the world; in Hawaiʻi and across the continental US, in Germany, Brazil, and in the Philippines. \n",
      "Our 20 contributors are Catalina Africa-Espinosa, Calla Camero, Azuré Keahi, Leah Danze, gentofish, Jasmine Grace, Taissa Fromme, Rebecca Maria Goldschmidt, Jourdan Simmonds, Myka Arnado, Kristoffer Ardeña, 856G Gallery, Vincent Bercasio, Reise Kochi, Risa Hoshino, Lise-Michelle, Nakeʻu Awai, Cristin Lim, Jarrod Caranto, and Sonny Ganaden. These creatives are digging deep, unearthing, excavating the material and emotional realities of their cultural identity. It is our hope that their efforts will inspire you to gaze inward, outward, forward, and reconsider aspects of your own relationship to the places and communities around you, where-ever that may be.\n",
      "Before we can share this work-in-progress with you all, we need your help. This publication is a labor of love that needs financial support to go to production; we have a number of expenses that need to be covered, including materials, design, a small honoraria for newly commissioned works, and printing. By hitting our initial goal of $3,000 in three weeks, we will be able to effectively fund the pre-release costs and be able to focus on the public programming we have planned for the issue's June release, including an exhibition at Aupuni Space and an artist-in-residence from the Philippines.\n",
      "For those of you who have the financial capacity to consider a larger donation, we are seeking to create a patron program of 10 individuals who will donate at the $500-$1500 level. These micro-grants will support our publishing program, which now includes an open call for proposals.\n",
      "We consider the gesture of a pre-order to be a very meaningful show of support. We also welcome in-kind donations, volunteers, and new collaborations and partnerships.\n",
      "All forms of support, financial or otherwise, give us the energy, inspiration, and drive to continue making our project happen.\n",
      "With aloha and gratitude,\n",
      "Marika Emi and the Tropic Zine + Tropic Editions teams.\n",
      "Tropic Zine is the namesake project of Tropic Editions, a non-profit publishing imprint that produces artists' books imbued with a sense of place. Our publishing program supports artist-driven printed matter that forges connections between otherwise disparate locales and identities, with a curatorial emphasis on experimentation, queer and postcolonial critique, and community collaboration. We hope to draw Hawaiʻi into an existing global discourse on tropicality and creative production in the tropics.\n",

To avoid some of the challenges we faced in Issue 1 (including pushing back our release date multiple times), we have scheduled our design and production phases more fastidiously, improved our responsiveness and organizational skills, and already communicated our specific needs and timeline to our printer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are currently working to diversify our funding sources for this project. We have a three-pronged approach: private donations, institutional and foundation grants, and publication sales.

      "Aden Mc Ready, a bastard child of a drug and alcohol addled mom and an unidentified dad is reduced to singing in the subway for handouts. He is jolted into the final realization that the only way to predict ones future is to create it through faith, blood, sweat and tears. After numerous struggles, recoveries, and relapses he accidentally meets the man who is his dad, a man who once had it all but would give it all back to have been able to just have been present for his only son. Aden's attribute success to the emotions he went through as a neglected child. Now, when surrounded by the love and caring that has eluded him all his life, Aden starts his own family armed with the desperate plea of a dying man (his father) never to neglect his children. Adam Ratcliffe will be premiering in two movies scheduled to release this year!  Brotherly love starring Keke Palmer, Cory Hardrict, Romeo Miller and Meek Millz. Also summers biggest movie \"Southpaw\" starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Forest Whitaker, Rachel McAdams and 50 Cent.  Ryan Larason has been in love with cinematography ever since he picked up a camera.
