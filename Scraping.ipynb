      "-------STORY--------\n",
      " “Lluvia de Peces” (Rain of Fish) is a phenomenon that is said to have taken place annually for more than a century in Yoro, Honduras. It's believed to have started with Father José Manuel Subirana, a Spanish Catholic missionary who visited Honduras from 1856-1864. Upon seeing so many poor people, he prayed for three days and three nights asking God for a miracle to provide the people with food. It has been raining fish ever since. The fish are all about six-inches long and are completely blind. Even stranger is that these particular fish are not found in any of the surrounding bodies of water.\n",
      " Each painting is a visual representation of a particular story with the colors, patterns, clothing, animals, people, and architecture from that region. ",
      " ",
      " I begin each piece by researching the oral literature and imagery, and then creating a loose drawing of the key characters. I then draw the images in chalk onto a black canvas, building upon the colors in layers to add depth and vibrancy. The black background creates dramatic shadows that i really love. \n",
      "Every story has a lesson, moral or societal mores for children and adults alike. Stories help us remember who we are, where we came from, and even what the future could hold if we repeat the same mistakes. Many of my paintings tell the story of poverty, power, greed, and love. The lessons are, I hope, timeless.\n",
      "Television and other cultural forces have diluted storytelling as a tool of communicating, learning, and healing, and I want to make people curious about the stories of Central and South America. I want people to become curious again about story, about culture, and about people.\n",
      "The funds raised during this campaign will go toward purchasing art supplies for all of the pieces, securing a gallery for the event, creating Kickstarter rewards, shipping, packaging, project management, media development, taxes, etc.\n",
      "Here are the reward images that will be offered in various sizes:\n",
      "Thank you so much for checking out the project! I hope that you'll partner with me in creating this exhibition and please spread the word!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Hello! My name is Peggy Seymour and I'm from London. I am a self-employed jewellery designer/maker/seller by day and, unknown to most, a portrait artist by night. \n",
      "I hid my secret identity quite effectively for over a decade but have finally decided to take my painting seriously and pursue my life-long dream of making a living out of art.\n",
      "To cut a long story short, I had a traumatic art education which basically crushed my confidence and the desire to paint and draw right out of me. As a result I totally lost my way artistically and didn't pick up a paintbrush again for another ten years. During that time I found other ways of venting my creativity through design work of various kinds but it never truly felt like me and I never really stopped thinking about painting. It has always been my big \"what if?\". \n",
      "So, fast forward to now. I've conquered my fears, picked up my paintbrush and actually applied paint to canvas. Now I'm ready to show the world what I've got. This is where you, dear reader, come in.\n",
      "Juggling my art with trying to bring in a decent wage is super-difficult. As a self-employed person I am entirely responsible for my own income. Right now, when I'm painting, I'm not earning anything and with every painting taking upwards of 30 hours to complete, progress is slow and money is tight. \n",
      "On top of that I'm completely unknown. I have no fans, no following. I've never sold my oil paintings before. I'm a total rookie.\n",
      "Art with My Heart is a project designed to keep me painting, develop my skills as a portrait artist and share what I am learning whilst doing it. \n",
      "I believe the best way to improve my painting is to paint. Every time I create a new piece I learn something new and stretch myself further. I've already learnt so much since I started painting again but I desperately need your help to keep it going. \n",
      "With your support I want to create 12 brand new portraits of humans against black backdrops. I love painting people, especially against black. The light and dark contrast is extra intense and the skin colours really pop. There's a sort of silence about it. With no noisy distractions in the background you can just focus on the awesomeness of the human form and all the emotion it can convey. It's really very beautiful.\n",
      "But that's not all! I want to share my learning process with you. I'll be taking work in progress photographs of everything I do and writing notes on my painting technique discoveries as I go along. All this will be available through a backers only blog and in much more detail in a PDF Method Book which will contain in-progress shots, close-ups showing every tiny brush stroke and, if I can work out how to make them, links to time-lapse videos of me actually painting. \n",
      "I'm completely self-taught and the process has been very frustrating and lonely but, if you'll allow me, I'd like to share everything I know with you.\n",
      "Every portrait I create as part of this project will be included in my Catalogue of Work PDF along with the ones I have already created. It will be like an exhibition in electronic form.\n",
      "The process of creating each portrait will also be documented for my backers only blog and PDF Method Book.\n",
      "The portraits from the £125 reward will be kept by me as a starter portfolio to approach galleries with.\n",
      "Portraits from the £75, £250, £475 and £500 rewards will, of course, be shipped straight to their owners on completion. They will be shipped flat, just so you know.\n",
      "Your support will enable me to pay for:\n",
      "Rewards:\n",
      "I am offering the following super-special rewards in return for your pledge.\n",
      "Have a look to the right for full details and estimated delivery dates. Please note that the Catalogue of Work and the Method book will be emailed to you at the conclusion of the project so I can include all the portraits I create. I'm thinking this will be some time in December 2013.\n",
      "I am so happy to be painting again. It's a scary feeling to finally share my art with the world but it's also joyful and exhilarating. \n",
      "Portraiture is the very best thing I know how to do and the opportunity to create art full-time would be a dream come true for me and would allow me to find where I left my painting career, pick it up and run with it.\n",
      "Remember, that without your support I simply cannot do this. If my project does not reach its £3,500 goal I will get nothing and I will be very, very sad. Do something amazing with your day. Become a patron of the British arts and help me realise my dream at the same time.\n",
      "This one will also be available as a choice for all postcard/print rewards.\n",
      "Thank you so much for taking the time to read about my Kickstarter project. Please help me spread the word by sharing it with others if you can.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "So, you've done your maths and realised that if I sell all my portrait slots I'll actually be painting 30 portraits plus 1 masterwork which is a lot more than my project goal of 12? Not to worry. I have allowed for the extra work in my projected time scale and should still have everything completed by December 2013 in this most wonderful of eventualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst I am new to portraiture commissions, please rest assured that I have owned my own online business since 1998 and am very used to fulfilling orders in a timely manner on an international scale. I have also received many jewellery design commissions over the years so the concept of commissioned work is not new to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I already have a printer lined up for the Giclee prints and another one for the postcards and stickers so I'm all ready to go. Yay!\n",

After their final theater performance, they decide to get a few motel rooms to hold their senior cast party before each going their separate ways. Little do they know that they're being picked off one by one, while they're distracted by their interpersonal conflicts. \n",

      "2020. A year where the unpredictable became the predictable. We all have woken up to shocking headlines week to week, sometimes day to day, and there was one news story that really caught my attention and imagination: Several prisons across the United States started releasing \"non-violent\" inmates in an effort to stop potential outbreaks of a virus that was spreading world-wide. According to many sources, some violent inmates slipped through the cracks and were released. \n",
      "I immediately knew I wanted to make a horror film based loosely on this development.  For decades, I've had my own unique and terrifying approach to a film I love dearly: John Carpenter's \"Halloween.\" All I needed was an original and very grounded angle to get into the story of the night HE came home. \n",
      "And now I have one.\n",
      "Michael Myers killed his older sister when he was six years old on Halloween night. No motive. No emotion. No remorse. Dr. Samuel Loomis was placed to help Michael and try to understand him. However, Dr. Loomis has an ability he is mostly unaware of: He can reach into other's minds and spirit. He can see things about people that they can't see for themselves. What he sees in young Michael's eyes is summed up as pure evil. \n",
      "Through the years as Michael has grown, he hasn't spoken a word. He hasn't caused any fights, has never had behavioral problems and just stares at the wall. Several attempts to move Michael into a psychiatric facility have been unsuccessful because of Dr. Loomis's insistence. This is the \"one success\" that Loomis claims when it comes to Michael. \n",
      "Suddenly, Loomis finds himself in a horrifying situation. The prison that Michael has been locked away in for nearly twenty years is releasing qualifying inmates. This action is to reduce prison population to avoid potential spread of a deadly virus that has been sweeping the globe. Based on his behavioral reputation, Michael Myers has been selected and set free as he is now considered to be a non-violent threat to society. A person with a troubled childhood but a clean seventeen year prison record. \n",
      "Feeling the crushing weight of guilt for preventing Michael from being relocated to a psychiatric facility -where he would have never been released- Dr. Samuel Loomis rushes to Michael's hometown of Haddonfield to warn the citizens that Myers is on his way. Most importantly, to locate a young woman named Laurie Strode and revealed who she really is and why Michael is coming for her. How does this doctor know the carnage Michael is seeking in Haddonfield? Dr. Loomis once saw into the mind and spirit of Michael Myers. \n",
      "A part of him never escaped.\n",
      "\"The Shape of Halloween\" is being filmed in and around Salt Lake City, Utah. This is where the theatrical sequels \"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers\" and \"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\" were filmed in the 1980's. Our production will be filming on the very streets of those two films, bringing a really special connection to our fan film and the actual \"Halloween\" film legacy. There will also be several building and other locations used in our film that appeared in those sequels. \n",
      "The script is terrifying. To say that we pulled out all the stops is to say you only read the first twenty pages. It is so much more than that. Beneath all the mayhem that unspools over the course of our story, we silently dig into the psychology of Samuel Loomis, Laurie Strode and the characters that populate Haddonfield. We reach deeply into the emotions of the characters as they navigate through the thrill ride that is \"The Shape of Halloween.\"   \n",
      "Production is scheduled to start mid-October for a release early next year. With the funds we raise from this campaign, we will be investing solely in new and updated film equipment so the film can be made and brought to life the best it can be.\n",
      "I'm Brett James Bishop, the writer and director of \"The Shape of Halloween.\" I have been a huge fan of John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" since I was a kid. In my teens, the game was upped by the \"Scream\" films and I have been making small horror films for friends and family since high school. Finally ready and excited to branch off on my own within the world of horror films for the world to experience, I want to kick it off with this personal vision of a story that I've had in my head for decades. A new perspective of the night HE came home..\n",
      "The story of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode has always fascinated me. Not to mention the story of Dr. Samuel Loomis and Michael Myers. I'm a writer that loves to find and explore the WHY of the story and characters. \"The Shape of Halloween\" is far from a dumb slasher flick. There are story elements that might even surprise you that we present. \n",
      "I am also very excited to bring together a very diverse cast and crew that will represent equality across the board.\n",
      "My work previous to this project was a fan film in 2016 titled, \"Batman: Sins of the Past\" that broke out to global praise. I am also a published writer, producer and actor. I've been studying film for the past decade, primarily the past several years. \n",

      "Common to Utah is the chance of winter hitting in October. To help avoid this potential issue, all scenes that take place outside are scheduled first, with many having the option of being moved to interior locations without hurting the storytelling. There is also the chance of the actual pandemic having a second wave hit around the time of production. This production will be using testing kits to make sure everyone on set is healthy as well as practicing CDC guidelines. Easier to pull off when you have a pandemic in your story and having a killer who is always wearing a mask. If there is a city or state stay-at-home order, the film will be rescheduled for next spring and will not be cancelled.\n",

Magazine consultant Jay McGill estimates that profit margins in the industry have dropped off from a stellar 20–25% to a more earthly, but still healthy, range of 12–15%, which is pretty close to the average for the S&P 500. In fact, publishing giant Hearst recently reported record-breaking ad sales for its September issues.\n",

You build your subscription numbers by finding the right niche, producing high quality content, and strategically marketing it. Then make your real money from attracting advertisers who like your niche and distribution numbers.\n",
      "The great thing about the freelance market, is that it consists of over 53 million people in the United States. So that means, as a magazine that caters to the success of freelancers, our target market is over 53 million people! Yep, 1 in 3 Americans now work as freelancers in some capacity. Our market is HUGE! If we can only get this magazine in the hands of 1% of American freelancers, that will give us 530,000 subscribers! That, my friends, is a HUGE magazine that will pull in tens of thousands of dollars per single full page advertisement within it. Can you see where I'm going here? Even if we reach only .1% of the market, we're working with 53,000 subscribers which is a VERY successful niche magazine. But of course, I want this to be mainstream. And with your help, I can make it happen!\n",
      "Now beyond all of this, I have also launched a website called limelance.com which is a marketplace for freelancers and employers to connect on available freelance jobs. Better check that out too! My business plan is to constantly cross-promote the magazine with the online marketplace, and watch them both explode in numbers. You may have noticed the full page ad for LimeLance in the magazine's Digital Preview you clicked on earlier. As the little boy in Sleepless in Seattle said, they are MFEO (made for each other!).\n",
      "So here's where you come in. To properly launch this thing to the freelance world, I need... well... funding. Producing, marketing, printing, and distributing a high-scale magazine isn't cheap. But I'm going to make is ridiculously easy for you. For contributing to this project, I will instantly make you a subscriber to the magazine. So basically, you're subscribing and funding the project all at the same time. For $25, you get 12 monthly issues. For $50, you get 36 monthly issues. For $100, you get monthly issues forever. \n",
      "My plan is to get the first issue out the door in January 2016. With your funding, I can make it happen! Maybe you're not even a freelancer. But guess what? After reading the magazine every month, you might just want to dive into the freelance world. You'll definitely learn how!\n",
      "So let's get this thing rocking. In a year or two you'll be able to brag that you were one of the founding partners of Freelance Magazine. :) \n",
      "Thank you so much for your time and consideration.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The risk involved in this project is really quite minimal. The biggest challenge is getting advertisers into a very first issue of any magazine. Most advertisers want to see a bit of a track record before committing advertising dollars. So there is a good chance we will take a minimal loss on the first few issues of the magazine. Which is why we need to ensure we are properly funded to make the magazine viable long-term. Now don't get me wrong, there are many ways to get paying advertisers into a first issue, and that will be a huge point of focus. Giving advertisers an incredible looking preview of the magazine is by far the best way to do that.\n",

I  studied horticulture last year and have a passion for studying plants up close especially Western Australian natives.  Through my photography I hope to enter competitions both here and internationally to show the world how amazing plants and flowers can be.

I have an 80year old shed that would love to restore so I can turn it into my studio - I grow the plants I photograph in my large native garden my 5 yr plan is to open my studio and the garden to the public so they can enjoy my art and the garden \"do what you love - and you'll never work a day in your life\" I absolutely love my art and my plants - I am passionate about Western Australian natives which are the best in the world !

      "Mulitple/Universal\n",
      "This show deals with the role of art and abstraction as a universal engine for self-differentiation and also universal communication in the age of the internet. The work by this group of artists navigates the visual landscape by using material experimentation, simple geometries, color play, etc. in a way that vividly illuminates individual preference and experience.  Under another light, these works exhibit the connectedness of a universally vibrating network.  The underpinnings of this curatorial effort lie in the basic study of quantum physics, and especially in the idea that we live in a time where humanity is approaching a confluence between a tangible, electronic universal consciousness (the internet), and a still vague but growing understanding of the way that energy and consciousness might be drawn from a universal field. How are the constant easy access to information and the shifts away from a mechanical, linear view of the universe affecting abstraction? \n",
      "From what I've seen, abstraction in painting has been moving towards a practice that combines both the modernist desire to define the universal and the expressionist urge to explore what moves us and defines us as individuals; contemporary painting is increasingly an unabashed celebration of color and chemistry which uses universal language to simultaneously engage with and escape the saturation of technological communication. There is a clear sense that none of the works in this show could have been made at another point in history.  The works are not only constructed and influenced by digital technologies; they are created with the knowledge of instantaneous presence in the timeline of the universally accessible digital world.\n",

      "\"Portraits of Promise\" - One Hundred Portraits of American Teenagers,  is a series of oil portraits of teenagers painted from life.  The models each posed for 4 hours.  The paintings are done in a method known as “Alla Prima”, which is a direct, expressive painting style, and literally means “at once” in Italian.  Alla prima paintings are completed in a single session, during which the artist tries to capture the feeling and  psychology of the subject as well as an accurate likeness in a limited period of time. In these paintings, each completed \"wet-on-wet\" in a single session; the methods used are those I learned studying under Nelson Shanks at Studio Incamminati, the school he founded in Philadelphia.  This series had its genesis in my desire to to paint portraits from life, and to explore different ways to paint expressively.  I also to wanted do something different, something less formal than traditional portraiture, and to work with subjects who might not otherwise have their portraits painted. At a certain point, it became apparent that this project had become  a sort of \"historical document\" by which the viewer could experience today's teenagers, not only through how these young people look, but also through their thoughts, feelings, aspirations and dreams, which are incorporated into the project.  Each portrait is accompanied by quotes from a questionnaire the teenagers were asked to complete, in which they share their concerns and hopes for the future, as well as practical  advice to other teenagers.  The paintings, accompanied by the models' statements, will be exhbited under the title \"Portraits of Promise: One Hundred Alla Prima Portraits of American Teenagers\".  I also plan to publish a book about my experience of this project,  which will include photographs of the paintings and the model's statements about life, as well as my own thoughts about painting this series. I began the paintings in September, 2010, a week after my youngest child left for college, and completed  118 paintings by June, 2012. Painting this series helped me to process my feelings about my shifting role as parent, mother and wife, entering the next phase of my life without my children at home. Embracing the young people who posed in this series was a wonderful way to ease though this transition.  They lifted my spirits, and sustained me through over 100 paintings.  The funds raised here will be used to purchase  frames in which the paintings will be exhibited.  Should additional funds be raised, that money will be used to underwrite the costs of publishing the book of this project. This series of portraits has been a true labor of love.\n",
      " You can follow this project on my blog at www.natalieitaliano.blogspot.com. \"Portraits of Promise: One Hundred Alla Prima Portraits of American Teenagers\", will be exhibited as part of a group show at Gloucester County College in Sewell, NJ., opening September 9, 2-4 pm, 2012.  The exhibition  will continue until October 17, and will be the first in a series of planned exhibitions of \"Portraits of Promise\". \n",

      " I have been wanting to get some badges made for a while and these eco-friendly wooden pins seemed like the perfect fit. They are sustainably resourced, use far less energy to manufacture than traditional enamel pins, and produce more detail in the printed design.\n",
      "There are 5 different designs available. If you are one of those people who struggles to decide, don’t worry. You can pledge now and choose a design later. I will be sending out a survey where you can pick which ones you want.\n",

This is the most costly part of our production process, from distribution to the facility to paying for the processing, but it is necessary for us to provide you with a TRULY CLEAN plant-based beverage.

      "Welcome to my Kickstarter page. I'm so excited to have the opportunity to join forces with you to make my very first EP. Let me just tell you a little bit about what led me here and how I plan on doing this with your help.\n",
      "I've been performing since before I could remember (I literally have no recollection of my first performance at age 2.5). I grew up in South Dakota playing anywhere they would have me, whether it was opening for grandstand acts with my guitar or singing at nursing homes for $20 and a Thanksgiving turkey.  Anyhow, I moved to Nashville when I was 19, which is when I started writing with the big kids and learning what it really meant to be an artist.  \n",
      "Shortly after I moved, I found a great writing partner with whom I had an amazing creative connection. His name is Leland Grant, and we formed a duo called \"THE LiNE.\" We were fueled by a wonderful songwriter/friend/mentor who is still responsible for many of my songwriting choices today. For the next two years, I put every ounce of my creativity into writing songs for our project.\n",
      "Leland and I had the privilege of being on Team Xtina on season 2 of The Voice. It was full of challenges, and also some of the greatest moments of my life. No matter who you are, it's incredibly inspiring to have Christina Aguilera show you how to sing something while she's standing three feet from you. \n",
      "Though our time on The Voice didn't end how I wanted it to, it did lead me to a simple conclusion - I needed to go back to being Hailey Steele. I started writing for myself again (it sorta felt like I was starting from scratch) and signed a publishing deal with BMG Chrysalis Nashville, and I've been writing like crazy ever since. I've always stood by the motto \"may the best song win,\" and have made my best effort to bring that to the table with my music. So that's my story, and now here we are. \n",
      "The reason I'm doing a Kickstarter is because I want this project to be funded independently so that I own the master recordings...no label, no publishing company or anybody else owning anything. It's just me and the people who like my music deciding what to do with it. \n",
      "Every little bit helps. I'm asking for $10,000 as a goal, but every dollar I receive will count towards what it takes to make a quality 5-6 song EP. I am really focused on making these recordings sound great, and that's never cheap.\n",
      "Here's where your money will go: studio time, musicians, producer, mixing/mastering, marketing/promotion, printing/pressing of physical copies, video, design and photography associated with the EPK.\n",
      "What's in it for you: I've created a list of incentives that will make this fun for backers on every budget level. Knowing me and knowing my music are interchangeable, so I want to give you the full experience and keep you as involved as possible. \n",
      "I'm so excited to be able to share my music with you. Please spread the word about this project to your family, friends, co-workers, etc. I can't wait to see what we can do.\n",

I'm confident that the risks and challenges will be at a minimum, but they cannot be avoided altogether. The biggest risk we face is time, simply because of how many steps there are to the recording process. Since this project is independent, we are not operating under any major time constraints. Should the process experience delay, it will just take a little extra patience. However, I will do my best to get all of your rewards to you in a timely fashion!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Cisco is a local promoter in the underground club scene, but the party is about to end. As EDM music consumes the dance crowd at an illegal show, rave-girl Catrina desires the euphoric high of \"Molly\" that Cisco previously introduced to her. While dancing on stage, Catrina collapses from an overdose. Her older sister, Sophia, holds her in her arms, but Catrina succumbs to the dark veil of death, leaving Sophia and her friends to mourn a life cut tragically short.  \n",
      "Almost a year passes and Sophia honors Catrina's life on Dia De Los Muertos (The Day Of The Dead), hoping to connect with her spirit and find some closure. As tradition dictates on this sacred day, Sophia decides to build an ofrenda (a ritual altar) with the guidance of Victor, an elderly Brujo. He warns Sophia that under no circumstances can she allow the ofrenda to remain unfinished or the consequences for Catrina's soul could be dire.  \n",
      "Sophia invites Catrina's friends, including Cisco, to take part in building the ofrenda. As usual, Cisco turns it into a party. As everyone drinks and parties, an evil presence, the Lady of Dead, intervenes, allowing unholy entities to escape Purgatory so they can consume the souls of the living. Cisco is the first to be possessed and he dutifully leads Sophia and their friends into the spiritual abyss embodied in a dilapidated hospital rumored to be haunted. In order to escape their horrific imprisonment in the hospital, the tortured souls of Darkness crossover the threshold of the living and hunt down Catrina and her friends one by one. \n",
      "With the doorway opened to the other side, Sophia learns that her sister was not who she thought she was… but can she save herself and her friends before they are possessed and their souls lost to dark dominion of the Lady of the Dead? \n",
      "We want to bring a new horror character known as                                             \"The Lady Of The Dead -Catrina\" ! She is classy and she is deadly and she has been around for a very long time, you're just not paying attention! Well now you will! Classic scares and suspense is what we need to bring and we will with your help.  We want to entertain while creating jobs for people at the same time. We are a family of producers, friends and artists. This not just a one shot idea. If we succeed with this project, it will enable us to continue making the other great films in our creative collective. And that helps continue to empower independent film and create even more jobs. Big corporate studios are not the only way. \n",
      "Alternatively, small independent micro-budget films do not mean they are cheesy or bad. Some of the most successful and iconic horror films came from the independent film community. If we got rid of the movies no one wanted to make, it would leave a giant hole in the horror genre landscape. Movies like \"Blair Witch Project\" and \"Paranormal Activity\" completely changed the game. But they would not have happened if left to the studios to decide.  \n",
      "We are not backed by a studio. We are not backed by a bank, or investment consortium. We are just a great group of film-making friends who want to scare the living crap out of you.  And through this amazing crowd funding resource, we have the incredible opportunity to directly connect with you -- the fans who love scary movies; the actual people who buy tickets at the box office; the ones that spread the word of mouth; and the ones that keep the genre alive in an increasingly formulaic, comic book-driven world. Did we mention SCARING THE CRAP OUT OF YOU!? Just making sure.\n",
      "All too often the box office pressures and insane costs of the Big Movie Industry service the corporate bottom line. Maybe that's why horror movies nowadays have abandoned their grass roots and their prime directive? Relying excessively on CGI (Computer-Generated Imaging aka digital special effects) to create screams of terror. We don't. We keep it real. A touch is OK, if needed, but that's only if needed. We call it \"practical scare authenticity\" - meaning we only want to use real world strategies to scare you. And we have Proof of Concept. Think about this, the Godfathers of horror movies, the iconic classics like George Romero's \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"The Exorcist\" all created fear with this incredibly effective practical approach. You do not need a computer to create great characters, good acting and a skin-crawling, cover your eyes environment. We are all about authentic, real fear.  \n",

      "I did not go to a coveted film school. I do not have movie industry parents or a trust fund. I'm a regular, blue collar, hard working guy who learned movies by LOVING movies. Given my background, movies are, in so many ways, my salvation. I've lost count of how many movies I have watched. And my favorites have always been horror films. I will never forget watching             THE EXORCIST and THE HOWLING. Scared me witless! Couldn't sleep alone for a week. And, I loved it.\n",
      "Years later, imagine how incredible I felt getting to be an extra in a real Hollywood movie! Sounds corny but it's the honest to God truth. So even while supporting my family working 70 hours a week, I found a way to carve out a small slice of time to stay involved in movies -- wearing any hat I was asked to because no matter how insignificant the job, I believe the best way to learn is hands on. That's me. Roll up my sleeves. Sweat of my brow. Nothing wrong with it, but I'm just not a text book kinda guy. I just do it. And it took me a long time to work my way up. And finally, a few years ago, I was rewarded with the opportunity to be a Producer on an indie film entitled \"KILL KAPONE\" (currently out on DVD,out on REDBOX in the fall and VOD outlets!).\n",
      "So I've being doing my movie thing and along the way in life, as always, you meet some really cool people.

That's pretty much how I met the people in our movie.\n",

Dyana's improvisational skill and timing were essential for her key role in Los Muertos. \n",

It was erected in 1904 and rebuilt in 1924 after a massive fire. Due to its high mortality rate throughout the years, Linda Vista was shut down in 1991. It was considered one of the most haunted locations in Los Angeles until it was completely remodeled by a real estate developer shortly after we finishing filming the hospital sequences. It now Senior Housing. We're very proud we were able to fund shooting at this location before this insanely terrifying location was lost for all time. Seriously, shootinghere was beyond creepy. We consider it a badge of honor we can count ourselves as one of the very last films ever filmed at this historic site.\n",

These ancient celebrations of life and death were observed during the time of the Aztecs, with rituals and offerings to connect our world with that of the dead. We delved deeply into the rich history of this celebrated holiday and added our own backstory to explain its \"true\" origins. We love that Dia de Los Muertos provides the inspiration for our title and we intend to fully exploit its connection to the far more familiar scary holiday called All Hallows Eve (Halloween). At the center of the Day of the Dead traditions is the Aztec goddess Mictecacihuatal, aka the Lady of the Dead. She is the template for the demon who hunts down our heroes. All these rich cultural and traditional elements provided an extremely solid foundation to build a unique contemporary story, a different story, a truly skin crawling story that makes you think and makes you scream!\n",

We created that with minimal funding and have been gaining interest and followers around the world. If passion were money, we'd be fully funded. But art imitates life, and damn it, things cost money! So... we need some. Our $85,000 target is not a lot by Hollywood standards, but it's still going to require many helping hands supporting us with small amounts. We know how hard we all work to make ends meet, so we would never want someone to pledge anything exorbitant. Give whatever you can and if you can't pledge, show us some love on social media!

      "1.  30% - Our biggest chunk is obviously crew. We can't get these guys to do anything without waving a little green in front of their eyes. Bringing a KICKASS HORROR will take the efforts of our crew to wear many hats, go without sleep (thank God for coffee!), and effortlessly do what it takes to make this film happen! Our effects, set dressing, makeup/art departments are also in this category and without them we have no magic!!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2.  25% - Editing is the next expense we will encounter. Since we will shy away from an all CGI platform, we have to depend on the look, feel and sound that a good movie needs. Editing, color correcting, audio and processing is a definite must we cannot skimp on!! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3.  20% - ACTORS. What will we do without them? Not a damn thing!  Apparently, it's customary to pay and feed these folks? The nerve of some people huh? We need them and we need to feed and buy them ice cream daily. No, but we do have to pay for their skill and talent which brings characters and the story to life. We tried monopoly money, guess it didn't work!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4.  15% - Seems we cant film like we would like to without permits. Go figure!        But we do need them as well as liability insurance and clearances which falls into this category. The support from local owners of specific locations and businesses for our shoot has been EXTREMELY overwhelming and we've been thrilled that they opened their doors to our production. This all adds to production value and authenticity. Of course location is everything and some do come with a price. So this, too, can be a challenge to consume all our budget. Do I smell favors cooking?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "5.  10% - And last but not least we have PUBLICITY. This little area is what we need to shout out to the media and world that we have arrived damn it ! Yes even social media costs money to be done strategically. Not only social platforms, but shows, festivals and events to promote also need funds. Your continued support in spreading the word about LOS MUERTOS will intensify our efforts even further.\r\n",

      "NO sugar coating, just the straight facts. No matter how big or how small the film production company is, obstacles and challenges will arise. The key is to carefully plan a strategy to cover as many possible pitfalls in order to avoid them or correct them. This is why having a production team and mentors behind us with years of experience is priceless. We've helped ourselves even further by hiring really talented actors that have sharpened their craft and bring a wealth of additional support to the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of a film's biggest challenges, after financing of course, is production scheduling for both actors and locations. Our writer specifically designed our story with a smaller cast because it allows for greater mobility, less expense and more freedom to adapt our shooting schedules due to availability and other unforeseen issues. The best way to avoid a problem is not to make one. You know, measure twice and cut once!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But seriously, we can't finish Los Muertos without actual legal tender and your HELP! So please make it rain... or shower, drizzle, or sprinkle. Even a trickle is immensely appreciated. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We will work our hardest to overcome every obstacle, but one of our biggest challenges is immediate -- raising all the financing required to make this film a reality. And this is where you all come in. Your support and word of mouth can make this film fully materialize!\r\n",
      "Other Ways You Can Help\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If contibuting funds is not possible at this moment, there are other very valuable ways to help us out. Help spread the word and awareness about Los Muertos as much as possible. Social media is an amazing asset and you, the horror genre fans, have the power to make a difference.\n",

      "     After surviving colon cancer in the summer of 2014, I came to realization that poor nutrition is a major contributor to development of cancer.  After long and thorough research on cancer prevention, I eliminated chicken and beef from my diet, focusing on plant-based foods as one of my sources of protein.  I noticed that many dishes lacked flavor and majority of protein sources were soy-based.  Most people are aware that 99% of soy sold in the US is genetically modified.  I couldn't take a chance by exposing my body to GMO products, so I decided to experiment with various organic plant-based protein sources and came out with currently patent-pending, delicious recipe for high-protein content, organic, plant-based sauce. This sauce can be added to any dish, vegan or otherwise, to increase the flavor and daily protein intake, without jeopardizing your health.  It contains no artificial ingredients and has a high-nutritional value.  It is 100% Non-GMO and vegan friendly. \n",

      "My name is Morgan Leigh and this is my Kickstarter. \n",
      "First things first, Thank you everyone for visiting my Kickstarter page and for watching my video above! In advanced I'd like to say thank you for all the support and love, this would not be possible without YOU! Every donation helps, big or small. Remember - “It's not about what it is, it's about what it can become.” Together we can raise enough money to make this dream become a reality!\n",
      "Therefore, I'm extremely excited to be starting this new endeavor together on the making of my first full length debut album! \n",
      "When I was 17, I had an amazing opportunity to travel to Nashville, TN and record my first EP. I fell in love with the songwriting process and came home to San Diego, CA and began writing with song writing partner in Rhyme, Paul Coughlin. It's been 3 years since then and we've put together a list of songs we are extremely proud of and can't wait to share with everyone!\n",
      "As you may know, It takes a lot of time and money to record an album. Our main focus is to record a full length album of the songs we've written so our fans, family, and friends can have a little bit of us with them where ever they go! \n",
      "The last 7 months we've been all over the United States sharing our music without the backing of a Record Label. Being an independent artist has its challenges, but it also has its perks! We have full control of our creativity and whom we share our music with! With our fans as our label, the possibilities are endless!\n",
      "The Breakdown\n",
      "We have set our goal to $10,000 to record the album. However, if we raise up to $20,000, we will be able to record the album plus make a music video, distribute the music world wide, and go on tour to a city near you! The more money we raise, the more we can give back to our fans! This means more shows, new music, more merchandise, and more opportunities for our fans to get to know us better! \n",
      "The Packages\n",
      "We have a lot a great packages for our backers! They range anywhere from $1-$10,000 and each package guarantees a copy of the new album! For more info on the packages, check out the right side of the page! \n",
      "Download Our Latest Music for Free\n",
      "In the mean time, while we are recording our new album (thanks to your donation), you can download all our previously recorded music for free here! Reverbnation.com/MorganLeighMusic\n",
      "\"Foolish\" is one of nine songs you can download for free at the link above!\n",
      " Thank You!\n",
      "I am so incredibly thankful for each and everyone of you. Music has become apart of me, it identifies who I am  and who I want to be. Without your support and backing, all of this would not be possible. You've taken my dream of being an artist and skyrocketed my career into something I could not have dreamt of and  I am so greatful for that! I can't wait to personally meet all of you at one of our next shows, the grocery store, or where ever it may be when we run into each other! Thank you, Thank you, and Thank you!\n",

      "However, finishing our album doesn't necessarily mean everyone in the world is guaranteed to hear it. There are really no limits to the amount of effort and money you can pour into this endeavor!

      "Personnaly measuring 1m81, the thigh boots just turn into knee boots.\n",
      "Our mission is to create a shoe's accessory that will fit to any woman's shoes and transform it into a beautiful pair of thigh boots. All this, with trendy collections, adapting to all budgets, all body shapes and above all, to each woman. \n",
      "In addition to the trendy collections, a web app will also be developed to allow customers to create their own accessories if their minds were to turn to creativity. \n",
      "Yes ! Pimp'up deeply believes that every woman is unique.\n",
      "Pimp'up expresses and believes in true values: A free and independent woman, strong and elegant.\n",

      "A Vegan range has even been designed, to be able to offer the same products to everyone, while respecting everyone's ethics.\n",
      "Size : 3 types of size: S, M, L and the custom-made.\n",
      "Because each woman deserves a special attention, our labels are composed of a secret pocket where a personalized word, signed by my hand, has been slipped, especially for her.  Because wearing Pimp'up is much more than dressing your leg or wanting to be trendy. Wearing a pair of Pimp'up is joining a community. A community of strong and independant women capable of moving mountains! You will never be alone again! And if you are a little down; this word will remind you of it. Because it will have been written especially for you and only for you.\n",
      "A web application will allow customers to create their own accessories thanks to a big database of materials, things to customize. Simple and effective, it has never been easier to create for express your personality. \n",
      "Our accessory is manufactured in a small but very famous Italian workshop of 20 craftsmen, in the region of Marches. Area known for shoe making. \n",
      "This world-renowned workshop also produces parts for major international brands. Our materials are finely selected and/or directly manufactured on site while respecting an eco-responsible production line.\n",

Because we sincerely believe that the use of the highest quality materials is the basis of an excellent accessory.

By eliminating intermediaries, not using resellers and by talking directly with you, we are able to offer an accessory of impeccable quality, at a price that can be adapted to all budgets, depending on the range. All accessories are finely inspected by us before each shipment.\n",
      "From the beginning, our objective was to offer a beautiful stylish feminine shoe's accessory, which fits all shoes, but above all, at a great price. The fact is that we don't have to buy the entire shoe, to adapt to any shoe allows us to do this. Indeed, the accessory adapts and re-invent your pair. The fact that we are also in direct contact with our customers without intermediaries or resellers also allows us to offer you a quality product, without costing you a fortune.\n",
      "Whether you go to work in a skirt or trousers suit, jeans or even a little black dress, the accessory is as versatile as it is functional. A dinner with your beloved? We remove the Pimp'up to let us see your legs. Reinvent your look as simply as a hello!\n",

      "If I reach 150,000, I will post prototype drawings for celebrities (which for me are the spirit of Pimp'up) saying that every 5000 more I make the prototypes and send them to the star and that it will then be on sale in September. 5000 also for packaging\n",
      "Fashion designer and always on the lookout for the latest trends, I love being feminine and stylish even in the freezing cold. What could be better than a beautiful pair of boots with a sweater dress for a trendy look? I've never been able to find a pair that can be beautiful, suitable, not vulgar, and without being horribly expensive!\n",
      "I created Pimp'up to solve this problem. With the fit and waterproofness of a shoe, Pimp'up adapts, keeps you warm and guarantees you a confident look, with a wide variety of choices to represent you. To each her own Pimp'up!\n",
      "Our mission is to dress your leg, dust off the shoe's world and allow you to reinvent your pairs without having to buy new ones.\n",
      "Over the past year, we have produced 8 prototypes. At each step of the process, we learned valuable information. We have refined, redesigned and are now delighted to use what we have learned to really launch Pimp'up with the help of the Kickstarter community.\n",
      "We spend a lot of time in our workshops, working with the staff and preparing our accessories to perfection. We have established a partnership with a workshop that manufactures items for some of the world's leading brands. We are only an hour away by plane, and when the accessories are finished and ready to go, we will pick them up directly.\n",
      "The possibilities of evolution for Pimp'up are endless! We could think about creating collections of hats, gloves, dresses and even shoes for our accessories in the future! Pimp'up will soon become the essential that every woman will have in her dressing room just like the little black dress or the eternal little pencil skirt.\n",
      "We expect the Pimp'up accessory to be ready for shipment, for Kickstarter orders, in November of this year. For the realization of the collection and the launch of the e-commerce site, we plan a launch in the beginning of december.

A lot of them are ideas that I had sitting around the house for years that I kept kicking at until one day they smiled back and allowed me to write them. They were written all over the United States, from Alaska, to Oregon, to Colorado, to the Chihuahuan and  Sonora Desert to my front porch in Austin TX.  It takes me years to finish a song. I wish they came easier but that doesn't seem to be how it works for me. I'm really excited that I'm able to make a new record and I get to share it with you. I'm recording about fourteen songs and putting the ten that I feel make the album complete on the new record. Of these fourteen, about five of them I co-wrote with some of my long term friends and co-writing partners, Ron Scott, Gregory Alan Isakov, Marc Brenton and new to this  group of writing friends, Robby Hecht. \n",

I have a dream of being able to hire a company that does Press Promotions but that is another $2,500, So I'm just sticking with the $8,000 for now, but it would be amazing if I could get enough pledges to raise $10,500 for press promotions.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "I would definitely say that I was born into a musical family. My dad is a musician who plays a lot of instruments; my mum sings; and my older sister and brother are both very musical. My grandfather's nickname was 'Singer' and my great-grandfather was a multi-instrumentalist too. I guess there’s no escaping it. Music is in my blood.\n",
      "It should have been no surprise then when I quit my studies at Sixth Form and decided instead to pursue a career in music. But it did come as a surprise. Originally, I had intended to finish my A-Levels and then, do the music thing. But “destiny calls.” And sometimes it calls at what you think is a really inconvenient time. However, with enough time passed to look back in retrospect, you can see that it was actually the perfect time. I was born to do this music thing!\n",
      "I’ve been writing songs since I was 9 (let’s just say I’ve had mooore than enough time to get better at songwriting) – and after quitting my studies, I wrote a lot. I was in a sticky situation where I didn’t know how to do the thing I most loved to do and, though it really hurt at times, I’m glad for it or else I wouldn’t have learned a valuable lesson in patience, faith and hope.\n",
      " (\"Change\" - written last month using random words people gave me. Free download at soundcloud!)\n",
      " (\"Usually, I Don't Listen To The News\" - Telephone box performance I did last month for K2.AV. Free download at soundcloud!)\n",
      "(\"Black Hole\" 2012 demo, which will be on the album.)\n",
      "(\"Stumbling Block\" 2012 demo, which will be on the album.)\n",
      "Two thirds of the 12 songs on this album weren’t written during that particular time, but the reason I've put them all on the album is because they share a theme: passivity. The state of being passive. Sometimes it’s a good thing to be passive, to deal with situations peacefully or to take a backseat; being inactive gives you some time to relax and reflect. And at other times it’s not so good to be passive – sometimes you're letting people walk all over you, sometimes you’re just being lazy, and sometimes you're lacking a lot of self-confidence and belief.\n",
      "I have experienced all of these things and so it's no surprise that they have found their way out of my system into songs of their own. That's the beauty of it!\n",
      "These songs have already helped me through some really difficult times; who knows whether they'll end up one day helping you through some of yours? If not, ah well. I hope it's nice to listen to.\n",
      "It really is not hard to make an independent album these days. Affordable technology makes it very doable. But it is hard to make a quality independent album these days for that very same reason.\n",
      "Lack of proper facilities, lack of inspiration, lack of direction and motivation have been obstacles that I’ve been trying and failing to overcome in recent years. Well, I'm now full of inspiration, I now know the direction I'm going in, and you all have been my motivation throughout this time... so I'm thinking, actually, maybe the best way to get these songs out there is with your help.\n",
      "Just the fact that you like and believe in my music alone means the world to me, and whether you pledge, share the project or encourage, your support means the same. The funding will provide studio time and musicians to play on some of the tracks: there will be strings and a little harmonica! It will pay for the album artwork and design, some snaps, packaging, replication and distribution – the physical album comes with a nice booklet including the lyrics, \n",
      "artwork and photos as well as the credits, which will have all of your \n",
      "beautiful names in it! When it’s all done – you get the finished product.\n",
      "In order to do all of this, I need £2,200 – that's £300 for studio time, £400 for the musicians, £250 for the artwork, design and photography, £1000 for the packaging and replication of the CDs, and £250 for the other rewards. But from the overall budget, i.e. the £2,500 or more that is raised, Kickstarter takes 5%, payment processing fees take from 3 to 5%, and then those deductions add VAT. So they'll take around £300 if we reach the funding goal, leaving me with just about the amount I need. If we don't reach the funding goal, you don't pay anything, which is great, but there also won't be an album... which isn't so great. I really hope and believe we will fund this thing!\n",
      "It will only take a few months to complete the project and that’s exactly the reason I’m getting my butt into gear and doing this now. I have no time for dilly-dallying – now is the time to do this. I’m excited! I’m aiming to have an album in your hands and ears by February 2014. Yes, that’s right. I’m setting a release date for February 2014!\n",
      "As well as the album, there are other rewards too (as mentioned), such as access to the UK tour dates (yes, there will be a tour!), access to an online show (which I'll do before the album's release, in December or January), t-shirts with lyrics and artwork printed on them,  you can hire me to come to your house for an acoustic concert, I can use my hand and a pencil and draw a portrait of you… I’m not that terrible an artist. And a few more.\n",
      "For all the rewards including CDs and things I'll be mailing to you, the mailing costs are included in the pledge amount, except for those outside the UK. There may be more pledges for some of the rewards, like the t-shirts and mugs, than I've anticipated and thus calculated into the budget, so if we raise more than the funding goal (which is absolutely possible) that will help to take care of those extra costs!\n",
      "Well, for one thing (as I just mentioned), I'll have more things listed in the rewards to create and fulfil, so the extra funding will take care of that. And if there's enough left over...\n",
      "Basically, I will plough it all into Passivity, in whatever way I can. What I've listed in the budget is just what's necessary to produce the album; there's so much more legwork to be done. I want to take this album further than I'm even able to imagine, so whether I end up playing a tonne of gigs in my hometown or doing a couple shows in another country, I'm going to be far from finished when the album is complete. That's the scary and exciting part.\n",
      "If you have any more suggestions for other rewards and things we could do for Passivity once it's done, I'd love to hear them! I'll be keeping you updated throughout the funding period and (if it's successfully funded!) all throughout the making of this album. Get ready for a lot of videos and a lot of blog posts.\n",
      "As much as I love to create music, and as much as I love to do that by myself, in my room, lost in my own little world inside my own head, I love to talk to people. Music is how I talk to people.\n",
      "If you’re interested at all in what I have to say musically, cool - I'm going to work my absolute hardest to get this music to you. It would be great if you could help me out by sharing this project and spreading the word. Let's do this!\n",

      "\r\n",
      "– As this isn't a do-it-ALL-yourself album and I'll be working with artists, photographers and other musicians, they will have their own schedules too, so, again, there could be slight delays and reschedules here and there. I intend to get everything done before their actual deadlines to minimize the effect of these possible inconveniences.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "– When recording, mixing and mastering are done, and the artwork is complete, I'll be sending the master off to be replicated and printed, and the packaging to be printed with the artwork. There could be some delays in me receiving these CDs before I release the album, which is out of my hands, and it shouldn't delay the release by too much, if at all. However, if it should happen to affect the release, all that means is the album will hopefully be out in March instead of February.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "– I am going to be working leading up to and during the Christmas period, so... needless to say, that could definitely throw a spanner in the works. Again, I aim to skirt around this by trying to complete things before their scheduled deadlines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "– I already know how exceptionally busy I am going to be from the start of this funding period in November, right the way through to February. The portraits I may be drawing for some of you may take a while... but you will get them!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "– I am doing this all independent of a label (I actually think this is a perfect opportunity to start my own), which - though I'm really looking forward to it - means there's a lot of work! I'll be labouring diligently in order to fulfil all the necessary tasks, reach the deadlines and get this album out there. Please be patient with me. Thankfully, I've got a bunch of really talented and supportive friends and family to help me with every aspect of this project, give me great advice and encouragement, and... make sure I get enough sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "– I also cannot overstate how greatly I will need you too. As much as I believe in myself and believe in this album (which is so very much), my belief simply isn't enough - I need yours too. During the funding period, I'll be promoting the campaign and hoping that you'll all jump on board to help spread the word too. But also throughout this whole journey, from here to the very day you get your copies, I'll need your prayers, support and for you to keep me as motivated as you have done in the past. Thank you.\n",

      "I am currently running this Kickstarter due to the success of my first pin. Shortly after I sold the majority of the pins, people started asking \"When are you going to make more?\" Honestly, back then I didn't have an answer... But I do now!\n",
      "This is my first Kickstarter and I will feature 5 of my favorite One Piece waifus as enamel pin designs. Boa Hancock, Nami, Nico Robin, Perona and Shirahoshi. I hope we get to unlock them all! \n",
      "Pledging contributes to the production cost of these pins, and all additional stock left over after backer rewards are fulfilled, will go on my Etsy Shop after the Campaign is over.           \n",
      "By pledging, Backers get a discounted price and freebies. \n",
      "Thank you all for your time and consideration~♥\n",
      "My pin designs is based off of my first pin which featured Nami being captured or sold in a slave auction. (Or, she probably sold herself for some extra Berries!) \n",
      "Reaching the initial goal of $550 would unlock the first pin in 2 variants. There will be 3 variants per pin design, Regular and Glitter Rare and GOLD Raw. If all designs are unlocked/funded, that would make a total of 15 pins available!  \n",

      "September: The campaign ends on 9/14/19. Once it ends, all pledges are collected and cards are charged. Then, I will get the backer reward surveys set up and sent out. \n",
      "PRE-ORDERS: From Sunday, September 16th to Sunday, September 29th Pre-Orders will be available on my Shop. *These will be full price!* Why Pre-order? Because I do not plan to order stock specifically for the store. So if you want a pin(s) at the best price possible, Kickstarter is your safest bet. Then, Pre-orders are your last chance to guarantee a pin(s).\n",
      "October: It will take around 2 weeks for Kickstarter to release the funds raised to me. Once I get the funds, Manufacturer shall be contacted and production will commence. Production usually takes 2-3 weeks with about a week of transit time for the pins to arrive to me after being shipped. \n",

      "Hello film, kitsch and monster fans! I'm Kendra, the gallery manager at Quirks and The Sideshow Gallery. With my bestie (and gallery owner Jenn) we've started designing our own range of pins and brooches and dubbed our brand \"Lipstick and Chrome\"! We have a passion for collecting enamel pins and acrylic brooches, so these are our focus. We know we need the support of like minded and passionate friends to help us on our journey and get the wheels turning.  I had the \"killer\" idea to design a pin collection based on vintage horror movies and pulp classics - you know, that campy stuff! (I'm actually a wimp, so this is as horror as I get.) I reached out to friend Kelly of Kitschy Delish and she helped us whip up these excellent designs. (She is stellar, please check her out on Etsy!) \n",
      "So without any further \"previews\" let's sit down and enjoy the feature presentation.... Lipstick and Chrome Presents STARS OF THE SILVER SCREAM! \n",
      "Once we hit our goal we'll be ready to produce our first two pins! The Vamp is lying in wait to pounce the next man who strays from his path. The coffin lid will swing open to expose this deadly vixen on our final design. Now Dracula is the king of horror movie camp and this collection would not be the same without him. The Kiss of Dracula is our enamel ode to him. One of my favorite things about this collection is we've designed the backing cards to feel like vintage movie posters completing the \"Silver Scream\" vibe. We have a few sparkly ideas for many of the pieces in this collection- we can't wait to show you the prototypes! Starting with your $20 donation you'll be able to add both The Vamp and Dracula pins to your collection. \n",
      "Have time for another flick? We hope so, because we'll unlock King Kong at $750 and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman at $1000. (Should we cross universes and make her \"snack\" wear a red shirt? Shout out to all you Trekkies.) We're also hoping to have enough capitol behind this project to upgrade our King Kong Monster to move up and down the skyscraper. TRICKS- we want to do allllll the TRICKS! \n",
      "The last two stars of this kitschy horror pin collection are Bride of Frankenstein (with glow in the dark hair) and Slasher (victim and knife chained piece). These pieces will unlock at $1250 and $1500 respectively. I might really have a thing for our Psycho inspired Slasher pin, so I hope you're all keen on the Midnight Matinee!  \n",

      "An estimate 2.5% of Canadians eat a vegan diet. A much larger percentage eat some form of vegetarian diet. Prominent animal rights activist Gary Yourofsky says there are 4 main reasons people eat animal food products. One of those reasons is CONVENIENCE. And that's the main focus on this project. While we care a lot about food quality, and providing tasty, nutritious food, we don't aim to be the leader in these areas. Our main goal is simply to try to offset the advantage in convenience that animal-based food products currently have in the marketplace. \n",
      "Vegan Lunch Delivery\n",
      "Our goal is to use technology to make eating at least 1 vegan meal a day really simple, affordable and just plain easy. Our menu will be small but provide enough options that you could eat lunch 5-days a week from it without having the same combination of meals twice. We will provide an online ordering system and delivery within the downtown of Vancouver for maximum convenience. In addition to same-day ordering, we will also offer an order schedule. This will allow our customers for instance to preorder lunches 2-days per week for an entire month. \n",
      "Food Freedom Delivery Food Security\n",
      "VeganCafe.ca is partly about delivering food to vegans. It's also about helping non-vegans make the transition. One way we plan to help in that effort is through our Food Freedom Menu. This menu is a selection of affordable, simple vegan foods which we will distribute for free. A portion of all our sales will go to support this program, and we will also seek volunteers to minimize the costs to support it. We hope to deliver thousands of free vegan meals to people in need of food security throughout Vancouver and in doing that, help educate recipients about eating vegan. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Our first challenge is to find a suitable commissary kitchen to work from. If we had more funding we'd start our own kitchen but as a stepping stone we plan to rent space in an existing kitchen. We have several leads on kitchens already but so far these are all kitchens that have non-vegan food prepared there. While this is an acceptable plan B for us at this time, we would definitely to find a fully vegan kitchen such as partnering with an existing vegan restaurant that does not offer lunch service or has extra space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our second challenge is logistics, setting up our delivery system. We're still determining whether we will hire our own delivery drivers or use a contracted service. We've contacted several existing delivery services and the challenge is most will only deliver orders received through their websites, whereas we plan to take orders off our own website and need those processed for delivery. \n",

      "I am a worship leader, a voice/piano instructor, singer and songwriter and have spent my life performing and preparing others to perform.  \n",
      "I met Producer Brandon Bee several years ago when he was producing an album for my student Holly Starr.  We have been friends since.  Having the chance to work with him now is an incredible experience, a joy.  We have spent 6 months so far working on the album in short bursts as I have had to travel to Utah where his studio has been to record.  \n",
      "It is a labor of love.  The songs we selected for the album come from my life.  There is worship, of course, but there are songs of overcoming grief, illness and yes even anger, songs of nostalgia and songs of hope.  \n",
      "3 times I made the decision to lay this down and stop working on the album.  3 times God used people and circumstances to tell me ~ keep going. I know now that this is what I am supposed to do.  \n",
      "We still have another recording session or two to complete, this time in Seattle WA so I will no longer have to leave my state and have the travel and lodging expenses so much.  Phew! \n",
      "Once the recording is completed it is out of my hands and goes to mixing, mastering and ~ I don't know what all!  I know I still need to get the cd cover artwork &/or photography done and I plan to include a liner in the case to tell some stories for each song.  \n",
      "Brandon says this is not the usual album.  He says I am \"left of center\".  He says this is a \"Concept\" album.  It is life in song.  My life.  The human condition if you will.  I do not write songs for the sake of songs.  I write emotions for the sake of sanity.  It just comes out in songs.\n",
      "We hope to have this completed by the Spring of 2014.  \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "This project has been challenging because working with a great producer has added much travel and schedule juggling resulting in greater expense and less income as time has been given to travel and record.  Once this project is completed I am unclear with how to proceed but I am talking with seasoned recording artists and learning so much about how this differs from my experience as a Live performer only.  I do hope to tour the Pacific Northwest when the album is done and share what I believe God has given me.  I don't know who else needs to hear that life is full of unwelcome events and moments ~ but it does not change who God is and what He has in store for you.  I know He has shown me this.  Suffering is what this world offers.  Thank God this isn't all there is.  That's my message.  You can cry.  Then be glad.  In weakness - He is strong.  In tears - comes joy.  Thank You Jesus.\n",

      "I am making my first album after evolving as an artist for ten years.  I need your help to make it happen and I am excited to take this journey with you as listeners and friends.\n",
      "I've spent my life exploring the world of theatre, artists, education, and music.  In all my wanderings I come across people. People who stimulate each other to connect and to create.  Communities with a palpable desire to grow and revive.  I'm happy to say I've been swept up in it all and find myself surrounded by projects and dreams that truly bring people together through the arts...\n",
      "That said, I seem to have neglected my more solitary art in the process.  A songwriter never stops writing permanently.  Maybe a long dry spell, but the songs are there, lying dormant.  Fans have encouraged me to invest in my own music and make it known to the world, but I couldn't wrap my mind around so much work to serve myself. \n",
      "Then, someone did it for me.  Lis and Lon Williamson of Gatorbone Records swept in and invited me onto their label.  This changed everything. Breathing life into those words reminded me that these songs exist for YOU, the listener.  Once I get it out, my need is met.  It is you, the audience, who then stands to gain from a possible connection with one of songs.  I was humbled and encouraged by my time spent in the studio and I can't wait to share the songs with you all.\n",
      "The album, maiden voyage, is sometimes abstract, sometimes narrative, sometimes soulful, but always autobiographical.  For better or worse, each song is directly inspired by different people in my life. One track, \"Elijah\" is about a people's experience which wove indelible threads in my foundation as a person.  \"Into One\" is spoken to a person with which many of us have had a dialogue.  Others are fictional portrayals of peoples' lives which provoked me to write.  There are love songs, too.  All of it, I suppose, paints a portrait of me as a person.  \n",

We may be counting on a certain musician to add a fiddle or accordian track, and they could have an emergency that would keep them from keeping their recording date.  Would we move ahead, and just lose the musical vision we had for that artist's contribution?  No, probably not.  We would work them into our schedule, and it could cause the record to be released later than we thought.\n",

That is where the collaboration side of this project comes from. I know the value of having varied viewpoints look at a thing.

I may have different documents for commenters but I would prefer to only get negative comments from my contributors, and by negative, I am referring to constructive criticism. While, I do enjoy positive remarks, that can't be used to improve the story because it's a reinforcement of what is already in place. I may have two different documents for this, allowing one to be for showing love and the other one to help shape the story by pointing out grammatical issues or helping me clarify things for you (the reader). Regardless of the level of input, I still plan to bring in an editor.

      "Funding Usage & Backer Rewards:\n",
      "This project will be running through late July (60 days). I plan to upload into KDP after editing. I anticipate sending to an editor in mid July. I realize that overlaps with the run of this project and may be sent in while backers are still commenting on the beta reading but I'm wanting to have a reasonable turn around on the physical rewards. When I upload to KDP, I understand that I will receive a proof copy and then I will suggest or approve that proof. From what I've read, it can take close to 3 weeks for me to receive the physical books that I send then send out as the backer rewards. Additionally, my artists doesn't start on my book cover and concepts until August. I suspect that the eBooks can be sent in late August but the physical things will likely be sent out in September.\n",
      "A large portion of the funding (approx. $4,000+) will go towards editing. Another significant portion will go into the concept art, producing the physical copies, and shipping. As it says in the Tier V reward, I really want to put more into that tier so additional funding will likely be channeled into that.\n",
      "Given that this project is of a collaborative nature, please feel free to make recommendations on the backer rewards. I will consider altering them but once backers have put money into a tier, I can only add to them at that point and won't be able to substitute anything. So if you have a suggestion, it's best to offer those early on.\n",
      "My Progress:\n",
      "This project is about Duality Dissonance and I am in the process of completing its rewrite. This story is capable of standing alone but I also have a continuing storyline that I plan to work on after this one. There are 2 subsequent novels planned, along with an additional story about a supporting character that spans the Duality books. That story is a prequel to Dissonance and is a bit of an origin for that supporting character.\n",
      "I started rewriting Dissonance in Dec of '21. I took a short break for March and I'm now approaching the concluding moments of the novel. This rough rewrite is sitting just over 75,000 words and I will be pushing it over 90,000 before I consider it to be approaching an adequate length. I'm going back and forth between revising, world building, and progressing the closing chapters. It should take me about 2 weeks to push above 90,000 when I'm focusing solely on progressing the late chapters. I know the details of those chapters from the draft so I just have to fill out the rewrite. My projection is based on my work during my last deliberate progression where I progressed 11,000 words over 4 days. I'm not concerned or stalling the progression, I'm just alternating my tasks each week. I progress the rewrite one week, revise early chapters the next, and then focus world building/map making on the 3rd week before revisiting chapter progression again.\n",
      "This is not a new story for me but it will be for you. I initially put this story concept together a few years ago. I stepped away from the draft because I was ill-equipped to convert my imagination into a novel that was approachable for others. I believe I have fixed that though and I'm here to invite you to participate in the finalizing of this project.\n",
      "I don't intend to do frequent progress updates on Kickstarter but I will be making regular ones on my blog. Feel free to check there if you want a more current update. I know that interacting on multiple platforms will bog down my story progress so I may implement a schedule for Kickstarter updates if they get too involved. Maybe once a week? Regardless of the interactions here and on the google documents (backer rewards), I will maintain a higher tempo of updates on the blog.\n",
      "Goals/Intent:\n",
      "This story will happen regardless of this projects performance but I have 2 goals here. Another part of my reasoning for stepping away from my draft was because I felt like this story belonged to more than just this would-be writer. It is my belief that this story will be important to a great many people out there and it is my hope to find some of them here. So my first and primary goal is to establish and reach some of the audience that will be passionate about this story/storyline. I want to find them and I want to include them during the finalizing of this novel. My secondary goal is to fund this project. The majority of the funding will go towards editorial work and the artwork that Thea Magerand will be completing for me. \n",
      "The recommended timeframe for Kickstarter projects is 30 days but I am running this for 60 days due to my primary goal and Thea's timeline. Thea is pretty popular so she won't be working on my project until August. This project will close at the end of July  which will lead into my artist getting to this project. Of course, that means that the art won't be completed when the project ends and I will have to find out a timeframe from Thea. The performance of this project will impact the amount of art that I need from Thea though so I will just have to provide updates as the project goes on.\n",
      "Interactions:\n",
      "There are the obvious interactions within the backer rewards and also your ability to recommend alterations to those rewards but I also have a blog that will facilitate further interaction. I started the blog in May 2022 with the intent of mapping the course of this story.  There, you can find an about me section, get regular updates on story activities and see things regarding my personality and strengths.  I mention the personality/strengths bit now because it is related to where this is all going. Both my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (INFP) and my Strengths Finder 2.0 paint me as something of a bridge builder...and -that- is what this is ultimately about. I'm building a bridge. I want to bridge the gap between Duality Dissonance and the people that it will be meaningful to. If you find meaning here, please feel free to get involved and be a part of it.

      "I've got a new record and I'm this close (hold your thumb and forefinger about half an inch apart) to finishing it. Recording and mastering are done, and this project is to raise money for production and packaging.\n",
      "There Are No Secrets In This Town is 11 songs inspired by an oral history interview of a Terre Haute \"madam.\" The woman was in the business from before Prohibition to the '60s or '70s, and she spoke about so many fascinating characters she had met, as well as about politics, society and other matters. She talked about everything but sex, in fact. As I read it I thought, \"These people would make great songs.\" So I started writing. The songs about love and loss and lust and industrial accidents and vets coming home from the war and there is even a song about shoes.\n",
      "Fred Grittner produced and recorded the album and also performs and sings on it. He took a one-microphone, \"live\"-in-the-room approach and it turned out great. The record also features Karl Burke on bass, Lonnie Knight on guitar, Amy Brockman on harmony vocals, Bob Nordquist on harmonicaand Erik Brandt on accordion. Don Arney in Terre Haute did the mastering. I think we came up with a darn-fine record, and now I want others to hear it.\n",
      "If we make the goal, we'll be producing the record with a two-panel sleeve. Depending on how much over the goal we reach at the end of the 30 days, we may go with a four-panel sleeve, which would allow more room for art. A record sleeve should be arty. Speaking of which, I've already chosen the cover art. It is a great photo by the renown Chicago photographer Art Shay. He shot it while on assignment in Terre Haute for Life Magazine back in 1958. I saw the photo while doing some research for the record and thought it was perfect. I was able to track down Shay (he's 91 now) and his archivist and the three of us negotiated a deal for the use of the photo. I'm pretty excited about it. \n",

I've priced some local and national businesses and have narrowed the choices. I've got a great designer working on the album jacket and I've secured the rights to use a photo by renown photographer Art Shay on the cover. My hope is to keep duplication and production local; I like to keep my money close to home. In short, everyone on the \"team\" knows what they are doing and they've done it before, so the risks are minimal. If we make the goal, we'll have a record.\n",

Read below for details how to donate, the recording process and the prizes you'll get when you contribute. And listen to my new single, \"Familiar Chime\" - The minute I reach my goal I will release another new single, \"Minnesota\" and make both songs downloadable for people who contributed to this project. \n",
      "The Kickstarter campaign for Johnny Lewis' debut album, \"Age\" will fund studio sessions, hiring musicians and pressing the album for the Kickstarter's donors to acquire, enjoy and share with friends and family. Johnny is recording \"Age\" at one of the most renowned studios in Brooklyn, NY - Vinegar Hill Sound - and strives for the highest audio quality to showcase his music and songs. Every contributor will be able to download \"Age\" in its entirety before its physical release date in April. Contributing more funds to the project will include unique gifts such as obtaining the album in Vinyl form, typed lyrics from Johnny Lewis, and also having the opportunity to receive limited prints of original oil paintings by Johnny (see examples below). At the $500 level, donors will receive all of these gifts, including an actual original painting (if they WANT it! )\n",
      "Johnny Lewis' musical background is not that of the ordinary Folk Artist. Stemming from Minneapolis, MN, Johnny moved to Colorado in 2008 to pursue electronic production for a number of touring acts including The Larva Ink, Lizzo, Bokonon and many more. Accepted into the festival community, Lewis opened extensively for national acts such as The Flaming Lips and EOTO. After tirelessly working for his electronic acts, Lewis came to terms with his obsession for acoustic music, which in turn, drove him away from production and into his passion - writing songs. Lewis melds the timeless north-country sound of acoustic guitar with unique lyrics and electronic ambiance, replanting the poetic verse into a timeless songwriting style for a new generation of listeners. Johnny Lewis now resides in New York City where he studies Poetry at The New School. \n",

      " INSPIRATION\n",
      "                    As\n",
      "much as any other painter, J.M.W. Turner inaugurates the modern use of color\n",
      "and composition.  He is arguably as\n",
      "influential as Vermeer was earlier.  His landscapes and seascapes mix montages of terror and\n",
      "delight, pathos and transcendence into single canvases. \n",
      "Moreover, he has always stirred my\n",
      "soul and fired my muse.  Since\n",
      "relocating to Appalachian North Carolina, the thought of doing something\n",
      "simultaneously to honor and reconfigure Turner’s brilliance has become\n",
      "something of an obsession.  \n",
      "I carried my copy of Turner at the Tate with me everywhere,\n",
      "until finally my mother and my husband ganged up on me.  Their challenge: “Do something with\n",
      "this; go to Kickstarter, and plead with the world for help in achieving your\n",
      "vision.”  So here I am.\n",
      "RATIONALE\n",
      "            As\n",
      "one of the first Romantics, Turner quite clearly articulated a defense of\n",
      "nature against the depredations of humanity.  He showed the power and fury that nature, especially the\n",
      "sea, might unleash at any moment. \n",
      "His canvases also depict the interconnections that bind people to each\n",
      "other and to the natural world.\n",
      "            All\n",
      "of these elements of Turner’s approach, two hundred years old, seem apt today,\n",
      "as society’s mastery of the cosmos seems almost complete at the same time that\n",
      "our lives hang on our ability to balance our own needs and pathways with what\n",
      "the universe permits.  Reimaging\n",
      "Turner’s oeuvre thus seemed both aesthetically and philosophically sound.\n",
      "            As\n",
      "well, I had begun to collect beautiful pieces of driftwood, some of which\n",
      "seemed ideal for luscious oils and sweeping compositions.  On my own, intrepid if uncertain, I\n",
      "began to reconfigure Turner at the Tate\n",
      "piece by piece.\n",
      "            Three\n",
      "such panels into the breech, however, I ran out of Prussian Blue.  I’m nearly out of Liquen Lite, two\n",
      "shades of yellow, and several other tubes of paint.  I’m low on paint thinner, and I used my last gesso on the\n",
      "planned fourth Turner panel.  I\n",
      "have obtained ten of the ninety three panels necessary for completion, yet each\n",
      "of these came at a cost of ten dollars or more.\n",
      "While I believe in what I’m doing,\n",
      "and offer the work that I’ve completed as evidence of its validity, I need\n",
      "support—at a minimum what I’ve requested here on KickStarter, to continue with\n",
      "this.  I am praying that others see\n",
      "something of the value in this that I do.\n",
      "PROCESS\n",
      "            Basically,\n",
      "the funds that I seek will pay for all my supplies, all of the ‘canvases’, and\n",
      "then let me hire someone to help with bringing the pieces to market.  I am hopeful that such a consultant can\n",
      "also help me to prepare to do a video about the project and a catalog, but that\n",
      "is after the completion of what I propose here.\n",
      "            Basically,\n",
      "what will happen by the middle of February, after this drive for assistance is\n",
      "successful, is that I will have purchased all of my paints and supplies.  I will also have ordered all of the\n",
      "remaining wood pieces, sanded, finished, and prepped with gesso on one side.  The money to pay for them will be\n",
      "available too, praise be.\n",
      "            Then,\n",
      "beginning on February 15th, each day I will paint exactly one of the\n",
      "remaining ninety images, seven days a week.  By May 15th(it’s a leap year!), therefore, that\n",
      "phase of work will have finished.\n",
      "            At\n",
      "least twice a week, on Sunday morning and Wednesday night—and perhaps more\n",
      "frequently—I will blog about the whole project.  Partially, this anticipates my desire to create a video and\n",
      "catalog presentation later; in part, though, it also serves to keep my supporters\n",
      "in the loop about my progress, trials and triumphs, and so forth.\n",
      "            I\n",
      "also intend to do at least one brief video while I’m in the thick of\n",
      "things.  I can’t promise this, but\n",
      "it is my intention; I’m pretty good about keeping my word to myself.  We’ll see.\n",
      "            Finally\n",
      "at the beginning of May, I will tap my Atlanta and WNC networks to find someone\n",
      "appropriate to help me with marketing and presentation. I already have several\n",
      "leads in this regard. For the most part, this will culminate the project. \n",

      "creators in the aftermath; the video will help me with this.  Artists need to find a way to express\n",
      "their power in ways that go beyond craftiness and beauty, or at least, that’s\n",
      "my sense of things.\n",
      "            Similarly,\n",

      "produce a catalog of the work that both presents the images in another medium\n",

      "In the new supernatural thriller Lazy Susan, a new horror icon will be born. Susan is an evil twin like no other. And we want you to be part of her cinematic legacy.\n",
      "But first:\n",
      "1. Why am I qualified to make the next great horror film?\n",
      "This past year, I've had the pleasure of sharing past projects in a documentary called HEART ATTACK: The Early Pulse Pounding Cinema of Kelly Hughes. It played at film festivals in London and Portugal. \n",
      "But it was at a screening at the Thin Line Film Fest in Denton, TX where I met two of the future stars of Lazy Susan. Local filmmaker and actor Chad Withers introduced me to Rubber Gloves Rehearsal Studios. It's a bar/nightclub that features Denton's most cutting-edge bands. And that night he was filming a nu-millennial punk rock band called DEEP Throat. And their lead singer, Taylor Kimbrough, was so electrifying, I knew I had to come out of retirement and create a new project to showcase her intensity.\n",
      "2. Why the obsession with evil twins?\n",
      "The idea for Lazy Susan came from my love of evil twins. And movies like David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers where one actor plays both twins. Years ago, I created a twins episode for my TV show Heart Attack Theatre. And the episode was called Sisters. It involved a psychic nun and her adulterous twin sister. And it was the first time I attempted to film an actress playing a scene with herself, using a stand-in to make it look like two distinct characters. I had such a good time with it. And have always wanted to do a similar effect on a bigger level. So this is my chance with Lazy Susan.\n",
      "3. How did we get such a great cast?\n",
      "Fate!\n",
      "4. I love horror movies. Will I get a copy of Lazy Susan when it's completed?\n",
      "Of course! Most of the donation options include a copy of the movie as a reward. So choose one of those, and you're good to go!\n",
      "5. How will you spend my donation?\n",
      "We will put the money into audio and visual gear to give us the best production values possible. And will run a tight ship to make sure we finish on schedule, and create a special piece of cinema that everyone is proud to call their own!\n",
      "6. How do I donate?\n",
      "Ready to give us a pledge, and call yourself a Movie Investor? All it take is a few clicks. We would love for you to join the team, and be part of the Lazy Susan experience. \n",
      "Just choose your donation amount in the column on the right, and it will walk you through the process ------>\n",
      ":)\n",
      "We really appreciate your support. And can't wait to share Susan with you when we're done.\n",

      "Every time I fly into a reasonably large city at night I try to get a window seat. If it's a clear enough night I watch the view as we land. At first it looks like a nervous system. Clumps of lights connected by thin strands. As you get closer to the ground you start to see other shapes take form against an inky black backdrop. I have often thought about making paintings of this experience, and now I am. \n",
      "I will be doing a series of paintings in all sizes based on this vision. In addition this will be my first series to have limited edition prints. I plan to have some sort of show of the paintings at some point, but before I can set that up I need to have some paintings to show. Right now I just have a few small ones, and the large two panel painting above that I made last year and have already sold.\n",
      "This is where the backers come in. I started out doing miniature paintings, which doesn't require a lot of space or a lot by the way of supplies. I have also recently decided to take on painting on a more full time basis, and have made the necessary adjustments to my day job hours to make this possible. \n",
      "Part of the funding will be used for adequate lighting for my studio. Right now I can only paint by the window during the day. I am also in sore need of some new, larger, brushes, a larger portfolio to transport paintings, and if possible a better easel that will not fall over with a stiff breeze. There will be a significant outlay for scanning and printing service for the limited editions. Lastly part of the money raised will be used for basic business expenses such as establishing a website, accounting software, business cards, and promotional post cards. \n",
      "What you should know as a backer: All limited edition prints will be cut to bleed (no white border), signed and numbered. The actual number of each edition will depend in part on the number of backers in each level. All original paintings will arrive on a gallery wrapped canvas, with matte varnish, and wired ready to hang on your wall. All backers, regardless of donation level, will receive one each of any promotional post cards that are produced for this series. As soon as I have any sort of show, open house, or reception lined up I will add an update with all pertinent information and invite each backer personally. \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "I wrote Dwarfhammer because I wanted to write a book that would inspire my daughters and give young men a chance to think about what respect means - without being told how to think. I work with offenders in prisons and I am challenged when I hear the same justifications that they use for their crimes against women being repeated by men, often otherwise good men, on the outside. We need stories to deal with men's violence because, as I discovered when one man offered to knock me out in a pub, just telling men that they are sexist doesn't work. Stories help us to understand other people and their struggles and to know what it means to be a victim. Stories also give us hope and the courage to push on against overwhelming odds. Now, more than ever, we need to change the stories we tell ourselves. \n",
      "So, want to know what the book is about? Three young dwarves are cast out of their village and must embark on an epic journey to reclaim the Dwarfhammer, stop an invading horde and somehow not carve each other to pieces along the way. Tolly is fierce and deadly, but can she discover the wild talent that is within her? Luki, her twin brother, creates chaos wherever he goes but will he survive to tell his story? Arnfel, the proud son of the murdered Chief, must recover the Dwarfhammer - the ancient relic of his clan - and unite the dwarves before it is too late. Old and young, male and female, outsiders and purebloods - all must find a way to overcome old prejudices or be crushed by the coming war.\n",
      "At last I have written the novel, the next step is to get it published and I feel that this might be the biggest challenge of all. I want to give the book the best chance it can get and for that I need to get the novel professionally edited, commission artwork and create a website. Dwarfhammer is to be edited in October, the artwork completed in November and the final pitch to publishers finalised in December.\n",
      "I have chosen good people to edit and illustrate and this costs money. The editing is $A780 and the artwork is $A500+. My Kickstarter budget is $A800 to get the project off the ground.\n",
      "You can join the campaign to have Dwarfhammer published by chipping in for the artwork. We need the images of Tolly, Luki and Arn to fill the front cover of the book and to inspire the website. What will these three feisty young dwarves look like?\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Getting published is extremely competitive - let's face it, even JK Rowling had a struggle to publish her first book on the shelf. Awesome artwork will help Dwarfhammer stand out as a quality novel.\n",

      "Ephie & Celia Risho invite you to join them on an epic journey with their first young-adult novel Phoenix Rising, book one of The Elementalists series. The father/daughter team have worked 2 1/2 years through numerous revisions to bring this adventure to life. With the critical eyes of writers’ groups, editors, artists and a supportive family they are excited to welcome you on this journey.\n",
      "A strange creature attacks Amber’s village and burns one of the fields. Amber bravely goes on a quest to find the creature and learn how to stop it. But the journey turns out to be far more important than she ever imagined. \n",
      "This book is not only a good story about heroism, it’s a great way to support young authors and readers. This platform for releasing the book is our chance to get the book into your hands where the normal publishing world has so many roadblocks. We were able to work with the kinds of artists we wanted to, and bring exactly the right kind of story at the right time. \n",
      "And we are so grateful for your interest! With you, this story becomes a shared experience we can all appreciate. As we continue to bring future books in the series to you, we can all journey together!   \n",
      "It all started when Celia started reading voraciously and said to me one evening, “Dad, we should write a book together!” It turned out she had lots of ideas, and they quickly took shape.\n",
      "At our bedtime routines she’d say, “Dad! Did you write the next chapter yet?” To which I would be thrilled if I’d made the time the night before or in between things to eke it out. As I read to her she'd correct words or ideas. “Not like that, Dad, like this!” She made it funnier and the characters more colorful.\n",
      "I recently looked back at the notes from our first brainstorming session and laughed. The story has some of the core ideas from that time, but took a completely different arc in the end, with many layers, intrigue, and the potential for at least five books in the series.\n",
      "After sharing it out with numerous family and friends and seeing the story grow, we took it to a writer's group. Every step it became a better book. In the summer of 2019 we found our editor, Ann Castro. Little did we know, Ann would guide us in transforming our book from its simple form into a work of art!\n",
      "The editing process was tough for Celia, since she was less involved, so we focused on book two. Editing book one while simultaneously writing book two turned out to be a lot of work — late nights, early mornings, writing on an iPad on business trips 20,000 feet above the continent. Now, we're finally ready to release book one to all of you!\n",
      "This has been one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done in my life, and we haven’t even published it yet! I’m excited to share these books with all of you. I see them not just as good stories, but a glimpse into what’s possible. As the characters have come to life, I've related to each one of them, and they've become like friends.\n",
      "I admit that there was a time or two when I used the characters’ bravery as examples when parenting Celia. “Do you really think that’s a good choice? What do you think Amber would do in this situation?” LOL. I feel guilty now writing this down — using a fictional character as an example. But that’s the power of a good story, isn’t it? It should change our lives. It’s certainly changed ours. 😉  \n",
      "Ephie (dad) has been writing his whole life, inspired by his sixth grade teacher to write a story every week. He enrolled in the writing program at his undergrad Middlebury College and has been writing ever since. He loves the outdoors, music, community, his family and telling stories. He’s lived in Vermont, British Columbia, Costa Rica, and at the time of writing this book, beautiful Bozeman, Montana where he works in software development.\n",
      "Celia (daughter) is an avid book lover, and packs a novel with her wherever she goes. She developed the book idea at age nine inspired by a writing assignment. She was born in Vancouver, Canada where her first two syllable word was “hockey”! She and her brother are being raised in the mountains of Montana, where she enjoys sewing, 4H, performance art, and visiting hot springs. At the time of this writing, not only are five books in this series planned, a whole new series is partially formed in her mind! \n",
      "Choosing self-publishing has allowed us to work with the artists and editor who we’ve selected, and to release our book in the way we want — straight to you! It also has with it our own share of taking on the costs. We’re hoping this Kickstarter will take the edge off of some of what we’ve put into it, as well as cover the costs of buying copies to autograph. \n",
      "In addition to printing costs and shipping, the other costs have totaled about $6,000, including:\n",
      "Thank you for supporting an amazing story about heroism, and the young authors and readers of this book. We are sincerely grateful for your interest! With you, this story becomes a shared experience we can all appreciate. \n",
      "We would be so grateful if you would share this with your friends. The only way we can continue writing sustainably is if these books are well-read. \n",
      "We invite you to join us on this journey! We’ll be providing blog-style updates which you can sign up for at theelementalists.net. Until then...   \n",
      "And a little laugh ...\n",

      "Since this is our first book, there are still some unknowns that might delay the publishing of the book. We do plan on having all things sorted and the book published up to Amazon within 30 days of launch, and we’ll do our darndest to make sure that happens. If we are delayed for sickness or other circumstances we’ll let everyone know. We’re in the last stages and the finish line is in sight!\n",

Clueless, and nervous, I got home and leafed through my children's encyclopaedia to discover more. 20 years on, I am still fascinated by this graceful, harmless dinosaur of the sea and have spent many a summer in search for more sightings (with many successful trips). Now in 2014 the species is on the conservation vulnerable list, I need to increase awareness of its plight and kick start a project that can help protect it.

      "Kickstarter is a global platform, which could mean potentially reaching new readers. What Kickstarter does is offer a chance to be seen by not only friends, family, and existing readers, but the world. \n",

      "Amazon has become one of the best channels for my book in recent months, but, in all honesty, they get over half the money. Which is fine, because they're a massive international network. But it also means I typically make less than a dollar a book. (Not complaining, I set the margin really low so it's affordable!) Kickstarter only take a small percentage, so it means I can sell the books for cheaper, and make hopefully more than $1 per book!\n",

I compiled a preliminary four weeks' worth of self-love challenges and sent it into the world to have it reviewed by therapists, life coaches, and other women and teenage girls. I wanted this program to truly make a difference for women and girls on their self-love journeys. I sent out developmental programs to friends/volunteers. I collected feedback, adjusted, and sent it out again. Finally after nearly a year of adjusting and sourcing this is our Program.\n",

      "Why do we need your help here on Kickstarter? Our program consists of a combination of products, packaging materials, and printing. When ordered separately or in small quantities Crownby becomes quite expensive. By ordering in bulk we lower the cost of our program significantly for our Queens.  We need your help to fund our first bulk order.\n",

      "1) Timing. We have knowingly planned in extra time to complete your order because we import products from overseas.

      "THE STORY\n",
      "In the distant future, the gods have judged humanity, stripping them of their sapience. With humanity's forbidden knowledge locked away, many of the earth's beasts have risen with their own cultures and myths.\n",
      "Far to the north, in the great Greentide Forest, rests the remote village of Dreymoot. The squirrels of Dreymoot have been story-keepers for centuries, content to live vicariously through the gathered lore of the great continent. \n",
      "Yet one squirrel longs to leave his cloistered existence. To experience the magic and mystery that lies beyond the safety of the forest.\n",
      "Join Hackberry as he journeys far from his home, driven to seek his long-lost father, and caught up in a struggle for power that will shape the future of his world. \n",
      "SOME BACKGROUND INFO\n",
      "I've written several books in the past: some nonfiction books on spirituality and politics as well as one children's book called A Wolf at the Gate that was critically well received (and a lot of fun to write). \n",
      "I wrote A Wolf at the Gate for my son, Jonas. Back in those years, he was a cuddly little tyke. At bedtime, he'd nestle into my shoulder as I'd tell him stories. Sometimes, I'd read them. But often, I'd share stories of my own devising. \n",
      "Many of those stories featured a bold squirrel named Hackberry. As Jonas aged, the stories developed and deepened. Soon, the stories would wander away from our bedtime ritual and haunt my waking thoughts. Often, I'd find myself lost in imagination, thinking of Hackberry's world and the numerous characters who inhabit it. \n",
      "Now that Jonas is nearly twelve, I've decided that now is the time to finish my first Hackberry novel. I'm writing it for Jonas and older children everywhere—for those entering young adulthood in uncertain times. \n",
      "One might think that stories about talking animals would be geared towards little children. But anyone who has ever read Watership Down knows better. Over the years, the adventures of Hackberry have become more complex and dark. No longer quaint stories for a cuddly kindergartner, these are stories that speak to the challenges of our own world.\n",
      "The best of fantasy (especially young adult fantasy) not only helps us escape into an imaginary world, but equips us to be clever and brave in our own. And that requires a level of honesty about the world that, ironically, can rarely be found outside of fiction. \n",
      "ANTICIPATED BOOK LENGTH\n",
      "This will end up around 250-300 pages long (55,000 to 67,000 words). If everything goes well with the book, it will be the first of a series of a minimum of four book. \n",
      "INFLUENCES\n",
      "In a review of A Wolf at the Gate, Kirkus said that I write with \"sharp, muscular prose.\" Stylistically, that would put me in the company of writers like Melville, McCarthy, and Hemingway. It is true: I try to use words economically. I want to to paint pictures with action and context rather than furnishing my books with long descriptions. \n",
      "As a writer, though, I focus more on story than craft. A good story adequately written sticks with me far longer than an adequate story written well. In this particular case, the tales of Hackberry are heavily influenced by Walter M. Miller Jr's A Canticle for Leibowitz, Richard Adams' Watership Down, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books, and Norse mythology. I am also influenced by Tolkien and Lewis, sometimes in spite of myself. \n",
      "WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO? \n",
      "We did it! The project is funded.\n",
      "In the past 24 hours, I've been bombarded with support for this project. To keep the momentum going, I've added some stretch goals. This will give you a sense of what any money above and beyond the initial goal would go towards. \n",
      "What's a stretch goal?\n",
      "From Kickstarter's FAQ: \"A stretch goal is a funding target set by the project creator beyond the original Kickstarter goal. Stretch goals as a term and a practice emerged from the Kickstarter community as a way for creators to 'stretch' beyond the initial, official goal of the Kickstarter project and raise more money (and often make cooler stuff!). Funds are collected whether stretch goals are met or not, as long as the project has met its Kickstarter funding goal.\"\n",
      "More money means that I can get better design help, offer a higher-quality printing of the book, and offer cooler rewards to backers. So, if you'd like to make the book even better, here are some new stretch goals:\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "At this point, most of the writing remains to be done. So it is possible that something could happen to prevent me from finishing the book. However, I've budgeted nearly 18 months for writing and have written several books in the past. I'm confident things will go according to plan.\n",

      "I could use your favorite colors or subjects in the painting or make it a surprise, whatever you like.   The price of the postage is included in the pledge. Here is a link to my Tumblr account. I've posted hundreds of paintings and other artworks on there as to give you a better idea of my style. Acrylics are my strong point so I use them for most of my work.  \n",
      " On a side note, if successful, this campaign will also allow me the time to keep creating a series of art videos which I've titled \"Arting with Jim\" . The link goes to episode 1 which is about colorblindness. I hope to expand the series to include fun projects that people can do at home very inexpensively and sharing tips and tricks I've learned about working with different materials.

      "everyone should smell like meat!\n",
      "We firmly believe that the aroma of freshly cooked bacon should linger long after breakfast and that meaty and clean go hand in hand. That's how we arrived at Meat Soap. By using animal byproducts that are typically discarded as main ingredients in bars of soap, we are looking to change minds about what \"clean\" means. A variety of fats will be rendered by our crack team of fat melters to create a rainbow of colors, scents, and flavors (but don't eat Meat Soap, no matter how tempting!)\n",
      "Our plan is to design and fabricate a custom soap mold to produce our collection of butcher paper-wrapped soaps. We hope to spark a lively debate about personal hygiene and meat consumption, while resurrecting the tradition of using animal-based resources to their fullest potential. We think clean people should smell like bacon, not like mint or roses.\n",
      "We must raise enough money to pay to for a set of soap molds from a custom mold producer out of Portland, Oregon. Once we hit our funding target we'll procure the molds, melt some fat, and develop our bars of soap. Producing the custom molds will cost a minimum of $500, so the more bars of soap people request, the lower the cost of the soap! We'll order the raw materials for our soap (assorted meat fat to render and glycerin soap base) and we'll manufacture enough soap to keep you lathered in protein! Then we'll lovingly wrap each bar with butcher paper and send it to you! Don't mind the grease stains, they add character!\n",
      "FAQ\n",
      "Is it safe?\n",
      "Er... probably? Meat Soap has not been tested on animals but we've been washing our hands with our prototypes. Since Meat Soap contains no preservatives it won't last forever, and for the love of Mike DO NOT TRY TO EAT IT NO MATTER HOW DELICIOUS IT SMELLS.\n",
      "What's with the stickers?\n",
      "We want you to stick our cute piggy logo on everything. We're looking at making them scratch n' sniff to smell like bacon if possible, but otherwise they'll be awesome vinyl stickers for you to treasure!\n",

      "What happens if you don't get funded?\n",
      "Then your pledge will not be charged and Meat Soap will fade into a tragic cloud of obscurity and darkness forever.\n",
      "What if I'm a Vegetarian?\n",

      "It's my belief that stay at home fathers are underrepresented in current film and television. So I decided to do something about it and wrote a feature length screenplay called SURPRISE DIVORCE.\n",
      "I'm raising funds to attend the Catalina Film Festival, September 27-October 1st. It's the ideal opportunity to network with industry executives and hopefully connect with and sell my screenplay. Festival attendance and networking are the next necessary steps to successfully sell this screenplay.\n",
      "Several years ago I was complaining to my late father that I was not able to attend a Festival for Acting. My dad recommended raising funds on Kickstarter, and I poo poo'd it. He believed I had plenty of friends who would help when and where I need it. So I'm finally taking his sage advice and reaching out.\n",
      "Surprise Divorce is a story of a stay at home father/husband (Kevin) caught off guard by his wife’s (Anne) desire to end their lengthy marriage. Kevin is forced to confront divorce from the perspective of a traditional “housewife”. Having no job or preparation to step into “the real world” the screenplay follows him as he gets back on his feet, works through his pain and comes out the other side. Using therapy, laughter, and tears he makes his way through the modern world’s new sexual politics. Politics that still view a stay at home father’s work as not a real job. Surprise Divorce examines love, family, and divorce in a modern world that is slow to adapt to its new realities.\n",

      "With the famous fossil hunter Roy Chapman Andrews as inspiration, I too have had several different jobs at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, from administration to diorama painter to janitor!\n",
      "For the past 3 years I have traveled to Marfa, Texas, where I have shown my paintings and drawings at Eugene Binder Gallery. My current jackrabbit paintings are collectively titled \"No Man’s Land.\" This work is influenced by the Southwest and rooted in the natural history of animals that exist in large numbers, with consideration of the unknowable nature of the animals’ instinctual motives within their environment. Throughout my time working on these paintings, I’ve started to consider the prehistory of environment and organism and the awesome improbable questions of our unknown future. My diorama projects and a recent trip to the South African Bushveld (a similar environment to Southwest Texas) have inspired me to look back, and learn more about the geology of the Permian Basin area.\n",
      "The Concept: A Collage of Past and Present\n",
      "During the Permian period shallow seas covered much of what is dry land in present-day Southwest Texas millions of years ago. Referencing a 1960’s diorama of the Permian Sea from the American Museum of Natural History along with a diorama from the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland, TX, an invented landscape will be fabricated in the back of a cargo trailer. This artwork installation will be what I call a “portable landscape” and the first in the series. My goal is to connect the ancient to the present environment with the people living in Marfa, Texas, and the surrounding area, and call forth the primordial sense one feels while traveling through this land.\n",
      "The Construction:\n",
      "The overall structure will be a standard 6ft x 10ft cargo trailer centered in the gallery. Like looking through the viewfinder of a camera, a window will be cut into the side exposing an intimate underwater scene diorama. A painted ultramarine blue-green background, a three-dimensional foreground with objects and a proscenium will be constructed inside the trailer creating an ancient oasis, and offer sun-drenched viewers refuge as well as a look into the past.\n",
      "The seabed landscape will be barren incorporating a variety of casted and real fossils including brachiopods collected in the area. Today, these fossils continue to lie buried underground waiting to be discovered and maybe even owned!\n",
      "The Catalogue:\n",
      "The deep Southwest is often associated with journey, distance and space, survival and dehydration, borders and ownership, roadside Americana, aliens, religion, fossil hunting, crude oil, cattle ranches, freedom and exploration. An artist catalogue titled “Field Companion” will accompany the work and illustrate a behind-the-scenes look at the artist’s “idea-prospecting” with the intent to arouse the nostalgic and sometimes possessive powers that these ideas can evoke in people.\n",

Once America's industrial backbone, the Rust Belt now features deserted factories and depressed local economies. Beginning in the 1970s, this former manufacturing powerhouse experienced severe, and in some areas crippling, economic decline. Many jobs moved to lower-wage areas of the US, to Mexico, and overseas. The exodus left Rust Belt cities littered with empty factories.\n",
      "I will be painting and drawing every day as I ride my way from my hometown in Madison, WI, through the Rust Belt, to New York City. I am biking and camping my way through this area to keep my costs low…and also because I like biking. Like many of the people in the areas I will be traveling through, I don’t currently have many liquid assets, so I need some help to get this ball rolling. I will need to pay for painting and drawing supplies, the shipping costs for mailing my paintings as I finish them, the cost of the book-binding materials, and the occasional meal. In essence, by contributing to my project, you are pre-paying for a piece of art that I will complete in the course of my journey. By ordering a drawing or painting or book or another contribution incentive you can help make my Rust Belt art project possible. Thank you!\n",

I ended up doodling this design on a napkin and several weeks later I finalized 6 Game of Thrones Ferret designs!!\n",

      "Hello! My name is Brandon Horvath and I am a freelance graphic designer. As an independent designer and fan of enamel pins I have designed a variety of work featuring my own original concepts, some of which have been shared here on Kickstarter! I am excited to once again share a unique collection of enamel pins that with your help, we will together be able to take from concept to reality! \n",
      "Allow me to introduce to you the “Festival of Deities: Enamel Pin Collection”. \n",
      "The world is full of legendary tales and mythical facts, stories of colossal deities and celestial beings are told to inspire as well as celebrate these respective guardians over humanity. This enamel pin collection is based off of one such tale of the Cardinal Animal Deities of ancient mythos, themed around a festival of which they are the guests of honor. \n",
      "The celestial beings known as Byakko the Tiger, Suzaku the Phoenix, Seiryū the Azure Dragon, Genbu the Tortoise, and Kōryū the Golden Dragon are the cardinal deities of whom this Kickstarter is about, a design for each cardinal deity has been created in the form of a festival kabuki mask, much like you would see worn by attendees and displayed in booths during said festivals celebrated in Japan, except these are no ordinary masks displayed for all to see. These masks have been created in the likeness of the cardinal deities so that those attending this cardinal festival can show their support for their own chosen guardian. \n",
      "If the Kickstarter reaches it's main goal the mask of the tiger Byakko will be unlocked! Each cardinal deity after Byakko has their own stretch goal and will be selectable as a backer reward upon reaching their respective goal's!\n",
      "                                      Goal 1: Byakko Mask Enamel Pin (Fully Funded!)  \n",
      "Byakko the Tiger and Guardian of the West is the first design that has been unlocked through the funding of the base Kickstarter goal!\n",

      "First and foremost, this is going to be a blast. There will be music, galleries, screenings, drinks, good company... all that jazz. But the cause is important too: we artists go through hell and back to make our visions come to life. And we don't do it for the money. In fact, it often costs a lot more than we make to create our masterpieces. What makes it worth it? You.\n",
      "Your support, recognition and appreciation helps us keep doing what we're doing.\n",
      "It started with a music video-- one that we put time, money and tireless effort into. And now, we think it deserves an audience. But finding one is not as easy as you might think.   \n",
      "When Scott Schaafsma of the Kerosene Stars got in contact with Eden Ames, writer/director/co-producer of the \"Talk Talk\" music video, an ambitious vision was born. A strongly aesthetic storyline featuring a Jekyll/Hyde femme fatale preying on a suspicious detective snowballed into the live action/animated hybrid it is now-- but it didn't stop there. After all, making the video is only half the work. The rest is getting it seen.    \n",
      "This is where we recognized an opportunity to not only fund an expensive vision, but also to gain an audience for it. This is where the idea of an independent arts showcase began.\n",
      "We're not the only ones who deserve some exposure, though. There are so many artists, musicians and filmmakers out there who are putting their heart and soul into their work. These are talented people, people with passion and determination. But sometimes, even that isn't enough to earn recognition or even a paycheck in the highly competitive world of art.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "At this point, we've overcome the biggest risks and challenges in terms of production. What we're up against now is getting a crowd out to this awesome event. But we're hard at work at not only making this thing as awesome as it can be, but also getting the word out as much as we possibly can. With the aggregated promotional power of all our featured artists, we think we can do it. But... if that doesn't work, know that we're on top of our marketing game and are milking every possible outlet to boost attendance from MeetUp groups to radio shout outs and even the traditional bulletins.\n",

      "The Charlie Awards Film Festival was founded by Teacher, Wayne McNanny in 1972 and is possibly the oldest student film festival in Canada. The Charlie Awards is a film competition for high school students in the KW region that helps students to discover their creative potential, build their confidence, develop leadership skills, and work collaboratively in teams. Students film everywhere and anywhere, developing a variety of story lines and plots to create dynamic, innovative productions. At the school site the student's films are assessed by a panel of judges. Two films from each school are submitted, previewed by judges and premiered to the public. This year, the films will be presented on April 28, 2016, 7:00 p.m. at the Princess Theatre in Waterloo. The Charlies are judged by media professionals who donate their time to work with the best of the K-W region's young film makers. They help our students improve their filmmaking abilities; they provide editing and production advice and consult on solutions to problems. This year is the 45th Anniversary of The Charlies Awards Film Festival.\n",

I would absolutely love to be able to move up to the next level, which includes such equipment like CCD Astronomic Cameras, Solar Filters, H-Band Filters, an EQ3 Telescope Mount (A mount that tracks the sky, making long exposure images possible) and other general Photographic tools. As of yet it's impossible for me to fund this myself, so I turn to the internet to help me in my time of need. I hope this idea captures the publics interest, I will be sending my images out to pledgers who helped me on my mission. People who pledge larger amounts can instruct me on what to image.. and those who pledge even more will not only receive the images I take & process, but will receive framed photographs, to hang around your home, images you can choose, with frames you can choose.. Basically whatever I can do to make this worth your while, I really hope to hear from some of you guys soon.Thank you so much for reading.. \n",

      "What Is Cinema on the Edge? \n",
      "We are celebrating the vibrancy, resilience, creativity and courage of the Beijing Independent Film Festival (BIFF) by organizing the first ever \"Cinema on the Edge\" film series. \n",
      "The 2014 edition of BIFF was not allowed to happen. Organizers were detained, screenings rooms were barricaded, filmmakers and festival-goers were harassed and intimidated. With the full cooperation of BIFF, we plan to bring a version of their festival to New York City this August and September.\n",
      "The films shown at BIFF consistently blow our minds - they inspire and challenge us. They've shaped us to be better filmmakers, critics, producers, distributors, curators, educators, even better human beings. Our hope is to introduce audiences to the films we love by showing them at some of NYC's best museums and cinemas. \n",
      "Films in the series include:\n",
      "Who are We? \n",
      "We are producer/distributor Karin Chien, critic/curator Shelly Kraicer, and filmmaker/anthropologist J.P. Sniadecki. We met and became friends in Beijing, while studying, programming, distributing, writing about, co-producing, or co-directing Chinese independent film. We connected over our love of cinema. And we might not be friends without BIFF. J.P. and Karin connected while sharing a long cab ride to the artist village of Songzhuang where BIFF is held. Shelly and Karin bonded over meals while evading harassment by authorities trying to shut down screenings at BIFF.\n",
      "Here is J.P. talking about how BIFF affected him: \n",
      "“My first time there, I felt I had found my tribe: filmmakers, cinephiles, artists, scholars, and students gathering together to dive into a week of screenings, discussions, dinners, parties, music performances and, inevitably, various encounters with the authorities. Yet BIFF remains a grassroots affair: everyone pitches in and interactions flow easily. Our series is trying to keep that ethos alive.”\n",
      "Here is a picture of J.P. doing a Q&A at BIFF 2012, which screened several of his films in a special program.\n",
      "Here's Karin, Shelly, and Shelly's partner Lisa meeting with Xu Tong, director of Cut Out The Eyes. We're in Trainspotting Cafe, a pioneering venue for independent film in Beijing. Their screenings were shut down too.\n",
      "Combined, we have over 50 years of experience making and screening films. BIFF has played a significant role in shaping our professional destinies, and some of our work would not be possible without BIFF. For example, thanks in part to BIFF, Karin co-founded the only distribution company in North America dedicated to releasing independent cinema from mainland China. Also thanks in part to BIFF, Shelly has been a trailblazer bringing Chinese cinema to several Western film festivals, including Rotterdam, Dubai and Vancouver, and has been able to write extensively about Chinese independent cinema. And J.P started a screening series at Harvard to showcase Chinese independent cinema, as well as write his dissertation on Chinese documentary and direct several films in China, including People's Park and Yumen, both showing in this series.\n",
      "This festival has changed our lives, its films have inspired us, and its community has embraced us. This series is a small way for us to support them in turn.\n",
      "Why We Are Doing It\n",
      "Independent films are not allowed to be screened publicly in China. These films are made without approval of the censors and cannot be seen in regular movie theaters. Independent film festivals offer a singular space in China for unauthorized filmmakers to meet with their audiences, and to sustain a concrete, vibrant, alternative Chinese filmmaking community. \n",
      "China's break-neck pace of change has created a class of independent filmmakers who are inventing radical new film languages. It is one of the most exciting places for independent cinema in the world.\n",
      "It's not the same as being there, but here are a few photos to give you a sense of BIFF. Imagine the incredible camaraderie, tight sense of community, excitement around new work, nervous tension about authorities showing up unannounced and you'll have a sense of what it was like to attend BIFF. \n",
      "Since 2012, independent film festivals have been under siege. All have been confronted with government opposition and interference. \n",
      "All but one or two have ceased to exist.\n",
      "All this may be hard to imagine in North America, where you can find film festivals every day of the year showcasing thousands of independent films.\n",
      "Since 2004, the Beijing Independent Film Festival (BIFF) has been the most important venue for unauthorized films in China. Set in the artist village of Songzhuang, BIFF was a rare space where freedom of expression flourished. But in 2014, BIFF was forced to cancel its festival following aggressive police action and physical intimidation.\n",
      "The films in BIFF 2014 were never shown. But they must be seen. With the full cooperation of BIFF, we are organizing a version of the festival in North America. We call the series: Cinema on the Edge: the Best of the Beijing Independent Film Festival 2012-2015.\n",
      "How We Are Doing it\n",
      "After BIFF was shut down in August 2014, our friend/colleague Kevin Lee, while discussing the situation with Karin, mused out loud, \"I wish we could recreate the festival here somehow.\" A year later, we're making that happen. We called our friends and colleagues, those interested in showing risky and groundbreaking cinema. We asked if they wanted to premiere films that couldn't be screened in China. The bold programmers of Anthology Film Archives, Asia Society, Maysles Cinema, Museum of Chinese in America, and UnionDocs said YES.\n",
      "We've scheduled 18 programs of enthralling, provocative, and brilliant films at 5 of NYC's best museums and cinemas. We can't wait for you to see them.\n",
      "But wait. We still need your help!\n",
      "What YOU CAN DO\n",
      "This is a 100% volunteer effort. We need money to bring Chinese filmmakers to the screenings in NYC, and to publish a one-of-a-kind program booklet for the series. Without dialogue and discussing, the screenings are not complete. \n",
      "Your participation will go directly to these 2 much needed items: \n",
      "1. Travel for filmmakers and festival organizers to NYC. This is 80% of our budget. Flights, hotel, and ground transportation to NYC are not cheap! If you've attended a film festival in the past, you know that Q&As and filmmaker talks are what make the screenings special. If funded, we'll be able to fly directors in to attend their screenings. Creating dialogue between filmmakers and audience is a critical part of the festival experience, and one that these filmmakers are often denied in China.\n",
      "2. Publishing a program booklet to accompany the screenings. We cannot bring every filmmaker to the U.S. A few aren't allowed to travel either. This booklet enables us to include their voices in Cinema on the Edge. We have original quotes from the filmmakers and original essays from scholars. The booklet will also include memorable images from the excitement, both onscreen and off, of the past few years of BIFF.\n",
      "If you can contribute, keep in mind, not one penny of the funding will go towards paying us!  \n",
      "If you cannot contribute, you can help by getting the word out. The more times you share this link, the more folks will know about the courageous efforts of BIFF to create, and sustain, a truly independent cinema in China. \n",

      "At this point, the risks and challenges are minimal. The films are already booked, the screening schedules are being printed, and the materials are being shipped or created. \n",
      "\n",
      "The filmmaker guests whom we plan to invite have visas and are already traveling or living outside of China. The program booklet is being edited and designed, and will soon be ready to be printed. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we are proud of the screenings, the real impact and intangible value of film festivals are the conversations, the connections, the future collaborations, the community that is borne from them. If you help us reach our goal, permit us to create that essential bridge of communication and exchange between filmmakers and audiences that activates cinema, makes it meaningful and alive. \n",

      "I hope you have just watched my Introduction Video to the Creative Minds Program in Cannes, France. This video took a lot of hard work (I hate being in front of the camera) and helped get me admitted into the (highly selective) program which I hope to attend. Here's the whole story:\n",
      "On Wednesday, February 18th, 2015 I went to an info session about the Creative Minds Program based solely off a last minute email and a gut feeling. I figured my ambitious peers would be fighting for this opportunity  (as is usually the case), but instead I was the only person in the room, which could've been awkward, but it wasn't. I mainly attended the session to find out if there was an opportunity for Financial Aid, as I knew the program would be nearly impossible for me without it. The recruiter was wonderful and let me know that there was aid available. He introduced me to the Program in depth and answered all my questions. There was just over a week left to apply, so it was crunch time, but I left the info session feeling like it was fate.\n",
      "I finished my application in time and waited nervously to hear back. When I was admitted, there was no sigh of relief, but an anticipation that was almost worse than not knowing if I got in: can I afford it? I knew that without aid, the answer to that question was no. I finally received a small amount of aid, which I am incredibly grateful for, but it is still an unreachable goal for me and my family alone. And that's where I need your help.\n",
      "My remaining fee for the program is $2,999. The fee covers everything (food, lodging, equipment, festival access) except for Airfare, which is another $1,500 (or more) for a round trip flight. The total cost of the program and transportation - $4,500 - is an amount that I am only familiar with because it is how much my family and I pay for an entire semester at USC, and we couldn't even do that without generous Financial Aid from both the University and the Federal Government. \n",
      "There have been several opportunities that I have not been able to pursue at all due to finances, and others (like college) that I have only been able to pursue with the help of others. This would usually fall into the former category, but I believe with the help of those around me, it will not. Whether you can spare $5 or more, every donation counts and I am beyond grateful for whatever you can offer to help me reach my goal of $4,000. \n",
      "For an idea of the product, please take a look at my visual sample. It is especially relevant to this project because I made it at the Emerging Filmmaker Program - a small town version of The Creative Minds Program:\n",

At this time, cleaning solutions held great significance as we aimed to protect ourselves by sanitising our hands and any goods that came into the house. \n",

      "Hi, I’m Dan, and I'd love your support in completing Tinker Kitchen, a new maker space for food hackers in San Francisco.\n",
      "It's a great time to be a chef. As an engineer who loves cooking, I’m fascinated by all the new kitchen gadgets and cooking techniques that have become popular over the last few years. Sous vide machines, molecular gastronomy powders, liquid nitrogen ice cream, coffee roasters, fresh pasta extruders. Each time I walk into Sur La Table and Williams-Sonoma, or browse ChefSteps and Kenji Lopez-Alt’s food blog, I find fresh ideas, cuisines, and recipes just waiting to be cooked up.\n",
      "I enjoy cooking in the comfort of my own kitchen. But sometimes I dream of having a fully stocked kitchen, with access to professional cooking equipment that's much larger and more expensive than the tools I own. It’s fun to experiment on my own, but it's way more fun to geek out over recipes, gadgets, and stories with other people who share my love of cooking.\n",
      "So I was inspired to create Tinker Kitchen - a maker space for food hackers to learn and experiment with cooking. Think of Tinker Kitchen as the place where you go to create awesome food, discover new cooking techniques and tools, and train your intuition to come up with original food ideas. I also want it to be a space where you can hang out and share cooking experiences with like-minded food hackers.\n",
      "Tinker Kitchen will build communities of people who love connecting over food. While there are many places where you can learn to cook, they're primarily scheduled classes at fixed times. With Tinker Kitchen, we’re taking a different approach, based on membership. As a member of Tinker Kitchen, you can come anytime you want and hang out, practice your techniques, develop your own projects, and connect with others. We’re about following your curiosity and sharing that experience with others.\n",
      "I'm thrilled to announce that construction of Tinker Kitchen is nearly complete. It's a 1700 sq ft space in San Francisco's Mission District. All that's left to do is finish a few building inspections and put in some finishing touches like ordering more furniture, equipment, and supplies.\n",
      "Tinker Kitchen is open and spacious, giving food lovers the space they need to experiment together. The kitchen is very spacious and our huge skylight gives the space lots of natural lighting. We're also restoring boarded-up windows in the front of the space.\n",
      "Tinker Kitchen is designed to be as flexible as possible. The front of the space will have small tables and chairs, so big groups can put them together for a communal meal, while small groups can still sit separately.\n",
      "We'll have all the greatest equipment, from our ovens to specialty laboratory equipment, to the dishwasher. We'll have it all. More on that below.\n",
      "The kitchen work tables are large butcher-block tables, so you can craft dishes directly on them. They're on casters so they're easy to rearrange for different uses like a class/demo, or a group working independently. Multiple groups can work at the same time without bothering each other.\n",
      "I'm a little obsessed with kitchen equipment. I want Tinker Kitchen to be a \"kitchen playground\" where home cooks can have access to the commercial machines which restaurants and specialty food makers use.\n",
      "Our cook line will feature multiple ovens, including a German-made \"combi oven\" with built-in humidity/steam control, commercial deep-fryer, and even a real wok range.\n",
      "Tinker Kitchen will have a commercial pasta extruder, at least three ways of making ice cream (batch freezer, Pacojet, and even liquid nitrogen). We'll have chocolate-making tools—for tempering and making bonbons, as well as for making it bean-to-bar. And coffee—from a drum roaster to a dual-boiler espresso machine.\n",
      "Then there's the lab equipment for modernist cooking—two centrifuges (a refrigerated one and a spinzall), dehydrator, freeze drier, chamber vacuum, and a selection of the powders and chemicals you need to make foams, gels, spherify, and more.\n",
      "As a thank-you to our backers and members, you can help us decide what we will get next. Should we get tools to make custom chocolate molds? Or a pizza oven? Maybe a rotary evaporator to distill flavor extracts? The options are endless... you can help us pick.\n",

      "Small events (up to ~15 people) can happen anytime the space is open. We'll occasionally also allow the whole space to be booked for celebrations and team-building off-sites.\n",
      "We've already made a significant investment in Tinker Kitchen. We've financed everything from architects and building contractors, to paying rent and buying some of the equipment. Kickstarter funds will go towards:\n",
      "The campaign will cover all of those, plus Kickstarter rewards, and other Kickstarter costs.\n",
      "I’m Dan Mills, Founder of Tinker Kitchen.\n",
      "I love everything about food—cooking, the science behind it, the kitchen equipment—all of it. From my childhood in Venezuela through my career in the tech industry I’ve slowly expanded my arsenal of tastes, techniques and equipment, always tinkering with something new. In 2015 I started Tinker Kitchen to build an awesome maker space for food where I can share this passion with others.\n",
      "The seed for this concept dates back to my college days, where I had the good fortune to take a very special biology course. Maker spaces weren’t really a thing back then, but that’s exactly what this was: a sculptor and a bio prof had a lab in the basement to explain real-world structures and processes by building physical models. We studied biological organisms, did research, and built models to explain them. I discovered that this learning style is not only great fun, but immensely effective: I can still remember the things I learned back then, even though it’s been almost two decades. I approach cooking the same way. I am not only interested in the end product, but in learning the underlying principles.\n",
      "Earlier last year, I had the honor of spending a month working at Chez Panisse in Berkeley. Every day, I woke up at 4.30AM, drove north for an hour, and showed up with my knives at 6.30AM. It was an eye-opening experience. On any given day, I would do everything from peeling buckets of onions, to prepping whole farm boxes of strange new vegetables (cardoons!), to butchering whole legs of lamb.\n",
      "Despite the high pressure environment, I was impressed by how Chez Panisse has formed a learning community that values training each other to achieve excellence. But my deepest learning was not any specific recipe or cooking technique, but a work ethic. To be a cook at the top of your game requires dedication. I could be taught all the tricks to supreming an orange, but an experienced cook would still do the same thing three times as fast with no mistakes, because they have done it over and over for thousands of hours.\n",
      "All this has led me to believe that in order for us to grow as cooks, it is not enough to only learn cooking techniques. We need to have a place where we can practice and a community that is excited to share our cooking journey. That place, I hope, will be Tinker Kitchen. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Because we're finishing up our construction, we've already mitigated most of the big risks in the project. However, we need to finish getting our city permits and approvals (building, health, etc) before we can open.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're incredibly excited to open Tinker Kitchen and start building a community around cooking to share with all of SF. See you soon!\n",

      "My name is Andrew Hoagland, but I go by the penname Law Matheson. You may remember DOSCO from earlier in the year. I spent the beginning months of 2015 studying Kickstarter and other crowd-funding platforms, what to expect, how to avoid pitfalls, and much more. I intended to continue studying and writing throughout the summer and launching KickStarter in October. By early March, however, I grew a little impatient and was willing to give it a try.\n",
      "I am glad that I did. Not because I was happy to watch my project only reach 60%, but because it taught me a lot. In a difficult way, however it was not a failure, but a learning experience. Besides, I like the hard way, and first try would have been just too easy. \n",
      "Taking from what I learned in the first half of this year, as well as my studies of my previous Campaign, I hope that you will all enjoy the new approach. \n",
      " D.O.S.C.O. stands for Department Of Supernatural Cooperation and Organization. They are the secret branch of government that operates to keep human’s from learning of Supernatural’s, and to ensure that they are kept away/safe from human’s, or as they are known in the book, Civi’s. \n",
      "They remain secretive and in the shadows, but operate as a Post Office as a cover to their below ground establishment. \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The book follows a young man named Neil Matheson as he arrives in New City, Maine a (fictional) town inland from the Atlantic, but surrounded on three sides by lakes or rivers. New City is a fairly populated city as it has a community college and a prestigious 150 year old private school. \n",
      "Situated in the middle of town, off to the far right, a mile from the river that cut off its eastern shores, is a forest that is known as Branwood Forrest. If you were to Map the area from online, it would appear a pretty basic 1 square mile of woods. However, those with Supernatural genetics can travel up to 3000 miles! Civi’s are simply deterred by strong magic, and are forced to turn away, believing to have had a great hike.\n",
      "This forest acts as a Beacon for any Supe’ (Supernatural) that is on its own, cast out, runaway, or simply doesn’t belong anywhere else. \n",
      "That’s how I was able to write out werewolves (thank god right? We don’t need anymore vampire/werewolf love stories). Vampires also don’t make any appearances as they have been hunted to near extinction by Civi’s, and Ghosts are a myth. \n",
      " Neil enters NC not knowing any of this, he is as ignorant to it all, as to the fact that he is about to set into motion a series of events that may never stop. What he does know is how to survive on the streets while traveling alone. \n",
      "Once the catalyst is sparked Neil enters into a new and bizarre world, one he may never be able to leave. He meets amazing and diverse friends; he is Initiated into DOSCO and they help him to finish his High School Diploma; he finally starts to settle down, make some money and establish himself.

      "This book is not intended for children 18 or younger. There are many adult themes, drug references, language, and some violence better not read by young minds. \n",
      "That being said, for those young adults and up that love anything ‘Supernatural,’ ‘Secret Agent’, ‘Mystery,’ or ‘Thrillers,’ this book is definitely for you. Plot twists and manipulated character development is something I thrive on. Many stories are unfortunately lacking this, but consumers want it so badly! \n",
      "It has been my goal since I started this series, DOSCO, three years ago to go all the way to publication. I didn’t know at the creation of it all that I would later go on and try to self-publish. Having the background I do, the fact that I am doing it the hard way is not surprising. It is much more than that though, I can’t stand the idea of selling my rights over to some publishing company that doesn’t understand the Universe I’ve molded or the characters and problems therein. I often feel like I am not creating these characters, but rather that I am discovering them. Therefore I would never want to see someone change my characters just to make it “more marketable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The series is meant for young adults and up, and it deals with a lot of controversial issues, but ones that are important to the story and the characters development. By changing the scenarios to make them less ‘risqué’ and more ‘palpable’ you lose the true essence of how the characters became the way they are and under plays the situations they get into.\n",

      "I am not on here to make loads of money, that is not my intention. My goal is to have a finished book that I can then give or sell cheaply to friends and people that have influenced or touched my series in anyway. Since I was a child I have always loved imagining new and splendid worlds, and reaching others with it through writing. For that little 5 year old me, I want to try and live up to those dreams.\n",

I believe in this story, and I hope that you will too.\n",

      "I'm starting this kickstarter campaign because I want to see The Watercolor Oracle out in the world bringing hope to people.  For the past 3 years, I've been inspired to paint abstract watercolors...for me it was an exercise in letting go and taking chances. I also began to collect messages of intuitive guidance from meditations and journaling. When I had the idea to join them together into an oracle card deck I was SO excited! Although the wisdom in these cards was originally meant for me, it's also universal, and I trust it can help whoever wants to receive it.\n",
      "I really had no idea how to bring this idea to fruition. Once I had finished the paintings, and gathered enough wisdom to put on each of the 44 cards, I was kinda stumped on the process of making the deck real. Sure, I could laminate each of my original paintings, or scan them and print them. But as I looked at the oracle card decks I had purchased on my bookshelf, I wanted my deck to be just as available to others, and just as professionally made. And I'm not exactly there yet.\n",
      "It took a ton of searching on the internet to get where I am now with production. I did find 2 affordable companies that could print prototypes in a few different sizes, and one that could print a guidebook the size I wanted. From there, I made my decision which one could work for what I needed. This included the 3.5x5 cards along with the same size saddle-stitched guidebook. I solved the problem of packaging with a blue velvet pouch, but would love to create a sturdy box in the future.\n",
      "Since I've spent lots of time, and some money on figuring this all out, I really just need help in running a larger print of The Watercolor Oracle! The printer is currently having major delays in turning out product, so a larger run of cards will allow me to have them on hand to mail out right away. People won't have to wait the current lengthy time which is at least 6 weeks. I'd like to place an order for 250 decks, guidebooks, velvet packages, and bubble mailers.\n",

      "We've curated a collection of movies about people just like you working to create better urban neighborhoods.  Whether they're about urban designers creating master plans, or private citizens building small scale projects, their stories are inspiring. \n",
      "For our festival's second year, we need your help to improve and expand the New Urbanism Film Festival to deliver the message of human scaled neighborhoods to even more people.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a great response to last year's event, inspiring many to return to their neighborhoods and try some of the ideas they could only see at NUFF.  Your help through kickstarter will allow us to expand our advertising budget.  We want to buy ads in local papers, reach out to community and student groups, and hire a public relations manager.\n",
      "Our second goal for this year is to make the event more interactive and bring more attention to the idea of human scaled urban design. To do this, we need to attract more speakers to present workshops, discussions, and activities that will further inspire our attendees, and take the virtual world of film and make it concrete. So, a portion of this kickstarter fund will be used for hospitality and stipends for our guest speakers. \n",
      "Our third goal for this kickstarter is to reward filmmakers. Last year, filmmakers were invited to a special dinner, and winners won plaques and prizes.  This year, we want to reward and encourage these forward-thinking filmmakers by offering cash prizes that will allow them to make even more ambitious projects in the future. \n",

      " 2. Broaden our audience \n",
      " 3. Reward filmmakers \n",
      "Stretch Goal 1:  If we can reach $13,000, we'll be able to add a full day to the festival.  We've already received more submissions than we did in our entire first year, and most are feature length. In order to take advantage of this bounty, we need another day that would allow us to show more features. \n",
      "Stretch Goal 2: If we reach $16,000, not only will we add another day to the annual festival, we'll host programming throughout the year.  This would help grow our audience base as well as spread the message of human scale urban design.  \n",

However, short and feature films will be considered for all applicable award categories. For more info on what kinds of videos we're looking for and how to submit, visit our website!\n",
      "In addition to the short and feature films that we receive as contest submissions, we will screen major motion picture feature films with a theme of urban issues.  Which ones we screen, will depend on reaching or exceeding our funding goals.\n",
      "Last year we screened The Garden, GDOG, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The Garden was a nice complement to our short films because we did not receive a lot of submissions addressing the relationship between food and the city.  Which we believe is a critical issue. So we were excited to screen The Garden and have the director Scott Kennedy join us to discuss the intricacies of food, the city, and politics.\n",
      "Similarly, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, was a fun choice because it deals with LA History in a fun way.

      "We will select feature films for this year's festival in the same manner: Do they complement other workshops and presentations on the schedule? Do they address an issue not covered in the short films?\n",

We are also involved in local advocacy groups here in Los Angeles. Between our national CNU connections and our local advocacy efforts, we are confident we can provide a roster of guests that will prove very inspiring. \n",
      "Check out our website for a complete list of all 16 speakers and presenters we hosted at the first annual New Urbanism Film Festival.\n",

We believe everyone should have equal access to the arts and it is our mission to keep these shows and these experiences accessible to all. That is why each year we add more free shows and keep our admission prices as low as possible for our ticketed events. \n",

      "And Rooftop Films does more than simply exhibit films. By supporting Rooftop you also help independent filmmakers finish their new films.  One dollar from every ticket we sell goes into the Rooftop Filmmakers Fund, and we raise tens of thousands of additional dollars in cash and services to help our alumni filmmakers to produce their latest films. Over the years, Rooftop has helped more than 100 filmmakers complete their films, including Benh Zeitlin (Beasts of the Southern Wild), David Lowery (Ain’t Them Bodies Saints), Lucy Walker (The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom), Shaka King (Newlyweeds), Sean Durkin (Martha Marcy May Marlene) and Gillian Robespierre (Obvious Child, coming very soon!). \n",

To thank you for your support of Rooftop we are offering many great rewards, including DVDs and blu-ray discs from Magnolia, Oscilloscope, IFC Films and more, as well as tickets to Rooftop shows, and the best reward of all: Rooftop Membership.\n",

      "Rooftop shows are the unique events that are defining New York film culture. We are never content to simply show movies outdoors — we turn our screenings into unforgettably unique evenings. Last summer we didn’t just screen a documentary about a brass band -- we hosted a whole brass band festival (Brasslands). It was not enough for us to simply show a moving portrait of modern strongman (Bending Steel) -- we presented that film on the beach at Coney Island preceded by an exhilarating live exhibition featuring horseshoe bending and crowbar twisting. \n",
      "Access to the Best Independent Films and Filmmakers in the World \n",
      "In 2013 Rooftop Members got to hang out with the filmmakers and actors at the premieres and sneak previews of such films as Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha (starring Greta Gerwig), Sebastian Silva’s Crystal Fairy (starring Michael Cera and Gaby Hoffman), and David Lowery’s Ain’t Them Bodies Saints (starring Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara). \n",
      "First Access to Surprising Sites All Over the City \n",
      "Rooftop shows consistently sell out but Rooftop members get in free and have priority entry. Plus you’ll receive VIP tickets to panels, and after parties too.  You and your friends also receive invitations to off season screenings and exclusive programs curated for members only, and all of this will take place in unconventional spaces and special locations that you might never have discovered without Rooftop Films. \n",
      "If you love Rooftop Films, and want to be part of the Rooftop community, take advantage of these offers. Together we will keep building something bigger, keep our program fresh and accessible year after year and in 2014, we’ll be able to go further and do more, BUT we can only do it with your help. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "As a non-profit organization we will always face the challenge of relying on the support from our backers to sustain Rooftop Films. This Kickstarter project is not a means to an end. It is a stepping stone for us to grow and expand. And with that growth comes greater responsibility, challenges, and needs. We are a hard-working team of six year round and we work tirelessly to provide a unique experience for all who come to our shows. There is still work to be done and we are glad that you are on this journey with us.\n",

The Rosetta Comet Mission. Right now there's a lot of buzz around realistic space exploration, but it's sorely missing from one place - the young adult section of your local bookstore. Let's fill that hole in the shelf. My first novel began with that goal in mind -  to refocus our collective attention on the amazing possibility of space travel. That vision continues with The Rathmore Chaos. \n",
      "READ A SAMPLE HERE.\n",
      "Tully Harper lost a good friend on his first trip into space -- a friend that he desperately wants to find. To do that, he must journey to a very real moon in our solar system. His friend's fate, and maybe humanity's, rests on his ability to locate the Rathmore Chaos. Once there, Tully explores an alien world, battles to bring home his friend, and discovers the origins of his powers, which don't always obey his commands. He also learns the unexpected story of the Ascendant, a myth-infused tale that I will write in the years to come. I researched everything from planetary sciences to orbital transfers to movement in low gravity to bring real science to bear upon the fiction.\n",
      "Also, the story is funny when it needs to be. Tully carries with him a pocket-sized Android who spouts definitions and advertisement at terribly inappropriate times. His name is Little Bacon, and bacon makes everything better.\n",
      "Here's a link to The Conspiracy Game, my first novel. Read the reviews. What you'll see is the result of my first Kickstarter, which inspired me to pursue this trilogy. Unlike the first Kickstarter, this one includes a copy of the book! (see award levels for details). \n",

      "Tully Harper - protagonist - an only child from a single parent home; life-threateningly curious; received unpredictable powers when he touched a strange object in space. \n",
      "Sunjay Chakravorty - Tully's best friend - son of a Space Alliance research engineer; martial arts afficianado, human question cannon, fierce friend, and megafanboy for the pop star Queen Envy.\n",
      "Tabitha Tirelli - Tully's friend/crush - lives down the street from Tully; instrumental in helping Tully avoid death in space; perceptive friend; doodler and straight A student; not a manic pixie dream girl.\n",
      "Gallant Trackman - Archspy of the Ascendant - power-hungry traitor who sold out Tully and the world to the Ascendant; lost his hand trying to stop Tully in the first book and not happy about it.  \n",

      "When coming up with this project, my aim was pretty simple: I wanted to make a set of pride pins that I would be proud to wear myself. I have experience working in wildlife conservation science, and my love for nature and passion for greater inclusivity in STEM careers influenced my design choice for this series. Additionally, I wanted to create a pin line that reflected the LGBTQ+ community's diversity, beauty, and perseverance!\n",

Please note that the selection I made is NOT indicative of favouritism or perceived value, but rather of a) budget restrictions; b) design similarity (the same number of stripes, for example, makes pins cheaper and easier to manufacture); and c) demand according to requests from existing customers. \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Last year I borrowed a Nikon D7100 Digital camera from my good friend and fellow photographer Ryuijie. After over 50 years of photographing with film in multiple formats I quickly learned what an incredible tool the new cameras are. No need to change film for different situations, the higher sensitivity allowing the use of available light (which has always been my preference), being able to make very large photographs without needing medium or large format cameras and film. But most of all, to see the final image quality the new 10 ink printers can now produce...it's like my early days in a darkroom all over again.\n",
      "It's no wonder so many of the top fine art photographers today made the move years ago to this medium.  In addition, the art community has accepted the new pigment photographs as seen in auction results in recent years. A few years back a Jock Sturges pigment print sold for $40,000.00 at auction. It's well documented that these newer archival pigment photographs have been tested to last 150-200 years, if not longer.   \n",
      "My main purpose of this Kickstarter project is to get my new photographs in your hands so you can see the beauty of this (new to me!) process. After the cost of printing the \"rewards\", I will use any additional funds to upgrade my system to a digital camera and to start scanning some sellect negatives from the last 50+ years to make new archival pigment photographs from them.  \n",

      "A large meteor is headed straight for Earth and 13-year old Sean couldn’t be more excited.  With his father Kevin, a lead scientist on the NASA team being sent to study the impact site, Sean is going to get to travel to central Russia and learn firsthand all the secrets that the rock from outer space may hold.  It’s the chance of a lifetime. \n",
      "Soon after Sean and his father arrive in Moscow, the meteorite (nicknamed Elijah by the Russians) finally reaches the Earth’s surface, but instead of exploding upon impact as was predicted, the huge space rock lands quietly – and largely intact.  Sean, Kevin and the team of scientists are even more surprised when they learn that, moments before the meteorite landed, six Russian Air Force men in the area of the crash site dropped dead instantly, with no identifiable cause of death. \n",
      "Sean is soon left alone and, as he struggles to escape the dying city, he discovers that somehow the meteorite’s arrival has given him strange, almost magical, abilities. He must use these newfound powers to survive against roaming gangs and find out what happened to his world. \n",

      "Elijah’s Chariot is a dramatic and adventurous novel appropriate for middle school ages and up (my adult readers especially have loved it). In writing it, I really wanted to explore what it would be like for a young boy to be all on his own in a completely foreign environment and have to figure out how to survive. Although the book is very much about the adventure, I’ve also included scientific elements throughout – on meteors and some ideas of how mental abilities like telekinesis could actually work. Also, I’ve relied on my personal experience of living in St. Petersburg and Moscow to flesh out the world in which Sean finds himself stranded. So, there are some possible educational elements as well as all the fun. \n",

As if the new kid at school isn't enough for her to deal with, she gets unwanted powers-which she can't control, learns that she's actually an alien and that a giant vampire-lizard has it out for her specifically.\n",

How about tons of your favorite 80s arcade games! Best your Galaga high score while enjoying an expertly crafted latte. Reach a new level in Pac-Man while stuffing your face with fluffy, glazed donuts. Squash some Q*Bert baddies while gnoshing on an ice cream cookie sandwich. It's okay to cry. Happy tears, of course. 8-Bit Donuts will be located on the campus of The Guild Hall, Savannah's premier gaming destination. The Guild Hall already boasts a host of successful businesses, including The Chromatic Dragon, our gamerpub, The Guild Hall Arena, our 18+ gamerspace, and Jolly Goblin Games, our traditional friendly local game store. With plenty of space to play Magic, D&D, or any other tabletop game your heart desires, 8-Bit will offer more than just arcade games. \n",

Scotcharoo Crullers?!  PB&J Stuffed Donuts?!  Cap'n Crunch Special?!  Dude.  There is no stopping this man!\n",

      "But wait, there's more!  What Savannah eatery would be complete without ice cream? Kill the heat on a hot Savannah day (which we all know is most of the year) with one of our treats that features delicious ice cream from Leopold's.  Chocolate, vanilla, and most of your favorite Leopold's flavors will be available, either as add-ons to make your donut experience even more magical, or as part of a special creation by our team of donutisans (Clegg made that one up, too).\n",

The Dragon offers customers console gaming and board gaming while they enjoy up-scale pub food, craft beer, and cocktails. Not to brag, but it's been called \"The Disney World of Savannah\" and \"Oh my god I can't believe this is a real thing am I dreaming?\"  We couldn't have done it without our Kickstarter backers, and we hope that together we can achieve similar results with you folks on 8-Bit Donuts. \n",

But we need your help to finish it! Without these funds, we won't be able to get this project done.\n",

So, the cost here depends on whether we have enough to float the floor (making it level) and what sort of materials we can afford to cover the floor.\n",
      "(Did a vampire take this picture?!?) It may not look like much now, but this is where our coffee and donut bar will live!  \n",
      "Ceiling Repair ($500-$3k) We can patch just the hole caused by a leak from the plumbing in the ceiling (you can see it in the pic below), or we can redo the entire ceiling. The latter is preferable, of course, but costs 6 times more.\n",
      "Lighting ($500 - $2k) The space has ugly ceiling fluorescents and ceiling fans from the 1980s (which is sort of ironic, if you think about it) and we could replace those with more modern and inexpensive fixtures of the same size or (and especially if we can repair the entire ceiling) we can switch to recessed cans or something a bit less ... institutional.\n",
      "With your help, we will turn this space into equal parts \"tasty donut shop\", \"comfy coffee shop hangout\" and \"nostalgic 80s arcade\". But we can't do it alone! \n",
      "---Equipment---\n",
      "We've got a hood installed already and we have our old oven, some mixers and glazing tables from Clegg's bakery.  But we still need a variety of donut and coffee related equipment.\n",
      "Donut Fryer ($500-$5k) - We need a donut fryer, and the better this Kickstarter performs, the better the machine we can afford.\n",
      "Proofing Cabinet ($500-$1k) - We need a proofing cabinet, which enables us to set the temperature and humidity necessary to create super fluffy donuts.  Again, if we raise more money, we can get a better proofer.\n",
      "All the Coffee Equipment!!! ($2k-$15k) We can make it all happen with as little as $2k or as much as $15k, when you factor in the espresso machine, coffee grinder, brewers, and assorted thingamabobs.\n",
      "--Arcade Cabinets--\n",
      "This one just comes down to what we have left after getting the space ready.  If we had unlimited funds, there is room for 12-15 arcade cabinets and cocktail tables.  Generally, each of these cabinets costs $1,400-$2,000 to acquire.\n",
      "Examples: \n",
      "Galaga / Ms. Pac-Man / Pac-Man (Cocktail) - $1,400\n",
      "Donkey Kong / Defender / Joust - $2,000\n",
      "We will need about $50,000 to finish this space. Crazy, right? We are set our goal at $10,000 for a few reasons: (1) That's what we know we need to get the ball rolling on renovation of the space; (2) We wanted to start with an attainable goal and build from there; and (3) We've got some amazing stretch goals planned that will allow us to get to $50,000, if people really get behind what we're trying to accomplish in order to make this space come to life! \n",

      "The good news is that we've done this before!  We opened The Chromatic Dragon in 2015, and that was 10 times more precarious because of the liquor license.  Our team has also opened two bakeries in the past, both here in Savannah, so we have plenty of experience that many others don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another risk for any new business is sufficient funding.  We've already invested over $50,000 in the project to get this far and one of the things a successful Kickstarter will do, in addition to providing additional funding, obviously, is demonstrate to our investors that there is a market here in Savannah for the type of business that we have planned.\n",

And they told us the ones who did would not spend any money.  They told us we needed to have ESPN and girls with bikini tops and basically the same thing every other bar has.

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Here we are, two years on from the creation of the first Providero Tea and Coffee House. It’s been a wonderful ride to this point! We come to you now to ask you to join with us again in a new adventure!\n",
      "But first, here’s a recap…..\n",
      "With the help and support of our amazing Kickstarter Community, our dreaming and hard work culminated in the opening of the Providero Tea and Coffee House in Llandudno Junction in January 2014. \n",
      "In two years we have served thousands of cups of the finest tea and coffee on the North Wales coast, alongside our famous home-made cakes and locally-baked bread. \n",
      "We have continued to develop a wonderful customer base of regulars, many of whom have become friends with us, and with each other. \n",
      "We have served visitors from all over the world and welcomed some fascinating characters through our door - it’s been a privilege to offer this hospitality in our little corner of beautiful North Wales. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our team of 2 (Jon and Ellie!) has grown, to include James, Emma, Jake and Bronte - these fantastic people have joined their skills with ours, to make Providero what it is today; a thriving, bustling coffee house with a growing reputation for excellence and a warm welcome.\n",
      "Don’t just take our word for it - we have gained a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence (read some customer reviews here) and we have the great honour of being included as the only North Wales cafe in the next edition of the Northern Independent Coffee Guide. \n",
      "Most days, Providero is bustling from the moment our doors open at 8am, to when we close at 6pm. There is an increasing number of occasions when customers can’t find a seat, and there is a queue out of the door! \n",
      "We find more and more that we are feeling the limits of our little shop. Large groups can’t find space to eat and drink together, freelance workers who want to set up office for the day in our cafe don’t have the space to do so. We have to turn away requests to hire out our upstairs space for meetings, as we need it for customer turnover. It’s a wonderful problem to have, but we want to be able to do more to meet and exceed our customer’s high expectations and needs.\n",
      "Many people have asked when we are going to open somewhere else - somewhere bigger? As the demands on our small space have increased, we’ve realised it’s time to take the plunge and open Providero number 2! This won't mean losing our Junction home, but branching out and having a second place to welcome you to.\n",
      "We have come across a fantastic shop in the restaurant/cafe quarter of Llandudno, which has captured our imaginations. It already has A3 planning permission for use as a cafe (which is a real bonus!) There is also a lot more space!\n",
      "The premises has an outdoor pavement seating area, accessible toilet and babychange facilities, and scope for a food prep room meaning we could at last offer tempting light lunch options, alongside our range of teas, coffees and cakes. \n",
      "Huge bowls of healthy salads would await you, along with a hearty homemade soups of the day and local breads.  The emphasis on our lunches would be simple, tasty, healthy food that you could enjoy in or take away with you. \n",
      "We would incorporate more brew methods for our coffees, giving you more choice and showcasing how versatile and delicious all our coffees can be. We'll have more retail products - stuff you can buy to make the perfect brew at home, or perfect gifts for loved ones! \n",
      "We’d love to stock craft beers and wines and be open late on Fridays and Saturdays for you to hang out and start your weekend properly! We’d open too for sleepy Sundays - Come and read the weekend paper, play board games with your family and friends or sip a coffee before taking a Sunday afternoon stroll on the Orme. \n",
      "We’d have a separate room available that could be booked out for private events or meetings. Ample plug sockets for laptop users, more space for groups and somewhere safe to lock your bikes. We’ll have the room to host events and are already planning a few of our own. Rest assured though, our welcome, quality and ethos won’t change.\n",
      "We were humbled and blown away by the generosity and support of our Kickstarter backers 2 years ago. To be honest it was an uncomfortable experience to be vulnerable and ask for you to give to that project. It’s still uncomfortable! \n",
      "Although the cafe in Junction is profitable, there is not a lot left over after we have paid the bills, wages and suppliers. It is sustainable, but due to its size, it is limited in what it can achieve.\n",
      "We see it as a good thing to give people the opportunity to sow into Providero again at this important point of growth. To allow our supporters, customers and community to contribute to opening a new space from which they will benefit and enjoy. To allow people to influence and shape who and what they find on their local high-street. \n",
      "We also acknowledge that crowdfunding was foundational in what we became. It meant that a thread of gratitude, generosity and a sense of always looking to “pay it forward” has run through all that we have done. It shared the influence and the power to create something bright and new amongst a whole bunch of folk, far and wide. It meant that you are all part of us, and we are part of you. This concept has been beautifully depicted in our “Wall of Thanks” artwork by Jen Mickelborough, which is displayed in the cafe.\n",
      " \n",
      "We’re hoping to raise at least £30,000 through Kickstarter. \n",
      "You may not have the means or desire to pledge financially. That is totally fine! There is no obligation to whatsoever. However, if this resonates with you at all; if you would like to see a second, bigger Providero Tea and Coffee house in Llandudno, and you have the means to do so, please pledge. We would love your support and your involvement. \n",
      "The shop presently is an empty shell, with no catering facilities, just some plastered stud walls and falling-down ceiling tiles. A fairly extensive building and shop fit-out is needed to transform it into a beautiful cafe space with all the coffee and catering equipment we would require. We get the keys (therefore start paying rent) in July, and so would be on a tight timeframe to get the shop open as soon as possible. \n",
      "The good news is, we know a lot more what we’re doing this time around! We have a much more realistic idea of the cost of equipment, for example. Many of our customers are already bringing useful contacts and advice for the aspects of the project that are unfamiliar to us. We have strong design concepts and are confident we can keep things on-time and on-budget.\n",
      "We know the full renovation and kitting out of the shop will cost more than £30k. It will be more in the region of £100k with all the building and engineering works, equipment, furniture and stock required. It would be AMAZING if the Kickstarter campaign smashed this target of £30k so we could keep our borrowing down and keep more of the money in the local economy and delivering on our vision for this new venture!\n",
      "We would love you to be a part of this next chapter of the Providero story! Even if you can’t pledge financially, please spread the word, tweet about the project, post it on Facebook! As always, ask us your questions, come and talk to us, or drop us an email. We are super-excited to turn this project into reality and we’re really looking forward to welcoming you once again to our new Providero Tea & Coffee House in Llandudno!\n",
      " \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The good news is, the landlords accepted our offer for the lease! They were aware of our reputation and keen for us to have the tenancy. We've been going over our current figures and projections with a fine-tooth comb, ensuring our calculations and business plans are watertight to give the business as a whole the very best chance of succeeding in its aims.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are committed to keeping our start up costs as low as possible, but are also aware that we will have to maintain the running of the Junction shop, in addition to recruiting and training new staff. Jon won’t be as free to do as much of the work as last time. Therefore our labour costs will be higher.\n",

      "What is the FicMayab? \n",
      "The festival will be a diverse space of cinematographic exhibition of indigenous themes in its different genres (documentary, fiction, animation, experimental, etc.). ), but above all, it is a space for participation and learning about cultural identity, the struggles for the defense of Mother Earth, the memory and communication challenges of Indigenous / Native Peoples. \n",
      "Following the mandate of the CLACPI Assembly, which established that the venues of the festivals should respond to indigenous peoples and nationalities and not states, it was decided to name the 13th FicMayab Festival 'where Fic means' International Film Festival and Mayab' of the territory Maya, which extends from what is now called Nicaragua to the southeast of Mexico. Although the main exhibition coverage of FicMayab 'is Mesoamerica, its call is extended to the whole world. \n",
      "The importance of 13 For Mayan Peoples: The number 13 (Oxlajuj) has a very special meaning since there are 13 cosmic and natural energies ranging from 1 to 13 that enhance human capabilities, which combined with the 20 nawales. According to the ajq'ij Edgar Choguaj: \"they suppose the probability and the possibility of 260 different personalities, at the same time diverse intelligences and minds, complex and ordered among themselves, as it is the nature and the universe-pluriverso with its pluriforms\". the Oxlajuj number (13) is always present for example in the 13 months of 20 days of the Cholqi'j or Mayan lunar calendar, the 13 Baqtunes, the Mayan long count calendar that marks a solar age.  There are also 13 main joints that give movement to our body.\n",
      "The festival and its components: \n",
      "The FICMAYAB 'takes place from 2 to 16 October 2018 in Guatemala and will have as main headquarters Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango, Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala City, Antigua Guatemala, Cobán and Chisec in Alta Verapaz and the Estor in Izabal. \n",
      "The main component of FICMAYAB 'is the Official Exhibition, where the 92 selected filmworks from different parts of the world will be exhibited. In addition, parallel and complementary activities will be held as: Special Sample: Program for the exhibition of audiovisual works in addition to the Official Show. X International Communication Meeting  of Indigenous / Native Peoples: Meeting of communicators and communicators involved with the media and Indigenous / Native Peoples, in which topics of interest will be discussed, experiences will be shared and articulated actions and strategies will be traced. Political Forum of Indigenous / Native Peoples: Space for discussion and proposals on aspects of interest for Indigenous Peoples; exchange with representatives of local movements, regional struggles and communicators. Festilab: Space for workshops and practical work for the exchange of ideas and knowledge, with the presence of filmmakers, producers and artists from different regions, cultures and experiences. Community visits: opportunity to approach and exchange with local communities with whom to learn successful examples of self-determined local development. Artistic activities: Dances, music, theater, photography and plastic arts, among others. CLACPI General Assembly: An Ordinary Assembly will be held to evaluate what has been done and draw up the work plan for the next period. The venue for the next Festival and the persons and organizations that will occupy the various positions and commissions in this organization will be chosen.\n",
      "What will the funds be used for?\n",
      "In order to cover lodging, food and transportation for 100 indigenous communicators and communicators from Guatemala during the 15 days of the festival. For production expenses: production of music events, medical insurance, consumables, equipment rentals, artists' fees, among many other things. \n",
      "The International Festival of Cinema and Communication of the Indigenous  Peoples is one of main activities for CLACPI, we are people of diverse organizations of several countries of Latin America, that as a network, since 1985, we made a great variety of activities of collaboration, exchange and mutual support in communication from an integral perspective, as well as in the training, production, diffusion of indigenous film and video. The activity that most characterizes CLACPI, and the one that has remained constant throughout its life has been the celebration of the International Film and Video Festival of Indigenous Peoples. This event, held on a rotating basis in the different venues of the organizations that make up CLACPI, consists of the concentration of people and audiovisual productions, which in turn entail enormous knowledge, experience and especially important messages from indigenous peoples regarding their situation , rights, proposals and struggles. \n",
      "CLACPI has 12 Festivals celebrated in different parts of the territory of Abya Yala. The Anaconda Prize should also be mentioned as an international and pioneering initiative since 2000, of an itinerant nature and of indigenous and Afro-descendant community protagonism.

      "1. Cos’è il Fantafestival? Un po’ di storia…\n",
      "Il Fantafestival è il più longevo festival italiano dedicato al cinema fantastico in tutte le sue declinazioni: fantascienza, horror, fantasy, paranormale, gotico e altri generi affini, con alle spalle ben 37 edizioni! Probabilmente molti già lo conosceranno, ma è giusto raccontare un po’ della sua storia, per tutti coloro che non hanno ancora avuto modo di sperimentarlo in prima persona. Il Fantafestival nasce a Roma nel 1981, come diretta derivazione delle rassegne di cinema di fantascienza organizzate per il circuito Italnoleggio negli anni ’74-’77 e delle grandi kermesse di cinema fantastico con le quali il Cineclub Tevere di Roma connotò la propria programmazione a partire dal ’75. Iniziato al cinema Clodio nell’ottobre del 1981 e poi passato, negli anni, come sede principale prima al complesso Capranica-Capranichetta, poi al Barberini, al Quattro Fontane e al Savoy, il festival si è sempre caratterizzato per il taglio popolare, indirizzato al grande pubblico degli appassionati. Le ali del pipistrello del Fantafestival hanno volano negli anni nei cieli di altre città italiane, come Milano, Ravenna, Napoli, Verona e Genova. Grazie alle numerose collaborazioni internazionali inoltre nel 1986 il Fantafestival, insieme ai Festival di Bruxelles, di Sitges (Spagna) e di Oporto (Portogallo) è tra i soci fondatori della European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation (www.melies.org). Sul palco e sugli schermi del Fantafestival sono passati i nomi più illustri del cinema fantastico italiano e internazionale: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, George A. Romero, Roger Corman, David Cronenberg, Sam Raimi, Peter Cushing, Malcolm McDowell, Peter Jackson, Alejandro Jodorowsky, John Phillip Law, Rutger Hauer, Tobe Hooper, Lloyd Kaufman, Brian Yuzna, Robert Englund, John Carpenter, Ursula Andress, Barbara Steele, Dario Argento, Carlo Rambaldi, Dino De Laurentiis, Dante Ferretti, Sergio Stivaletti, Lamberto Bava e molti altri ancora.\n",
      "2. Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival? La raccolta fondi per l’edizione 2018\n",
      "Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival? Questa è la domanda che ci siamo fatti e che vi facciamo quando abbiamo toccato con mano l’impossibilità di organizzare la 38esima edizione del nostro festival. La causa è dovuta alla riduzione, fino all’annullamento, dei finanziamenti pubblici, grazie ai quali finora siamo riusciti a proporre con continuità e in crescita la manifestazione. Un calo al quale ci siamo rifiutati di cedere, rispondendo con investimenti personali e la forza della nostra passione, grazie all’affetto che da sempre il pubblico ha dimostrato nei confronti della kermesse. Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival? Ma soprattutto, che mondo è “con” Il Fantafestival? La realtà dei festival cinematografici è profondamente cambiata nell’arco dei 37 anni di vita del Fantafestival. Da diversi anni il festival ha focalizzato gran parte della sua attenzione alle produzioni di giovani autori italiani e internazionali. Registi e produttori indipendenti di corti e lungometraggi a cui il Fantafestival ha dato spazio nell’ottica di promuovere idee nuove, giovani talenti, per riuscire a metterli in contatto con il destinatario ultimo delle loro opere: il pubblico. E sono stati diversi i casi in cui un giovane filmmaker esordiente, anche grazie alla visibilità ottenuta con il Fantafestival, abbia poi proseguito la sua carriera fino ad arrivare alla distribuzione nazionale in sala. Ciò che unisce il Fantafestival, i filmmaker e gli spettatori è proprio la passione verso il cinema fantastico. Una passione che di certo non può scomparire per una mancanza di budget. Abbiamo pensato che un mondo senza Fantafestival non debba esistere e abbiamo deciso di chiedervi aiuto, proprio come molti filmmaker fanno per riuscire a portare a compimento la loro opera. Chiediamo aiuto a tutti coloro che, anno dopo anno, ci raccontano di come la loro passione per il cinema di genere fantastico sia nata proprio durante le nostre passate edizioni e ai più giovani che vorranno entrare a far parte del nostro mondo!\n",
      "3. La 38esima edizione\n",
      "Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival lo potete scoprire ironicamente all’interno dello spot che vede protagonisti i nostri Luca Ruocco e Marcello Rossi, girato con il supporto del regista Paolo Gaudio (premiato proprio al Fantafestival per il suo lungometraggio d’esordio Fantasticherie di un passeggiatore solitario). Nel mondo reale, l’assenza del Fantafestival non porterebbe alla sparizione del fantastico dalla vita di tutti i suoi fan, ma di certo segnerebbe la scomparsa di una pagina importante nella storia della cultura italiana horror, fantasy e fantascientifica. Se vorrete darci una mano a salvare la 38esima edizione del Fantafestival avrete la nostra eterna gratitudine e ci aiuterete a coprire le spese organizzative di base di questa nuova avventura che si svolgerà negli spazi del Nuovo Cinema Aquila, a Roma a Dicembre 2018.

      "1. What is Fantafestival? A brief history…\n",
      "Fantafestival is the oldest Italian festival dedicated to fantastic cinema, covering all its sub-genres: science fiction, horror, fantasy, paranormal, gothic and other similar genres, and it now counts 37 editions! Many of you probably have already heard of Fantafestival, but it’s fair to tell some of his history, for all those who haven’t experimented it in first person. Fantafestival was born in Rome in 1981, following the experiences of science fiction movies exhibitions made for distribution Italnoleggio during ’74-’77, and following the successful science fiction programming of Cineclub Tevere in Rome, starting from ’75. First held at Clodio theatre in October 1981, and then in several other locations, the Capranica-Capranichetta complex, the Barberini theatre, the Quattro Fontane theatre and finally at the Savoy theatre, the festival has always been addressed to the large audience of fans. During the years, Fantafestival’s bat had flown in other Italian cities: Milan, Ravenna, Naples, Verona and Genoa. Thank to various international collaborations, in 1986 Fantafestival along with the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, the Festival Internacional de Cinema de Catalunya of Sitges (Spain), and the Fantasporto (Oporto, Portugal) is among the funding members of the European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation (www.melies.org). The stage and the screens of Fantafestival have seen all the most important names of fantastic cinema, both Italian and international: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, George A. Romero, Roger Corman, David Cronenberg, Sam Raimi, Peter Cushing, Malcolm McDowell, Peter Jackson, Alejandro Jodorowsky, John Phillip Law, Rutger Hauer, Tobe Hooper, Lloyd Kaufman, Brian Yuzna, Robert Englund, John Carpenter, Ursula Andress, Barbara Steele, Dario Argento, Carlo Rambaldi, Dino De Laurentiis, Dante Ferretti, Sergio Stivaletti, Lamberto Bava and many more.\n",
      "2. What the world would be like without Fantafestival? The crowdfunding for 2018\n",
      "What the world would be like without Fantafestival? This is the question we asked ourselves when we realized that it would not be possible to organize the 38th edition of our festival. The reason for this is the constant decrease, down to zero, of the state funding, which in the past allowed us to present an ever growing event. In these last years we decided not to surrender to the funding decrease, compensating it both with personal investments and with our passion, thanks to the affection of Fantafestival’s audience. What the world would be like without Fantafestival? But more importantly, what is the world like “with” Fantafestival? The world of film festival has deeply changed during the 37 years of life of Fantafestival. For several years now our festival is focusing on independent productions of Italian and foreign filmmakers. Independent directors and producers to whom Fantafestival gave space, in order to promote new ideas and young talents, to put them in contact with the ultimate recipients of their work: the audience. And more than once, thanks to the visibility they had in Fantafestival, young filmmakers went on with their career up to have national theatre distribution of their movies. What brings together Fantafestival, filmmakers and the audience is passion for fantastic cinema. A passion which does not disappear just for the lack of budget. So we decided that a world without Fantafestival should not exist, and we decided to ask for your help, just like many filmmakers do to complete their works. We ask for help from all those that, year after year, tell us how their passion was born in Fantafestival’s past editions and to the younger fans who want to join this world!\n",
      "3. The 38th edition\n",
      "You can ironically find out what the world would be like without Fantafestival in our spot, with the organizers Luca Ruocco and Marcello Rossi, directed by Paolo Gaudio (who was awarded by Fantafestival for his debut movie Reveries of a Solitary Walker). In the real world, the disappearance of Fantafestival certainly would not deprive all the fan of fantastic cinema, but it would mean to eradicate an important page from the history of Italian fantastic culture. If you’ll help us to save the 38th edition of Fantafestival, you’ll have our eternal gratitude, and you’ll help us to cover the basis expenses for this new adventure that will be held at Nuovo Cinema Aquila in Rome on December 2018. But this is not all: to thank you for your small or big help, Fantafestival will have a gift for each one of you. Here you can find the gifts list.\n",

      "Expedition to the Arctic Circle \n",
      "I am embarking on a photographic expedition to the western shores of Greenland along the southern edge of the Arctic Circle.  My name is Emanuel Dimitri Volakis and I have been creating black and white photographs for over 27 years. My interest in photography began when I was eleven years old. My professional career as a fine artist commenced in my twenties. I have been working full time as an independent artist for almost three decades.  \n",
      "My past work has focused on the aesthetics and achievements of humanity from ancient times to the modern age.  I have photographed the ruins at Pompeii, created an extensive body of work on the Gardens at Versailles and completed additional series on baroque sculpture, architecture and the urban landscape throughout Western Europe and North America.\n",
      "My photographic travels have taken me to many unique regions across North America including Yosemite, Mineral King,  the Olympic Peninsula, the northern coast of California, Zion and Bryce Canyon in the South West.  My love of the natural world and the animals that inhabit these wild spaces have been an intrinsic part of my life as an environmentalist, naturalist and activist.\n",
      "The principles of my aesthetics rest on four major pillars. The exclusive use of available light, sharp contrast, bold compositional elements and lastly a sense of timelessness that transports the viewer to a moment beyond the present. I will apply these same core principles on this expedition in order to create images that will capture the mystery and intrigue of this magical land beyond time.\n",
      "This new series will focus exclusively on the natural world and the animals that live there. I will be staging from an icebreaker class expedition ship via zodiac watercraft and by sea kayak in order to fully immerse myself in this remote environment and get as close as possible to the various creatures of the region. \n",
      "I have three distinct photographic objectives for this trip. I will be creating a series of images of icebergs and glaciers treated as architectural studies, capturing the phenomena of the Aurora Borealis, and creating a series of black and white portraits of animals living within the Arctic Circle.\n",
      "I will be shooting primarily in black and white utilizing traditional film cameras including 35mm, medium format and 4x5.  I will also utilize digital cameras to capture the Aurora Borealis in full color. The expedition will last 16 days followed by several months of darkroom work, photo editing and printing.\n",
      "I am offering open edition and limited edition photographs (meticulously hand printed silver gelatin prints and archival pigment prints) to accommodate all levels of patronage. In addition, I will be offering non exclusive digital assets (film stills, videos and jpegs) as rewards for entry level patrons. I am also offering a few unique rewards for those patrons who want to support the campaign in a more substantial way. \n",
      "If you are inspired by this endeavor and want to support traditional analog photography as an art form, please back this project so that I may create a body of work of this ephemeral place and the majestic animals that live there.\n",
      "Thank you for considering this project. \n",
      "A short note on the timeline for rewards fulfillment. For those supporters who would rather receive a reward sooner than later (2019 vs 2020), you are welcome to choose from a selection of images of my past work. Images from this expedition will become available over time as I develop film, scan and tune negatives and make prints in the darkroom. The process can take months (after returning with 100+ rolls of film) so patience is a must when it comes to analog photography. I will be leaving in August of 2019 for the Arctic and returning in mid September. Rest assured that I will work diligently to process and proof all the negatives as quickly as possible. The more money I raise through this campaign, the more time I can devote to completing this project with no interruptions when I return. It is my goal to have working proofs by December/January of this year and to begin to offer images for patrons to review by the Spring of 2020...or possibly sooner. All rewards should be fulfilled by Summer of 2020. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Any expedition to remote parts of the world holds an array of risks and challenges. The two largest potential risks for this expedition will be weather concerns and the scarcity of animals in the region. I hope to create shots of multiple wild animals but there is no guarantee that I will find all the subjects I am looking for (polar bears and arctic foxes being some of the more challenging animals to photograph in their natural habitat). The same goes for the Aurora Borealis, another natural phenomena which hopefully will manifest during my time there. With two solid weeks out in the field I feel confident I will be able to meet both of these goals.  Barring any major equipment failures, I should bring back thousands of exposures resulting in a large array of images to choose from.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Hello,\n",
      "My name is Daryl and I run a small Etsy store where I sell enamel pins and other products of my designs. Typically, I try to focus on designing and selling original characters, but I recently played through the PS3 classic Ni No Kuni and was inspired to design my first keychain. \n",
      "Here are some specifics:\n",
      "Assurance:\n",
      "All pledge money received will go straight into the production and manufacturing of this keychain. The manufacturer that I work with does require 100 piece minimum, so I don't foresee having much money leftover. If there does happen to be some funds left over, all the remainder will go toward purchasing new backing cards and other such items for packaging.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I've been designing and manufacturing hard enamel pins for almost a year now and have yet to encounter any sort of challenge that wasn't easily overcome. However, this being my first keychain design, things might work a little differently, considering it's a new type of item. But I trust in my contacts with the manufacturer and I will do everything in my power to ensure that this product turns out the best that it can possibly be.\n",

      "Hello, My name is Daryl and I run a small Etsy store where I sell enamel pins and other products of my designs. Typically, I try to focus on designing and selling original characters, but I recently played through the PS3 classic Ni No Kuni and was inspired to design my first keychain.  Here are some specifics: Assurance: All pledge money received will go straight into the production and manufacturing of this keychain. The manufacturer that I work with does require 100 piece minimum, so I don't foresee having much money leftover. If there does happen to be some funds left over, all the remainder will go toward purchasing new backing cards and other such items for packaging.\n",

      "I've been designing and manufacturing hard enamel pins for almost a year now and have yet to encounter any sort of challenge that wasn't easily overcome. However, this being my first keychain design, things might work a little differently, considering it's a new type of item. But I trust in my contacts with the manufacturer and I will do everything in my power to ensure that this product turns out the best that it can possibly be.\n"
