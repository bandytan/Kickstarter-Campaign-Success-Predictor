      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Thank you for taking the time to stop and look at my campaign! I'm Sam, sole artist and owner of Little Lunar Rabbit Designs.\n",
      "Ultimately, the goal of this campaign is to get some pins made. To help make the project more manageable, the initial goal was a relatively low one - being only one pin. Rather than running the campaign for all 10 designs and risk not being able to fund everything, I had hoped that by breaking the project into smaller chunks, we would be able to produce as many as we could!\n",
      "We're now a ways into the campaign, and the original campaign is beyond successfully funded! Since we do still have some time left, I have added 4 all new bonus designs, re-released the original Crystal Bunny pin, and added on some really fun milestone stretch goals! \n",
      "The pin that started it all - my crystal bunny design! Having made this one, having gone through the whole process of making my own vector art, translating the emblem into a pin, and finally getting the finished piece in hand is what sparked my desire to finish the rest of the series. It was such a wonderful experience working with the manufacturer for this design, that I am very much looking forward to working with them on the future designs!\n",
      "Due to the insanely unexpected success of this campaign, this pin is now available as an add-on for $11 each, and will be available as a selection for your pledge! \n",
      "  For those of you who are familiar to Kickstarter, this is simply a little refresher. And for those of you who are checking it out for the first time, here's a breakdown for how things go!\n",
      "- Pledge your reward: Choose which reward tier you'd like to \"pledge,\" this is your own placeholder in the project funding, payment isn't due yet, so hang tight! Pledging is zero risk - you pay when the campaign ends and are free to edit your pledge at any time while the campaign is running!\n",
      "- Campaign runs for 30 days, goals are met, and pins are unlocked! \n",
      "- Campaign ends, you select which pins you'd like from the unlocked designs through a project end backer survey. This is where your pledge payment is processed. \n",
      "- Kickstarter releases funds after 2 weeks, and pins are sent into production!\n",
      "- Pins are mailed to me, sorted, and then mailed out to you!\n",
      " Finally on to the fun stuff - the best part, and why you're all here - the pins!!\n",
      "After the campaign is over, the intent is to sell the pins at $12 each. \n",
      "As a thank you for participating in the campaign and helping me reach my goal, I've set two special price brackets for this project. The \"Early Bird\" pricing is a limited pricing option, available on a first come, first serve basis. The pins in those select brackets will be $10 each, and come with a free holographic vinyl sticker.\n",
      "After that, the Kickstarter exclusive pricing will be $11 each.\n",
      "- If you would like to pledge for more than 10 pins, all you have to do is add $11 per pin to your pledge! -\n",
      "The holographic sticker will also be available as a pledge add-on, which will be discussed more in the \"Extras\" section - on to the pins!\n",
      " All of the stretch goal pins will be:\n",
      "With the campaign having been so successfully funded in such a short amount of time, I've decided to add some additional bonus designs! These designs were not originally a part of the campaign, but after much request, will now be as well! Due to the fact that they were not a part of the initial campaign, designs may be subject to slight modifications after approval from the manufacturer. Any updates to these designs will be announced as needed.\n",
      " Exclusive to this project, I'm making an extra special holographic sticker! They will be weather safe, and UV coated, so you may blind your enemies with shiny moon-powered love, either inside or outside!\n",
      "While Early Bird participants will be getting this sticker for free, you can also pledge for it by itself, or add it into your pin pledge! The holographic stickers will be $4 each. \n",
      "You may add as many stickers as you'd like to your pledge, just by adding 4 times the amount of stickers you'd like. For example: If you'd like one pin, but two stickers, you would add $8 to your $11 pledge. It's that easy! You will be able to specify that quantity to me when you get your backer survey.\n",
      "Once this project is over, this sticker will be gone forever! \n",
      "Additional Pins - If you would like more pins than currently offered as a reward tier, you may absolutely add on any additional pins from the entire collection (including the Crystal Bunny pin!) for $11 each! When I send out the backer survey, you will be able to specify how many of which pins you'd like.\n",
      "The campaign has officially hit 10k!! I am absolutely astounded by your support for this project, and as we continue to hit new milestones, I'll be announcing new free gifts! \n",
      " ((Sample image courtesy of StickerApp, sample designs by @AskSweetCream on Twitter)) \n",
      "For every pin pledged, all backers will now receive a FREE 2\" tall metallic chrome sticker to match! So if you've pledged for let's say one Mercury pin, you will receive one free matching Mercury sticker! If you've pledged for the Full Collection - Bonus Edition . . . that's right! you'll receive a free sticker for all 15 pin designs! \n",
      "If you would like additional chrome stickers, you are more than welcome to add them to your pledge for $2 each! I will have a fully comprehensive backer survey at the end of the campaign to designate how many of which kinds of additional stickers you'd like, as well as your pin selection. \n",
      "As a thank you for sharing the project for me, I'll be including a free galaxy aesthetic lanyard with every backer's pledge (please note this does not include the \"Lunar Love\" tier - only for those who are getting items shipped to them!)!  \n",
      "They'll be 2 cm wide, galaxy print, with a matching aesthetic to the campaign imagery. You'll be able to put your pins on it without it clashing, or you'll be able to just have a space themed lanyard for whatever use you'd like! I know I'm gonna use mine for holding my con badges! They'll also feature my Little Lunar Bun on them, though the placement may change to the back of the neck.   \n",
      "For those of you who do share the project, be sure to tag me (@LittleLunarRabbitDesigns on both Instagram and Facebook - if your Instgram account is set to private, be sure to take a screenshot and send it to me, otherwise I might not see it!) and be entered to win a FREE Sailor Guardian Spirit Jersey! \n",
      " That's right! \"The Moonlight is a Messenger of Love\" design is officially unlocked as a 2 inch soft enamel, rainbow plated key chain with a matching heart shaped clasp! This bonus item is free to anyone who pledges for 3 or more pins!\n",
      "So. Everything looks good, you've made your pledge, and now you're just . . . waiting. Here's the projected timeline for how everything will go: \n",
      "Added into this timeline is a production buffer, should the manufacturer need additional time to complete the pins. Please keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and while I will absolutely do my best to stick to it, these are still human made items that may require a little patience. Any delays will be very transparently addressed in a timely manner. My full time job is also that of a stay at home mom, so packaging pins may also take me some time.\n",
      "And that's just about it guys! Thank you so much for stopping by, for your pledges so far, and for all the support you continue to give! If you'd like to help out in a non-financial way, I've created two images (square format and \"stories\" format) that you could use to share the project outside of Kickstarter! It would mean the WORLD to me if we could get to that 15K stretch goal! And if you'd like to tag me in any posts, I'm @LittleLunarRabbitDesigns on Instagram, and @LilLunarRabbit on Twitter! Thanks again! \n",
      "Square:\n",
      "Stories:\n",
      " As I mentioned before, I'm Sam. An avid Sailor Moon fan (collector, fan artist and even cosplayer!), with a fantastical love of all things space themed. As a girl, I used to sit after school and get insanely hyped for Sailor Moon to come on, and then later that very night hang out on our back deck with my dad, looking up at the stars with our Polaris telescope. \n",
      "While my life didn't take me down the path of astronomy, I have always held the stars close to my heart, and try to incorporate them into as much of my life and art as possible. Crossing that with my love for Sailor Moon was an absolute no-brainer. \n",
      "My professional art journey actually started with Sailor Moon, as my first real series work ever completed. To date, I've drawn all ten scouts, Tuxedo Mask and Luna's human form, with more characters planned for the future. With each drawing, I created an emblem to pair with each portrait, which sparked one of my most successful lines to date. The pins here are variants of those very emblems, with a new twist, specific to these pin designs. \n",
      "To see more of my work, you're more than welcome to follow me on all of my social media platforms!\n",
      "Facebook || Instagram || Tumblr || Twitter || Etsy\n",
      "Before I wrap this up, I wanted to take a couple moments to thank those who have helped me so much throughout this project, from advice on how to start this project, to the pin production itself, all the way to annoying little design questions. I wouldn't have felt the confidence I do in running this campaign without their help.\n",
      "Vivian Tong || Sketchbeetle Art - Sheila Wong || Sheila Wong Design & Illustration - Salt Squad Queen || SharkCafeArt - Mellanie Chafe || LuniaraMC\n",
      "And lastly, my own personal cheer-leading squad - Daci, Toni, Kat, Kieran, and my husband. \n",
      "A little late, but a super important one that I missed - Santana. Without her final push, honestly, I wouldn't have thought this was possible. \n",
      " The benefit about Kickstarter is that while the campaign is running, everything is risk free. You can change your mind not only about how much you pledge, but also if you want to pledge at all. While I genuinely hope you'll be here for the whole journey, I do understand if you need to back out! \n",
      "A couple of things to remember:\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "While this is my first Kickstarter campaign, and only my second time taking on pins, I am very confident in my abilities to be able to fulfill whatever level of rewards we end up unlocking! I do currently run a successful Etsy shop, and customer service is very important to me. Any issues that come up will be transparently addressed, and I will do my best to resolve them in whatever capacity I can. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have also been working very closely with other artists who have run very successful enamel pin campaigns for advice and feedback. \n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to message me with any questions!\n",

      "Mes expositions  « Collages & Photomontages » en Islande 2019\n",
      "Des collages ! Voilà plus de 40 ans que j'en réalise. Tout d'abord sur papier, dans mes jeunes années, cela aboutira à 3 expositions en Provence (France) dans les années 80' qui remporteront un certain succès. Je pressens les potentialités du numérique dans ce domaine particulier, mais je reste « timide » bien que techniquement toujours très investi...\n",
      "Puis arrive la Révolution Numérique généralisée, mes Collages & Photomontages reprennent depuis 2017 mais sous une forme résolument numérique et désormais en ultra haute définition avec des programmes informatiques extraordinaires de finesse et de précision.\n",
      "En 2018, j'éprouve l'impérieux désir de franchir le pas : exposer, montrer, s'exposer aussi d'une certaine façon ... au regard d'autrui. Un plaisir et une souffrance...\n",
      "Le lieu sera vite choisi, l'ISLANDE, mon pays d'adoption où j'ai déjà vécu plusieurs années et où une bonne partie de ma famille réside. Je soumets un pré-projet d'exposition en 2018 au Musée National de Reykjavik qui sera rapidement accepté : un bel encouragement ! Le thème retenu sera : Beauty and the Beast, 21 tableaux réalisés en 1 an spécialement pour l'occasion\n",
      "Deux lieux d'exposition me sont attribués, l'un à Reykjavik (Juin et Juillet 2019), l'autre à Akureyri (Août et Septembre 2019). Par ailleurs j'explore de nouvelles opportunités en Islande (2019-2020) mais aussi en Suisse et en Allemagne pour l'avenir le plus proche.\n",
      "La difficulté, vous pouvez-vous en douter, se révèle être assez rapidement financière. Je découvre l'envers du décor : les coûts de fabrication, de transports, d'importation (de France à Islande), ainsi que toute la logistique afférente : catalogues imprimées, tirages tests en haute définition, affiches multilingues, voire cartes postales en couleurs et autres produits dérivés...\n",
      "Je ne suis qu'un très modeste enseignant, Artiste en dilettante d'une certaine façon, inconnu ou du moins méconnu du public, et n'aspirant qu'à exposer des œuvres que je considère personnellement comme très atypiques et originales.\n",
      "Il ne suffit (hélas) pas de créer, d'imaginer, d'exprimer ; il faut également utiliser les techniques d'impression les plus modernes et les plus sophistiquées, projeter les formats (qui peuvent être géants véritablement, un vrai bonheur), ajuster les échelles d'impression, définir des profils de couleurs pour obtenir les meilleurs résultats graphiques. \n",
      "Il faut choisir les qualités d'impression, les formes, les tailles, les encadrements, les modes d'accrochage. Il faut tenter l'excellence avec de petits moyens logistiques. \n",
      "Tout cela a un coût qui excède en bonne part mes moyens ordinaires : c'est la raison pour laquelle je fais aujourd'hui (et pour la première fois dans ma vie) appel à vos dons !\n",
      "Vous pouvez m'aider ... à aller au bout de ce projet artistique. Vous pouvez me permettre de réaliser dans les meilleures conditions, ces deux expositions islandaises (publiques et gratuites) prévues pour l'été 2019.\n",
      "C'est maintenant, là, presque tout de suite car le temps passe vite !\n",
      "Je compte sur vous ! Vous pouvez compter sur moi....\n",
      "Amicales pensées, Michel S.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Le seul vrai risque aujourd'hui, à titre personnel, serait de susciter de l'indifférence ! Un risque que tout artiste prend lorsqu'il S'EXPOSE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Car une exposition change la donne : l'indifférence (aux autres) est je crois nécessaire à la CREATION mais elle devient mortifère sous le regard d'autrui, lorsque l'on fait le pas de SE MONTRER...\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus prosaïquement, si je n'arrive pas à assurer la LOGISTIQUE de ces expositions prévues et en partie planifiées, c'est le risque du découragement, de l'amertume voire même de l’abandon du projet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Je pourrais exprimer cela sous une forme plus énigmatique : je ne suis pas certain d'avoir du goût pour cette soif de vivre, mais j'ai faim d'avoir soif !\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "My name is Artimus Wolz and I am an artist, filmmaker, and comedian who is raising funds for my debut comedy album titled 'CHAOS'. With your help, I can bring this project into existence.\n",
      "The concept for CHAOS came after the success of my viral comedy TikTok 'Incompedance' which satirizes the relationship phenomenon known as weaponized incompetence. After amassing over 8 million views with more than 200,000 listens on Spotify, I began planning a full length comedy album. My vision for CHAOS is a piece of art that not only makes you laugh but also provides the cathartic feeling found only when confronting your inner trauma.\n",
      "I want to establish a new style of comedy that pushes humor to the brink of its own destruction. To make an album that makes you laugh, cry, dance, scream at the top of your lungs and, ultimately, rejoice, by embracing the painful parts of life as a path to reclaiming power--like a lifelong fever break.  I want to create CHAOS. \n",
      "With your support I'll be able to bring this album to fruition. The funds will be used for studio time during the month of March to produce the album, marketing materials for the release, and personal living expenses during production. Targeted release date is Summer 2022.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Once the project is funded, I'll be able to start production on the album full time in March. I expect the production of the album and the film special to be about two months. There is the possibility I need a little more time due to unimaginable creative reasons but no matter what, this project will be completed in Summer 2022. I am working with a very talented artist and printing expert to ensure the non-digital rewards (stickers/posters) are ready to ship by the time the kickstarter campaign is complete. Higher tiers delivery will a little longer as the Cassette won't be ready until the album is mastered.\n",

      "Why do we need the donations?  What will they be used for? \n",
      "We need to buy many items for the garden from the straw bales that will be the foundation of the garden since we have a cement back yard, to soaking hoses, a repair that just materialized - fixing the outside water spigot (which broke with the deep freeze we had this winter) the seedlings (organic and GMO free) the support brackets for the climbing plants, gardening tools, rain collection barrels, lady bugs, some soil, gloves for the volunteers, and the list goes on.\n",
      "We also want to give each person that is receiving food for their family from the local food pantries a free copy of the recipe book Good and Cheap - How to eat on $4/day by Leanne Brown along with some produce from the garden as well as cooking lessons and nutrition education and so much more.  \n",

Unfortunately, right before my book was to be worked on, the company closed down. Since I believe there is a reason for everything, I pushed on and kept searching for a home. I went on to submit to another publisher and was accepted, only to have that publisher fold as well.\n",

      "My Own Private Hollywood (or MOPH, for short) is an independently owned film festival that travels from city to city exhibiting short and feature-length films and movies from creatives all over the world--although, for now, we're limiting submissions to those from the U.S.  Each year, we select projects that are fresh, illuminating and unconventional enough to not only showcase the producers' talents but also tell original stories and captivate new audiences.  Our objective is to not necessarily push creatives to Hollywood but pull \"Hollywood\" to them by allowing individuals to start their own production companies and improve their local economies.  \n",
      "Our mission is to enhance the marketing, distributing and merchandising opportunities for creatives worldwide, allowing them to successfully enter the entertainment industry without facing adversity, prejudice or nepotism.  We feel that if \"unknowns\" display their works in venues and arenas outside the internet, they can penetrate more markets, capture wider audiences, discover merchandising opportunities not yet realized and obtain greater recognition.  Their bold endeavors might even influence other hopefuls to pursue their dreams as well, ultimately allowing aspiring moviemakers to lead better, more fulfilled lives.  \n",
      "You can learn more about MOPH or submit content at http://events.the1613s.net/moph/. \n",
      "We plan to host MOPH in one of Seattle's theaters, colleges or interior settings.  At the site, a patron may pay $5 for a single ticket and at least $1 for a food or drink item.  The ticket pays for his/her admission to the event, from the moment of receipt to the end of its course.  If you receive a forever ticket, you can attend MOPH for free once a year.  This ticket doesn't pay for concessions--although we do offer vouchers for that--and CAN'T be transferred or sold to another individual.  Upon entering the screening room, our staff will validate your ticket, allowing you to exit and return to the site if needed.  \n",
      "50% of revenue generated from ticket and concession sales during the event, sans the Washington state sales tax, will be equally disbursed to all creatives whose content appeared in the festival.  These payments are their royalties.  The other 50% will go to MOPH itself.  The payee of a royalty is the individual or company that submitted the featured content.  If the payee receives more than $600, he/she/it will be required to complete a W-9, after which he/she/it we receive a check of his/her/its earnings and, after the start of the new year, a 1099-MISC, which the IRS requires both parties to file.  \n",
      "The amount a creative receives in royalty is determined by the number of products sold.  For example, if 200 $5 tickets and 400 $3 snacks at an event with 20 individuals or companies exhibiting content, each creative will receive $55, whether or not he/she/it attends MOPH.  Because your pledge buys you a ticket, 50% of it will also go to the creatives.  The other 50% [of your pledges] will go to MOPH, used for the expenses listed below.  \n",
      "Creatives whose work is chosen to appear in MOPH will receive an email [from us] asking if he/she/it would like to display a resume and headshot at the site.  We plan to invite not only patrons but also local filmmakers, TV outlets and other such people in the [film/TV/media] industry to watch our creatives' content, review their materials and converse with them.  \n",
      "Creatives may also showcase and sell their own merchandise, such as DVDs, toys, T-shirts, etc., promoting their or other people's work.  Merchandisers keep 100% of the income they collect [from their sales].  \n",
      "After the film fest, we plan to host a mingle session where creatives, industry insiders and patrons can chat and network [with each other].  We'll have more confirmed info about MOPH's site location, the movies we've chosen [to appear], and everything else by June 30, 2017.  \n",

      "Sometime after MOPH 2017, we plan to exhibit and distribute our creatives featured and non-featured submissions on the official 1613 Productions website, which is still in development.  Here, users can watch, download and purchase copies of their favorite MOPH content.  The launch of this site of course depends of the success of the events.  If MOPH 2017 shows promise, we'll start constructing the 1613 Productions site sometime after January 2018.  We’ll keep everybody informed of its progress via or Facebook (http://facebook.com/gomoph), Twitter (http://twitter.com/themophevent) and Google+ (http://plus.google.com/114569763683513917816/) pages.  \n",
      "After a few years, again, depending on MOPH success, we'd like to produce a film/movie showcase featuring everybody's favorite content to appear on Netflix, Hulu or even cable TV.  Each season's showcase could coincide with the previous year(s) content.  \n",

One could use it year-after-year or hold on to it until MOPH visits a region close by (go to http://events.the1613s.net/moph/about.php#cities to see the cities we plan to visit).  The ticket contains ten (10) slots, one of which to be stamped per event.  After it's been exhausted, we'll automatically send the ticket holder a replacement ticket [to be used for another ten years].

If we can't secure an interior site, however, we'll consider hosting MOPH outside, which may require a permit [from the city].

      "\"As a transaction, taking a photograph sounds free and easy, but like most things, quickly complicates. The currency of Carl Martin’s pictures is the cash of curiosity; time well spent in the presence of a new neighbor, in a friend’s backyard. Earnest, ongoing delight in discovering a new way to witness what’s familiar.These are pictures of persistent freshness.\" - Michael David Murphy\n",
      "My practice for over twenty-five years has been to acknowledge and elevate existing culture using the intersection of subtle human gesture and a built social environment. Say, a casual side glance, a slight shifting of weight on one leg, the fold and tone of a particular arm, or the slight body twist and raising of face just over the shoulder to engage a viewer, within a sub or urban setting. I think that artists create moments with perspective and gesture to define a new entity. I believe that these entities can speak to our humanity and experience as human beings and communicate a link and alignment within ourselves to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work in this book spans the decade of the 1990ʻs to about 2001 or so. During that time period I was lucky enough to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship to support this project. There are several bodies of work within this project that have amalgamated as a single entity, which, as I write this, has no overarching title. The collections within the work, all made in Athens, GA, are specifically: Men Of Georgia, Towards Salvage, Elevator, Downtowners, and Systems of Organization. The smaller bodies of work within the project represent different conceptual approaches to the culture of a small town; I would try to convince myself that I was “doing something entirely new” only to realize later that my stance was very much the same, looking at the same material with a slightly different framework. It was like peeling an onion, different layers but the same onion, and not from a traveler's perspective, but as a working member of the community. I hope the amalgamated body of work speaks clearly about the experience of being human and communicates a link and alignment within ourselves to others. The goal has always been to “construct” an image, almost like a building, from the raw elements that we find in our community. My thoughts are that this structural framework would give an image a sculptural presence, a little bit of power, that could allow it to reach an audience and hence allow the subject a rightful due of attention.\n",

      "\"The Carl Martin photographs, taken in Athens, Georgia, over a span of 25 years is a meditation on the nature of what it is for a human being to see and be seen – how do we present ourselves to the world and how is that presentation received – what does it mean?  Ultimately this is not a document that is specific to a place or time. It is more akin to a universal canvasing and inventory of the human condition in the ordinary.  Yet this plain, clear taking-in with a camera and film places us in closer touch with the quirky, transcendent living presence of Carl's Athens, Georgia, neighbors and friends than you might have ever have imagined possible. We feel we are looking through Carl’s eyes. And we are amazed. Supported by a Guggenheim Fellowship these photographs found Carl and fortunately they have now found us all.  A beautiful, truthful portrait in almost 60 pictures of  our time and place and people.

      "I am an author with several years of amateur fiction-writing experience and professional nonfiction-writing experience. I write, edit, and produce both fiction reviews and writing advice videos on YouTube on a weekly basis, but my dream has always been to write fiction professionally. If this Kickstarter campaign succeeds, I will have realized that dream—however briefly.\n",
      "For this Kickstarter campaign, I plan on writing a YA novel about Iliana Rostov, a young girl who has recently begun her freshman year at high school. Iliana loves to be popular and the center of attention, but her guilty pleasure is that she also loves to read old books. This passion of hers leads her to an old bookstore, really just a hole in the wall of a strip mall, and while there she discovers that its proprietor, James Mayfield, is a practitioner of real black magic. This fascinates Iliana, and so the rest of the story will be her learning black magic as his part-time apprentice.\n",
      "The setting for the novel will be a fictional city in the American Midwest. The format will be mostly episodic, and so the book will consist of loosely connected short stories that will build to a climax in the final section. Each section will focus on a different aspect of magical theory, a different magical danger or threat, and a different opportunity for Iliana to grow and mature.\n",
      "The main hook for the novel is that I will be referencing real magical practices that people actually use to this day. That means stuff like Hermetic demon summoning, alchemy, kabbalah, Tarot readings, and auguries. You know all those conservative parents who worry that Dungeons and Dragons leads to Satanism or that the Harry Potter books teach witchcraft? I want this novel to be their worst nightmare. However, I also want the book to be instructional without being dry and to teach wholesome life lessons about the value of friendship, the usefulness of a broad education, the need for self-reflection, and so on.\n",
      "The sum I'm asking for will go in its entirety to pay for my living expenses so that I can work on the novel full-time. Last year I managed to write a 70,000-word novel in under four months, and I believe I can do so again. Since the book will be episodic, I estimate that each episode will be around 10,000 words and thus consist of between 5-10 stories.\n",
      "While I would be perfectly happy if this project somehow reached its initial goal, if a miracle happens and we exceed the goal by $1000 it will enable me to continue writing for longer; I will therefore add one more story that I originally planned to the book and open one more story prompt for someone to claim. In the unlikely event that pledges keep coming, I will continue adding stories for every $1000 extra.\n",

      "After the meal, Marty started teaching Nella some new spells. He said it was because she was the best person to cast spells now that he couldn’t use his hands. That made her happy, but it didn’t make her surprised. Her mommy always told her she was good at learning quick, and her daddy had so much trouble flying when all he had to do was pretend to fall up or sideways. She still liked flying in a plane more since she could relax, but magic was getting more and more fun now that she was learning all the things it could do.\n",
      "The first rule was that you always had to touch the thing you wanted to cast a spell on. But you could get around that a little by casting spells on the air and then moving the air. It made saying the spell harder and cost more argen-ton, though. You could also put a spell in a stone and then throw the stone at someone, but doing that cost a lot, too. So if you could do something by touching it, you touched it.\n",
      "The second rule was that you had to think about exactly what you wanted when you cast a spell. If you thought about anything else, bad stuff happened. Stuff like people blowing up or turning inside-out, or rooms lighting on fire. Nella knew Marty wasn’t just trying to scare her, because he looked scared too when he told her about it. Maybe that’s why he was a scaredy sheep? Because he saw someone turn inside-out? She almost asked him that, but then she remembered that her mommy told her how questions like that were rude.\n",

      "Featured in The Oak House will be gourmet coffees sourced from around the globe, each with an amazing story to tell. Craft beers and fine wines will be hand selected for quality and variety, each accompanied with fun facts and tasting notes. Artisan fare including delectable chocolates, and locally made cheeses, breads and pastries will be available for purchase as you sit and study on one of our leather couches or laptop tables (handcrafted in Durham, from responsibly sourced white oak).  Enjoy live music, readings, and even lectures near the small corner stage or work with a group at our large 12 foot, 12 inch table (hand crafted in NC from reclaimed vintage wood).\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Hi there!\n",
      "Thanks for checking us out! Let us introduce ourselves first!\n",
      "We are Mycotech, a biotech startup company based in Bandung, Indonesia that dedicates ourselves to saving the world by using one of the Earth’s most overlooked resources  — mushrooms.\n",
      "When we started our business in Bandung in 2012 as gourmet mushroom producers, we realized that there is so much more to mushrooms than meets the eye. We initiated our research by using what limited resources we can find — our mother’s pressure cookers. \n",
      "What started as menial experiments quickly turned into one of our most explored research. While looking into the fast-growing infrastructure development in Indonesia, we discovered BIOBO, a mycelium board composite that uses no harmful chemicals as binder agents.\n",
      "Our mission? Delivering sustainable & affordable material from renewable resources — designed in style.\n",
      "#sustainabilityproject\n",
      "Now, we are excited to introduce to you the technology that can definitely replace animal & petroleum-based leather — Mylea™️!\n",
      "Textile is one of the most toxic industries in the world, and leather-processing is a very dangerous contributor to this business. When more people are interested in fashion, the consumption of bags as fashion items are also rising – and more animals are slaughtered. Almost one billion cows are killed each year, not counting the rare animals going extinct because they are being hunted for their skin. \n",
      "Between the tannery and the dye house, leather also receives multiple applications of chemical preservatives, colorants, stiffeners, and modifiers - chemicals that are dangerous to the environment and human health. \n",
      "Indonesians have already developed sophisticated biotechnology for the culinary department - one of them is Tempeh! Now, it's time to explore the possibilities!\n",
      "Tempeh, the traditional Indonesian dish, is made by combining white soybeans with fungus named Rhizopus oligosporus. The fungus's mycelium binds the soybeans together and made them solid. If you haven't had this delicacy, you're definitely missing out.\n",
      "However, we're more focused on how the mycelium binds the soybeans together  — and the method is what first inspired us into creating & developing bio leather that we named Mylea™️! \n",
      "#notleatherbutbetter\n",
      "Mylea is one of the products we present to save the world. It is the answer for questions thrown by the ethicals in the fashion business. \n",
      "Instead of making it to be eaten, we make it for fashion. And instead of soybeans, we recycle agricultural waste as growth medium.\n",
      "It’s not leather, but it’s better!\n",
      "#veganleather #notleatherbutbetter #savetheenvironment\n",
      "Unlike regular leather that needs to be dyed numerous times, Mylea™️ can absorb dye faster & better, resulting in cheaper production cost & more vibrant colors. Oh, we're only using natural dye extracted from leaf, roots, and even food waste to add colors to Mylea. Trust us when we say the colors are much more unique.\n",
      " So, why an alternative to leather? The regular one's just as good, right? \n",
      "Well, while the two are strong & sustainable, one uses extravagant number of resources, and the other needs only a few days & some water to grow & cultivate.\n",
      "Need the comparison, complete with numbers? Here's one for you.\n",
      "#environmental \n",
      "The numbers are great and all  —  but does it actually able to work like leather would?\n",
      "Instead of telling you all about it, we'll just show you what we've done with Mylea.\n",
      "Meet our newest collaboration work and the first wooden-mushroom watch to be made  —  the Pala X Mylea Watch.\n",
      "Collaborating with Pala Nusantara, one of the most prominent wooden watch maker in Indonesia, is a step to the right direction to save the world and maximizing the use of resources while saving them at the same time.\n",
      "Our watch is the perfect company for people who move about the world, and it's always nice to keep tabs on our necessities. And no worries, the Mycelium strap works just like regular leather  —  only greener!\n",
      "For you who prefer the classic pen-and-paper method of keeping notes, our traveler's journal is the one you need in your hands. \n",
      "We joined forces with Vitarlenology — local Indonesian book designer, crafter, and binder  — to create this beautiful, luxurious, and easily-customized journal to be with you every step you take around the Earth.\n",
      "While jumping from one location to another, don't forget to keep your cash & cards on hand. Carrying a thick, heavy wallet might not be efficient enough for you, so here we present a solution for you agile folks. \n",
      "The result of our collaboration with Cavcraft — local Bandung leather artisan — is a Mycelium Card Wallet that's small, concise, and can fit up to 4 cards  — plus room to spare for your cash & coins. \n",
      " Have we mentioned that it's small enough to be hanged around your neck & still look cool? \n",
      "It's the perfect thing to complete your casual-work look! \n",
      "Thank you for supporting Mycotech & helping us create a sustainable future! For you who pledged S$10+, we will be sending you up-to-date news about our project & a digital hand-written thank-you note to your e-mail. \n",
      "For those of you who pledge S$25+, congratulations! You've secured your Mycelium Traveler's Journal! If you missed our first bid, it's okay  — you can still get 30% off the S$50 regular price or get 56% cut by pledging for double!\n",
      "If you pledge for more than S$45+, we will get you your very own Mycelium Card Wallet & send it to your doorstep! If you hurry, you can get 36% cut from the retail price of S$70 or 56% by pledging more than S$56!\n",
      "If you pledge S$125+, we'll make sure that you get our beloved Pala X Mylea Watch & have it complete your look when you've had it in your hands. The mini is a special edition, so you can only get it in pairs with the regular-size!\n",
      "Pledge S$310+ and get the ultimate package of Pala X Mylea Watch, Mylea Card Wallet, and Traveler's Journal to be the first to know that saving the world doesn't have to sacrifice your fashion statement or your note-taking habit.\n",
      "Or you can jump straight to S$1000+ to get double the products! You can keep them for yourself or share them with your friends and family. Beware: this is a limited offer, and you'll get two very limited Mycelium Pouch to complete the package!\n",
      "Please include the amount of shipping cost needed in your pledge by clicking the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button that sits next to Kickstarter Video. \n",
      "Also, bear in mind that any duty or taxes on import into your country will be your responsibility, so take extra care on those potential costs.\n",
      "The average number of days for shipping vary based upon origin and destination, so please be patient for your package. If we've sent them your way, you'd know  — and we cannot wait to see your reaction of our Pala X Mylea Watch!\n",
      "Here's the thing — we've made a schedule & limited our pledging time until the middle of March, so make sure to pledge before time runs out!\n",
      "Here's the complete timeline for the interested souls out there.\n",
      "We'll keep you posted on new updates regarding our project!  \n",
      "This Kickstarter project is our first step as we are taking an effort in scaling up our production, do a standardization, certification and optimization to improve our current production to fulfill a larger market demand while also improving the research to explore more in sustainable materials and make it possible for everyone to use it in many applications.\n",
      "Thank you so much for your support!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Mylea is a new material that is still under development. We are aware that there is still room for improvement to reach the highest quality as well as to scale up the production efficiently that might reduce the cost of production in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we grow the material in-house, it may take a bit more time to set up our to-scale production facility. However, our production facility is ready to grow the leather demand up to 1000 wallet/month.\n",
      "\n",
      "While, as with anything, there can be surprises, we feel confident we can deliver this product on schedule by Fall of 2019. Leading up to delivery date, we will do our absolute best to respond to all of your inquiries as promptly as possible, keep you up to date on our progress, and work as hard as we can to get you your Mylea product as soon as possible.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Hey,\n",
      "I'm Liz and i'm the creator and owner of The Snarky Company. I'm a photographer, artist, pin maker, and this is the third Kickstarter i've launched. I've worked as a freelance photographer, lived abroad in England,  traveled around Europe photographing different countries, I have a full time job at a rad tech startup, I own a pin company, I have both a bachelors and a masters degree, and my baking skills are Great British Bake Off level. All of that sounds really great on paper, but what that paper doesn't tell you, is that I struggled through hours and hours of work, and frustration, to accomplish those things...i've got ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. First and foremost, ADHD is my main squeeze, anxiety and depression are a result of living with ADHD.\n",
      "As is common with girls and women, I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until later in life. When a psychiatrist first said \"My professional opinion is that you have ADHD\", I just didn't believe her. I was a good kid, did marching band for 8 years, I did really well in school, and I was at the top of my class during my undergrad – surely she was mistaken. \n",
      "I researched the f*ck out of ADHD. The more I read, the more I realized that I carried the same misconceptions and ideologies that the general population does. I thought ADHD meant that you had trouble concentrating or sitting still. What I learned is that everything about ADHD is so complex, that it borders on being incomprehensible at times. Even the term Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is misleading and incorrect in describing what it is. The symptoms, the brain chemistry, the cognition, the neurological and genetic theories, are so far beyond \"not being able to pay attention\".  Every time I did research, and read about other people's stories, it was like someone was telling a story from my life. \n",
      "I studied film and media theory for my undergraduate degree, so for my master's degree I chose the Film, Photography, and Media studies program at Leeds University in England. One of the best things about studying media, is that it is so pervasive, that you can study pretty much any topic. The concentration of my master's degree was studying the representation of people with mental illnesses, and the associated stigma, through media, from the 19th century to the present (talk about getting really niche. I studied everything, from how people with mental illness were represented, to associated stigmas and their detrimental effects to all of society, and even what happens in the brain of a person with a mental illness, when they consume media. This resulted in a 42 page thesis and a photo essay that took a look into the small and intricate cues of my \"disorder\". Getting a post-graduate degree with ADHD was arduous, but at that time, I did it without stimulant drugs like adderall, and I graduated with honors. \n",
      "One of my dreams in life is to give a TED talk on ADHD, breaking down how the ADHD brain works, and what life is like living in a world where your brain works differently. I would gladly sit here and debunk whatever misconceptions are out there, but then we'd be here for years. This is just my story, but the whole campaign isn't just focused around ADHD. Needless to say, mental illness, mental health, and stigma are topics that are very near and dear to my heart. I have wanted to create this project for a very, very long time.\n",
      "You'll find that the first 9 pins of this project focus only on ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. I am aware that they are not the only mental illnesses that exist in this world. In fact, there are a multitude of different illnesses, disorders, and conditions. Mental health is unique to everyone, so I can only speak from my own experiences. While I would love to branch out and make pins for other illnesses, so that everyone feels heard and represented, I don't feel like I can interpret an illness that I have not experienced or lived through. I don't feel that I have that authority. \n",
      "While these pins are based off of my experiences, my hope is that maybe you'll find a pin that you can also relate to. If any of these pins resonate with you, remember that you're not alone, because I, as well as millions of other people, have gone through the same struggle. We may experience our illnesses in our own unique ways, but there are some common stigmas and experiences that we have all had to face. I also understand that some people may disagree with what I have to say, and that's totally cool, no one is forcing you to pledge to the campaign. \n",
      "When I was first diagnosed with three mental illnesses, I felt guilty, selfish, like I was a burden. I didn't want to believe it to be true about myself. I went to therapy, tried some medications, and kept it all on the down low. Then over the course of 6 years, in my early adulthood, I went through experiences that were traumatic for me. Soon after that it just kind of clicked for me. I was sitting in my room and out loud to myself I just said \"This is so f*cking dumb. I didn't choose this, my mental health problems are not my fault. Why have I allowed other people to dictate how I feel about my own life?\" It may have just been something I gained from age, or from some empowering sociology classes in college, but my best guess is that I came face to face with one of my deepest fears. Ever since then I have been 100% percent honest and open about my mental health, and the fact that I take medication and go to therapy. I realized that if you can just be a genuine person, and communicate honestly and openly to others, you'll learn that there are so many other people fighting the same fight, that have the same fears that you do.\n",
      "When someone stigmatizes you, for whatever reason, they're exerting power over you. This doesn't mean that they're always doing it maliciously, sometimes it's out of sheer ignorance or lack of knowledge. When I was younger, if someone called you a slut, it was an insult. If someone were to call me that today, i'd probably find it funny and laugh. It's a good example of a word that carried a stigma, and instead of fearing that stigma, overtime, women just took ownership of the word. We started speaking out about slut shaming, and about how women should be able to be open about their sexuality. Women took ownership of that label, and once we owned it, we took the power back. \n",
      "If someone tells me i'm being over emotional, I say \"yeah? so what. What's wrong with showing emotion?\" People don't know how to respond to that because then they have to admit, out loud, the unspoken rule that we always have to keep our emotions in check. A really sh*tty ex once called me crazy and erratic when I became emotional and anxious, from discovering his unfaithful activities and compulsive lying. Needless to say, that relationship did not last, and it has been over for some time. When we first got together, I had failed to see the red flag when he told me \"his ex had depression and emotional problems, and that she was crazy\". Recently, we had contact where we got on the topic of our relationship. He told me that he couldn't be calm and faithful when someone, (meaning me) was so volatile. Ironically, I had never even raised my voice at him, until I found out what he was doing behind my back. Let me interpret what he was really saying, \"I was unfaithful, and I didn't like your emotional and behavioral response to that, so that justifies my unfaithfulness.\" He tried to stigmatize my ADHD by saying I was erratic. He used my ADHD and anxiety as a scapegoat so he couldn't be held responsible for the pain he had caused me. At that time in our relationship, I had responded with a completely unapologetic emotional response. Did I take the high road, probably not. I said some terrible things out of anger, and did a few things out of pettiness. A good amount of time has passed since then, but from our last encounter a few months back, it's clear he hasn't changed. Many people have asked why I stayed so long. He had his own mental health issues, addictions, and vices, and for the longest time I was patient, forgiving, and I made every attempt to be understanding and to not stigmatize his issues...but I was not met with the same compassion. Indeed this is a long story of an ex, that involved so many more factors, but the importance here, is that this was the most traumatic time that anyone had ever used a mental health stigma to manipulate me, shame me, and take away my power. For a long time I was angry that I let someone do that to me, I felt weak, like I wasn't the strong, independent woman I wanted to be, but it was the most pivotal moment in my life. It was the moment I realized that if I just took ownership, than my ex, or anyone else, could never have that power over me again. I owned the stigma he tried to place on me, I took the power back, and I became a stronger, more empathetic, and caring person. \n",
      "When this Kickstarter meets its base goal, the first three brain pins will be unlocked. All pins after that will be unlocked when they hit their \"funds raised goal\". The pins will first be sold at an early bird price of $8 per pin, however, there are a limited quantity of early bird spots. When the early bird spots are gone, each pin will sell for $10 each, unless noted elsewhere. This campaign involves 20+ pin designs. More pins will be uncovered as our funding increases. All pins in this campaign are hard enamel, unless noted elsewhere.\n",

      "The Once Daily pin is the first time we are experimenting with new materials. The left side of the pill will be filled, by hand, with a special epoxy. This is so we can create the look of a pill with one colored half of the capsule, and the other side clear. We've ordered a test batch of these pins from the manufacturer, because I personally will be filling each pin with the epoxy. If the test does not work, and we realize this was a bust, we'll still produce these pins. The only change is that the clear part you see on the left will be filled with stained glass enamel. Stained glass enamel is not clear, but it does create a unique look.\n",

      "The Mosaic Heart is a pin that will contain stained glass enamel. The white part you see is regular white enamel, but the colored sections will be stained glass enamel. This process means that all the colored spots will be cut outs, that are then filled with an epoxy/enamel mixture. This produces an opaque look, somewhat like, well stained glass. If you hold it up to the light, the colored parts will show some light. While stained glass enamel can be beautiful, it is sometimes hard to produce, and can be risky. The color of the stained glass may vary from pin to pin, and there is the possibility of a few very tiny bubbles in the enamel. These should be minor things you will barely notice. The most important thing to note here is that this process can be expensive. If you choose this pin as one of the designs for your pledge level, it will be the only time you'll be able to get it at that price. After this campaign ends, this pin will retail for somewhere between $12-$15. If you've never seen stained glass enamel, google it, and you should find some examples. \n",

      " I'm more than happy to create more label pins. I like fonts.\n",
      "If there is a label pin you'd like to request, please message me directly. Please message me with the mental illness, condition, or disorder, and how you think it should appear as a label. For example, if you have Bipolar Disorder, should the pin read Bipolar Disorder, or just Bipolar. Please also keep in mind that I will only create labels for another three conditions, because if I made one for every condition, we'd be here all damn day. Please don't message me with a physical illness or condition, for now  i'm only making these for mental illnesses recognized in the DSM-V. (i.e. Autism, Bipolar, PTSD, OCD, etc). I know there are some people who have qualms about \"labeling\". This pin isn't saying that your illness is all you are. I wear my ADHD related pins in hope that if someone wants to ask, i'm more than happy to answer any questions... and the next time my partner looks at my disorganized room with a smirk, i'm going to smile and point to this pin. Even though i'm only making another three label pins, this doesn't mean there that others won't appear in the future. Another note: It might seem that this stretch requires a much larger sum of funds raised to unlock. This is because even though these pins are small, they call for three seperate mold fees. Mold fees are paid only once, but they impact the cost when producing a new pin.   \n",

      "The other day I did a rough estimate of how many pins we’ll be manufacturing...and it was over 20K. That’s alot of pins which means alot of backing cards. Now I know there are some of you out there who collect backing cards, some of you just throw them away, and some of you even graciously offered to not have one, but I like backing cards. I like designing backing cards, I like quality cards, and even before I launched this campaign, I was designing the backing cards for it in my head. I wanted to try something new, and having a campaign with such a high volume of pins, meant that this was the time to try it. So here’s how the backing cards will work. We’ll be using 4”X6”, 22pt stock, postcards, and each card will hold 4-6 pins depending on size. If you purchase one 1-2 pins, you’ll receive your pins on a typical square backing card. If you purchase say 7 pins, then you might get 5 of them on a postcard and two on regular sized backing card. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to choose whether you receive postcards or individual backing cards, and you won’t be able to specify which pins go with which cards. While buying more than 20K regular backing cards is possible, it would mean we would have to cut the quality. I won’t do that for this campaign because I have a special idea in mind. Let’s say that you purchased 5 pins, so you’ll receive them all on a postcard, but you’re really adamant about a single, regular sized, backing card, because maybe you want to give one pin as a gift. In this case you’ll be able to purchase a single backing card in the add-ons section for 25 cents a piece. (also take note that freebie pins come in the regular factory bag and not on a backing card)\n",
      "After this Kickstarter campaign has ended, Kickstarter will collect the funds for your pledge level. If your payment is declined, Kickstarter allows you 7 days to \"fix\" your pledge. If you miss the 7 days, you will still have the opportunity to reinstate your pledge through your BackerKit survey. After these 7 days have passed, we will send you a survey from a pledge manager called BackerKit. This survey will first ask pledge level questions, this is where you designate which designs you want. Once you've finished your pledge questions, the designs you've chosen are automatically added to your item list. After pledge questions, you'll go through an add-ons section (sort of like an exit through gift shop situation) Add-ons are optional, and do not affect the items from your pledge level. We haven't posted pictures yet, but here are some things you can expect to find in the Add-Ons section.\n",

      "- Locking backs\n",
      "- Pins from previous campaigns or what we have in stock at that time\n",

      "Keep checking back, as i'll soon add the sticker design mockups. \n",
      "Below are the first four stickers for the add-ons section. There are more to come, and not all are just sticker versions of the pins. The stickers range in size from roughly 2\" - 5\". \n",

      "What is an Add-On Stretch Goal? \n",
      "The reason we use a pledge manager like BackerKit, is because it allows us to create more comprehensive surveys, and streamline our shipping process. BackerKit has a feature called an Add-On Stretch Goal. For my first campaign, I had an idea for a t-shirt design, but I didn't know if anyone would actually want to buy it. So I contacted some screen printing companies, priced out t-shirts, and then added it to the add-ons section of the survey. Three people ordered it. Whenever you manufacture a product, there's a minimum order quantity. The minimum quantity is usually the product at is highest price. To have t-shirts printed, I needed 50 people to order them, and that didn't happen. I ended up contacting those three people and letting know that I had removed the t-shirt from their order, and that they wouldn't be charged for it. \n",
      "The add-on stretch goal will show up in the add-on sections, and it'll have a banner that says something like \"Hey we need 50 people to make this happen\". As people add this item to their carts you can see whether this product is going to be made or not. When you complete your survey, if you add any extra items, you'll be prompted for your card details. You won't be charged when you complete your survey. You'll be charged at the lockdown date, and we'll notify you when that date is. If we don't meet the minimum quantity for an add-on stretch goal you may have ordered, then it is removed from your order, and you are not charged for it. This allows us to put out other products like patches, t-shirts, and key chains, to see if people actually respond to them. It's essentially a fail-safe, if we like a t-shirt design, but then find out no one else does, we aren't stuck manufacturing 50 t-shirts because only one person ordered it. \n",
      "We are still talking to manufacturers to work out pricing on all these items, so we don't have a price estimate at the moment. What we do know, is that we are offering add-on stretch goal items at a discounted price to Kickstarter backers only. If you pre-order these items after the campaign, you'll order them at full price. \n",
      "Below is a somewhat blurry photo of a chenille patch. The red and light green are the chenille, which is a soft fuzzy material. The seeds and stem are done in embroidery, and the black outline is felt. Chenille patches are often what you see on varsity letterman jackets. \n",

      "After the campaign ends, your funds will be drawn from Kickstarter, and then you will be sent a survey to pick out your rewards and add your shipping info. We will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to send out surveys. There will also be an add-ons section to your survey, where you can add on extra items, such as sticker packs, locking metal backs, or additional pins. Payment details will be collected in your survey to pay for any last minute added items. \n",

      "Pledge Level Shipping is a fixed rate that is based off of the amount of pins in your pledge level. Keep in mind some pledge levels have as little as one pin, and some pledge levels have as many as 20. We will be using the U.S. postal service for shipping. \n",

Any extra shipping fees are based on the weight of your package, for example, adding a sticker pack has no additional shipping fee, but adding another four pins may have a shipping fee. \n",
      "When shipping internationally we will make every effort to properly fill out customs forms. We will abide by your countries customs and shipping laws, which means we will denote the package value as the cost of your order, and mark this as merchandise.

Our first campaign was supposed to begin shipping in February 2019, and instead we sent out our last 20 orders in February. Our second campaign was set to begin shipping in April and we started shipping the first orders in the last week of February, and the remaining orders will all be sent out in mid march. We've consistently shipped early so far. We can't make any promises for this project because sometimes with crowdfunding there are unforeseen circumstances, but if all goes well like the last two campaigns, you should get rewards before July. \n",

      "It's important to understand that this is a crowdfunded campaign. Crowdfunded campaigns are often subject to delays due to unforeseen circumstances. Please also understand that money pledged to a crowdfunded campaign is a donation or investment. This is not an online store and you will not immediately receive your rewards after pledging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that minor changes may occur in production, and that the images presented here are my mock up designs. There is a possibility of slight changes in color and size, but I don't foresee any major issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pin Grades\n",
      "The Snarky Company offers two grades of pins, First Grade, and Second Grade. First Grade pins are really the only pins I offer in my online stores, and they are the only ones available for Kickstarter campaigns. Second grade pins are only available through online stores, and currently we're not offering any. Our pins are handmade and they may have minor cosmetic imperfections. \n",
      "Examples of expected First Grade imperfections:\n",
      "Small buff marks, scuffs, or scratches on metal/enamel\n",
      "Small specks, pores, or bubbles anywhere on the pin\n",
      "Slightly low or uneven fills\n",
      "Slightly misaligned screenprinted details (for pins with screenprinting)\n",
      "Slight variations in the distribution of giltter\n",
      "Slight defects in text (this is usually only in pins with small text)\n",
      "We want to make you aware that these First Grade pins may have small imperfections, but 99% of the time, these imperfections are non-existent or not noticeable. \n",
      "An important note about color and size.\n",
      "It is crucial to understand that while we have made pins before, the pins in this Kickstarter have not yet been manufactured. The designs you see on this page are only mockups, which means the final product may have slight changes in color and size. Taking your two dimensional design, sending it to a manufacturer, and receiving a three dimensional, physical object is difficult. From our experience, the majority of our pins turn out looking like the mockup design. \n",
      "There are so many variables when you see a mockup that you are viewing on your computer or phone. Different computers, phones, or other devices have different screen settings which means we may not all be viewing the same coloration. We use a Pantone Solid Coated book to choose the colors for our designs. The manufacturers use those Pantone numbers to know which colors to mix and apply where, however, looking at a Pantone swatch on paper, is different than looking at a Pantone color in enamel. \n",
      "Each mockup has a rough estimate of what the size will be. Our sizes are either specifying the general height of the pin, or width of the pin, however, the actual size of the physical product may vary. \n",
      "\n",
      "Glitters\n",
      "When you view a mockup design that has components with glitter, it is crucial to understand how glitter overlays work in Adobe Illustrator. Glitter textures are artificially created in Adobe illustrator. We have glitter textures in various shades for each color, but they come no where near to the hundreds of different glitter colors that manufacturers offer.  The mockup design may show you a section of dark blue glitter, that has flecks of dark blue and silver, however, the physical glitter may contain specs of other shades of blue, green, or silver. When you see a mockup design with glitter, understand that the glitter overlay is to give you an idea of the general color of the glitter, and where it will be on the pin. When a pin has holographic glitter, it will be labeled as holographic glitter. Holographic is what you could call rainbow glitter, each spec of glitter can reflect various different colors. What you should know about holographic glitter is that it reflects different colors depending on the enamel it is placed in. When placed in white enamel, it reflects a shade of light blue, when placed in black enamel it reflects a shade of green. \n",
      "Refunds or Exchanges\n",
      "After the campaign has ended, you will have ample time to make your pin selections in your BackerKit survey. You will be notified before surveys are locked down and any add-ons are charged. Once your order is locked down, we have a no refunds or exchanges policy. The only time we will issue a refund or replacement, is in extenuating circumstances, or if your pin arrives damaged (please read the section on pin grades to determine if your pin is damaged). Examples of damaged pins are, posts that are bent and unusable, posts that may have fallen off, or whole chunks of enamel that are missing. We will also offer refunds or offer to reship an item if it is missing from your order. \n",
      "Rubber Backs vs. Locking Backs\n",
      "Each pin from our campaign will come with rubber backs, but we highly recommend purchasing locking backs. If you choose to adhere your pin to a jacket, bag, or other item, with a rubber back, and it falls off, we will not replace the missing pin. We do offer locking backs through our add-ons section in your survey. \n",
      "Shipping Policies\n",
      "Please visit the shipping section to read about these policies. \n",
      "Comments\n",
      "Mental Illness can be a very intimate and personal topic. Any one who leaves a comment that I determine to be rude, defamatory, or ignorant, will be blocked with no explanation. \n",
      "The Denim Jacket Pledge Level\n",
      "If you pledge for this tier, after the campaign has ended, we provide a sizing chart where you can choose your size. We'll provide 1-3 different options for jackets. We prefer Levi's jackets, but we have other chosen brands that are also great quality. From the options we provide, you'll get to choose which jacket style, color (if that style has color options), and of course your size. For the collector's box you have three options for engraving. You can choose just our Logo, just your name, or you can choose to have the Logo and your name. You'll receive one of each pin, and if that pin has multiple color options, you'll receive one of each color (for example, the Pill pin comes in four colors, you'll get all four). All pins will come on backing cards, with locking backs, and arrive packed in the collector's box. Please be careful when choosing your jacket size, as we cannot provide an exchange or refund if it does not fit. Once your pledge level is locked down (you'll be notified before the lockdown) the pledge level is non-refundable. If any of your items are damaged in transit, we will replace them though. If you purchase this tier as an international backer, we properly fill out all customs forms, but we will not be held responsible if your country loses your package through their mailing service (this means once the package is no longer with the USPS), or if they hold your package and ask for additional VAT, taxes, or fees. You'll also receive any add-on stretch goals that are successfully unlocked. If any add-on stretch goal is not unlocked, it will not come with your order. If you have any questions about this tier, please feel free to reach out.\n",

I am a father of three autistic children with additional needs and I’ve witnessed them and my younger brother who is also autistic being persecuted in the street or facing limited opportunities due to their disabilities.\n",
      "Prior to the COVID pandemic, I worked in the travel industry, and as countries closed their borders my job disappeared overnight. At home during lockdown I wanted to teach my 3 autistic children some life skills, I taught them how to bake a good cake and I began giving away my bakes to raving reviews.\n",
      "I have done intensive research I have also spoken with my children’s schools and I discovered that when autistc children get up to school-leaving age, the opportunities available for them are restricted. Many young autistic young people are enrolled in courses at college which they lack interest in, while many others isolate at home and may suffer mental health difficulties. \n",
      "I plan to renovate the upstairs area and use it as a training center to offer placements to young people and adults with additional needs and allow them the comfort of learning at their own pace as well as having a deep sense of belonging to the team. The training would potentially be affiliated with a college and would provide each graduate a recognised qualification, each candidate would also be supported in to paid employment at my bakery or within the catering industry.  \n",
      "I have the premises, passion and dedicated to change the lives of young people in Warrington, my bakery school will help create the bakers of tomorrow and In the future, we would look to expand our number of stores allowing us to reach more communities and help more young vulnerable adults.\n",
      "HOW FAR, SO FAR?\n",
      "You deserve to know, if I am asking for your dedicated support, you need to know how I've been fairing on my own.\n",
      "In the past 18 months, I've built a home-based business utilizing a basic Etsy site, and I've completed over 250 orders on Etsy, during which I made, packaged, and delivered over 300 cakes. My cake business is thriving, and I frequently export cakes to the United States, Canada, Germany, India, Saudi Arabia, and Australia. In the last month, I have received three orders from customers in Australia. My reputation has grown, and I'm now doing a lot of local work, which has allowed me to develop new baking skills and expand my product line.\n",

      "Actually, my first online order came from France and my next one was from Los Angeles. And before I knew it, I started running a global online business.\n",
      "I found that people were buying cakes from my left, right, and center so I started making alcohol versions which flew off the shelves and it kept going from there\n",
      "I have reached a point where my home is overtaken by my bakery items and I am out of space, I am in desperate need of commercial premises. With commercial premises, I could take my business to the next level.\n",
      "In a nutshell, I am attempting to pursue my lifelong dream of creating a community bakery that is world-class, exceeds everything locally within the town, and at the same time help humanity in a very significant way by improving the lives of young people and adults with additional needs, no compromise.\n",
      "THE PLAN\n",
      "If you're in my home community, one way or another, you must have heard of this campaign but if you are just catching us for the first time, you may love to know that my local newspaper ‘the Warrington Guardian’ recently featured my story which was available in the printed copy on January 27th, 2022 and can also be viewed on their website https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/19865741.bakery-outlet-will-open-knutsford-road-latchford/\n",
      "The sole plan is to help improve the lives of many young vulnerable adults. I have sourced, secured and now the legal tenant of retail premises in the Latchford shopping village in Warrington. \n",
      "I really hope I could completely renovate the shop and turn it into Warrington's only traditional independent bakery offering cakes, pastries, pastries, sandwiches, baked potato, hot rolls, cold rolls, whilst offering several training opportunities to young adults with additional needs. Once established, I would open late at night at weekends and launch our night-time bakery and hot food delivery service throughout the Warrington area, I would look to partner with Just Eat or Deliveroo.\n",

      "GameZone is a gaming entertainment center for children and adults who share the love of video games. We provide a safe space for people to play the newest game consoles and most popular games in the market. If you want to test your skills, you can join one of our tournaments and win big. We want to create a fun energetic space for you to explore the Game World.  Alot of kids come home after school, throw their bags down and get straight onto their games, Alone. We want to change that. We want games to be a social tool.\n",
      " A safe space for kids to hang out. Instead of your kid coming home to get on his game alone in his room, he/she has a place with other kids to socialize and team up with. Also to give all kids and teens an equal opportunity to play the same games. Games are a very common talking point for kids to make friends. But can be very expensive. We will also offer free board games and a free game TV for kids who just want to hang out or cant afford the full amount. (Put anything in the donation bucket you get 30 minutes. Once a time a day.) Donation are put towards a new game, voted on by the Gamers. \n",
      " The idea is to have a few newer and a few older gaming consoles for pay to play $5 an hour.  We will Host tournaments, pay to play,  every so often to really bring people in. They can also can opt into being in a tournament from home online with us. So if your rival is stuck home sick he can still kick your butt. :)  $2 raffle tickets can be purchased for a chance to win game play. \n",
      "  We are a gaming family so we have a good ammount of equiptment already stock piled. The funds raised on kickstarter will give us the opportunity to lease a space, buy furniture and couch covers. Cleaning supplies for all the controllers. A cash register. We will also buy the few game systems that we have not already acquired. After all these first initial items are purchased,  We will have everything to completely run this business. Insurance, space rent amd monthly bills. I will pay. I will be working a part time that will supplement any needed funds for replacements. My husband works hard to pay our home bills so anything I make I can put straight into upgrading sytems, buying new games and prizes.  We are a very tight nit community and I feel this could completly thrive. This could thrive anywhere. \n",
      "Video games are so diverse. They bring all kinds of different  people to a common place and We want everyone to have the same opportunity.  Try a console you may not be able to afford. Try a game before you buy it. Have a place to hangout after school. \n",
      "We have few really nice spaces for lease I could easily turn this dream into reality with a little bit of help. My son and I are very much into the gaming community. This just feels so second nature and easy to exicuted.  Every single penny I make from this will go right back into it.

      "In our 2019/20 season, we met the need for accessible classical performances in Delta. High-quality performances could be experienced in your beloved neighbourhood without passing through the tunnel or going downtown. Great interest among the community showed potential for an annual Delta series.\n",
      "It's been a tough two years, not just for us but all over the world. There were doubts whether the 2021/22 season was the right time to return to Delta, but we wanted to bring the comfort and joy of music to people during this challenging time. Though our audiences have been small, we have received heartfelt gratitude for our performances.\n",
      "While we have enjoyed our intimate community this season, the reality of the financial need to sustain the Delta series is increasingly pressing. Many former audiences have expressed their intention to return in 2022/23, but we need concrete financial support to ensure we can present the series from beginning to end. We are running this pre-sale subscription campaign to secure the funds we need to present the Delta series starting in Fall 2022.\n",
      "THE PROJECT\n",
      "In addition to the government funding that we receive, VCMS requires a minimum of $40,000 in pre-sold subscriptions, donations, and concert sponsorships to put on the Delta series in our 2022/23 season. If we do not meet this goal, the Delta series will be held off until at least Fall 2023, and all subscriptions, donations, and concert sponsorships will be fully refunded. This pre-sale campaign will run until July 23, 2022, to give us enough time to lock down the season lineup before October. If the goal is met, next season will consist of five Friday evening concerts at the South Delta Baptist Church from October 2022 to May 2023.\n",
      "YOUR CONTRIBUTION\n",
      "VCMS can continue to present chamber music at the highest level of artistic excellence accessibly in Delta with your support. Your contribution provides for a portion of artist fees, travel and accommodation, and venue rental. Make a tax-deductible donation towards the Delta series by pledging over $20 above the subscription cost. Your support in the growth and development of artistic excellence in Tsawwassen will pay dividends in the years to come.\n",

Amidst these challenges, VCMS brought all five planned performances for 2021-2022 to Delta at great loss to the organization. Reaching our goal of $40,000 will not only guarantee our financial ability to run another season, it will also give us concrete evidence that audiences still want quality classical music in Tsawwassen.\n",

      "Pinzle is a publishing company and a art agency in Korea, which launched the art subscription service for the first time in the world. By applying the IP licensing method, Pinzle is not only changing the conventional art market which has been retained by a simple distributing system, but also creating a new culture in which more artworks can be created and consumed.\n",
      "\n",
      " Pinzle is a German-based word which means \"style\". The style of each artists reveals their experience and philosophy. Pinzle publishes a magazine and a large artwork print featuring artists’ unique style every month to deliver their life and philosophy.\n",
      " \n",
      "Pinzle's mission is to constantly discover amazing new artists and make it easier for people to access wonderful works of art in the world. And, this funding project is our first step towards the global market to grow into a global publishing company & art agency.\n",
      "Freshen up your daily lives and space with new artwork that we deliver every month.\n",
      "Pinzle is a new way of experiencing the lives of artists and their paintings.\n",
      "Every month! There will be a new artist, a new life story and a new picture.\n",
      "The enjoyment of art can be difficult to do for many reasons. Some of these reasons might include not having enough time to visit places that display artwork, or financial reasons, after all  purchasing fancy artwork can be quiet expensive. Whatever the case may be, the enjoyment of art should never be compromised. It should never feel like you're trying to obtain the Mona Lisa or visit the Louvre Museum. You can enjoy art with Pinzle more casual way.\n",
      "It's nice to hang a picture up on a white wall so that it grabs all the attention, but also it looks very nice when leaned up against a corner. As far as the picture goes, it could either be placed in frame or be stuck onto a wall using tape without a frame. The concept is similar to how people enjoy books, movies, and streaming music, through easy access.\n",
      "Everyone needs a change of scenery and space at times. Look around you now.\n",
      "Isn't there something desolate about walls and space that's colorless? Why not boost the morals of yourself and your loved ones with colorful paintings? It is also a wonderful experience for children to grow up around colorful works of art.\n",
      "The artwork will be inside the kraft tube along with a magazine that will explain the painting, and also about the artist. If you take the new picture out of the tube and replace it with the previous month's picture, you'll conveniently save space and time. You'll also feel a sense of refreshment with the new picture.\n",
      "And, the pictures are available in A1, the large size. It's large enough to fully appreciate and transform your space.\n",
      "Every month Pinzle magazine will talk about a artist and their artwork. They are mainly young artist around the world, who are grabbing a lot of attention for their works. To find artist who are very inspiring, we focus on current trends, and also seek advice from other artist associates.\n",
      "It's not always easy to do, but in order to gain a more thorough understanding of the artist's life, and to experience it first hand, we'll fly to the cities where the artist are located. The conversations and interviews we have with the artist will be made into a magazine along with pictures that are also taken. The magazine will be distributed along with the artwork.\n",
      "For several months, we visited fascinating artist in Japan, Europe, and the U.S., and as a result we have accumulated a lot of great artwork and many interesting stories.\n",
      "Even within just one piece of artwork, we feel that a great part of the artist's life and inspiration is shared. Saddened by the fact that, magnificent works of art, get looked at as mere images, we put together a variety of works, and content with deep meaning. \n",
      "The most prominent work of an artist is chosen and printed in a A1 large size, called \"Pinzle print\", and will be delivered along with \"Pinzle magazine\" which is the artist's story documented in the magazine and \"Pinzle Film\" is the story of the curation journey. \"Pinzle magazine\" is shipped securely in the kraft paper tube with \"Pinzle print\" and to take a look at the \"Pinzle film,\" you can visit our website at www.pinzle.net, and also through our official Pinzle channel on youtube and vimeo.\n",
      "Fund-raised from our backers will be used towards artwork contents and production. Any excess amount will be used towards the curation journey and for the copyright agreement with the next artist.\n",
      "We will strive to bring color to the daily lives of many people with works of art from different artist that we hope will inspire. \n",

It depends on how you perceive it.\n",

However, even if infinity cannot be measured, it can be felt. And through this book I will attempt to upload the information from my mind to your mind, so we together can use the power of the universe to our benefit and co-create an amazing future for humanity.\n",
      "I challenge you to perceive the following: infinity is true, this also means there have been an infinite amount of “big bangs”. The original idea that our Father/Mother/ GOD/The Creator had. This also means that if there was an infinite amount of beginnings, there are also an infinite number of endings. As the universe starts with a big bang, it will eventually “Die” or “End” in a way that is violent & peaceful at the same time, perhaps in a supermassive black hole that will suck anything of the universe inside of itself, ending up with…. Nothing…. And from nothing, ALWAYS comes something.\n",
      "You see, the end of the universe is not the true end, it is an endless loop, the universe creates itself, and the universe ultimately ends itself.\n",

An ultimate state of bliss, happiness & love for this world and all the energy that is contained within every living and/or seemingly static thing. \n",
      "After a very hard time in this world, especially now during the Corona epidemic, I know this world deserves the truth about what we are. The truth that we are all connected and that we are all one. This book will carry one of the many answers life can give you to find true heaven on earth. And I am grateful to be able to share it with you. Please find below 2 excerpts from the book as it is written:\n",
      "We are one, it is not something I hope to be true or believe to be true, it is something I know to be true. My purpose with this book is not to change you believe or religion. It is simply to show a different approach of thinking that can alleviate or even fully remove any pain or discomfort you might be experiencing.\n",
      "You are amazing, YOU are beautiful, and you WILL be able to change any circumstances in your live that is causing you negative perceived emotions. Because even though you do not believe in us, we believe in you. Simply because we are you, and you are us.\n",

      "I originally started making salsa after the local grocer discontinued my fiances favorite salsa. I created a mango blend that she was hooked on. So I took some to work and a few guys wanted to try it, one chip was all it took and they were hooked. So one guy asked, can you make me a 32 ounce jar and I will buy it? I said okay enthusiastically and set off at the end of the day to start fun filled journey into making salsa. \n",
      "One flavor turned into 2, 2 into 4 and so one. The salsa sells very well, so I thought to myself \"what can I do to make it better\"? HOT SAUCE! My cousin grows all of the hottest peppers in the world locally in his garden, so I hit him up and he now supplies me with hot peppers. He does not charge me for them, but I know that he has always wanted to sell his own crazy hot salsa and hot sauce on a large scale to share his love of the pepper as well.\n",
      "Anyways, I would love to start a legal salsa and hot sauce business that is licensed and permitted with a place to call SevenSalsa its home. I do have a full time job, and that does make it hard to run my little salsa business from home with minimal equipment. The funds would also help me purchase some commercial equipment to make salsa and hot sauce on a larger scale as well.\n",

      "More than a café we're also a second home where you connect with new friends. \n",
      "OUR STORY: \n",
      "This is a family cooperative run by me Sumbu, with my mother and brother, and of course grandma Marthe. We are a generational example of what African migration can look like. Grandma was born during the Belgian colonial period and, despite the burden of illiteracy, is a strong businesswoman not to be messed with. Her daughter, my mother, Wumba has a passion for food and an incredible skill for cooking Congolese cuisine with Swedish ingredients (it's possible!). Me, I have a background in journalism and human rights- work and love to gather people around art and food. Lastly, but not least, my brother Bel who was born in Sweden and is passionate about baking as well as creating music with his guitar. He's also a soon-to-be lawyer and will make sure that we don't go too creatively crazy!\n",
      "OUR VISION:\n",
      "We have waited far too long to realize our dream of creating a fun and relaxed space for people to meet, enjoy themselves and eat good food, while discovering more of Africa. With the café we aim to promote creativity and spread awareness of Africa’s rich cultural diversity by bridging gaps between Afro-Swede communities and other groups in the society.\n",
      "A shared space\n",
      "We want to grow openness and kindness. This is an initiative grounded in inclusion and exchange so we welcome everyone- regardless of background, gender, identity or skin color. The more the merrier! We think that changes come from within and when we create together. We encourage our visitors to see the café as a second home where they can hang out and take part in which events we should organize.\n",
      "One country and meal at a time\n",
      "As Africa is extremely diverse and large, we will of course not be able to represent or showcase the cultures of the entire continent. We do however hope to share some of the the knowledge, experiences and creativity found among the African communities in Sweden. Whether you have something to share or are simply interested in learning and meeting new people, you are welcome!\n",
      "WHY WE NEED YOU:\n",
      "We simply need your help to make this happen! So far the project has been paid from my humble savings but we need a stronger push than some saved coins.\n",
      "The funds we raise from this campaign will help us renovate the space, buy major equipment (for example a grinder, ice maker, raw juice machine etc). Your help will also supply us with some working capital so that we may employ members of our community, and give us a stable start so that we can have a sustainable future.   \n",
      "Without you this won't be possible!\n",
      "Thank you for your support. We promise to use the money wisely!\n",
      "We can't wait to serve you <3\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "To be honest cafés are not really the most profitable businesses. Our strength is though that we are more than just a café. By regularly hosting events and opening the doors to others that want to create, we will continue to attract customers to the space.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two rooms in the café building that can be rented out to compatible tenants. Their employers will doubtless have lunch at our café. Our location, in a highly trafficked and fashionable part of central Stockholm, means also that we will attract new clients daily.\n",

      "My sister and I are so excited you’re here! We started Happy Things Studio to empower women in their creativity and to give you a different kind of painting party experience. We want to make sure you leave our parties with something that you’re proud of, something worthy of hanging in your home… and we believe you will find art to be rather addicting once we help you get the hang of it. \n",
      "Simply put, a painting party. Excellent for special events like work parties, birthdays or bridal showers, hosted in your building or in your own living room! We specialize in hand cut, wood door signs, then hand painted by yourself with the assistance and finishing touches of a professional artist, and then finally garnished with a bow of your choosing. (Don’t worry, we bring everything you need to host… basically a portable painting studio to set up in your space, but a few extra chairs, drinks, and munchies never hurt!)\n",
      "1. No canvases. We only paint wooden door (or where ever) signs. They are more durable, and you can even paint the other side if you're feeling crafty at home. (;\n",
      "2. Individuality and variety. You pick what shape cutout you'd like to paint, then we make picking a design really simple! You can either reference the email we’ll send you when you schedule a party, or you can creep on our social media to find a design you love! Then our lovely staff will help you achieve it!No two shapes come out exactly the same, and we like it that way! That means there are no mass productions or instructions: only one-on-one help to make sure you leave with something worthy of your front door. \n",
      "3. Professional artists at your disposal. We are there to take the pressure off of you! We can either show you how to paint something, or do it for you! You paint as much or as little as you like, because ultimately, you'll be able to hand it over to us to personalize until you love it. \n",
      "The whole point is to create an inviting space to explore your creativity and empower your self-expression. We want you to be PROUD of what you make because we believe that everyone needs to be a little kinder to themselves, and it all starts with scheduling a party then picking out what shapes you and your friends would like to paint! So help us get the ball rolling by pledging to start our Happy Things Studio!\n",

For example, you see our circle shape? it can be a basketball, a baseball, a smiley face or just covered in flowers; It can be painted with abstract designs like shown, or in clean stripes lined with metallic gold; It can be summery or give a Holiday vibe. The shapes come to us blank, and you get to tell us how to make yours! \n",

      "One last thing I would like to address for the painting parties is what you're actually buying when you pledge for a party on our kickstarter. The total cost for your party depends on the number of people attending, our adult parties are $40 a person, our kid's parties are $25 a person. \n",
      "( YES! We offer children's parties too! We call them Bumble Bee parties, but for the sake of simplicity and fundraising, we are making the deposits the same. )\n",

Your deposit for a party covers our cost of materials, and enables us to build up a large inventory of shapes before moving back to Florida. On the day of your party, the remaining cost per person is $30. \n",
      "We recommend that you, our lovely host, collect the $40 from your friends as they commit to coming, prior to the day of the party. This will make payment much simpler, as well as ensuring all your guests will be there. \n",
      "We will not accept personal checks for parties, however, we will accept debit/credit card payment, square cash, or just good ole cash. \n",
      "Our team for parties also depends on the number of guests, but generally consists of 2 - 4 people. \n",
      "1- Personalizers. Someone like me teaching you how to attain your design and do your calligraphy at the end. (For larger parties it will be my sister and myself... And possibly some amazing friends I find along the way.)\n",

      "3- The Buzzer. This person runs around the party taking pictures for you on your phone or our professional camera gear to share on social media. *We will not share your face if we do not have your permission.* However, we do love a good candid shot, and well, our marketing intern, Haley, is the best. but if you would prefer to not be in the photos, she will take some super cute shots of just your sign to share.\n",

      "Hi, my name is Rae, I'm 21, Australian, Female, and I am raising money for the completion and publication of a short story I have written. I have always been passionate about writing and have written many short stories as well as completed  a Bachelor of Arts course majoring in Creative Writing, but have only recently gained the courage to attempt a publication of my work. The money is predominantly for the publication process of the story with the majority going towards the cost of the publication package I am selecting and the rest towards the additional services that aren't included in said package. The idea wasn't particularity influenced by anything, I kind of just thought one day 'Hey, what if fairy dust was a drug?' and it kind of escalated from there. Before I go into a more succinct summary of the story, I thought that a passage I have written would provide an accurate synopsis of both plot and writing style (p.s. this text box wouldn't let me edit the format of the writing :( ). \n",
      "It was after they had finished their meal, which - much to the displeasure of the Darlings - was no more than make-believe, did Peter pull them aside, leading them to the back of the fort where a small, wooden table was located. Pulling out a crusted, treasure-like box, Peter took a key from his pocket and unlocked it. Taking the contents from the box, he placed it on the table, revealing a strange powder, lying on tissue paper. With a well-practiced smirk, deviant in nature yet charming in action, Peter placed a yellow-tinted powder onto the table before the Darlings.\n",
      "‘This,’ he began, ‘is what they call Fairy Dust.’\n",
      "‘Is it magic?’ Michael asked obnoxiously, with eyebrows raised and a scrunched up face.\n",
      "‘Of course not idiot,’ came John’s harsh response, ‘it’s drugs.’\n",
      "‘Now, now, who’s to say it’s not magic?’ Peter pinched the powder between grotty fingertips and let it lightly sprinkle back down, cascading in a shimmery waterfall like sand in an hourglass, catching the light just right to make it appear enchanted, ‘Fairy Dust is magic if you believe it is. It can take you on the ride of your life, to a whole other world built just for you.’\n",
      "‘I’m not sure. Father says drugs rot your brain.’ John gave the powder a suspicious look.\n",
      "‘Nonsense!’ Peter exclaimed offended, ‘If anything it sharpens the brain, wakes it up a little, opens the faculties, lets you see things that most folks don’t. One whiff and all your dreams will come true. Trust me, you’ll be flying so high you’ll never wanna come down.’\n",
      "Lucifer, you see, was an angel before he was ever a devil. If one were to look in on this exact moment in time, the catalyst for events to come, perhaps they would see a devil with an angel’s guise, or perhaps a snake offering the forbidden fruit to the innocent. Most likely though, they would see a sad little boy, who never knew a good time that wasn’t at the end of a blunt.\n",
      "Wendy could see it - the pitiful boy before her - but, whether out of infatuation or rebellion, she took the powder offered, snorted it up her nose just as Peter showed her…\n",
      "…and she flew.\n",
      "Well what do you think? I'm a bit nervous since this is the first time people who I don't know will be reading it, but recently I've been attempting to leave my comfort zone and socialize more and I guess this counts since I've always been kind of secretive with my writing. \n",
      "Anyways, as you can probably guess the story is based on the Darling children who get involved with Peter Pan, who in this story is a drug-addicted teen living in a rough neighborhood. It has the majority of the original Peter Pan story, including the characters, as well as some elements from the 2003 film. The story contains drug-related themes and some (extremely) mild sexual themes and some other themes I don't really know how to classify. I haven't listed any rewards yet, but rewards would be along the lines of listing the backers of the story in the final product. \n",
      "I'm not really sure what else to say other than imploring that any who read this consider backing my project and sincerely thanking those that do. This story is kind of like my baby at this point and it would mean a lot to me to actually see it published. So yeah, that's all, here's a smiley face. \n",

      "Risks and challenges would fall into failing to reach the financial goal. If I fail to reach the specified amount, I could attempt to find a cheaper publisher, though it is unlikely I will receive the same opportunities presented from the current publisher I am aiming for. Another issue is political correctness since Native Americans are in the original Peter Pan but are referred to as 'Indians' which is the main identifier for these characters in the original. To remain faithful, I have included the identifier 'Indians', however to avoid offense to anyone, this is merely the group's name and I am going to specify that the nationality of the 'Indians' are not Native American individuals. In relation to this terminology issue, I am open to suggestions on its inclusion and execution.\n",

While in the establishment, we were coached by distinguished teachers and performers, such as Gabriella Dall'Olio, Leon Bosch, Nic Pendlebury and David Kennedy.\n",
      "Interested in all sorts of repertoire, focused on virtuosity and versatile sonorities on both instruments, we are an innovative and unique duo in the classical chamber music scene, creating new repertoire specifically written for the ensemble.\n",
      "The duo has performed in great London venues such as the Wigmore Hall, St. James in Piccadilly, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, the Old Royal Naval College, the Verdi Halls at the Royal Albert Hall. We have worked in collaboration with Salvi Harps and the Victor Salvi Harp Museum in the event \"Eccellenza incontra Eccellenza\", in La Morra d'Alba, Italy.\n",

      "About the CD Programme\n",
      "During the pandemic, we have been gifted by the incredible composer Yoshihisa Hirano with his Elegy for double bass and harp, written and created especially for the Girls in the Magnesium Dress. Some of his greatest compositions come from the Anime soundtracks works, such as Death Note, Final Fantasy and Broken Blade to name a few.\n",
      "His work has led us to bigger reflections. What classical repertoire do we know that has been written as an inspiration of Japanese culture? What transcriptions and arrangements could be created for our duo? The answers we got were exciting!!!\n",
      "The Japanese word Rūtsu stands for \"roots\": we made it into the title of our album as a symbol of the deep correlation between Japan and its influence on the Western World. \n",

      "2021 has not been a great year for professional musicians: no performances, closed theatres and no future perspective have forced us to find alternative solutions to survive this crisis, both economically and emotionally.\n",
      "As a duo, we have used our lockdown months to develop and discover new repertoire, looking forward to future occasions.\n",
      "This is why we were incredibly touched when the label Da Vinci Records offered us to record our first CD as the Girls in the Magnesium Dress.\n",

      " Hello!\n",
      " I'm Misu !, an spanish artist who loves innovation and the art revolution. I have in my hands an artistic project where I need a series of materials to be able to carry it out. As many of you already know, in the world of art, not all materials serve, since quality is essential to make a difference, because, for example, in painting, we often try to make paintings that demand a high budget that in Cases like mine are inaccessible. The paintings, the brushes, the supports, the materials that we are going to use ... Everything counts! And whoever is dedicated to it, knows perfectly that the quality of the materials make the difference and the difficulty or ease to carry out your work (especially in the cases of more demanding artists, as is my case). Good quality art material in Spain is very expensive, and humble artists like me know how difficult it is to have these materials and how hard it is to fight to get them.\n",
      " The beneficiary of the donations of the campaign will be me, as the artist who will create the work. I will go to buy the materials in specific art stores that are located in the center of Madrid, Spain. The funds will be invested only in the materials, in a deposit that I have specially dedicated, only to these materials. I will need the funds for this Christmas if possible, since that is when I have more time to buy the material and create the works of art.\n",
      " My purpose will be to obtain these quality materials in order to start doing better quality works, which due to my current economic situation, unfortunately prevents me from allowing it.\n",
      " I really feel the need to advance in the art world, since I've been in the same place for a while now, managing as I could with the money I had.\n",
      "  These are difficult economic times for me, and I will try to move forward with these new materials as well as possible. For me it would really mean a great opportunity to expand my unique and revolutionary technique, to be able to advance as an artist and create new works much better than those I already had. I just hope to get it and start as soon as possible, because I'm really looking forward to it. I hope that thanks to you, God willing, tomorrow I will become an outstanding figure that will make your work an inspiration to change the world, because I have never feared being different and I have always dreamed of changing the world through this purpose , besides getting to inspire other people to be themselves and continue doing without fear what they are doing, because art serves to open minds and transcendently liberate the soul that we carry inside, in our heart. Hopefully it will be achieved little by little, with small steps like this.\n",
      " And from my heart I say, thank you very much to everyone who supports me with your donations, no matter how minimal, in this project. I really thank you very much, because your money will be really used to the millimeter to get a good cause. Thanks, again.\n",

Being born under the month of umbart, she was born with quite a peculiar gift, and with it she would soon find herself in an all too familiar world.

Plusieurs coûts tels que: location de la salle, accords du piano, honoraires et hébergement de l'équipe technique et de moi-même, mixage et mastering. Ce projet est coproduit avec la maison de disque québécoise Espace 21.\n",

Quelques petits frais de livraison pourrait s'ajouter pour des adresses en dehors du Canada.\n",
      "L'idée du disque double est venue dans un but de cohérence et pour mieux contempler l'évolution du style d'écriture de Pierné ainsi que sa métamorphose du romantisme vers le modernisme. Au départ, je prévoyais seulement enregistrer des pièces extraites des Quinze pièces pour piano op.3 et des Six Pièces posthumes. Mon ami Georges Nicholson qui réalisera l'album double m'a convaincu d'enregistrer l'entièreté de ces cycles. C'est donc avec beaucoup de joie que j'ai accepté, mais aussi quelques inquiétudes face à un projet aussi ambitieux. Ceci étant dit, je crois que cette nouvelle mouture du projet contribuera à m'apporter l'énergie et la motivation pour le porter à bien. J'ai déjà bien hâte de présenter le fruit d'un long travail sur l'œuvre de Pierné, mais tellement passionnant, qui dure maintenant depuis plus de 8 ans.\n",

      "I am preparing a second disc which will be a double album devoted to works for piano by Gabriel Pierné (1863-1937). It will be recorded in one of the best venues in Canada: the Domaine Forget Concert Hall. I am raising funds to finance this great project which is close to my heart. Several costs such as: room rental, piano tuning, fees and accommodation for the technical team and myself, mixing and mastering. This project is co-produced with the Quebec record label Espace 21.\n",

Some small delivery charges may be added for addresses outside of Canada.\n",
      "The idea of ​​the double disc came for the sake of consistency and to better contemplate the evolution of Pierné's writing style as well as his metamorphosis from romanticism to modernism. Initially, I only planned to record pieces from the Fifteen Pieces for Piano Op.3 and the Six Posthumous Pieces. My friend Georges Nicholson who will produce the double album convinced me to record all of these cycles. It was therefore with great joy that I accepted, but also some concerns about such an ambitious project. That being said, I believe that this new version of the project will help give me the energy and motivation to carry it out. I am already looking forward to presenting the fruit of a long work on Pierné's work, but so fascinating, which has now lasted for more than 8 years.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "The Lost Birds is a musical memorial to bird species driven to extinction by humankind. Sweeping and elegiac, it's a haunting tribute to those soaring flocks that once filled our skies, but whose songs have since been silenced. It's a celebration of their feathered beauty: their symbolism as messengers of hope, peace, and renewal. But it's also a warning about our own tenuous existence on the planet: that the fate that befell these once soaring flocks foreshadows our own extinction.\n",
      "The Lost Birds will be sung by the preeminent British vocal ensemble VOCES8, accompanied by my longtime collaborators, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Backers will have the rare and unique opportunity to attend the orchestral recording sessions at the legendary Abbey Road Studios, as well as the vocal sessions at VOCES8's private recording facility (both in person and virtually). And just like my last Kickstarter album To Shiver the Sky, I'll be documenting in detail each phase of the creative process--from sketches to composing, recording to mixing, release to marketing-- with frequent updates, journal entries, and exclusive live streams and video content.\n",
      "This album will be a gentler production than my previous works. The language will be pastoral and romantic; by turns soaring and delicate, but with the slightest whisper of melancholy. It will be a response to the noise of our times; a return to simplicity, clean lines, and the timelessness of hymns and folk melodies. It will be a triumph of loveliness; a soundtrack for appreciating nature, and a reminder that we must preserve its ephemeral beauty while it still exists.\n",
      "Despite the actual cost of production being close to $200,000 we set our funding target at $50,000 because of the uncertain times that we're in.  Despite that you rallied and we hit our goal within 7 hours.  Thank you--I'm honored.  We're currently the second highest grossing classical music Kickstarter ever, and I'm hoping that by the end of the campaign we can set a new record.  So with that in mind, here are the first batch of stretch goals I have in mind for the rest of this campaign:\n",
      "(If we surpass these goals, then the rest of the money will just be kept as compensation for all my work.)\n",
      "The first part of the project will be the research; finding poems and texts to set to music, then coming up with the overall dramatic arc of the piece. After that comes months of composing and orchestration, which I'll be sharing with you in great detail through live-streams and updates.\n",
      "Then comes the recording. This album will use a hybrid of traditional classical recording techniques, and the more tech-heavy and modular approach that we employ in the film/game scoring world. The vocal portions of the album will be recorded first by VOCES8 in the traditional classical manner--all singers together in one room, without guide tracks, performing around a small cluster of microphones that will capture the natural acoustic of their recording space. After the vocals are done, I'll be building a metronome map around their performance, to preserve their natural phrasing and musicality. I'll then be bringing those sessions to Abbey Road, where the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra will overdub their parts. Every player will be listening to both the metronome map and VOCES8 recordings in their headphones--all while sight reading the music. Both halves of the recording will be a stunning display of musicianship you'll want to witness.\n",
      "Here's a rough timeline for The Lost Birds:\n",
      "Witnessing an album being recorded live is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's an experience you'll want to share with your friends and family, or a story you might someday tell your children and grandchildren: that you were there, either sitting in the room or watching online, as an album you helped bring to life was being captured for all eternity. So for the first time, not only are we making all the recording sessions available to attend live, but we're also making the VOCES8 sessions available to all to attend online.\n",
      "All backers can now purchase the VOCES8 Virtual Session Pass as an Add-on to their primary pledge tier, and get full streaming access to the VOCES8 recording sessions (and music video shoots), broadcast live from their recording studio in the heart of London, the VOCES8 Centre. What's more, you'll be able to listen in as I produce the sessions remotely from my studio in Los Angeles; so you'll be hearing exactly what I'm hearing in real time, and follow along as I give them notes and feedback. (For more details about the schedule and format for the online sessions, see the FAQ.)  \n",
      "For those who want to experience it live with the chance to meet the singers, The VOCES8 Recording Experience pledge tier gives you the opportunity to spend an evening recording with them, with the opportunity for a meet-and-greet. (I'll be producing the sessions remotely online, due to the pandemic.) Attendance will be capped to preserve that small-group feel.\n",
      "If attending an orchestral recording session is more to your liking, The Abbey Road/RPO Experience is your chance to visit the legendary recording studio and sit in while I conduct the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. This premium experience is a rare opportunity to go behind those closed doors. Attendance will be limited to maintain an exclusive experience, and you'll have the chance to join me for a private reception beforehand. To read firsthand how the entire experience is from an actual backer, see this blog post. (For information about the scheduling of these sessions, visit the FAQ.)\n",
      "I've curated a collection of rewards that give the ultimate music appreciation experience, as well as some one-of-a-kind collectables and life experiences that you won't get anywhere else. Almost every item is also available as an Add-on after you select your primary pledge tier--meaning you can easily mix and match any items you see in this campaign (note: if your primary pledge tier is a digital product only, then only digital Add-ons will be available.  If your primary pledge tier contains a physical product, then all digital and physical Add-ons will be available.). On top of all this, most of these rewards will be personalized in some way: the CDs, vinyl, prints, and study scores will all be signed (and in some cases numbered), and the handwritten 'Sogno di Volare' score will be dedicated and personalized to your liking--an ideal gift for a music lover. Here are a few samples:\n",
      "I'm a big believer in music's ability to be a force for good: its capacity for shedding light on darkness, and inspiring people to become better versions of themselves. All my previous albums were rooted in this philosophy: on the surface they're simply enjoyable music, but dig a little deeper and you'll discover dialogues on cultural tolerance (Calling All Dawns), musical explorations of water conservation (The Drop That Contained the Sea), and celebrations of human achievement (To Shiver the Sky). The Lost Birds will be the same.\n",
      "To me, an album should never just be a random collection of music. I believe in concept albums: songs built around a core idea, with interconnected musical motifs, that tell a story from start to finish. I approach my work like a film director: each album tells a different story, with different characters, and each with its own unique narrative and structure--but they're all told in a way such that they're unmistakably mine.\n",
      "My work has won two Grammy awards, repeatedly topped the Billboard charts, and has been heard the world over: from Carnegie Hall, to the United Nations, and even The Vatican. It's been the soundtrack for many of the world's biggest events: from the FA Cup to the World Expo, and even to a landmark peace treaty signing in Mozambique. It was even a question on Jeopardy!\n",
      "The Lost Birds will be the next chapter in that story, and while there's no guarantee that it will follow in the footsteps of my other albums, what I can say is that this music is not intended to just fade away after a season. Like all my albums, it's meant as a piece of permanence--one that will hopefully be performed again and again in concert halls for years to come. This is your chance to attach your name to its creation. I invite you to join me on the journey.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I've successfully recorded and released three full orchestral/choral albums in the past, including one that was fully funded by a Kickstarter campaign ('To Shiver the Sky'), so I have a wide range of resources and experience for recording and releasing this album. The album is already slated for release in 2022 via my new record deal with the legendary record label Decca Gold/Universal, so there's no way that this album doesn't get finished. The worst that will happen is that it gets delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "One potential challenge will be the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: at the moment the orchestral sessions are scheduled for February 2022, but that presupposes that the virus is contained well enough such that large recording sessions can take place, and I'm able to get a vaccine and fly to London. We'll keep everyone informed about the outlook, and if necessary, we'll reschedule the sessions and those who pledged to attend them will be given the option of a refund. This may cause delays to the album's release.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a good track record with Kickstarter: my last album was the highest grossing classical music Kickstarter ever, and I gave a very thorough behind-the-scenes experience of the creation of the album, from pre-production, to composing, to release, to marketing. I take my backers very seriously!\n",

      "Ultimately most of us wish we were given some real advice, honest examples and stories of those who have made this journey before us. Agencies tend to tell you what you want to hear, or what they want you to believe once you are considering to sign up for a program such as this one. And even thought there have been people who have had the perfect trip, far more did not. Some made the best of their situation, others gave up and went home.\n",
      "But this feels like a lot of beating around the bush, you get the idea, I do not plan to waste your time on things I will include in the guide itself.\n",
      "The Goal is to help out young students who plan to come as seasonal workers, a.k.a \" J1 students \" to the United States, young adults who might not be students but managed to attain a work visa and exchange students who would like to make some extra money while staying in the US. \n",
      "As one of these, I have had to deal with the hardships of bad organizing and being deceived for the profit of others. But I managed to pull myself together and do the best with my situation. The experience I have attained and the time I spent were definitely something I would have never imagined before I came.\n",
      "But if I had known better, I could have made my stay many times more enjoyable and profitable. Sometimes the right hints and tips can make all the difference! If I had come with the knowledge I have now, I could have easily made 3-4x more money (approx. 18000$ - 24000$) than I already have and struggled far less in terms of looking for a job, dealing with overstaffed cities, dealing with people who do not even consider us to be human. \n",
      "I just want to be able to pay back my debt and help some people out while I can. My first half of the program was quite the disaster in terms of employment, the reservations for seasonal workers have already reached a climax point in February 2018, as somebody who signed up in March 2018 I did not have much choice as it was the most promising place the Agency presented to us, after they declined our request to sign us up for a City of our choice. \n",
      "I would give the info. I have out for free were it not for my debt..so I thought this would be the best way to help myself and others at the same time.\n",

      "It will include tips regarding agencies, organization of the the trip, places to go to in both terms of employment and enjoyment, things to do and things to avoid doing, overview of american culture, a guide to calculate the finances for your trip and your earnings even before it starts, a guide to the means of transportation, housing, location, packing, shopping... and many more things, such as taxes and minimum wage, as well as your rights and a detailed description of my experience as a first time seasonal worker student in the US.\n",

      "Mi proyecto consiste en la compra y rehabilitación de un antiguo hotel rural que se encuentra al lado de la fuente agria de Pórtugos, cara sur de Sierra Nevada, Granada, España, (cerrado hace 10 años por jubilación) \n",
      "Qué es esto? \n",
      "Esto es apoyar un proyecto a cambio de una recompensa no económica.\n",
      "Es ayudar a cumplir una meta\n",
      "Es desarrollo para la zona\n",
      "Es auto-trabajo para gente,\n",
      "Es trabajo para otra.\n",
      "Es desarrollo local... \n",
      "Es tantas cosas! apoyad por favor,\n",
      "No es necesario registrarse.\n",
      "No se recauda si no se llega al monto total, y si se llega se recauda al final de la campaña. No hay límite de aportación, desde un euro hasta lo que quieras\n",
      "La casa tiene 12 habitaciones, dos con alcoba y las demás dobles; hay otra habitación con alcoba donde se instalarán los aseos, duchas y lavabos, así como lavadoras y secadora de fichas. Otra se encuentra habilitada para vivienda y recepción\n",

      " En la planta de abajo hay bar restaurante y un gran espacio de almacén. \n",
      "Poner estos dos espacios en marcha es el objetivo a corto plazo, y el aprovechamiento de los bosques y plantas medicinales que ya se encuentran en la finca. A medio y largo plazo los objetivos se irán ampliando. Hay muchísimas posibilidades a partir de lo que ya existe.\n",
      "La Alpujarra de Granada es un espacio muy turístico, pero entre los barrancos de Poqueira y el de Trevélez, los turistas se encuentran muchas veces con el problema de no encontrar alojamiento e incluso con escasez de servicios. El turista local es mitad español y mitad internacional, con preferencia de turistas procedentes de todos los países de Europa, pero con gran proyección mundial. Nuestro enfoque sería hacia el turista americano y asiático, que actualmente está empezando a visitarnos.  \n",
      "La idea es enfocarlo, además de para ampliar la oferta de turismo local, para realizar todo tipo de actividades de sanación, arte y naturaleza: campus, talleres, actuaciones, exposiciones,  concursos...\n",
      "También tiene una finca ecológica ( se puede certificar) de más de dos hectáreas que se dividen en bosques de castaños, nogales y encinas done se plantarán especies micológicas que protejan las raíces de plagas que actualmente están amenazando los bosques y nos aporten rendimiento también (boletus real y otras) y más de una hectárea de tierra de labor donde cultivaremos la comida del bar restaurante y plantas medicinales, de cultivo  ecológico y sostenible.\n",
      "Como atractivos turísticos adicionales, tiene unas ruinas árabes de un balneario que están bajo la protección de patrimonio, con lo que no se puede actuar sobre ellas, pero limpias de maleza embellecen el enclave y lo diferencian de cualquier otro en la zona. \n",
      "Otro gran atractivo es su cercanía a la fuente agria de Pórtugos, enclave muy turístico y visitado, a un minuto a pie desde la entrada de la finca. De hecho antiguamente este establecimiento era muy apreciado precisamente por esto. Este agua limpia los riñones, y es indicadísima para los problemas de piel\n",
      "La financiación va así:\n",
      "- 300.000,00 euros para la compra del espacio, único modo de acceso.\n",
      "- 35.000,00 para impuestos y gastos de compra\n",
      "- 60,000.00 para licencias, permisos y arquitecto\n",
      "- El resto para llevar a cabo la reforma y ponernos en marcha! esto incluye: cambio de cañerías y desagües, luz, instalaciones, mejora de accesos, limpieza de finca, pintura y albañilería. Estoy barajando posibilidades entre varios presupuestos, pero aproximadamente entre 80.000,00 y 90.000,00 euros. \n",
      "Mientras todo esto se hace, iremos empezando con las actividades que se pueda.\n",

      "- Agosto: compra del espacio, solicitud de presupuestos, permisos, licencias y otros trámites\n",

      "- Septiembre y octubre: obras en la casa y limpieza y preparación de finca. Fiestas privadas, cursos y talleres al aire libre. Empieza la recolección y venta de frutos secos. Se ponen en marcha las habitaciones. Preparación de la tierra de labor y empezar con el huerto ecológico y plantas medicinales\n",
      "\n",
      "- Noviembre: puesta en marcha del espacio de bar de tapas y restaurante. Aunque no es el mejor mes, hay que ir empezando. Empezamos con espectáculos, exposiciones y actividades a tope para optimizar lo máximo. \n",

      "\n",
      "Siempre gracias\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "El riesgo es que la administración se demore en dar los permisos, aunque por parte del ayuntamiento hay un gran apoyo para cualquier iniciativa, al tratarse de una zona en desarrollo. Otro es el caso de cultura, pues la finca se halla en territorio perteneciente a patrimonio histórico, con lo cual nos van a exigir construcción tradicional, integración paisajística, etc., pero esto forma parte del proyecto, así que espero que no pongan mucho inconveniente.\n",
      "Por otra parte, esto nos garantiza que no se van a abrir nuevos establecimientos, pues no hay nuevos permisos. Solo reaperturas, como es el caso. Por lo tanto, en el pueblo una vez que abramos, habrá un máximo de tres bares, tres restaurantes y cuatro alojamientos: dos hoteles, nuestro hotel rural y una casa rural particular. Aun habría trabajo para un par más de establecimientos en la temporada alta. Los fines de semana se trabaja todo el año \n",
      "Turismo también tiene un montón de requerimientos legales para los permisos. Mientras llegan y no, y durante las obras podemos ir haciendo fiestas privadas, actividades al aire libre, cursos, actuaciones etc. para ir generando ingresos y fama.\n",
      "Necesita reformas; hay que hacer la cocina del restaurante nueva y equiparla, hay que hacer los baños del hotel, hay que cambiar la instalación de agua, desagües y luz y adaptar los accesos y las normas de seguridad a la normativa vigente. También hay que pintar.\n",
      "Hay que equipar los dos espacios, aunque los muebles del hotel están, hay que comprar colchones, ropa, productos de limpieza... y las mercaderías,  y muebles del bar restaurante. Es una gran inversión.\n",
      "También hay que contratar gente, es un proyecto que necesita una comunidad; la contratación se hará con preferencia en los grupos de población que permita ahorrar costes: mujeres, mayores de 5o años, minusválidas, estudiantes de turismo y agricultura.... favoreciendo el desarrollo local y la integración, al mismo tiempo\n",

      "Baelin's Route follows the computer-character Baelin and his scripted loop around the fantasy world of Azerim. However on this particular journey Baelin bumps into a nasty Adventurer in the middle of an escort mission, overseeing a young NPC girl named Willow. After deciding he’s sick of the quest, the Adventurer turns on Willow to intentionally fail his quest, however Baelin intervenes and saves Willow. It’s now up to Baelin to escort Willow through the harsh world of Azerim back home to her family.\n",

      "It's difficult to see on the map below, but we've marked out Baelin's typical route he takes through Azerim. It's big. Like, really big. From Honeywood he ventures through forests, open fields and farms, deserts and mountains. But as you can see, the world is MUCH bigger - and still expanding!\n",

I still have a day job a few days a week as a freelance designer and would love to be able to commit full time to my passion.  My company has grown mostly by word of mouth and referrals etc. My very first client was a UFC fighter who needed to lose 30 pounds  for his fight and we did it through proper nutrition. \n",

I would like the place to be wifi accessible for those who are into graphic art as I would like the place to be welcome to all artists no matter their medium. In my vision there will be a coffee bar with 6-8 stools, a few tables for artists to relax and a few tables meant for artist to be able to paint or if they want to work their own sculpture. The place will be BYOB and it will be requested artists drink responsibly as this is a community place not a full on bar.  A mix of all types of music will play, we will have an area to put in music requests as well. It would be nice to have a room that would fit 10-15 people where events could be hosted, gallery space, or to host paint and sip classes. This place has so much potential and has always been a great dream of mine. With the help of the right people i can create a fun place that can give back to the community. The decorations will be of paintings that guests donate, and other guests can buy. There will be an area of the wall for this month's artist and their mini gallery, randomly selected from a box. The staff can give back by making appearances at local neighborhood schools and perhaps teach a painting class to the kids.

      "Como es bien sabido, el sector dedicado a la venta de productos naturales y orgánicos está en expansión, sobre todo en las grandes ciudades, donde este tipo de productos es muy valorado por sus habitantes.\n",
      "La sociedad actual (desde el entorno educativo y familiar) retorna y fomenta la cultura y el arte de comer con salud y equilibrio con alimentación equilibrada en bienestar y salud.\n",
      "En restauración, para diferenciarse, en sus cartas ofrecen platos de alta cocina elaborados con productos naturales y orgánicos.\n",
      "Clientes potenciales:\n",
      "Aquellos ciudadanos y vecinos que no cultivan sus propios productos y que, aun cultivándolos, compran los que les faltan, quieren descubrir los beneficios de la alimentacion natural.\n",
      "Si bien disponemos de cifras aproximadas en la edad de nuestra clientela (30/50 años) se puede presumir que, en España, cada día es más extendida la sana educación social-familiar en concepto de alimentación sana y equilibrada, ampliando la edad, cada vez en notoriedad, de 20 años en adelante.\n",
      "Tampoco descartamos al turista, que gracias a una detallada y selecta atención personalizada, y con la confianza que ofrecen instalaciones físicas, recuren nuestro servicio WEB. *www.natural-galicia.com. (abierto ya al público y en mejora estructural y de producto).\n",
      "Análisis de la competencia:\n",
      "Por el análisis de competencia que hemos podido llevar a cabo, llegamos a la conclusión de que, si es cierto que existen tiendas a granel en Orense centro y capital, no disponen de las avanzadas tecnologías de higiene y presentación de las que nosotros ofrecemos, en este campo el cliente lo valora y publicita. Punto importante para nosotros en tranquilidad a fines de regulaciones de ley e inspecciones sanitarias.\n",
      "Lo mismo podríamos decir de las grandes superficies, que, además, disponen de productos de nombre comercial y marca blanca y no siempre reúnen la confianza total del consumidor final. Tan sólo podemos dar cuenta de las grandes superficies, que debido a la gran variedad de productos que ofrecen, pueden suponer competencia para algún producto. Respecto a los supermercados de cadena, (Mercadona, Gadis, Lidel…) denominados para consumo diario y económico, empiezan tímidamente a ofertar algún producto, pero lejos de la gran variedad de referencias que nosotros podemos ofrecer.\n",
      "Mejoras propuestas para optimizar nuestros resultados:\n",
      "Podemos considerar una debilidad, la dificultad que nos encontramos a la hora de encontrar algún producto ecológico con precio de venta al público menos competitivo que la gran superficie, indudablemente nuestro nivel de compra no es suficiente para negociar ajustes importantes en precio al ser algunos de ellos de importación de países de la UE. como Francia o Alemania, que al añadir gastos de transporte y administrativos resultan menos económicos.\n",
      "Sin embargo, como bien es sabido por todos nosotros cada día las familias españolas valoran la cercanía y la atención profesional y diaria de la tienda cercana.\n",
      "Potenciales riesgos:\n",
      "La principal amenaza, como comentamos anteriormente, es la existencia de grandes superficies, que cuentan con gran diversidad de productos y clientela asentada de la ciudad.\n",
      "Otra amenaza sería los productos que en su etiquetado figuran como orgánicos-ecológicos y en realidad no lo son, pero que el cliente compra por precio, que suele ser bajo.\n",
      "Fortalezas:\n",
      "La principal fortaleza con la que cuenta la empresa es la relación calidad/ precio de todos los productos que ofrece, Garantizada y Demostrable.\n",
      "Además de la importantísima ventaja del novedoso sistema de a granel, mediante dispensadores reglamentados para una perfecta conservación e higiene del producto.\n",

      "Presentation:\n",
      "This company is a continuation of the launch started a year ago, in the sector of natural and organic cosmetics - Organic, Todo A GRANEL, dedicated to the sector of natural and biological food and cosmetics, health preparations, beauty with origin Natural and prepared in the shop in front of the customer. Products sold in bulk in almost all of them.\n",
      " \n",
      "After an ascending and gradual rise, we started with our own name, with this new exhibition and service to the public in the food sector belonging to the group called \"superaliment\" in addition to a great variety of teas, spices, medicinal plants, spirits, coffees, oils , Ice creams, dehydrated fruits ... including products of daily sale like fresh fruit, bread and elaborated food to carry (for loyalty of native clients and neighbors). Not to discard like novelty and attractive the possibility to enjoy a tasting of teas, infusions, Liqueurs existing for sale, with the addition that the smallest of the house enjoy a quiet space and oblivious to the work of the elderly.\n",
      " \n",
      "The enlargement of the section of selection in cosmetics and oils for the beauty care, as well as the realization of custom made and demand of our clients in the elaboration of cushions and therapeutic mask. It will also be directed to the whole range of family care, in order to serve this type of clients in all their needs.\n",
      "In the determination for the Sunday opening we are in the study of putting some \"less contaminated\" section that will serve to the general public, giving maximum appeal in references highlighted as main.\n",
      "General aspects of the sector:\n",
      "As is well known, the sector dedicated to the sale of natural and organic products is expanding, especially in large cities, where this type of products is highly valued by its inhabitants.\n",
      " \n",
      "The present society (from the educational and family environment) returns and promotes the culture and art of eating with health and balance with balanced diet in well-being and health.\n",
      "In restoration, to distinguish themselves, in their letters they offer dishes of haute cuisine elaborated with natural and organic products.\n",
      "Potential customers:\n",
      "Those citizens and neighbors who do not cultivate their own products and who, even cultivating them, buy the ones they lack, want to discover the benefits of natural food.\n",
      " \n",
      "Although we have approximate figures in the age of our clientele (30/50 years) it can be presumed that, in Spain, every day is more widespread the healthy social-family education in concept of healthy and balanced food, increasing the age, each Time in notoriety, from 20 years onwards.\n",
      "Neither do we rule out the tourist, who thanks to a detailed and select personalized attention, and with the confidence that offer physical facilities, resort our WEB service. * Www.natural-galicia.com. (Already open to the public and in structural and product improvement).\n",
      "Analysis of the competition:\n",
      "From the competition analysis we have been able to carry out, we conclude that, if it is true that there are bulk stores in Orense center and capital, they do not have the advanced hygiene and presentation technologies that we offer, in This field is valued and advertised by the client. Important point for us in tranquility for purposes of law regulations and sanitary inspections.\n",
      "The same could be said of large supermarkets, which also have products with a trade name and white label and do not always meet the total confidence of the final consumer. We can only give account of the large areas, which due to the great variety of products they offer, may lead to competition for some product. With regard to chain supermarkets (Mercadona, Gadis, Lidel ...), called for daily and economic consumption, they shyly start offering some product, but far from the great variety of references we can offer.\n",
      "Improvements proposals to optimize our results:\n",
      "We can consider a weakness, the difficulty that we find in finding an ecological product with a retail price less competitive than the large area, undoubtedly our level of purchase is not enough to negotiate important adjustments in price as some of them Imports from EU countries. Such as France or Germany, which adds less transport and administrative costs.\n",
      "However, as is well known by all of us, every day the Spanish families appreciate the closeness and the professional and daily attention of the nearby store.\n",
      "Potential risks:\n",
      "The main threat, as we said before, is the existence of large areas, which have a great diversity of products and seated clientele of the city.\n",
      "Another threat would be the products that are labeled organic-organic\n",
      "And in reality they are not, but the customer buys by price, which is usually low. Strengths: The main strength of the company is the quality / price ratio of all products offered, Guaranteed and Demonstrable. In addition to the very important advantage of the novel system of bulk, through regulated dispensers for a perfect conservation and hygiene of the product. We add the professional and personal experience of the management of the company of more than 20 years in the sector of food and treatment to the public, as well as the great wealth acquired at the beginning of the pioneering project in the town of Carballiño, where it has been able to verify Which is a successful and future path of business (Carballiño is made up of an older population and of less custom to innovations and changes, nevertheless, in a year, it has obtained an ascending line attracting all type of public and arriving at Hidden places (.) The count in the list of Galician suppliers, allows us to offer confidence and guarantee on all the products of the store, since we prove to be close and united to our land and our people.In contemplating the importance that has for us (Tea and coffee section for our guests), which is of vital importance for us, is the well-being of children, to which we will dedicate a leisure section so that the waiting time is not alterable or boring. * Being close to three schools, a private health clinic and in front of the official building of the Xunta de Galicia, we will promote healthy nutrition through healthy storefronts, with fruit and attractive lunch alternatives. *. In the same way we will be very attentive in sponsoring natural sports and cultural activities where the young people have a reference.

Opportunities: The significant and increasing increase of this type of food, as well as the lack of competition, is fundamental for the implementation of this project. Strategies: In the short term we look at the products offered by quality, presentation, prices and services of the competition, (small trade) studying in detail their weaknesses. Also in the area in which they are positioned, customer service staff, overhead (approximate guess) and type of clientele. With this data we work for a daily impulse in relation to quality, service and personalized attention, trying to cover all the needs to a maximum percentage, including the services \"extras\" of the big surfaces. * (Children's space, product tasting and specialized staff).

      "Composeher is ambitious. It might just also be unique.\n",
      "The project has been devised by the Glasgow School of Art Choir and was borne out of a recent survey by the Ivors Academy (formerly the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors) which revealed huge gender inequalities in the granting of music commissions. The survey showed that just 21% of commissioned composers within the United Kingdom are female.\n",
      "Composeher will shine a spotlight on seven composers by commissioning each of them to compose a choral work of around 10 minutes.\n",
      "Each composer will attend the premiere and participate in a pre-concert talk about the commission and the Composeher project, in conjunction with the conductor, Jamie Sansbury.\n",
      "In addition, a series of workshops with six of the composers will be held – throughout 2020/2021 – focusing on their work and processes. The workshops will also explore the current under-representation of female composers in the professional music industry.\n",
      "You may have seen the news in July 2019 that Creative Scotland has awarded part-funding towards Composeher, and the GSA Choir has committed a significant portion of its own existing funds towards the project. \n",
      "This Kickstarter campaign is to raise the required funds to pay for the lyrics in each of the choral works, a portion of the project for which we were unable to apply to Creative Scotland last year. The lyrics to be set by each composer are either pre-existing or newly commissioned texts and, therefore, we are required to pay for the rights to use (in the case of existing texts), or to commission a poet (in the case of new works). The GSA Choir is committed to ensuring that all artists whose work is being used are appropriately and fairly remunerated. \n",
      "We need to raise £4000 to cover the rights payments and all Kickstarter fees. Kickstarter runs an 'all-or-nothing' policy which means if we don't reach our required goal by the end of the campaign we won't receive a penny, so please help us spread the word, share the campaign with interested parties, and join the conversation using #Composeher.\n",
      "Whilst we want to keep the final lyrics for each piece under wraps until the world premiere performance in May 2021, we thought we would share some of the topics being written about:\n",

      "I reject the negative which is normally associated with the black color. I think that , more than white, it represents a space where gesture frees itself from any restraint or inhibition and fills, or empties depending on the circumstances, the distance between the real world and the one of the art piece: it is the transit between the darkness of oblivion and life. For this reason it cannot be conceived other than a positive force after the silence of the soul. What is more silence is a necessary step to reach a different level of experience, to enter an infinite conceptual space. To be conscious of following a path that does not have a beginning or an end. To accept accidents as precious elements and fundamental elements to the making of a project that knows no limits. It is about compositions entirely based on the use of primary elements: there are audacious depths in a monochrome sheet of paper, apertures on fantastic thin geographies in which one has to let be lead from the paper itself, guided by a new network of points of reference, to be able to feel the extension and sense its vastness: sign, tint, the physicality of color are the scaffoldings on which the creative process that, settling, takes the work to its completion. My painting wants to eliminate any coloristic reference, blast the palette in favor of a single color, totalizing and catalyst, black, which appears in a series of different colors only in relation to the amount of pigment that remains on the bottom surface at the pressure that it raises or leaves it, the only concrete action. The rest develops on the plane of ideas, exists only in thought; In this is a conceptual art, a score of light-not light, full-not full, timeless. Its uniqueness and the coexistence of two elaboration models: one almost sculptural, take off color, almost print, repetition as much as possible of the same compositional and formal theme. It's a purely tragic, overwhelming painting that does not offer a scam. It is the fist of a space full of deep void, the prologue of a terrible solution. It's a dark pause in silence. The experience of a work of art is all in the reader's willingness to let go of the discovery of a new dimension of perception, to cross the thresholds that we see but that we do not dare to cross. Art, any kind of art is the liberation from subjection to the banality of our everyday life; banality no longer understood as negative quality but as an essential part of our moods.\n",

      "The litter is back again........Part of my previous role with Transform was to over come barriers and link existing services, therefore because Cornwall has many small towns, that are all individually doing great work, some thought needs to go into targeting the people who still litter, this is where my project comes in.\n",
      "I want to exhibit my work in places that are not usual for art exhibitions, so that the work becomes educational in itself.\n",
      "I am launching and selling Art works from my website www.tidalmarks.co.uk\n",
      "Latest work from the 'Plastic Shoreline', 'Effervescence' Deep Water, 'Toxic', 'Kribow' (translation in Cornish for Reef/ widow maker surf) & 'Phosphorescence' series via our Tidalmarks website, incorporating litter findings from small beach cleans with my children over the years and I have created a great new project  that will be free for people to participate as a test pilot.\n",
      "Art Prints & Greetings Cards.\n",
      "Credit to Emily Stevens for the animation clip :) \n",
      "I have art prints and cards of many beautiful Cornish Landscape paintings available to view via on our Etsy Tidalmarks Shop.\n",
      "Sales will enable me to purchase more 6 x 4 ft canvas which cost £50 each + paint materials, as I enjoy working in larger scale and makes the texts larger for reading at exhibition.\n",
      "It gives me a  great sense of freedom to work this way and the message will be clearer, the pieces I have created are really my development test pieces, which in there own right are stunning but my journey as an emerging artist has just begun.\n",
      "Makeover \n",
      "I will need to expand my studio premises to fit and store the new canvas and also fix a leaky roof, having built the studio in our garden ourselves 4 years ago, it needs some tlc, as does the garden and gable end of the house, which is the first thing you see driving by, I want to showcase the studio in the best light as my husband and I work really hard, we are tired after a normal working day and quite frankly struggling to fit more in to our lives will be difficult and by freeing up our time to pay to have things done, would free up time and lift a burden, enabling focus on this project.\n",
      "I am offering 6 opportunities for you to 'meet the artist' and invite me to produce some work at your favourite location or at your fund raising event, business venue or corporate event. \n",
      "Or you can arrange to meet me at the studio as I can also work from photos, Great for wedding presents etc.\n",
      " Limited places available. \n",
      "(3 x Cornwall & Devon, 3 x UK mainland only) \n",
      "I would like to: \n",
      "Grow my audience and pay for more social media campaigns, raise funds to travel and exhibit my work further afield.  \n",
      "Get new signs at my house and pay for an upgraded website, as my current site has limits on the selling quantity and I have exceeded this, I also would like to upgrade my phone website, as its not as responsive as I would like. \n",
      "Develop & produce some affordable merchandise, to go with my fine art,  and community projects so everyone can enjoy taking a small piece of my art and small selection of alternative bio degradable and non plastic products to show people how to change.  \n",
      "Visit venues and aspire to be an inspirational speaker, promoting about conserving and protecting nature, using negative issues caused by man-made pollution and turning these into positive solutions, reinforcing ways to improve a more natural lifestyle.\n",
      "Questions for you with a view to forward thinking...\n",
      "Is shopping at the £1 shop a bargain?\n",
      "Do we really need to have so many plastic bottles around our bath? Can we not use soap? \n",
      "As an example, only 7% of plastic from Coca Cola gets recycled, it's being made new 93% of the time. (This is getting better, but its not enough) particularly as the U.K has been shipping our rubbish off for years to Japan, Peru and who knows where else! and probably some of our \"recycled\" rubbish is floating in the sea forming that island bigger than the size of France! \n",
      "Recently new adverts in the UK following stand up to cancer 'Bake off', are showing the new slimline can, stating 100% recycled, this has been introduced gently in my opinion, however with Michael Gove doing the U.K a great service by delivering the plastic bottle returns scheme, this will make a remarkable difference to us all, I am delighted by this news, a massive break through.\n",
      "It's really so amazing that these issues are topical thanks to the inspirational 'Attenborough effect' and team at Blue Planet ii, I'm so pleased to see so much more increased effort in lots of communities.\n",
      "Hope / Sustaining Momentum\n",
      "I truly hope that everyone can keep up the amazing litter picking and beach cleaning all around the U.K,, reinforcing fly-tipping penalties and many more community groups doing their bit is wonderful investigating packaging etc, the way forward, this is so important to keep up the 'momentum'  especially as more and more wildlife are added on to the endangered species list.   \n",
      "Education\n",
      "I used to be a teacher and would very much like to educate through the process of exhibition, which will keep raising the profile of 'banning the plastics'.  I want to do this in unique venues, that will allow people from all walks of life to view the work, as well as galleries.\n",
      "Bit of a Rant, just saying.......\n",
      "I feel it is essential for families to visit my work and interact so that future generations do not repeat the 'plastic catastrophic mess' that we have somehow embraced in the last 30 years.\n",
      "I am not perfect by any means and did not realise myself about how much damage can be caused by the way we currently live.  'I love the glitter\", bling and pearl as much as the next girly girl, however, once I started to research micro-plastics in toothpaste several years ago, before creating a painting called 'Chilli Roulette',  the more I read, the more I knew I had to change how I live, the rest has grown from there.\n",
      "Milk delivered at home, Bamboo Nappies or pull up pants that are biodegradable, washing machine filters to stop plastic fibres from our clothes washing down the drain, home made pesticides, replacing slug pellets with beer to protect birds, planting flowers for bees and butterflies,  'Pop bottles' used to be glass and children wanted to return them for sweet money, old school stuff is best! \n",
      "If you use glitter then clean it up with play dough (create sparkle dough),  do not wash the cloth under the tap and send it out to sea. #bemindful\n",
      "If humans pull together and make small changes, like refusing the polystyrene at the take-away shop, choosing the card packaging instead, then #beingmindful is your thing, its really happening.  (Thanks to my mate Fiona for being so clever with that one!).\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Hi all, I'm Rach, artist behind Bird House Press and this is my 7th Kickstarter! This time I'm aiming to get my ALICE IN WONDERLAND inspired pins and flair made.\n",
      "I have always been a fan of the crazy world of Alice in Wonderland - I live in Warrington, a town in the North-West of England that has links to Lewis Carroll.  The author was born in Daresbury, not far from the town, and the town centre has a marble sculpture of the Mad Hatter's Tea Party!  One of the churches in the town has a sculpture of a grinning cat that is said to have inspired the Cheshire Cat... my favourite character!!\n",
      " My first pin in the collection had to be the Cheshire Cat.  His enigmatic, slightly crazy smile has always made him a favourite character of mine. \n",
      " Details of the pin:\n",
      "WE REACHED THE £250 goal!!!!  Woooo hoooo!!!  \n",
      "So here is the 2nd design I have planned! This pin will be available to choose if the campaign reaches £550\n",
      "The second pin is based on my favourite phrase by the Cheshire Cat 'We're all mad here'.   I wanted to keep the design pretty simple - but link back to the Cat so I've kept the shape of his head and the big grin in the design.\n",
      "Details of the pin:\n",
      "The third pin was due to be revealed at £800 - but I have decided to let you see this little guy early - so here we have the very dapper looking - White Rabbit!!\n",
      "Details of the pin:\n",
      "This pin will be available to choose if the campaign reaches £800\n",
      "I have other idea for other pins and goodies - there is another pin design based on the Cheshire Cat (now revealed!) - as well as the White Rabbit (revealed early!), Alice and other characters - there is a whole wonderland full of inspiration!  I also want to add other goodies to the campaign - so I am excited to see how it goes!\n",
      "The image here gives a hint as to what I have planned!!\n",
      "By backing this project you will help me raise the funds to get these pins manufactured. The majority of the goal amount covers the production of the pins. The amount that remains relates to postage and packaging costs in shipping the pins out to backers.\n",
      "For those Early Birds to the campaign - there are special pledge amounts for those who support this campaign early on. Look for the Early Bird pledge amount - and grab yourself 1, 2, or 3 ALICE IN WONDERLAND inspired pins at a price especially for early backers!\n",
      "At the end of the campaign - backers will be able to choose which designs they would like from the unlocked pins. The CAMPAIGN GOALS image above gives a hint as to what they will be - the actual design will be revealed as we get nearer to the goals!\n",
      "This campaign is set to end in the first week of December - so realistically - by the time I receive surveys back, and funding from Kickstarter - we are nearly at Christmas, so these pins are going to be produced in the new year. I am therefore expecting to ship early February.  If I can ship out earlier - I will, I just don't want to over promise and under deliver!!\n",
      "Once the pins are manufactured and I have checked them -  all post within the UK will be sent out Royal Mail 2nd Class postage. For international deliveries 1 & 2 pin pledgers are sent standard international shipping, 3 pins and above get International Tracked shipping (Royal Mail signed for in the UK) as standard.\n",
      "This means no tracking numbers will be available with standard international shipping (although I always obtain proof of postage).\n",
      "If you would like a tracked delivery service with 1 or 2 pins then please don't hesitate to get in touch and I can let you know how much extra this would cost.\n",
      "When I am not doodling, eating cake or dreaming of biscuits... you can find me on Instagram HERE\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "These pins are being manufactured for me - therefore the production process is outside of my control. Potentially we could hit delays if the manufacturer experiences any issues - but this is my 7th project and I'm working with a manufacturer who has shown themselves to have a high quality of work and to deliver on time - so hopefully all good!\n",
      "\n",
      "If, however, there are any delays, I will keep all backers updated in my KICKSTARTER UPDATES.\n",

      "Please note that I will try to keep the designs as close to those images shown here in the campaign - but manufacturing processes may require slight changes.\n",

      "Approximately 12’000 red deer are hunted annualy in Switzerland. Astonishingly, the majority of these deer hides are disposed. This has occupied the biologist and hunter Conny Thiel-Egenter and the economist and chemist Kadri Vunder Fontana since spring 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017 we founded the Swiss enterprise Cervo Volante and began to develop our first fully sustainable product line.  We thrive to minimize the ecological footprint at every step of our production chain including the conservation of the hides, the transport, the leather processing, the shoe manufacturing and other constituents of our creations. We collect the skins at local butcheries in the mountains. We preserve them either by drying or by deep freezing in order to avoid the use of an enormous amount of salt. \n",
      "After more than two years of intensive work in this line of thought, the team has grown to include six members. Today, Cervo Volante offers six different styles of shoes in five unique natural colours. True to our principles, all of our products derive from deer that have been hunted and tanned in the Swiss Alps according to the highest ecological criteria and traditional handcraft. \n",
      "Fine shoes make the beginning of our first product line. Handcrafted by the grand Italian maestro Silvano Sassetti in Italy, they express the magic of the wilderness.   \n",
      "\n",
      "According to our Cervo Volante customs, we tan all of our leather 100% vegetable without chrome and with no chemical pre-tanning agents. As far as we know, our leather is one of the very few in the world which is tanned this consequently. We want our precious leather to stay as natural as possible. Therefore we do not add any synthetic agents for dying or surface sealing. A truly unique procedure today!

      "The idea of Cervo Volante was born in a climbing hall in Zürich where Kadri – a seasoned businesswoman and chemist, and Conny, a keen hunter and biologist, used to go climbing together once a week. They became friends and in addition to the common hobby they discussed different issues related to work, values and life in general. At one point Conny mentioned how much valuable raw material such as skins was wasted as nobody cared to use hunting leftover. Being responsible people, who respect animals and care about our planet and its future, making use of such waste was a topic very close to their hearts and every time they went climbing they continued the same discussion – would it be possible to produce some “natural luxury” out of that wild, valuable but wasted raw material? That was in February 2016.  \n",
      "Active as they were, they went further than just words. First, they made a feasibility study – researched tanneries and technologies on the Internet. Next they informed themselves about tanning opportunities and visited several tanneries and leather goods producers (including Silvano Sassetti and Meindl-Fashion). As both the above mentioned producers were very interested in cooperation and able to produce according to their specifications, they decided, in September 2016, to give it a try. In October their team was complemented by Marc Fischer, graphic designer, creative director and entrepreneur and Piret Puppart, professor and head of department at the Estonian Academy of Arts.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "About half a year ago, I launched a Kickstarter campaign for my Zodiac Constellation series which included the 12 traditional zodiacs and the moon. My goal was to create pieces that were relatable to the wearer, and to crete pieces that offered a way of self expression. After all, zodiacs are linked to unique dates, making each sign a special symbol of each person’s identity. This time I want to expand the constellation series, and to create a different narrative.  \n",
      "In this new collection, I’ve chosen to feature four constellations, including the  constellations of the Big Dipper, and the Little Dipper; also known as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. While there are many origin stories, the one I’ve chosen to focus on is the one about a mother and child who find eternal peace together in the sky. \n",
      " The next two constellations in the series were chosen to represent an eternal romance: Perseus and Andromeda. A story of a hero and his wife who were granted immortality to live amongst the stars.\n",
      "Each backing card contains a short summary of what the constellations symbolizes, with everything printed in gold foil on a 3.2\" x 4.2\" dark blue uncoated cardstock. The brief description of the story provides meaning to the constellation, they act as a symbol of romance between lovers, and of the familial love between parent and child.\n",
      "In addition to the new pin sets (Big Dipper + Little Dipper, and Perseus+Andromeda), I will be expanding the current gold zodiac collection to include Ophiuchus, often known as the 13th sign of the zodiac. \n",
      "Silver versions of each pin will also be available in Nickel Plating.\n",
      "Lastly I will also be including the new version of my constellation print in this campaign. The new and improved version is printed with high quality rose gold foil, on a dark blue uncoated cardstock to create a reflective metallic look with high contrast. An upgrade from my previous kickstarter campaign where both the blue and the gold were printed on matte paper separately. In comparison, the new version is shinier and constains no offset in any of its colors. The print will fit in all 8.5\"x11\" frames or larger frames with a matboard.\n",

      "Izzy and Tris are nearly identical twins but couldn’t be more different. Izzy is a wild child and can run as fiery as her red hair in the wind. Tris is brown-haired, bookish and falls through the cracks like water, as his thoughtful and methodical manner belies his age. The only thing they appear to share is the love for their father: who traveled across the world when they were very young to save them from an uncertain fate after their mother (and his estranged fiance) died amidst mysterious circumstances. What they will discover together is another world where the word “magic” takes on another dimension.\n",
      "As they pass their 10th birthday and take the first steps into their teenage years, the rift between them grows wider as their true selves begin to emerge, creating a potential unbalance with repercussions beyond imagination. Meanwhile, the planet reels from tensions in every arena of life: political, societal and environmental. While the twins mature into their respective destinies, a mounting dread methodically transcends time and space to bring further chaos in an effort for total domination. Forces of nature can heal their divide… but will that reconciliation happen in time to save Earth?\n",
      "Set in western Massachusetts, the Five College area (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, Smith & UMass) and its culturally-diverse community serves as the backdrop. Experience in the Western world of media & PR intermingles with my side trip into Eastern medicine & philosophy - while bringing in a fascination with theoretical physics - to tell a tale that bridges this world with the mystic. The medium of fantasy & science fiction leads this journey between the physical world that we feel and the metaphysical one that we sense… the battle between who we are and who the world wants us to be.\n",
      "This Kickstarter project is for the first edition - which will focus primarily on Izzy - of a prospective trilogy. The second book will address Tris’ storyline. There is a possibility of expanding on this verse with further side/back stories in the future. As far as my Rewards program is concerned, I have included an option to tailor a short side story that will include the donor in the plot line. Pretty cool! Your assistance will go towards the immense time & effort to write & print this book. I’m hoping to have WILD AS THE WIND completed by Summer 2018.\n",
      "ABOUT THE AUTHOR: I’ve been writing my entire life, hammering away at a typewriter as soon as my mother put one in front of me. My first “big” book was “The Hobbit” and I was officially hooked. I always had a great imagination - art & music have always been a part of my life as well - and the realm of fantasy and science fiction just further opened up my mind to new worlds and experiences.\n",
      "After starting out my adult life as a chef - while also trying to be a rock & roll star - I went to college in my mid 20’s. It didn’t take long for me to realize what I was meant to do: write. I wrote about anything as I traveled around the eastern U.S. and Europe (while on exchange in England) during my studies at UMass. Journalism gave me a route to explore the world in a more rational manner while my own personal work blossomed as a result, too.\n",
      "After graduation, I went on an odyssey of sorts over the last two decades, working in sports media & PR on the college, semi-pro and pro levels. Interesting side work in Eastern medicine, philosophy, etc. occurred along the way and expanded my outlook on life. Unfortunately, the sports media world is a young person’s game these days. Combine that with my long battle with Chronic Lyme Disease and I’ve come to the conclusion that its time to re-shuffle my proverbial deck.\n",
      "So, at this transitional time, I’ve gone with my heart. This project began over 15 years ago and every time I’ve come back to it, something reality-related got in the way. Now is the perfect time to take it on; especially as I proceed soon on the shady lanes of life after 50. This is truly a one-man project, starting on the ground level. And here’s where I hope y’all will hear this call to the universe and help me complete this dream endeavor.\n",
      "I chose western Massachusetts as a backdrop because I’ve lived, worked and studied here for 25 years and the region is special beyond words to me. If you haven’t been here than what are you waiting for? Food, music, culture, scenery… mystery. It has it all!

Far from being a \"dead\" market, the series proved that there was definitely a market for great stories told with a Catholic flavor and mindset. >However, despite selling through printing after printing, times grew hard for most Catholic publishers. Several Catholic publishers closed their fiction lines, and even the Young Chesterton Chronicles had to find a new home. \n",

It wasn't very crowded - in those days you could fit everyone who went to the place in one or two subway cars. But it didn't take a genius to figure out that this was the most interesting thing happening in New York City in 1976. The right people were attracted like flies, the wrong people didn't want anything to do with the dump. Pretty soon i would see The Ramones, Blondie, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, Talking Heads, Suicide and countless other bands, where in the most unlikely of places, the slumping New York City's infamous Bowery,  a small group of like minded musicians and artists had their sights set on the future. \n",

I was influenced by everyone from Diane Arbus to Robert Frank, from Brassai to Walker Evans, from Weegee to Garry Wiinogrand.\n",

      "People who were at CBGB's in those days, 1976-79, tell me these pictures look exactly as they remember it. Now it's time for these photographs - this piece of history - to be collected in a high quality, well printed photography book. \n",
      "I have an amazing designer and top quality printer, and with your help this book will go into production as soon as I meet my goal.  I will keep all contributors updated and on top of the project as things progress, with photos and updates. We'll even be having a contest to settle on a final book title, that can win you a free copy. You'll be along for the ride, and have the final product in your hands by the end of the year holidays. \n",
      "Additionally, I'm thrilled that Jim Jarmusch - director of the classic \"Stranger Than Paradise\"  and current \"Only Lovers Left Alive\" - who btw hung out at CBGB's - has agreed to do the intro for the book. We'll also be getting some other \"regulars\" involved in the project.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens to the energy that ripples away from us in our best moments? My finest moments were spent holding an art class enthralled. \n",
      "\"Once upon a time, when I was an awkward teen with terrible bangs, a sparkly purse, and a Tool t-shirt, I took a photo class at Maine East. Brandi Martin was my teacher. She was everything all of my other teachers were not: Accessible. Real. Honest. Relatable. She treated us like we were people already. Fast forward to now: thanks to social media we reconnected a few years ago and she is the big sister I never had. \n",
      "One day in class, she was demonstrating how to adjust darkroom enlargers and said \"If you turn the knob this way, it will unscrew and this whole very expensive piece will come crashing down...\" She looked up with a dramatic pause, met each of our eyes to make sure we were looking at her and paying attention. \"...do not turn the knob this way.\" She raised her eyebrows at us and paused again, let it sink in, and it did. Do not turn the goddamn knob this way, people. I would not. Ever. \"Turn it this way instead. You will feel it make these very satisfying little clicks.\"It was a 20 second snippet of my life 13 years ago, and I remember that exchange. The exaggerated way she paused and made sure we were watching, the \"satisfying little clicks\" was the perfect description of what we were supposed to feel for. As a parent, I have employed that strategy many many times. The quiet. The big pause. The opposite of shouting, but so, so much more effective.\n",
      "That's a little piece of Brandi that I carry into the world with me. It's a little piece of my teacher that my kids go into the world having experienced. There are over 9000 of us that spent a semester or an entire 4 years with her. Some of us became artists or photographers, but the vast majority of us did not. Yet we still carry these little pieces of her, of all of our teachers, out in the world with us.So where are the 9,000 now? What are they doing? The pieces of Brandi making art, raising children, making sandwiches, nursing sick people, building roads, building stock portfolios. They are standing in waiting rooms, sitting in church, yelling in traffic, resting in an urn, laying on a beach.\n",
      "Please consider funding this incredible art project, building a portrait of these pieces who have been scattered around the world over the last two decades.\"\n",
      "There's no standardized test to measure lifelong educational influence. This requires the hard way, locating and visiting 20-30 former students, talking to them about their lives, and what art now means in their daily lives. After taking it all in, I'll make a meaningful portrait about them and their world.  \n",
      "I've already begun tracking down former students, talking to them about the project. I tested the waters by creating a Facebook group. It already grew to 213 members! I asked them to make a video stating their name, age, location, major life activity, and what class they took with me, and got more than I bargained for. I spliced some of the results together to create the video above. These aren't even all of the replies; so many asked me visit and document them! I was deeply moved when Nick actually wrote a song about what he remembered from photo class.\n",
      "The final product will be a gallery show in Brooklyn next summer (location TBA) that speaks to the humanity of these wonderful people, and to the best kind of student/teacher relationships. I plan on capturing testimony about how the memories of teachers and students continue to influence the quality of each others' lives.\n",
      "You can help make this happen with your contribution. Your contribution will enable me to travel around the US and for some photo equipment. Any funds that exceed the total will be put towards additional travel to Europe, Brazil, and Japan, where even more of my Diaspora awaits!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "They really do want me to come. I imagine one problem might be that some former students may change their minds about being included in the project. That simply means I have to document more than I need. There is no shortage.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have most of the equipment I need, but my camera is a bit slow, so I'd like to add a faster DSLR to my camera bag.\n",

      "It was like a bolt of lightning in my studio!  Just like Benjamin Franklin, I was playing with water and electricity when something shocking happened.  \n",
      "I had been in my garage studio seeking inspiration.  I was working with water and coins, exploring new ways to illustrate the fluid nature of money.  As I walked Buddy one night, I found a pane of glass in the alley and was inspired to try something different.  I had seen an image from a Dutch artist who used glass, soap and a female model to create a great photo.   The idea was that soapy water would cause a cool refraction of an object behind the glass.  Since I didn't have a naked model, the shot didn't really work, but when I cleaned off the glass - it happened!  \n",
      "I was shocked...\n",
      " In the 1/1000th of a second that my lights burst, something magic was created.  I was mesmerized by what I saw.   It made me laugh.   For the next several weeks, I threw a lot of water at my camera.   I played with colors and backgrounds.   I threw the water fast and I lobbed it slow.  My studio walls were streaked with water and the floor was soaked.  It didn't matter what I did, the results were consistently amazing.   I was in a creative zone like I'd never known and I am still.  That unexpected bolt of lightning changed the entire trajectory of my photography.  What started out as a few dozen images has grown into a significantly deeper collection.  I see no reason to stop the momentum of this inspiration.  It really is a lot of fun.  \n",
      "I'm going to create a physical portfolio of nine 16\" x  24\" prints and a set of fifteen 24\" x  36\" prints with the funds from this campaign.  The images will be printed on brushed metal and will be of the highest archival quality.  The portfolio will be the introduction to prospective buyers and the large prints will be ready to deliver when a buyer says yes.     When this campaign ends, the emphasis will flow into establishing an art gallery presence of my work.  I will keep the updated evolution of this work on my website, www.alanhillphoto.com. \n",
      "I've also been experimenting with portraits of people within the set of the Splash concept.  See Update #6 for examples.  It's pretty fascinating.   Give me a shout if you'd like to model for me.   \n",
      "Why do I want the money?  The costs of producing the portfolio and the large prints are $5,230.  The costs for contributor gifts, Kickstarter fee, and Amazon credit card processing are $3,000.  The total campaign cost is $8,230.  The overage of $1,770 will be used for cost of sales.  I expect to travel to present my portfolio.  This campaign is the booster rocket to get this project off the ground.  \n",
      "Why am I using Kickstarter?  I could go to the bank and get a less expensive loan for the same amount, but the process of getting a loan contributes nothing to the marketing presence of the project.  This Kickstarter campaign does.  \n",
      "What about credit card security?  Credit card transactions are done through Amazon.  \n",

      "Questo progetto è iniziato per me nel 2012, ma ha subito mille rimaneggiamenti perché volevo fare qualcosa di davvero epico.\n",
      "This project started for me in 2012, but it has undergone a thousand refinements because I wanted to do something really epic.\n",
      "Questo lo rende a me particolarmente caro, poiché è un progetto che prende ben cinque anni della mia vita. Perciò riflette molto i miei cambiamenti, le mie vicissitudini e il mio percorso.\n",
      "This makes me particularly important, for it is a project that takes five years of my life. So it reflects my changes, my vicissitudes and my path.\n",
      "Grazie a Kickstarter però ora spero di fare un passo avanti e iniziare la vera e propria stesura. Per ora ho delineato solo le mappe, le vicende e la trama in generale. Ho inoltre scritto 80 pagine della parte iniziale. Col vostro aiuto spero quindi di potermi dedicare finalmente alla fine del processo, ovvero la bella copia per intenderci.\n",
      "Thanks to Kickstarter now I hope to step forward and start the actual draft. For now I have only outlined the maps, the stories and the plot in general. I also wrote 80 pages of the start. With your help I hope that I can finally dedicate myself to the end of the process, that is, thereal copy.\n",
      "Il genere è Fantasy Young Adult. I protagonisti sono adolescenti, e per questo si portano le problematiche tipiche di quell'età: amicizia, amore, trovare un posto nel mondo. Ma anche omofobia, razzismo e povertà .\n",
      "The genre is Fantasy Young Adult. The protagonists are teens, and for this reason they bring the typical issues of that age: friendship, love, find a place in the world. But also homophobia, racism and poverty.\n",
      "Tutto questo però in un contesto magico, popolato da misteriose e pericolose creature, dove si comprano e vendono pozioni, dove maghi e meccanici convivono pacificamente.\n",
      "All this however in a magical context, populated by mysterious and dangerous creatures, where potions are bought and sold, where wizards and mechanics live peacefully.\n",
      "Oltre quindi al tema dell'amicizia, dell'amore ( etero, gay o materno/paterno ) e della magia, per non parlare dell'adolescenza, si affiancano il problema dell'inquinamento, povertà e corruzione.\n",
      "Beyond the theme of friendship, love (ethereal, gay or maternal / paternal) and magic, not to mention adolescence, the problem of pollution, poverty and corruption is also alongside.\n",

      "1. Sogno\n",
      "Radura, 1° Giorno Prologo, Mattino \n",
      "Una leggera brezza mi scosta i capelli, portandomi una ciocca giù sulla fronte e provocandomi un leggero prurito sulla pelle. Un caldo raggio di sole mi sta riscaldando l’orecchio destro.\n",
      "Devo aver dimenticato la finestra aperta ieri sera, e ora il caldo mattino mi sta dando il benvenuto. Inizio a stiracchiarmi portando le mani verso la nuca come sono solito fare, ma la sensazione sulla pelle è totalmente diversa.\n",
      "Cerco di aprire le palpebre per capire cosa siano quelle piccole striscioline morbide, simili a ciuffi di peli. Il cane deve essere salito sul letto, non c’è altra spiegazione.\n",
      "Il raggio di sole sta lentamente raggiungendo i miei occhi impedendomi di aprirli, così rimango in quella posizione per un altro paio di secondi.\n",
      "D’un tratto mi mordo il labbro corrugando la fronte, com’è possibile che un rottweiler pastore tedesco si sia infilato tra il minuto spazio tra la mia testa e il muro?\n",
      "Riapro gli occhi incurante del bruciore causato dalla luce, porto istintivamente una mano per proteggere il volto e a poco a poco comincio a mettere a fuoco le mie dita. Intorno alla sagoma di quest’ultime predominano fasci sfocati di verde e blu.\n",
      "- ma che? - mormoro tra me e me. Tolgo la mano, ormai la vista si è abituata all’ambiente, e tutto prende forma. Sono nel mezzo di un immenso prato fiorito, circondato da fitti alberi. Mi rendo inoltre conto di essere all’ombra dell’unico albero nel centro della radura e capisco che la sensazione di prima era dovuta alla morbida e verde erba.\n",
      "La mia mente fatica a pensare qualcosa di sensato, mi sento piuttosto confuso. Cerco di ricordare quello che ho fatto ieri. Si, ecco i ricordi riaffiorano.\n",
      "Ripercorro brevemente la giornata e infine mi ricordo di essermi ubriacato, quindi probabilmente ora sono nel mio letto, o almeno spero di essere nel MIO letto, e sto avendo un sogno più fantasioso e realistico del solito, per via dell’alcol.\n",
      "Senza essermene reso conto mi sono seduto con la schiena appoggiata a quella che pare essere una giovane quercia. Percorro nuovamente la radura in lungo e in largo osservando i fitti alberi, sembra così buio laggiù.\n",
      "Non ci si dovrebbe svegliare, una volta capito che si sta sognando? Mi massaggio la nuca, una debole ma crescente fitta mi pervade. \n",
      "Se mi sono ubriacato come l’ultima volta devo aver battuto la testa in ogni singolo angolo. Un leggero sorriso prende forma sulle mie labbra, ma dubito che contagerà gli occhi.\n",
      "Comunque non ho il tempo di scoprirlo, qualcosa nel bosco attira la mia attenzione. Che idiota di cosa mi preoccupo, è un sogno! E c’è persino luce ... ultimamente i miei sogni sono tutt’altro che luminosi.\n",
      "Beh è inutile aspettare di svegliarsi, forse devo raggiungere un qualcosa per poterlo fare ... anche se francamente non sono sicuro di volermi svegliare ... o almeno non subito.\n",
      "Mi alzo leggermente più pesante del solito, chissà da quanto tempo giacevo in quella posizione. \n",
      "- ma che sto dicendo - mormoro quasi ammonendomi, è solo un sogno non giacevo lì sul serio!\n",
      "Ecco un altro spostamento, questa volta più visibile. Le felci ai piedi degli alberi si muovono ancora velocemente, troppo per essere semplicemente l’effetto della leggera brezza. Guardo meglio avvicinandomi di qualche passo, i miei piedi affondano nell’erba alta.\n",
      "Una macchia indistinta gialla compare nell’ombra dell’albero più esterno del bosco. Mi fermo, leggermente impaurito, la macchia sembra avere dimensioni notevoli, forse persino più alta di me.\n",
      "Sforzo ancora di più la vista, cercando di capire se si tratti di un animale o magari di una persona con un abito giallo. A poco a poco riesco a individuarne i contorni e riconosco quello che sembra un enorme becco arancione.\n",
      "2. - Dobbiamo muoverci! - esclamo agitato fiondandomi verso il gruppo. Gli uomini sono ancora troppo intenti a gesticolare, ma i miei compagni si voltano turbati.\n",
      "Kimberlin mi tocca la spalla - stai bene? -. I suoi occhi mi scrutano con preoccupazione, sa che raramente mi spavento in quel modo.\n",
      "Una voce si fa largo nella mia testa, fredda. Terribilmente fredda. Sembra una donna, ma non posso dire che sia umana. Sussurra il mio nome una volta.\n",
      "Proviene dalle rocce dalla parte opposta dello spiazzo, dove la vegetazione sembra distrutta dal gelo. Si, ne sono sicuro. Sono sicuro che ci sia un’ombra laggiù.\n",
      "“Will… Wiiiiiiiiiiiil” la voce esplode nella mia testa, proprio mentre Nate si lancia su di me. Sento il mio volto affondare nel suo petto, vengo sbalzato per terra.\n",
      "Tutto accade molto velocemente, e ci metto diversi secondi ad afferrare che siamo sotto attacco. Nate mi scuote con energia, sento la sua calda voce spronarmi - ehi William, ci sei? Dobbiamo mettere in salvo queste persone! -.\n",
      "Batto le palpebre riprendendo il controllo, mi rialzo afferrando il mio arco. Al mio fianco Nathan continua a castare scudi mentre una raffica di proiettili si riversa su di noi. Proiettili? Si ci stanno sparando con dei fucili, le armi proibite. \n",
      "Che il popolo di Obscuria abbia trovato un accesso a delle vecchie armi? Effettivamente sia le uniformi che le armi non sembrano in perfette condizioni. Un proiettile si disintegra proprio davanti alla mia testa, scontrandosi con lo scudo.\n",
      "Nate mi aveva salvato la vita. Si è piombato su di me proteggendoci giusto in tempo con la magia. Lo fisso per un istante. Poi Kimberlin crea un diversivo per permettere agli uomini nascosti dietro il carro di dirigersi verso il cunicolo che ci aveva portato qui.\n",
      "Lancia un enorme sfera di fuoco dritta contro i nemici, una decida di guardie provenienti dall’unica strada oltre l’arco di pietra. Questi vengono investiti in pieno e sono obbligati a spegnersi le fiamme di dosso, intenti a urlare di dolore.\n",
      "Dietro il fumo riesco a scorgere tuttavia altri uomini e degli oggetti non definiti avvicinarsi a passo svelto.\n",
      "Mi reco insieme ai miei compagni verso il cunicolo per tornare ad Arcadia, sento altri spari partire all’impazzata. \n",
      "Mentre i primi due uomini scompaiono nell’oscurità noto Nate fermarsi per continuare a farci da scudo, io mi fermo a mia volta.\n",
      "- Nate muoviti - gli urlo io mettendomi in ginocchio e scoccando una freccia dritta contro il braccio di un soldato che si stava avvicinando troppo. Sento una fitta allo stomaco non appena essa gli perfora la carne.\n",
      "Entrano gli altri due uomini e poi scoppia il caos più completo: un enorme sfera di metallo, probabilmente una palla di cannone, colpisce prepotentemente la parete sovrastante il passaggio.\n",
      "Stordito dal botto assordante mi volto per assistere alla scena. Vedo Kimberlin scaraventare di forza l’ultimo uomo dentro il passaggio, appena in tempo prima che degli enormi massi di roccia ricadessero dritti contro il suolo. I rombi assordanti si uniscono agli spari dietro di noi. \n",
      "Kim si scosta di lato con una ruota evitando dei frammenti, vedo il suo viso segnato dall’agitazione. Si rialza cercando un passaggio tra i detriti, ma è inutile. La via è bloccata. Siamo accerchiati senza una via di uscita, e per la prima volta riesco a intravedere della paura sul suo volto.\n",
      "La verità si stava facendo chiara anche a lei, la verità su come sarebbero andate le cose: avremmo ucciso i nostri nemici… o loro avrebbero ucciso noi.\n",
      "La rossa si perse un attimo nei suoi pensieri, poco prima aveva fatto la sua decisione. Aveva deciso di non infilarsi nel cunicolo lasciandoci indietro, ma di rimanere con noi a combattere.\n",
      "Perché è questo che Kimberlin sa fare meglio, combattere. E non appena lei stessa se ne ricorda, abbandona lo sconforto della situazione inaspettata e soprattutto inspiegabile. La vedo posizionarsi in assetto di guerra e farsi avanti.\n",
      "Nate che finora si era semplicemente occupato di tenere alto lo scudo si volta cercando il suo sguardo e, trovando un solido supporto, decide di agire.\n",
      "Intorno a noi si profilano oltre una decina di uomini, tutti armati nella stessa maniera. Tuttavia dietro di loro altri due manovrano quello che riconosco subito essere il cannone. Prendo una freccia e miro immediatamente alla gamba di quest’ultimi.\n",
      "Colpisco il primo uomo, subito scocco la seconda freccia ma un soldato si frappone per evitare che il cannone venga messo fuori uso. Lo colpisco in pieno petto.\n",
      "Sgrano gli occhi. Mentre lo vedo cadere in una posa innaturale per terra e assisto al sangue scarlatto riversarsi sugli stivali dei suoi compagni, il mio cuore si ferma. I miei muscoli si pietrificano.\n",
      "Kimberlin completa la mia opera con una sfera di fuoco che colpisce in pieno il bersaglio, tramortendolo soltanto. Troppo tardi comunque. La miccia ardeva e la mira era già stata presa.\n",
      "Proprio in quel momento Nate si distrae per colpire con quanta più energia gli consentano le sue capacità i soldati con un’onda d’acqua.\n",
      "Quando la sfera di cannone viene liberata e il fragore riempie le nostre orecchie, Nathan, stanco e indebolito dallo sforzo, cede cadendo all’indietro.\n",
      "Kimberlin prende il suo posto, alzo uno scudo con le mani verso il cielo. I colpi della seconda ondata di nemici ora pesano sulle sue spalle. \n",
      "- Will, ti prego. WILL! - la sento urlare da così distante. Batto finalmente le palpebre più volte, poi raccolgo l’arco e mi fiondo su Nate che tossendo cerca di rialzarsi. Ha diverse bruciature sui vestiti, e evidenti graffi sulle braccia, ma la sua espressione è forte e determinata come sempre.\n",
      "Uso un incantesimo di cura veloce per sostenerlo, poi mi giro verso i nemici che sembrano aumentare sempre più e provo a pensare a una soluzione. Ma l’unica cosa che riesco a vedere nella mia testa è la freccia conficcarsi dritta nel petto di un uomo.\n",
      "No, non è vero. C’è anche un altro pensiero che si manifesta prepotentemente. Un’ombra scura ai piedi della parete rocciosa alle nostre spalle. \n",
      "- c’è un passaggio di là - sussurro infine. Sento quasi un peso nel pronunciare queste parole. Ebbene ho paura. La figura che avevo visto sa il mio nome e ci sta aspettando. E ho paura di trascinare i miei amici in una trappola. \n",
      "Ma magari mi sono solo immaginato tutto. E comunque… che scelta abbiamo?\n",
      "Nathan mi scruta con i suoi occhi blu, lo sento quasi penetrare nella mia mente. Il suo viso corrugato in un’espressione indagatrice.\n",
      "- muoviamoci allora - esclama Kimberlin, poi lancia un cenno al compagno e come tre fulmini ci lanciamo in ritirata.\n",
      "Decine di proiettili mi sibilano accanto, alcuni proprio vicino alle orecchie. Voglio reagire, ma non ci riesco. Vedo Kimberlin invece continuare a lanciare alla cieca delle sfere di fuoco, mentre Nate alza nuovamente una fitta nebbia dietro di sé.\n",
      "Vedo la vegetazione secca e le rocce appuntite farsi più vicine, poi cambiando prospettiva scorgo finalmente un passaggio. \n",
      "Non appena varchiamo l’accesso e le pietre mi offrono protezione mi fermo, raccolgo le energie e erigo un enorme muro di ghiaccio. Poi mi ricongiungo ai miei compagni e proseguiamo a passo svelto nello stretto passaggio tra le rocce. \n",
      "Percorso un centinaio di metri sentiamo un’esplosione seguita dal rumore di vetri infranti. La mia barriera è stata abbattuta.\n",
      "Kimberlin si volta sorpresa ed esclama - che razza di armi sono! Come può una cosa così piccola a sprigionare una tale potenza! -.\n",
      "- continua a correre - la ammonisce il compagno. Ma avverto lo stupore persino sul volto di Nate, tuttavia non faceva vacillare la sua sicurezza nemmeno un secondo. Mi chiedo se abbiam mai avuto paura in vita sua. \n",
      "Ripensandoci durante la prova sembrava più rassegnato che spaventato. Poco prima che il ghiaccio…\n",
      "Ghiaccio? Le rocce in torno a sono ricoperte di ghiaccio e camminiamo ormai da diversi metri sopra della neve fresca.\n",
      "- Nate! - urla la rossa con incertezza, vedo il vapore acqueo uscire dalla sua bocca.\n",
      "- non lo so, ma è l’unica via - risponde secco affondando pesantemente i piedi nella neve sempre più alta.\n",
      "Poi dopo un’ultima svolta a destra compare la fine del percorso: una piccola salita che si insinua nell’ingresso di un enorme grotta. L’intera apertura è formata da spuntoni e pilastri di ghiaccio.\n",
      "Con un po’ di fantasia ricorda un enorme bocca con delle fauci gelate. La voce nella mia testa si ripresenta. Sento un brivido lungo tutta la schiena e sono costretto a fermarmi.\n",
      "I miei compagni rimangono interdetti. Kimberlin mi si avvicina, il suo tocco caldo sulla spalla mi ravviva per un secondo. Ma la vedo tremare e percepisco lo sforzo nel mantenere alta la sua temperatura. La sto portando nel luogo più avverso a chi ha il dono del fuoco. Una volta lì dentro, sarà facile preda. \n",
      "- vi sto portando in una trappola - sbiascico in fine.\n",
      "English translation made with google, the project is it in Italian so I'm not going to traslate it, at least for now!\n",
      "1. Dream, 1st Prologue Day, Morning\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "A slight breeze shakes my hair, pulling me down on my forehead and causing a slight itch on my skin. A warm sunbeam is heating my right ear. I must have forgotten the window open last night, and now the warm morning is welcoming me. I begin to stretch out my hands to my neck as I usually do, but the feeling on the skin is totally different. I try to open my eyelids to figure out what those soft little stripes are, like tufts of hair. The dog has to get on the bed, there is no other explanation. The sun's ray is slowly reaching my eyes preventing me from opening them, so I stay in that position for another couple of seconds. Suddenly I blunt my lip, wrinkling my forehead, how is a German shepherd rottweiler stuck in the space between my head and the wall? I re-open the careless eyes of the burning caused by light, instinctively hand a hand to protect my face and gradually begin to focus my fingers. Around the shape of the latter, blossoms of green and blue dominate. - but what? I murmur between me and me. I take my hand, now the vision is used to the environment, and everything takes shape. They are in the middle of an immense flower meadow, surrounded by dense trees. I also realize that I am in the shade of the only tree in the center of the clearing and I understand that the first feeling was due to the soft and green grass. My mind struggles to think something sensible, I feel rather confused. I try to remember what I did yesterday. Yes, here are the memories coming back. I briefly cover the day and finally remember I was drunk, so I'm probably now in my bed, or at least I'm hoping to be in my bed, and I'm having a dream more imaginative and realistic than usual, because of alcohol. Without realizing it, I sat with my back leaning against what appears to be a young oak. I walk past the clearing long and wide watching the dense trees, it looks so dark down there. Should not you wake up, once you realize you're dreaming? I massage my back, a weak but growing dullness pervades me. If I'm drunk like the last time I have to beat my head in every single corner. A slight smile takes shape on my lips, but I doubt it will catch my eyes. However, I do not have time to find out about it, something in the woods attracts my attention. What an idiot of what I'm worried about is a dream! And there is even light ... lately my dreams are far from bright. Well it is useless to wait to wake up, maybe I have to get something to do it ... even though frankly I'm not sure I wake up ... or at least not right away. I get slightly heavier than usual, who knows how long I was in that position. - but what I am saying - I murmur almost admonish me, it's just a dream I did not lie there seriously! Here is another shift, this time more visible. The ferns at the feet of the trees move still fast, too much to be simply the effect of the gentle breeze. I look better at approaching a few steps, my feet sink into the high grass. A faint yellow spot appears in the shadow of the tree's outer tree. I stand, slightly afraid, the stain seems to have considerable dimensions, perhaps even higher than me. Try even more the sight, trying to figure out whether it's an animal or maybe a person with a yellow dress. Gradually I can locate the contours and recognize what looks like a huge orange beak.\n",
      " 2. - We have to move! I exclaimed agitated and slid toward the group. Men are still too good at gesturing, but my companions are upset. Kimberlin touches my shoulder - are you okay? -. Her eyes are scrutinizing me with concern, know that I rarely get scared like that. A voice goes wide in my head, cold. Terribly cold. It looks like a woman, but I can not say it's human. You whisper my name once. It comes from the rocks on the opposite side of the square, where vegetation seems to be destroyed by frost. Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure there's a shadow over there. \"Will ... Wiiiiiiiiiiiil\" the voice explodes in my head just as Nate throws me over. I feel my face sink into his chest, I'm embittered on the ground. Everything happens very fast, and I take several seconds to grasp that we are under attack. Nate shakes me with energy, I hear her hot voice spin me - hey William, are you there? We need to save these people! -. I bend my eyelids, taking control, I get up and grab my bow. At my side Nathan continues to shield while a bullet bursts over us. Bullets? We are shooting with rifles, weapons forbidden. That the people of Obscuria have found access to old weapons? Indeed, uniforms and weapons do not look in perfect condition. A bullet disintegrates right in front of my head, colliding with the shield. Nate saved my life. It has plummeted on me, protecting yourself right in time with magic. I fixed it for a moment. Then Kimberlin creates a diversion to allow hidden men behind the chariot to head to the tunnel that he had brought us here. He launches a huge sphere of fire against enemies, a decade of guards coming from the only road beyond the stone arch. These are invested in full and are forced to turn off the flames of lightning, screaming with sorrow. Behind the smoke I can see other men and unspecified objects approaching quickly. I go with my companions to the tunnel to go back to Arcadia, and I hear other shots kick off. As the first two men disappear in the darkness known Nate stop to keep shielding us, I stop for myself. \"Get on the move,\" I shouted, kneeling down and rocking a straight arrow against the arm of a soldier who was approaching too much. I feel dull in the stomach as soon as it penetrates the meat. The other two men enter and then the most complete chaos breaks out: a huge metal sphere, probably a cannon ball, strikingly hits the wall above the passage. Stunned by the dumb bang I look to see the scene. I see Kimberlin stomping the last man into the passage just before the enormous rock boulders fell straight to the ground. The sloppy rhombs join in the shootings behind us. Kim shakes his side with a wheel, avoiding fragments, I see his face marked by agitation. It raises the gap between debris but is useless. The road is blocked. We are surrounded without a way out, and for the first time I can see the fear on his face. The truth was also clear to her, the truth about how things would go: we would kill our enemies ... or they would have killed us. The red man lost momentarily in his thoughts, shortly before making his decision. He had decided not to go into the tunnel, leaving behind, but to stay with us to fight. Because that's what Kimberlin knows best, fight. And as soon as she remembers her, she abandons the unexpected despair of the situation, and above all inexplicable. I see her standing in the wake of war and getting ahead. Nate, who until now had merely been busy keeping the shield high, turned to look at her, and, finding a solid support, decided to act. Around us, over a dozen men, all armed in the same manner. However behind them two others maneuver what I immediately recognize as the cannon. I take an arrow and immediately go to the leg of the latter. I hit the first man, immediately picked up the second arrow but a soldier stands to avoid the cannon being put out of use. I hit it in full chest. His eyes are lifted. As I see him dropping in an unnatural pose on the ground and assisting scarlet blood pour over his comrades' boots, my heart stops. My muscles are petrified. Kimberlin completes my work with a sphere of fire that hits the target in full, trampling it only. Too late anyway. The fuse was burning and the aim was already taken. Right at that moment Nate is distracted to strike with as much energy as possible by his soldiers with a wave of water. When the cannon ball is released and the rumble fills our ears, Nathan, tired and weakened by the effort, drops backward. Kimberlin takes his place, I raise a shield with her hands to the sky. Shots of the second wave of enemies now weigh on his shoulders. - Will, please. WILL! I feel screaming so far. I finally knock my eyelids several times, then I pick up the bow and lean on Nate, coughing up and trying to get up. She has a variety of burns on her clothes, and obviously scratches on her arms, but her expression is strong and determined as always. I use a fast care spell to support it, then I turn to enemies that seem to grow more and I try to think of a solution. But the only thing I can see in my head is the arrow sticking straight into the chest of a man. No it is not true. There is also another thought that manifests itself exaggerately. A dark shadow at the foot of the rocky wall behind us. - there's a passage over there - finally whisper. I feel almost a weight in saying these words. Well, I'm afraid. The figure I saw knew my name and is waiting for us. And I'm afraid to drag my friends into a trap.But maybe I just imagined it all. And anyway ... what choice do we have? Nathan looks at me with her blue eyes, I almost feel it penetrating my mind. Her face corrugated in an inquiring expression. \"Let's move on then,\" Kimberlin exclaims, then nods to his companion, and like three lightning strikes us back. Dozens of bullets hiss next to me, some close to my ears. I want to react, but I can not. I see Kimberlin instead continue to throw blindly the spheres of fire, while Nate again raises a dense fog behind herself. I see the dry vegetation and the sharp rocks get closer, then changing the perspective I finally see a passage. As soon as we reach the access and the stones offer protection I stand still, collect energy and erect a huge ice wall. Then I rejoin to my companions and we proceed step by step quickly into the narrow passage between the rocks. A hundred feet down we hear an explosion followed by the noise of broken windows. My barrier was demolished. Kimberlin looks surprised and exclaims - what kind of weapons are! How can such a thing be so small to release such a power! -. \"He continues to run,\" admonishes his companion. But I even wondered at Nate's face, but he did not even shake his security for a second. I wonder if we've ever been afraid in his life. Thinking about it during the test seemed more resigned than scared. Just before the ice ... Ice? The rocks are covered with ice and we are now walking several meters above the fresh snow. - Nate! Shouts the red with uncertainty, I see the steam coming out of his mouth. \"I do not know, but that's the only way,\" she says dryly, sinking heavily in the snow. Then after a last turn to the right you will see the end of the trail: a small climb that creeps into the entrance of a huge cave. The whole opening is formed by spikes and ice pillars. With a little fantasy, he remembers a huge mouth with frosty mouths. The voice in my head reappears. I feel a shiver all along my back and I'm forced to stop. My companions remain silent. Kimberlin approaches me, his hot touch on my shoulder enlivens me for a second. But I see her shiver and feel the strain in keeping her temperature high. I'm bringing it to the most adverse place to those who have the gift of fire. Once in there, it will be easy to prey. - I'm leading you into a trap - I suspect in the end.\n",

In order to do this first and foremost we will need to pay for extra tutor recruitment; nobody is willing to work for free we understand this. We will also need to pay for venues for our students and tutors to teach reliably within their living area across multiple cities. As well as get in contact with the surrounding schools and places of education in order to set up extra classes for students who require extra help from us. We will need to advertise our company to an acceptable extent including keeping up a social media appearance as well in order to raise awareness of our company including creating our very own website and website videos which will add extra costs for us – we hope to become a large, well known company.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "This summer I have the incredible opportunity of participating in a residency program at Artscape Gibraltar Point in Toronto, Ontario. Oh, Canada! The residency  is located on Toronto Island, situated in Lake Ontario just off the coast of Toronto, and is only accessible via ferry! While at the residency I will be producing a new series of large cyanotype photographic prints using giant paper negatives combined with traditional contact printing techniques. I am running this Kickstarter campaign to fund the supplies I’ll need to complete this project.\n",
      "Cyanotype is a very early (c. mid 1800’s) photo process that is practiced today by photographers working in alternative processes. Its most recognizable feature is the vibrant blue color of the final prints (prussian blue to be exact). The chemicals used are applied to any absorbent material, dried, and then exposed under UV light, commonly the sun, which has also given them the name “sunprints”. You can either make photograms by placing actual objects over the sensitized surface, which is what Anna Atkins became famous for, or you can contact print negative if you prefer more photographic effects.\n",
      "I use cyanotype for a few reasons. First, I'm not stuck in a smelly darkroom for hours in order to get a beautiful image and there are less chemicals involved. (It develops in water, how great is that?) Large scale cyanotype printing it is much more economical than darkroom prints. Also, compared to many other photographic processes, cyanotype is relatively forgiving because of its low sensitivity to anything other than UV light. Since exposures are measured in minutes rather than seconds, I can alter the final product in ways that would be nearly impossible in a traditional darkroom setting. For me, it’s the perfect balance of predictability and latitude for experimentation.\n",
      " Well, that’s kind of a difficult question to answer since I haven’t made the work yet, but I will answer questions I do know the answer to which might get us most of the way there. \n",
      "Additionally, you could view some of my work at benpanter.com in order to get a better feel of my aesthetic tendencies.\n",
      "Three words: Time, Space, and Community. A huge value of a residency is simply dedicated time away from daily routine where one’s only task is to fully engage with the creative process. The studio space and tools provided as a part of the residency are also important because it gives me a way to work which is normally difficult in my own studio. Also, I feel that spending time in close proximity to others who are engaged in their creative process is the best way to expand one’s own practice. I look forward to meeting new artists and I know for certain that an artist friend of mine will be there during the same period. So, I’m hoping we can engage in some collaborative work.\n",
      "Different residencies offer a wide range of opportunities, and Artscape Gibraltar Point supplies the right balance for my needs right now. I’ll have my own studio, access to a full darkroom, (which will come in handy if I’m coating and drying light-sensitive material) plenty of open space in which to be inspired and make work, and I’ll be spending time in a community of artists which should prove invaluable through the exchange of ideas. \n",
      "I am running this $600 Kickstarter campaign primarily to fund the supplies I need to make work. Also factored in are fees and taxes that I’ll have to pay as well as the rewards I’ll be shipping out to you. Specifically, the supplies I'll be purchasing are:\n",
      "STRETCH GOAL 1 - SUCCESSFUL!\n",
      "If I get $100 more ($700 total) I’ll be able to add on a few more supplies that will allow me to work on a small side project while in residence. Since the cyanotype process needs bright sunlight, it's really got a 9-3 kind of timetable. So I've decided on this additional project which dovetails nicely with that in mind. I've always been fond of pinhole photography, so I plan on taking some low light digital pinhole photos. In order to do this I'll need a pinhole lens cap for my camera and an intervalometer in order to allow for very long exposures.\n",
      "STRETCH GOAL 2 - UNLOCKED\n",
      "Any money beyond the first $700 will go towards the trip expenses (travel, room & board) which totals over $500 for a grand total goal of $1200. We can do it!\n",
      "I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of rewards I would want to receive from a project like this, and I’m really excited with what I’ve been able to make available.\n",
      "I hope you are as excited to receive these rewards as I am to make them. If you have any questions feel free to ask.\n",

      "SYNOPSIS \n",
      "This is the story about Rufio, before the mohawk, before Neverland, before he was The Pan. \n",
      "Roofus is a 13-year-old kid who is destined to be more than he is. After his mother is forced to put him into a foster home, he and his rag-tag group of best friends - a Jamaican boy named Julani and a bright-eyed latina force of nature named Ella - find a way for Roofus to escape his ill fate, find his happy thought and fulfill his destiny. \n",
      "The story has been reverse engineered from what was set-up in Hook. We answer all the questions you've ever wondered -- How and why is Rufio the leader of the Lost Boys? Where does \"bangarang\" come from? And of course, how he gets the mohawk. \n",
      "In a world of endless sequels, prequels, and reboots - we feel Bangarang holds a unique place. , The key for us is that this movie is a social commentary on the current world climate. We are taking a beloved character out of his comfort zone. \n",
      "This is an underdog, coming-of-age film in all the best ways. It's the story of a under represented group of heroes - bullied because they're different, and nothing more (such as Roofus, who comes from a immigrant family) - who won't let their villains get in the way of destiny. We think there's a hunger for good storytelling and strong execution, as well as fun original characters. With Bangarang, we plan to do just that. \n",
      "If our production budget is met, and we exceed our target number, we've set up a dream milestone:\n",

      "The early Internet was a vast, unregulated frontier where users discovered totally new and unexpected sides of themselves.  The opportunity to invent a new life and join a new community through an avatar revolutionized communication and social connection.  This was particularly true in the cold, dark aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Ishkhan, a young Armenian man, discovers a new side of himself through an online game community.  He is more comfortable expressing himself as a beautiful woman in a fantasy universe than as a downtrodden man in a bleak home scenario.  But how do others see him, online and offline?\n",
      "Welcome to the Kickstarter campaign for Role Playing Game!\n",
      "Role Playing Game tells the story of a young man in post-Soviet Armenia who reinvents himself through a massively multiplayer online role playing game [MMORPG].  The opera addresses themes of loneliness, alienation, gender expression, and the complicated relationship between traditional cultures and our new digital world.\n",
      "Featuring a cast of four and a supporting ensemble of twelve, the music blends Armenian folk music and Japanese videogame music into the opera style.  Specifically, synthesizer, Armenian duduk, Nintendo GameBoy, and digitally processed voice supplement a chamber ensemble of strings, clarinets, and piano.\n",
      "Though many people are intimidated by opera, this project presents an accessible and entertaining 90-minute experience.  The story is contemporary, and in English; the music draws on cultures from outside the traditional old-world settings of the famous operas.  The production also features original projections behind the stage.\n",
      "The protagonist of Role Playing Game, Ishkhan, creates an avatar that is everything he is not: bright, beautiful, free, and female.  At first, this new online persona reinvigorates his self-esteem, but then he naively plunges into an unhealthy relationship with another player online.  His mother, with great dismay, watches the game absorb her son; she worries how he will fulfill his role as an Armenian man, and she cannot understand the force the online world exerts on him.  This opera embraces the astounding social opportunities of the Internet but acknowledges the dark, addictive side of anonymous online interaction.\n",
      "_____________________________________________________\n",
      "I am producing the entire opera on my own, without a professional opera company or backing from an institution. The money raised from this campaign goes towards renting the venue, producing/recording the shows, and the awesome musicians who have dedicated much time for very little money.  Additional funding beyond the goal is much appreciated and will go towards superior video/audio recording, additional performances in the future, and paying the musicians a fee closer to what they deserve.  An $18 donation includes a discounted ticket to either performance.\n",

I believe in the music and in the story of Role Playing Game, but it will take some creative and aggressive marketing to draw people to the show.  I will be pushing for press coverage, but it is tough to guarantee marketing success for a super-low budget self-produced opera.

      "Exposure to live music is certainly not an essential, but it can help to lift moods and minds and remind people going through a tough time of when they played, what they played and how much they enjoyed doing it. Dignity Music is a project designed to uplift the heart.\n",
      "The first year of Dignity Music I presented eight concerts for the homeless and marginally-homed population of New Haven at the St. Thomas Moore Soup Kitchen, Stepping Stone Transitional Housing program, Fellowship Place and the New Haven Free Public Library. Two years ago, though Kickstarter funding and a Community Arts Grant from the City of New Haven, I presented thirteen concerts with a variety of musicians who presented everything from Baroque trios to Irish jigs and reels. Last year, I presented five concerts and continued to build particular relationships with the Sunrise Cafe and the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen. At every concert guests at the kitchen come to chat about music, what they like, what they played or continue to play. It is always a cheerful experience!\n",
      "All musicians were paid under the going rate and prepared beautiful selections of music designed to cheer people up (no late Beethoven :).\n",
      "The goal for 2018-19 Dignity Music is modest, but I plan to apply for the Neighborhood Cultural Vitality Grant in order to present ten concerts during the darkest time of the year.  All of the $1,000 raised (after Kickstarter fees), will go to pay musicians; I receive no payment for the administrative aspect of this project.\n",
      "The video is now outdated, but many thanks to John Fon Kovalsky and Joey Ortiz for making it!\n",

      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The challenges of Dignity Music always include finding the *right* musicians for this project: friendly, nonjudgmental, talented and flexible! Some of the \"regulars\" include Ben Dean (violin), Philip Boulanger (cello) and Bethany Wilder (violin / viola); these are wonderful musicians, but also people who enjoy talking with people and connecting to others through music.\n",
      "Another challenge is making sure we are in the right environment to present music. Most conversations are interesting and kind, but aggression and fights can break out and it is important to keep the musicians (and their instruments) feeling safe.\n",

      "An album blending Mexican folk tales, Bulgarian rhythms, and film noir atmosphere\n",
      "An album that explores the mystery and magic surrounding the month of October through various Mexican folktales and artists. The music features a quintet of solo violin, harp, guitar, bass, and world percussion. The centerpiece of the album is a violin concerto with the featured quintet surrounded by a full orchestra. It is inspired in part by Wayne Shorter's jazz classic \"Fall\".  \n",

      "Overview of Project\n",
      "We are making a very special fine art painting. The painting shows good people passing along a beautiful world to young stewards in a perpetual stewardship relay.\n",
      "Kickstarter makes it fun, easy, and inexpensive to participate. An explanation of the importance of the work is shown below.  Suffice it to say that -  if you choose to participate you will be proud to say that you are an original backer this wonderful kickstater project. \n",
      "Imagine yourself helping to make the best world ever. Imagine all the kickstarters and everyone everywhere working together to make that happen.  Imagine teaching and preparing the youngsters (youngstarters) to do an even better job. Imagine passing along that beautiful world to the youngsters who in their turn - make the world even better. Imagine that happening over and over again in a perpetual stewardship relay.\n",
      "This painting shows how kickstarters and good people everywhere are helping to make it  happen. They are truely making a beautiful home for all living things. A home for freedom and respect for the individual. A home for all to peacefully love, share, cherish, protect, preserve,  and enjoy.\n",
      "This beautiful fine art painting is a portrait of humanity, the living earth - our home, and the cosmos. As you can see,  the power of art allows us to place you and all of humanity in the painting twice; once as a youngster and then again as an adult. The painting has a very special message.\n",
      "The message of the painting is - We are all making the world a better place. We all are working together to improve our own lives, the world in which we live, and our future - and we are a very small part of a larger creation. We are all participants in a perpetual \"Stewardship Relay.\" \n",
      "Billions of good people are working together to improve the World. They work together to prepare the youngsters to do an even better job. That whole situation is a beautiful \"Stewardship Relay.\" A relay that just keeps happening over and over again. And things just keep getting better and better. And it never seems to stop. It may sound a little idealistic at first; but it is really happening.\n",
      "This very special painting is tribute to all the kickstarters and good stewards everywhere - past, present, and future. \n",
      "It is also a gentle reminder that time is short; and before you know it - you are passing along a better world to the next generation.\n",
      "Also important -  we want to sell prints of the work to get and keep this message in front of as many people as possible (especially the youngsters) and so that we can fund the project and further fund the business of continuing to promote the work and its message. \n",
      "Practical Application\n",
      "When you talk about making the world a better place and why it is important - everyone has a different picture in their head. This project provides you with a beautiful picture that you can point to and say, this is what we are trying to accomplish and this is why it is important.\" It provides a really good  visual aid  -  so everyone sees the same picture.\n",
      "You will be proud to display this picture in your home, business, school, government building, place of worship, or other institution. If you choose to help out now and fund the project now - you can get a print that shows that you are an original funder of the project - Very Special. \n",
      "Painting's Message\n",
      "We all are working together to improve our own lives, the world in which we live, and our future - and we are a very small part of a larger creation. We are all participants in a perpetual \"Stewardship Relay.\"\n",
      "Who are we? \n",
      "Free Stewards LLC; doing business as Free Stewards. There are two main collaborators for this specific project: the person that conceived the work and a skilled fine artist. The work (painting) reflects  important values that we all share. I can tell you that the skilled artist is of the highest integrity.  We want this work to reflect the highest values and integrity so there is no funny business. OK. \n",
      "Overall Mission Of Free Stewards\n",
      "Promote public awareness of and encourage preservation and safeguarding of the environment and creative works of art.\n",
      "What we are planning to make?\n",
      "A 6 foot by 10 foot -  oil on canvas high quality fine art painting.  We are aiming high, i.e., the best possible painting ever. To fund the project we are offering several print sizes to choose from. Since the painting is relatively large, most are reduced size prints. We are offering one cropped print. The cropped print focuses on the hands and the earth as shown below.  \n",
      "For the record we are painting (both literally and figuratively) the greatest work of art ever. The greatest work of art ever is of course all of creation by our creator. We are rendering that work with an emphasis on humanity, i.e., how we shape our lives, the world in which we live, and our future.\n",
      "If you feel there is a greater creative work please let us know - with a short explanation, but please no pictures of your spouses. \n",
      "Where did this project come from?  \n",
      "The image was conceived some time ago. There are registered copyrights and also a registered trademark. So this particular project is a derivative work situation - done in the fine art format. \n",
      "What’s our plan, and what’s our schedule?\n",
      "The project and painting are well thought out.The hard part of the work is done, i.e., figuring out what to paint. The mock-up (as shown above) is complete. The painting will be finished very soon. It is a simple painting that is easy to execute - at least for someone skilled in the art. \n",
      "What’s the budget?\n",
      "The budget provides for high quality investment grade art work and high quality rewards as noted. We will maintain high quality and integrity at all times. The majority of the funds go to the skilled artist. Funds over the goal mainly go to continuing to promote the painting and its message.\n",
      "Why do we care?\n",
      "The same reason everyone else does. It seems that making the world a better place is  hard-coded in the human DNA. This painting will help by providing an excellent visual aid as well as a symbol for good stewards to rally around. On a personal note, I believe that understanding the painting will have a powerful and positive influence on our future. It is the greatest work of art ever executed by the greatest artist ever. \n",
      " An artist's painting.\n",
      "Art is very powerful communication tool. In this situation the skilled artist is literally using his hand (as shown in mock up below) and the power of his craft to help shape the world and make it a  better place for the benefit of everyone.  \n",
      "Original quotes for this project\n",
      "Quote 1   -    \"before I can believe in anything else I must first believe in myself.\"\n",
      "                      \"before you can believe in anything else you must first believe in yourself.\"\n",

      "Be part of history by supporting the Hellenic Museum's upcoming exhibition, SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES. \n",
      "SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES is a one-of-a-kind exhibition that captures the spirit and history of both the contemporary and mythological worlds. The exhibition draws parallels between the Greek siege of Troy and the Gallipoli campaign, and links the modern world to the ancient, touching on the universal stories of humanity that transcend civilisations.\n",
      " \n",
      "Sidney Nolan was a major figure in Australia's Modernist art movement. In a career that spanned five decades he explored a variety of themes through his art, but none more consistently, and with more variety, than that of mythology. Experimenting with figures, landscapes, mythologies and histories whilst staying on the Greek island of Hydra in the mid 1950s, SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES proved to form one of the most influential periods of Nolan's life, culminating in two of his great series, Gallipoli and Leda and Swan. \n",
      "The exhibition will be enclosed by stark black gallery walls, contrasting against the vibrant colours of 61 original Nolan works - some never before seen - including priests in sunglasses; goats; prickly pears; boats in the harbour; and scenes of Homeric warriors such as, Theseus and the Minotaur, Icarus and ancient Greek theater masks.\n",
      "The works in SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES were all nearly modest in scale, and it is said that the handful of larger works were abandoned owing to difficulties in arranging transport.\n",
      " \n",
      "Your gift—at any level—will support the exhibition and related events, and help ensure we showcase this amazing piece of Hellenic-Australian history in a spectacular way. You will be awed by the design of the gallery and the depth of content that will be presented from Thursday 24 August, 2017. \n",
      "Our budget for the exhibition has been set to include: framing $7,015; lighting $2,500; painting $500; installation $500; printing $1,500; launch event $2,500.\n",
      "For supporting our efforts, we will thank you with a variety of perks including private tours, exhibition merchandise, and access to exclusive events.\n",
      "If you can’t contribute, you can help our cause by sharing our SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES campaign with your friends and family through social media using our handle @HellenicMuseum. Every bit helps! \n",
      "Your generosity plays a key role in helping the Hellenic Museum continue its mission to inspire a passion for Hellenic art, history and culture - connecting the past with the present to inspire our shared future. Thank you. \n",
      "A portion of your contribution may be tax deductible. Please consult your tax advisor. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",

      "The film tells the story of how one young woman overcomes personal tragedy. We were excited to make a movie that dealt with realistic themes against  a vibrant backdrop. In the process, we were able to film in some of Cook County's beautiful forest preserves and work with an array of talented student and local actors. \n",

      "Nicole Ramberg is a senior at Northwestern University where she has spent the last three years learning the true meaning of film making and friendship. Nicole first fell in love with storytelling when her dad read her The Hobbit at the ripe old age of 6 and then proceeded to submit ridiculously long stories to her English teachers for the next twelve years. Broken Roots is her first short film and she couldn’t have made this film without the hard work and support of her wonderful producers, Jon and Evan, and her talented cast and crew.\n",
      "Producers:\n",
      "Jon Rizik is the creative partner and best friend of writer/director Evan Rindler. Jon admires the fact Evan discovered his love of storytelling at a young age by creating poorly drawn Star Wars spin-off books. Jon has seen Evan's first attempts at filmmaking in high school, which he has since improved from. Jon appreciates that Evan came to Northwestern University and struck up a creative partnership. Together, they produced Broken Roots, a feat that neither of them could have achieved alone.\n",
      "Evan Rindler first met his creative partner, writer/director Jon Rizik at Northwestern University in 2012. Evan was immediately drawn to Jon's stories of how, from an early age, he crafted short films and music videos on his father's camcorder. Evan was also interested to learn that Jon was dedicated to creative outlets throughout his teens by taking part in speech competitions, playing guitar, and constantly writing creative fiction. Evan is thrilled to have just finished his first feature with Jon Rizik, How We Became Famous. At the young age of 20, they are both excited to begin their careers as filmmakers and ready for their next project.\n",
      "Check out the full cast and crew list at the bottom of the page!\n",
      "We're proud to say that principal photography has wrapped. To make the film we had to pay for equipment rentals, location fees, permits, food, transportation and more! We have received a generous grant and have worked to recoup our investment, but we are still trying to finish paying back our crew who paid for many of these things out of pocket.\n",
      "More importantly, we hope to share Broken Roots with the world by applying to film festivals. Film festivals have expensive entrance fees, in addition to mailing fees. \n",
      "Now that we are in the ending phase (editing, sound design, color correction) we need help to make sure that Broken Roots reaches the widest possible audience, and that our crew can afford to continue making challenging, beautiful films.\n",
      "In return for your generous donations, we're offering a host of rewards. Of course, no matter what amount you donate or reward you choose, you have our genuine thanks. We're grateful that your gifts help us make this dream a reality. \n",

Possibly you-the person that is reading this and I want to share the passion I have for my brand with you.  Amanda Cupcake is already established and just ready to do great things, but I am asking for funding support from you to help me take this brand to the next level and share the cupcake love quite possibly in your town.  How do you do this?  You can select a pledge amount on the right side of this page, starting at $1.00 and up and I will in turn reward you with lots of cupcake love for your belief in my dream to quite possibly turn the Amanda Cupcake brand into a household name.  My initiative is to not only to sell cupcakes, but to become a brand like Starbucks, Disney, or for bakers inspiration.. like Mrs. Fields the cookie company!I have a partnership already with a big box retailer that wants me to expand my line of cupcakes to more of their stores.\n",
      "I am asking for funding to help me move into a larger distribution kitchen and hire one team member to start to help me grow.  I have been renting a transitional small church kitchen on an as needed basis, but they have asked me to leave as soon as possible since I am not the tiny little bakery girl they imagined.  They said they aren't equipped for a full on traveling bakery like me to be working in their kitchen. (No doubt I am grateful for this church's help though, they haven't kicked me out, they let me use the kitchen when I need it until I can move out).I ended up in the hospital this past November because I thought I could do it all-the baking, the decorating,  the business end, and being the face of my company. (I am a very passionate person)!  It took my body being tired for me to see that I needed to restructure my business plan so that it could grow with a team of different people doing things that they are great at!I reconstructed a business plan where I simplified my company to focus on distribution to retailers to start, and we'd grow from there with other fun possibilities once we had our foundation set.I simplified our flavors to 3-4 best selling recipes that I have already worked the past 4 years to master and we will gradually start to distribute these flavors to grocery stores and retailers everywhere, hopefully eventually expanding outside of Wisconsin.As we sell more, we can master our recipes further, and hire another person to add to our team.  As we grow, we will gain expertise in how production works and we could then outsource some of our product to contract manufacturers or even sell our licensed recipes to retailers that have fixed kitchens so they could bake our recipes right in their store.  In the future, I see little Amanda Cupcake teams throughout Wisconsin and hopefully nationally (or maybe one day globally) baking away in the kitchen making our best selling cupcakes. Think about how Mrs. Fields cookies did it. Yep, that's my vision! (Except mine is a little sparklier and fluffier).I have a commercial kitchen promised to me right now, but I promised myself I wouldn't just move into a whole kitchen facility again without the financial backing that I need to rebuild a healthy business platform where I can hire a helper and relaunch this winning business model of mine where I am the face of the company, the person behind the branding, marketing & product developers and I have a team helping me bake and decorate my cupcake recipes!This business model supports the growth and production of not only a product-but an awesome brand,.My inspirations are Starbucks, Walt Disney, Betsey Johnson.This Kickstarter is the truest test to my customers (and future customers) support. \n",
      "I am looking to you - my community - to support me and help me relaunch this business so that I can deliver cupcake love, and the Amanda Cupcake brand to your hometown!  None of this possible without you.\n",
      "I've faced a lot of glory in this business, but I've also learned the hard way that when you are manufacturing a product (especially a small one that you need to make lots of to be able to make a living off of), that you can't do it all alone, and that you need the right space to grow creatively!What your Funding will do:Cover expenses to move into my new larger commercial kitchen space so that I am no longer at the church kitchen.Hire my first employee in this new business adventure.Help me invest in a commercial freezer that is needed for production.\n",

      "Instagram. I communicate with daily who are constantly posting, asking me to sell product in their town.\n",
      "Other fans want to know where they can buy my product.  I also post bake-at-home recipes you can try on my blog!\n",
      "What some may not know is how many long nights, early mornings, sore joints, wet shirts, and frosting splattered pants I've been through so that I can share my passion through a cupcake as my medium.  I have to tell you-it is so rewarding / worth it when I see the product on the shelf.  I feel like I am paid in love when I make my customers so happy that they cry or jump up and down and squeal with delight.  I cry or squeal with them because their connection with Amanda Cupcake is my world.\n",
      " After trying to work with several “investors” (I even auditioned on Shark Tank), I still haven’t found my \"sidekick\".  I started this brand from nothing but a dream in a kitchen out of a small diner in my hometown, and thousands of cupcakes later, it looks as though my dream is starting to be so tangible that you can touch it (or eat it)!\n",
      "What else is in the future of Amanda Cupcake (after we get through this plan) ?1.  An Amanda Cupcake license. And with that, a line of licensed Amanda Cupcake products (think of how Walt Disney did\n",
      "it, but Amanda Cupcake would be the edible, sparkly, sugar sweet version)!  2.  A recipe book (I have already been writing one and working with an illustrator, I even wrote the story)!Is there a retail store in the future of Amanda Cupcake?  Someday I would love to open up an Amanda Cupcake destination.  I'd name it THE CUPCAKE MANSION.  An entire mansion with walls made of sugar and glitter dedicated to a sweet lifestyle---a destination that the Food Network could talk about because it would be so exciting. Maybe in the future when we are ready we can launch another Kickstarter for this idea.   When I open this place, I want to do it right, so that we are prepared for the awesomeness that is in the future of a cupcake mansion!  \n",
      "Right now the best way to fund and support the end vision of a Cupcake Mansion would be to sell my cupcakes at fixed retail stores that have displays just waiting for Amanda Cupcake product to fill their space!Rewards:If you invest in Amanda Cupcake, you will be\n",
      "rewarded! Not only will you be rewarded\n",
      "knowing you are a part of a growing brand.But you will also be rewarded in Amanda Cupcake Swag that is offered here as a reward.\n",
      "Rewards are listed on the right side of the page, but here are some photos of the awesome rewards you will receive for believing in the Amanda Cupcake brand!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "You may be asking, how do I make a profit on something that has an expiration date on the shelves?  I have mastered a shelf life recipe (without using additives or preservatives)!  My secret is that I immediately store my product in air tight plastic containers and I sell them in display freezers at my big box retailers.  My cupcakes can last 30 days this way, and I have little to no waste.  I have proven this theory already by selling them at the Big Box Retailer I currently have a partnership with!  My customers have an understanding that the cupcakes will take a little while to thaw out, or if my local customers want cupcakes they can order them special from me as long as we have it booked in our calendar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patience: \n",
      "\n",
      "I have big dreams as Amanda Cupcake and I want to see them all happen (just as you do as my backers).  To grow in a healthy direction, you won't see everything happen overnight.  We must move forward in mini cupcake steps, with intention on building a healthy brand. ♥  I have already proven through gaining love all over Wisconsin that this is a brand that can grow and make a difference in the world!\n",

      " With every growth and change you see happen, you can know that you are a part of it, but I ask for your patience in building Amanda Cupcake.\n",

Sponsorship could be sole (£23,000), split into two (£11,500) or into four sponsors. Costs cover course fees, material costs and expenses, and I hope that the research can become useful in the scientific field to benefit health concerns in the future.  Colour has been a constant theme in my work, as I believe it to be a very powerful communicator with our subconscious minds and how it reacts with our bodies. Colour is a relatively under developed language, unique to each individual, and can be interpreted differently depending on culture. Our eyes are constantly absorbing visual images from the world around us. These images, taken in through the retina and processed by the mind, can fill in the blanks to make sense of what we see. This means that sometimes the mind will make connections from previously stored information of memories on form and colour linking patterns together, whether they are actually linked or not. The retina itself organises visual sensations of light before they become perceptions in the brain. Nonrepresentational works of art make the eye and information gathered work in a different way to pictorial representation.\n",

Tasked to create an identity for American national music, Dvořák believed that it could be found in the music of the 'primitive', not steeped in European tradition.

      "The QuarterTones worked with David McIntyre in 2014 on his composition \"Argyle Street\" which was a piece for flute quartet. The piece went on to win the 2014 Newly Published Music Award -Chamber Music from the National Flute Association. It has since been performed internationally and remains one of David's most popular pieces. We hope to collaborate again, this time on a piece for flute quartet and piano. The addition of the piano to the ensemble creates a new dimension within the composition, as since David himself is an outstanding pianist and amateur flutist, the combination is extremely exciting for him! \n",

We hope to premiere the work itself during the Pride festival in Saskatchewan in June of 2018 and hope for further performances elsewhere in Canada and around the world!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "With a spray can in Melbourne, Australia, my painting career began and continued through New Zealand and back home to the United States. I was hooked on starting new murals and it was the perfect solution to creating artwork without the comfort of a studio. The downside being that, while I had nice photos of my work, I didn't have the time nor space to create a series of detailed physical paintings. With the beginning of my art career budding from travel experience I am packing my bags again and setting off to South America to begin a residency in Buenos Aires. I have been accepted into the Proyecto 'Ace International Exploration Art Residency in Buenos Aires, Argentina! \n",
      "This is a month-long residency, afterwards I will continue my travels and create murals along the way. My goal is to challenge myself to not only paint walls along the way but to create a collection while travelling. As an artist, you require space, solitude, a wide array of materials, and time to create a collection. All of these things are lacking or nonexistent when travelling. I'm going to push myself to find creative ways to focus and paint while on the road and create a body of work that is personal and also reflects the locations I visit.  \n",
      "The $1,600 will fund the program fee and materials. I will cover all travel and personal expenses.\n",
      "With this goal, I will finally be able to invest the resources and time into creating multiple collections - a long time dream of mine! \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "A big risk for this residency and my entire trip is working on the road and not being able to finish artwork/murals in time due to lack of materials and the length of my residency. Because I have travelled while working in the past I feel more comfortable to take on this challenge.\n",

      "Art is an expression of how we feel, who we are, where we have been and where we are going. Owning an original piece of art that speaks to your special occasion is something that everyone should have to help tell the story about that moment in time when the next step was taken whether into personal or business history.\n",
      "As you can tell by the video, I am not a natural speaker. My strengths lie in artistry and written words. If you will see past my awkwardness, you will find merit and interested (dare I say excited) engagement in funding this fun and creative new venture.\n",
      "While creating new and interesting paintings, I was inspired to pull from the ether a new design studio brand to showcase and sell not only original art, but greeting cards and accessories that feature a beautiful photograph of that original art.\n",
      "Currently, I am working on projects at my kitchen table between meals and household duties. In order to fully realize my dream, I must rent a studio space where I can become inspired, create, market, store and sell my art along with a showcase area to feature the boxed sets of cards and accessories. All boxed sets come with the option of a greeting printed inside for any occasion as determined by the purchaser.\n",
      "I created a business plan and learned about the costs associated with space, materials (paint-related, et al.), furnishings, camera, lighting, and so much more, building a new brand, advertising, creating a web presence and forming business relationships necessary to carry the brand forward for a permanent presence in the industry and future growth.\n",
      "Niche cards are gaining a stronger foothold in the card industry because of the individual messages in the pictures as well as the words. My plan includes the opportunity for customers to purchase the original piece of art to display in the new owner's home or business. Occasions like birthdays and weddings can have original announcement cards sent AND the bonus of presenting the original art to the person(s) celebrating. This model works well for businesses that are just beginning, reinventing AND celebrating an anniversary!\n",
      "I welcome questions, suggestions and contributions. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a painting will say more to you in the first moments than any speech ever could. Thank you.\n",

      "make an impact. As a 27 year resident of Vermont, blessed with a shared sensitivity for sustainable living, I came to fear that much of general public has either taken for granted or turned a blind eye to the incredible gift we have in our National Park System. Millions of acres of protected lands, chosen for their awe inspiring beauty, untamed habitat, and diverse wildlife are at imminent risk of losing protections, devastating development, drilling, and sell off. As the firestorm of change emanates from Washington, I am alarmed by the seeming lack of concern for the future of our parks.\n",
      "  \n",
      "We live in an age of on demand information driven by electronic relationships. Our most influential and powerful generation at risk has been raised seeing our country and the world through the lens of Google. I fear the National Parks have lost their importance in the minds of citizens, as if a Wiki search of the Grand Canyon equates to seeing our parks or even worse that a drive-by “selfie” at the rim posted to Instagram is a cheap substitute for truly experiencing the priceless gift that it is. Without personal, authentic, and emotional connection to the marvel of true nature, the parks will lose value and one day become a shadow of a once great tradition. As an artist, observer, and interpreter of nature, I am urgently driven to create a wake-up call using my gifts and great personal risk to preserve the legacy of the National Parks. \n",

In the spirit of his inspirational legacy, I hope to lift up his concept of The Wilderness Idea - “A mystique; a valid, intangible, non-materialist experience”. To this end, I desire to revisit some of the locations of the iconic photographs of Adams interpretation of wilderness and on the very same ground, interpret through paint a new record of these precious places as well as discover new spots along the way. Through a valuable permanent collection of plein-air paintings, and a personal study of the park’s people, I will record “Postcards from the Parks” though a virtual travel journal blog. Using social networking, environmental preservation organizations, and project partners, I intend to create a tribe of followers and awaken a new appreciation for our parks as Adams did almost 75 years ago. The ultimate goal is to create awareness, appreciation, and action to motivate a new generation to hit the road, experience these gifts with their own eyes, “Honor Ansel”, and join the resistance to protect these places for future generations. \n",

One of my older brothers passed August of 2011 and that took a major toll on me because he was honestly my best-friend. I didn't want to be bothered by anybody for months afterwards and couldn't see any reason to continue living. Early October of this same year my ex-girlfriend came and picked me up from my oldest brothers' home. She'd called prior and told me she needed to talk to me but it had to be in person. So we reached her house and that's when she told me she was pregnant. At this point in time, I'm a directionless 21 year old who just lost his best friend and brother so this was a bit much to process. Yet I took responsibility and for the next 9 months I moved back in with her to make sure she was as comfortable as she could be during the pregnancy. \n",

      "I now had my reason to fight for my life and it came because of this beautiful woman. This was when the thought of honoring the ideal woman was initially birthed. \n",
      "I want to pay homage to the art and beauty that women birth on a daily basis. Whether it's a birthing life, a hug, or merely a smile, women have the ability to lift men to the best versions of themselves without us even knowing. \n",

      "\"The new Ben-Hur release is conducted by Nic Raine and features the City of Prague Orchestra and Chorus in a presentation that should become the standard for classic score reconstruction. It has been amazing to listen to the Prague Orchestra develop over the years from questionable, to serviceable, to solid, to exceptional. The sound quality of this recording is about as good as one could imagine. The sections that incorporate organ and full orchestra never find the keyboard overwhelming the sound picture, but it does come forward at the right moments. Piano lines can be discerned when necessary, adding accents, but always balanced within the ensemble. Given the modern recording techniques at play, the sheer craft of Rozsa’s orchestrations resonates here perhaps even more so than on the OST.With this release, they have outdone themselves, cementing their place in film music history as one of the finest re-recording ensembles for the medium\". —Steven A.

      "My name is Jon Higdon and i am making a YouTube series called bloodbound. Its about supernatural beings living in the modern world. It will follow the creatures and how they view humans, the world, and how they choose to live. Some will struggle with morality while others thrive on mayhem. The story follows a vampire named \"kavin\" and his struggle to hold on to the last bit of humanity he has. Redemption is a hard road and kavin will certainly have a lot of challenges along the way! \n",

      "--------joelcosmejr/community-grounds-coffee-and-meeting-house------\n",
      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "The Vision:\n",
      "Sell ethically, and when possible, locally sourced coffee, tea, and food to keep the lights on.\n",
      "Provide a meeting space for anyone who needs it, from block watches to planning neighborhood holiday events, from political activists to board game enthusiasts.\n",
      "Use the sound stage to host all ages shows that are truly welcoming to all. Most venues rely on alcohol sales for profit, and in doing so become inherently unwelcoming spaces for people who can’t or don’t drink.\n",
      "The Story:\n",
      "For years, it's been our dream to open a community gathering place where people can meet, share ideas and work together to make the South Side the best it can be.\n",
      "\tWhen we asked our friends Colleen Dempsey and Danny Lemmon to join the cause, they immediately had ideas about how they would use the space to create the community they wanted. \n",
      "Colleen, a social worker who lives and works on the South Side dreamed of support groups, having often thought “I wish there was an AA for people who aren't alcoholics. A place to check in, to listen and be listened to.” Danny's head went straight to music, “I came into music in a scene built by people who were under 21. We couldnt play at bars and clubs so we played  in churches, and our parents' basements. To have a permanent space for shows that did not rely on alcohol sales to stay open would be fantastic.” \n",
      "So that's Community Grounds, a place to gather, and host the kinds of events we dream of, but more importantly the kind of events YOU dream of. There's a reason the place is called Community Grounds, and a reason the website is mycommunitygrounds.com. Tell us what you want to do here, we can do more together than any of us could alone. \n",
      "The Coffee and Food:\n",
      "As much as possible, our food will be grown within our community gardens. There are currently three pocket gardens (with more soon to come) where the vegetables for several events, including Tara and Joel's wedding, were grown. With your help we'll create a green space on the roof of the building for growing even more vegetables and herbs. We believe we have more green thumbs per capita than most of the city!\n",
      "\n",
      "Several local coffee houses have offered to provide us with the training needed to ensure our success. From making the best pour over coffee in the neighborhood to working an espresso machine that costs as much as some of our cars, our fellow coffee aficionados will help us guarantee that every drop of coffee served is among the best. We will be working with local Ohio suppliers who use fair trade practices to provide the community with honestly sourced coffee and organic teas. We'll also be working with local restaurants and chefs to provide our neighbors with a variety of options including vegetarian and vegan choices; at Community Grounds, someone looking for a non-dairy milk product won't have to pay extra.\n",
      "The Meeting House:\n",
      "\n",
      "When you see “Coffee and Meeting House,” meeting house could mean lots of different things to different people, and we hope it will. We want to create a space that enables people to host the things they want and need.\n",
      "Want to put on a play? We'll have a stage. \n",
      "Want to put on a concert? We'll have a sound system. \n",

      "that's been without life for nearly two decades. Known to residents as the old sweeper store; it was built in 1925 on the corner of Cline St. & Parsons\n",
      "Avenue. It was the time of \"Glass and Steel\" for the South Side of Columbus. At a time when businesses thrived and all the buildings breathed life.\n",
      "The building served as the community library until\n",
      "the mid-1960s and then as the base for the Central Sweeper Exchange vacuum repair\n",
      "shop until the early 1990s. We are working hard to find more historical\n",

      "Because\n",
      "of its age, the building is in need of some upkeep; plumbing and electrical upgrades\n",

      "repairs are done at low cost and high quality. They are among many who have\n",
      "faith in our vision and believe that Community Grounds: Coffee & Meeting House will provide this beautiful building life and memories once again.\n",
      "With 2400 sq feet to work with, we have a lot in mind. The front of the building will house the cafe and performance stage. While the back area will be used for the kitchen and an office that will have it's own storefront. We'll also be renovating the two apartments upstairs which have not been lived in since the mid-1970s. \n",
      "The Neighborhood:\n",
      "The most important aspect will be our involvement in the area. Community Grounds will be located within the borders of the Ganthers Place Civic Association. A strong and active community that has been a shining example for the South Side of Columbus. This close-knit community will be working together to help us succeed through the combined efforts of talented and skilled residents. We are proud to live with a diverse group that consists of business owners, legal counselors, social workers, musicians, artists, community activists & leaders, landscapers, woodworkers, and pretty much any skill you can imagine. \n",
      "You will become an honorary member of the community by backing this project. We hope that, regardless of where in the world you live, you'll know that you have a second home in Ganthers Place, Columbus, OH.\n",
      "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems (or so we hear):\n",
      "Most banks would not invest to create a space like this in a neighborhood like ours. Crowd funding through Kickstarter takes the decision making power away from entities only concerned with profit, and gives it to the people who will actually be affected. We want to build something to be proud of, and like most good things in life, we can't do it alone. Your support is incredibly important to us, and this is a breakdown of what your backing goes towards.\n",
      "After Kickstarter fees & rewards, we'll have about 85% of our funding remaining. The majority will be used to finalize the purchase of the building. The rest will be used to repair the plumbing, electrical and heating. This will allow us to begin the process of re-designing the space into the vision you see above. We'll be working with local, community and small business focused architects who have offered to provide services at low costs.\n",
      "As you may know, Kickstarter runs an All or Nothing campaign. This means that if we do not meet our goal by the deadline, we receive nothing. This is why we need your support to make the dreams of our South Side residents a reality. We are committed to making every dollar you provide stretch as much as possible. \n",
      "Only YOU can help make this a success. We hope that you will stop by and have a drink once we're up and running. We'll be here to welcome you to your second home.\n",

      "Our efforts have not gone unnoticed in Columbus. We've received some great media coverage which has brought excitement to the South Side:\n",
      "Columbus Underground\n",
      "WBNS 10-TV \n",
      "WSYX ABC 6 & WTTE FOX 28\n",
      "Simple Marketing\n",

      "Our Founder Joel, has even received some extra time in the spotlight after being awarded the National Retail Federation's Dream BIG Scholarship:\n",
      "NRF Scholarship Class of 2014\n",
      "Even Congresswoman Joyce Beatty gave him a shout out on her Twitter & Facebook pages!\n",
      "We are excited for future coverage in order to help us gain more backers. But, don't forget that YOU have the power to share, like, favorite & re-tweet us to your friends and family. YOU are the reason why we will succeed.\n",
      "Special Thanks:\n",
      "We wanted to take a moment to thank the many people who came out to our launch party in body and spirit. You are all an example of the vision we all have for Community Grounds: Coffee & Meeting House.\n",
      "Thanks for the wonderful music: Grapefruit Moon, Playing to Vapors & Discount Tents. We hope to see you all again for our Kickstarter success party!\n",

      "\n",
      "Our partnerships with The Parsons Avenue Redevelopment Corporation and the Parsons Avenue Merchants Association (http://parsonsavenue.org/) will also provide us with resources along the road to success. We also have a community of skilled painters, electricians, plumbers, and various other volunteers who will do even the smallest job to help make this dream a reality.\n",

      "Bart Proot studied Industrial Design at the Antwerp institute for Architecture & Design where he finished his masters degree in 1994 and pursued subsequent training in New Materials and Production-techniques at the Delft University in The Netherlands.  It was in 1997 he made his first steps into the world of travel goods by joining Samsonite Europe.  Bringing in his expertise quickly resulted in new ideas and highly successful collections breaking sales-records of over 1.2 Million pieces.  In 2006 he moved to London to initiate the Samsonite global design-team and came in charge of product innovation worldwide.  It was during those days he worked on the first \"Curv\" products, but also created the basics for today’s ultra lite soft cases.\n",
      "In year 2010, he returned back to Belgium and started his own design studio,  work with a lot of top brands in the world like Eastpak (Europe), Samsonite (Europe), Ricardo (USA), Crumpler (Australia), Kipling (Europe) and many others.  (To view more of his designs,  please click www.shellsandskins.com).\n",

      "Started by Cheno Barajas, a fitness leader in The Gorge community, IBLV (I Believe) is a fitness apparel brand whose mission is to bring fitness to the underserved members of our communities and to inspire and empower individuals, through fitness. With Kickstarter, Cheno hopes to open his first IBLV Retail Store. \n",
      "IBLV is not just a fitness apparel brand, it's an idea that, if embraced, can help change someones life. When Cheno started IBLV, he wanted to create an apparel brand that was durable and attractive, but more importantly Cheno wanted to address two main issues; the lack of self confidence people experience in their fitness journey and the lack of resources undeserved members of his community experience within fitness. Through IBLV, Cheno hopes to help empower individuals to live their life fully and courageously and help the underserved members of our communities have access to fitness.  \n",
      "The Gorge is known for its outdoor sports and most retail stores in the area tailor to the outdoor enthusiast. There isn't an activewear retail store in The Gorge that tailors to general fitness enthusiast.  IBLV will help fill the gap and provide the fitness community with a wider variety of fitness apparel.\n",
      "Furthermore, IBLV will provide an environment where individuals can develop confidence and provide the social support to accompany them on their fitness journey and elevate them in their path to self-discovery.\n",
      "IBLV will donate 10% of the yearly profits to a charity to support underprivileged and underserved members of our communities, giving them access to fitness when they otherwise would not would not have access.\n",
      "IBLV will work to  acquire outdoor recreational equipment and gear that community members can rent free of cost.\n",
      "Cheno is the Founder of IBLV. A White Salmon native, Cheno grew up in a community that was financially limited. His family is from the small town of Madrid, Colima, Mexico. Madrid faces high levels of poverty and violence, which Cheno constantly had to battle with in his childhood years. \n",
      "Cheno has always been an active person. He was considered one of the top soccer athletes in The Gorge, and with the support of his family and mentors, he was able to secure an academic scholarship to Seattle University, where he walked on to their Division I Soccer program.\n",
      "After obtaining his degree in Business Management and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Cheno found himself lost. For three years, he aimlessly tried to fill the void within by indulging in unhealthy habits. He began drinking heavily and experimenting with heavy drugs. On his 24th birthday, after waking up not remembering what had happened the night before, Cheno had to make a decision, either he stayed on the path he was on which would lead to a very dark place, or he made an effort to change in hopes of reaching his true potential.  Even though he knew he wanted to change, he did not know where to begin. So he decided to change the one thing he could control, his body….and that’s when his fitness journey began.\n",
      "Cheno always lacked self-confidence. The reason why he was never truly successful in one area of his life had little to do with his abilities, but more with his lack of self-belief.  He began noticing this same lack of self-worth preventing many of his peers from reaching their true potential.  He noticed that there was a need to be inspired. In hopes of inspiring his community and helping them find purpose and fulfillment in their lives, Cheno created IBLV. It is more than an apparel brand; IBLV - I Believe - is a mentality.\n",
      "Through IBLV, Cheno wants to address the inequalities in his community and give those who come from a background similar to his the opportunity to express themselves and become the capable and impactful person they are meant to be.\n",
      "Community and family are at the core of IBLV. There is potential for IBLV to make great changes happen within communities. For this to become a reality, IBLV needs the support of the community to get off the ground. We hope that with Kickstarter, our community will give IBLV an opportunity to show the world what it is truly capable of.\n",
      "Cheno has worked with The Power Station Gym and has agreed on building out an IBLV retail space. All the money will go towards renovating the space, purchasing Inventory, and marketing.\n",
      "Cheno will work with local contractors to get the retail space established, and with a marketing director to help increase the IBLV reach.\n",
      "Through the years, IBLV has been able to establish itself because of the support from YOU!  We are truly blessed and grateful for the constant love and support we receive from you. We hope you continue to support us throughout this transition.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Brahms' works are among the most beloved in the classical music canon. Every so often, though, we hear the complaint that his music is too serious, too heavy - even stodgy. We think that this is a misperception, and that there's no better antidote than to listen to recordings by some of the musicians he trusted most. \n",
      "As we delved further into the (surprisingly intricate) world of early recordings, we found that some of the most inspiring and informative performances came from Brahms' younger female colleagues. At the turn of the century, it was still common for female musicians to withdraw from public concerts after marriage, while still continuing to play (and even perform) in private. As a result, there is a small but astonishing set of recordings from as late as the 1950s that preserves a style of playing untouched by the revolutions of the early 20th century.\n",
      "And what a style it is! We've included some examples in the reward tiers so that you can hear it for yourself. To us, the musicians in Brahms' circle sound powerfully creative and eloquent, as though they're native speakers of his musical language and are simply thinking out loud.\n",
      "We've spent the last several years working to absorb this style, which turned out to involve breaking a lot of the \"rules\" (spoken and unspoken) that we were taught as music students: how to shift, how to prepare a chord, how to play \"together\", and above all, how to keep a tempo. \n",
      "Fortunately, we're not alone on this journey of rediscovery. A new historically informed edition of the Brahms cello sonatas, which Kate co-edited with Clive Brown and Neal Peres da Costa, brings together all different kinds of information relating to Brahms' own aesthetic: recordings, memoirs, treatises, early editions, and more. There has been a huge amount of interest in the edition already, which makes us think that the time has come to put the old artistic freedoms back into circulation.\n",
      "We recorded our disc in March, with the help of a hugely inspiring and supportive team. Yi-heng played on a copy of an 1870 Streicher similar to Brahms' own, generously loaned to us by Peter Sykes and painstakingly maintained throughout the week by Dale Munschy (it turns out that Streichers are finicky beasts). \n",
      "Our engineer, Angus Lansing, plays historical instruments himself and knew just how to capture the warmth of the cello's gut strings and the soft iridescence of the Streicher. Sarah Darling, our highly gifted producer, is also a musical soulmate who knows how to draw the best music making out of us, and always managed to say exactly the right thing at the right time. We even allowed ourselves the luxury of using a second producer as a stylistic guardian: it was Andrus Madsen's job to make sure we didn't revert to modern playing styles in the frenzy of perfectionism that often overtakes recording sessions, and his enthusiasm for the risks we were taking gave us a lot of confidence.\n",
      "We'd like to invite you to join our project now as we enter the process of turning the music into a disc. Here's a breakdown of the total cost: \n",
      "• $3,000 Recording and producing\n",
      "• $2,000 Piano moving, tuning, and maintenance \n",
      "• $4,000 Editing and mastering \n",
      "• $3,000 Artwork, design, and replication of 1000 discs\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "There is a possibility that this disc will be a bit controversial. A common refrain among early recording buffs is the wistful sigh, \"You could never get away with playing like that nowadays.\" While the Brahms circle's playing style is no longer in living memory, the oldest of our teachers and colleagues remember being forbidden to take the artistic liberties necessary to play in it. The vivid yet nuanced inflections of timing (rubato) and pitch (portamento) that had a sincere, speechlike quality in the 19th century became associated in the 20th century with flippancy and egotism at best - at worst, with a brazen disrespect for the composer's work. We feel that the 21st century has no need for this prejudice, and that putting the old artistic freedoms back in circulation can give Brahms' music the freshness and vitality that it deserves. Whether we will \"get away with\" it remains to be seen.\n",

The Old English is just for the fun and benefit of the backers.3- It has been brought to my attention that there are at least 3 other movies out there named Happily Ever After...but none of them end in a question mark. Of course, Happily Ever After? is a working title, but if it gets to be too confusing, I'm sure the studio(s) who pick up the movie will come up, perhaps, with a name that they like better. No big whoop! As long as it gets picked up, I'm fine with that!!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "LOVECHILD Cake Co.  started from humble beginnings.  Previously LOVECHILD Cakes + Confections started from a hobby - rooted in tradition.  Growing up, I watched my mom and my grandmas on both sides bake countless delicious treats from scratch.  Box mixes were never an option.  So when I had kids of my own, it was important to me that I keep that scratch-made tradition alive.  I’d been making the girl’s birthday cakes for several years but they were a simple labor of love and far from professional.\n",
      "In 2020, when the world felt like it was ending, I was laid off from my job and forced to re-evaluate everything I was doing.  By August 2020, I had decided – I was going to go for it and take a chance on turning my hobby into my career.  And LOVECHILD cakes was born!  I can’t put into words how much the early support and encouragement I received meant to me.  Business took off quickly and I hit the ground running.  I spent the better part of our quarantine days (2020-2021) creating cake art for clients all over the Grand Strand. And in that year and a half, I discovered what a true passion cake artistry was for me. Day in and day out, I devoted hours to learning new techniques and trends.  I perfected my signature recipes, and stayed current on all of the up and coming cake trends.  I even took a 3 week intensive course – taught by Christina Tosi of Milkbar New York!\n",
      "As the weeks and months went on, I would purchase new tools here and there when the project required it – usually cutting into any profit I had hopes of making.  But that’s par for the course in starting a business and over time I was able to collect several items that make the job easier and make the cakes stand out from the rest.  However – the list is still long!\n",
      "September of last year, We sold our home – my OG baking headquarters -  and it’s taken a few months to truly get settled somewhere new.  But we are finally settled and I am READY to get back to work! I’ll be opening up my Calendar for booking starting JUNE 11th!\n",
      "I am starting this fundraiser to help with the upfront costs of some premium supplies and business must-haves so that I can bring you breath taking, instagrammable cakes and a more streamlined booking process.  It’s all about the customer – and I want to be able to provide the best of the best product!\n",
      "Some things your gifts will help me add to the LOVECHILD kitchen are:\n",
      "Why am I crowdsourcing funds this way? The answer is simple:  Without start-up funding, the cost of these items would be reflected the price of your cake and we can’t have that.  The success of any solid business relies on having the right tools to get the job done right.  Without them, I’d be swimming upstream, working harder - not smarter, and that’s just not sustainable.\n",
      "Who is this for?\n",
      "-Anyone who has been rooting for LOVECHILD cakes from afar.  Anyone who can’t support this small business by ordering my product, but would like to show support some other way.  Friends and family in other states – that might be you!\n",
      "-Anyone who has experienced the magic of a LOVECHILD cake and wants to see us become a mainstay in the Grand Strand’s cake community.\n",
      "-Anyone who believes in supporting local business.\n",
      "-Anyone with a little extra cash in their pocket – looking to do something good with it.\n",
      "-Anyone who wants some of the really cool rewards I’m offering!\n",
      "Did you think I was going to take your $$ without throwing a little swag your way?\n",
      "With my relaunch, will come a bit of fancy re-branding too! And I’ll be having buttery soft LOVECHILD t-shirts and fun LOVECHILD waterbottle (super durable) stickers made.  Depending on your gift, you’ll receive one of those items, a coupon towards your next cake order, or all of the above – just as a thank you from me 😊\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "This fundraiser is “all or nothing” - meaning that if I don’t reach my goal of $2500 by the end of the campaign, I don’t receive any of the pledged funds. So please consider donating - no matter how small.  And share with friends, family, and neighbors - everyone loves cake! Thank you x a million ❤️\n",

      "Hi! Thanks for stopping by! We're Stef & Amanda, and we're opening up a bakery & plant shop named Pinch in Hamilton, Ontario in late 2022.  \n",
      "You may know us from around the city, Amanda is the owner and operator of Sweet & Simple Co., a handmade confections business. She's also a founding member of The Kitchen Collective, a co-operative commercial kitchen in Hamilton, Ontario. (check out this old kickstarter video here!, its a trip). Amanda is a Pastry Chef & Professional Chocolatier, and has over 7 years experience working in a commercial kitchen and owning a successful business.\n",
      "You maybe know Stef from her One Minute Planty Chats with Coffee on Instagram. She's a plant enthusiast to the core, and studies Horticulture at the University of Guelph. If you like talking about dirt or worms, she's 100% there for it. Stef has worked in retail and management environments for most of her career, and has spent the last 8 years building up an extensive indoor plant collection.  She plans to pursue her Master Gardener's accreditation so she can continue to educate our customers on how to care for their investments.\n",
      "Our brick & mortar location will be located at 675 Main Street East in Hamilton, Ontario.  Hamilton is located on the traditional territories of the Mississaugas and Haudenosaunee. This land is protected by the Dish with One Spoon wampum belt covenant.  We acknowledge our presence as settlers on this land, and will continue to work towards being stewards of this land, and good neighbours to local Indigenous communities. \n",
      "Our shop was home to the former Jet Diner, which closed after a fire in 2017. We are excited to breathe new life into this space, but it does require some serious TLC before we can open our doors to you. \n",
      "Meeting the need for a space for folks to gather, graze and grow, Pinch will combine a bakery, café and plant store all in one.  Our shop will feature daily baked goods, a full service café and espresso bar, and endless lush tropical plants for you to both take home, and enjoy while you're in the space. We will feature cozy nooks around the shop for comfortable seating in a luscious atmosphere, providing an escape on those days that you just need to look at something green. \n",
      "We plan to prioritize sustainability, accessibility and community in our design to include things such as a wheelchair-accessible entrance, gender neutral washroom access, a guaranteed nut-free kitchen, environmentally sustainable packaging options and community engagement with not-for-profits in our neighbourhood and city.\n",
      "Accessibility is our main focus, and we plan to use funds raised during this Kickstarter to transition two small bathrooms into one larger, accessible washroom, along with some other more minor changes to the shop. These renovations require permits with the City of Hamilton, demolition of walls, new fixtures and other smaller upgrades. By funding this Kickstarter, you can help us bring our vision to life. \n",
      "We've lined up some pretty great rewards for this Kickstarter, you can find some more details below!\n",
      "Most of our rewards are self explanatory, but we wanted to give you the breakdown on a few things you probably have questions about!\n",
      "Here's a sample of some of the seedlings included in our seedling pack, both the Bright Colours and Warm Neutrals. Keep in mind, these photos are 1) not ours and 2) just for vibes, because right now, AS WE SPEAK, these sweeties are popping their little heads out of the soil. All seedling packs will be a mix of  at least 8 different annual varieties, including favourites like cosmos, stock, asters, sunflowers, zinnias, strawflowers, black eyed susans, calendulas, dahlias, scabiosas, flowering tobacco, maybe some grasses - the point is, we're growing a LOT of flowers. But each pack will be assembled with design, ease and style in mind, so you know you're getting a mix of some gorgeous colour to fill your garden with!\n",
      "Please note, most seedlings are partial to full sun with well-draining soil. All are suitable for Hamilton's planting zone 6b, and will be available once they are hardened off and ready to be planted outdoors. All will come with planting instructions and lot of good faith. Seedlings will also be available for a later date for individual purchase, once we have made sure we are offering our backers the cream of the crop (hehe).\n",
      "Adding the consult too? Please note, we do not have every answer and might not be able to solve every problem, but we are committing to working it out with you, and being present for the follow up. We can grow together, ya know? Sometimes we just need a bud to hype us up, and we got you.\n",
      "Our Perfect Cookies, Custom Cakes & Treat of the Month Club feature bakery items made in a commercial, public health inspected kitchen.  Since Sweet & Simple Co. has been nut free for the last 4 years, we plan to keep that moving forward with Pinch.\n",
      "If you have any concerns regarding allergies, please contact us at info@shopatpinch.com.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We recognize that there are many risks and challenges associated with starting a business at any time, let alone during a pandemic. \n",
      "Since our renovations rely on permits from the City of Hamilton, we have no control over the timeline of our project completion. Once approved, we have our contractors in place to begin working on the space as soon as possible.\n",
      "We may also face delays sourcing materials and fixtures for the shop, and plan to allow several months of lead time.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Did you ever have one of those days?\n",
      "It was early October and the TV and internet were covered with reports that Hurricane Matthew had become a Category 4 and was most likely headed our way!  You spend your day removing possible projectiles from your yard, securing what you can, boarding up your shed, installing your hurricane shutters, and stocking up on three days of supplies, but you never know if it's enough for \"this\" storm.\n",
      "Then Matty comes for a visit ... Yeah ... Hurricane Matthew.  \n",
      "Family members were evacuated last minute, everyone has taken refuge in my home. They bring their own supplies and everything seems fine.  The rain and sustained winds are no match for your level of preparedness. \n",
      "Suddenly the winds begin to gust, taking a section of your soffit, then another and another, the trim is flapping in the wind, and then it's gone.  Sounds like a piece of siding is pulling free on the other side of the house as you watch your neighbor's tree fall in a slow motion destroying their fence. Trees tops are slapping the sidewalk in the front yard, while the smaller trees in back are already laying down or just missing.  You hear someone in the house say \"Your gazebo just collapsed\", as you watch a couple of your hurricane shutters pull free from your home.  \n",
      "The next few hours are scary for your guest, but truly terrifying for you, because you took these people in and now you fear for their safety as well as your own. Everyone watches as your fence is torn apart ... posts break like twigs, sections pull up into the air to smash down to the ground.  The fence sections that only lean get really scary as the slats break off and fly across your yard.  Some of the newly created debris takes flight with the next series of wind gusts and is soon dancing it's way across your roof (that damage makes itself known a little later as the water stains start appearing on your ceilings).\n",
      "What do you do now?  What can you do until the storm is over?\n",
      "For a moment, the storm eases back, and as the rain stops the sun appears like nothing ever happened.  I looked through what still stood of my broken fence, I could see a newly formed lake in my neighbors backyard between the missing slats.  It grew dark again as the winds picked up speed, his lake appeared to have a current, then a tide, and finally it had waves.  My own dark ocean scene happening through the slats of my fence.\n",
      "This was my inspiration.  I will commemorate the death of my beloved fence (my means of separating my own tropical sanctuary from the outside world) by taking its remains and painting a beach scene, one vaguely similar to that which I saw Through the Fence. Broken slats are removed and here you see my first attempt. With more fence everywhere, I continued to paint away!\n",
      "\"Hurricane Matthew - The Through The Fence Series\" is my attempt to bring light to the darkness of all the damage, to put a positive spin on what was, and still is, a costly situation.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Hi!  I'm Mark Pari.  Just an average homeowner hit hard by Hurricane Matthew.  I'm the type of person who appreciates the beauty of my surroundings, tries to protect the environment, and makes a conscious effort to recycle, reuse, or repurpose where I can.\n",
      " \n",
      "This project is my way of creating some good from the bad resulting from Matthew.  So much debris was hauled out to the road to be picked up by local trash services who in turn redistribute into our landfills.  I know, there's not a lot that could be done with the damaged roofing and siding, but seeing those piles of broken fence gave me an idea.  \n",
      " \n",
      "My wife and I spent many years building ourselves a little tropical oasis here, safely protected by our fence.  It was devasting to watch the fence and much of what it protected destroyed in just one storm.\n",
      "I wanted to return some beauty to Florida, to show what this State has to offer, so I chose to paint Beach Scenes.\n",

With that being said, this Kickstarter campaign will be the jumping off point to take RISE -Art and Design- from a self owned artist proprietorship, to a creative multi-medium provider. \n",

But it doesn’t take itself too seriously, relying a lot on grim, dry humour and sarcastic, almost self-aware characters. \n",
      "Charity Steele, a determined and observant noblewoman and lead singer of the Royal Amphitheatre, is intended to be one of the main protagonists of the story, as she struggles to survive in the ensuing conflict. There are many questions- where did this violent undead army come from? Who started it? And why?\n",
      "\n",
      "I intend the book to be 80-100k words, with an ensemble cast and multiple PoV characters interwoven into the main conflict with the rotting army.\n",
      "Right now, Charity is the only protagonist set in stone, and I am still working out the specifics of the others; one possible addition to the main cast is a very psychotic/obsessive widow who is obsessed with reviving her late husband, who unbeknownst to her had a young secret lover. \n",
      "For those that chose the $60 perk (limit of 5 people) you can help me work out what kind of characters you want to see featured (either as a PoV, or in the supporting cast). You can be as specific as gender, name, occupation and backstory, etc., or you can just give me vague stimuli. I do already have an idea where the story will be heading, but I will rework the main plot so that these fan-created characters will be critical factors in the narrative. \n",

      "I'm Nick Photinos, founding cellist of Eighth Blackbird, and I'm raising funds to finish my first solo recording: Petits Artéfacts.\n",
      "The idea for this recording began to take shape soon after a concert at the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival, an annual festival of new chamber music held every year in North Adams, MA and run by Bang on a Can where I have taught for a number of years. In 2015, I premiered a work by bassist Florent Ghys, whose own recent and amazing Télévision inspired me to reach out to him. The piece he wrote for me: Petits Artéfacts, for cello, electronics and video, got me thinking about all the great yet small (sub 10-minutes) pieces I've performed over the years, most of which had never been recorded. These are works by some of the most acclaimed names in new music--David Lang, Andrew Norman, Bryce Dessner, David T. Little--but also a newer generation of groundbreaking composers like Angélica Negrón, Florent Ghys, Molly Joyce, and Pascal Le Boeuf, who are quickly gaining notoriety for themselves. The music runs the gamut from quirky and hilarious to profound and ethereal, and is brought to life with the help of two of my favorite collaborators, pianist Vicki Ray and percussionist Doug Perkins. Doug is also serving as Producer on this effort, with Todd Reynolds as co-producer.\n",
      "Here's the full recording lineup:\n",
      "To be clear about why I'm raising funds: I have already recorded the works for the album, which has prompted some to ask whether I am raising funds to reimburse myself, or even to pay myself. Far from it. As many of you know, there are considerable costs beyond studio time and editing, and include mixing, mastering, PR costs, photography, album art, and physical album production, to name a few. New Amsterdam has agreed to pick up the album, with a release scheduled for the Fall of 2017, but their involvement and amazing help, including PR, requires money. It is to help cover these costs that I am launching this campaign, and any money raised above the target amount will increase the amount given to individuals that have largely given their time pro-bono to this recording. \n",
      "This is an exciting, gripping album with music that deserves to be heard, and I'm deeply committed to bring it to life. Thank you for considering to be a part of its creation!\n",

      "While I've released many records as a founding member of Eighth Blackbird, this is the first time I've done everything myself, and so there are some inherent risks in that.

      "The story so far….\n",
      "In early 2013 I founded Resonance in order to make classical music accessible and fun for everyone.  Most people are amazed by how much they feel connected to the music which we present.  Equally, our drinks parties offer opportunities to ‘meet the artists’ as well as to network and make new friends. \n",
      " \n",
      "Great classical music is often labelled as “elitist”, and unfortunately ticket prices to top-notch arts events are often absurdly high.  It has always been my ambition to offer amazing music at an affordable price to all, and Resonance does exactly this, with concert tickets costing just $20 and $25. \n",
      "Since March 2013, Resonance has successfully presented 83 individual concert performances, based on 41 creative and interesting programmes.\n",
      "At Resonance we also believe that great music and socialising go hand-in-hand.  We offer complimentary drinks parties after our concerts, and these bring about new friendships and networking opportunities.\n",
      " \n",
      "As the costs of all overheads continue to rise, it has been difficult to keep Resonance going strong and to keep our ticket prices where they stand, as the best-value concert tickets in Australia.  We also insist on remunerating our wonderful artists at the levels which their years of training and world-class standards deserve.\n",
      "We really hope that you can help us in continuing to enrich the Australian arts community.  Resonance is an organisation about music and friendship, and we welcome you to join us for both.\n",
      "The future…..\n",
      "Aside from supporting our regular series of concerts in Sydney and Melbourne, your pledge will also help us achieve two other important goals:\n",
      " We are committed to providing professional performance opportunities for young people and music students.  Exciting projects in both Sydney and Melbourne in 2017 will see some of the most talented young musicians in Australia sharing their hard work with audiences.\n",
      "We want to reach out to Australian communities well beyond metropolitan areas.  Your pledge will assist us to begin some regional touring of Australia, bringing our amazing concerts to communities which lack arts opportunities.\n",
      "Our fundraising target…..\n",
      "Our target here represents approximately 50% of our annual costs.  With your help, we can partially fund some of our most basic and necessary costs such as:\n",
      "Professional, established artists\n",
      "Piano tuning fees\n",
      "Wine and soft drinks\n",
      "Marketing and insurance\n",
      "The rewards…..\n",
      "Should our campaign be successful, the greatest and most obvious reward is that we will continue to hold beautiful events and include the wider community.  Some of the reward tiers feature concert tickets and further interaction with Resonance, and we truly hope that you will take advantage of these and become our new partners.\n",
      "Finally…..\n",
      "Recent Australian governments have infamously slashed budgets for the arts, painting a rather grim future for this invaluable and most human of sectors.  Resonance is a musically-professional organisation with a community-driven heart, and offers a very honest approach to beautiful cultural and social events.  Please help us to keep this wonderful series alive.  \n",

      "We're hoping to complete this campaign and raise our target during just the month of March, when we celebrate our fourth birthday.  This will mean a campaign period of only 15 days.  However, we will be working consistently during this time to attract pledges from around Australia.\n",

      "This funding will allow me to create visionary new paintings, which will explore and challenge the paradigm of the feminine, through my own perspective and story, examining hopes, fears and fantasies. These pieces will push the concepts of portraiture and figurative painting formalities, through the experimentation of painting materials, structure and technique. (Art).\n",

I will finally allow myself to examine the coercive control I was unwittingly subject to, a subject which has orbited my art but I have never felt strong enough to explore. \n",
      "Having this this project funding will give me the freedom to create authentic work, be be free to try new mediums, new technique, new surfaces and will allow happy accidents to happen, to really explore the subject of my story, I story which will resonate with people who view my work. Art is after all and expression of emotion, of feeling, and this project will allow me to take a further step in my artistic career. \n",
      "However without it I won't be able to really push and experiment with the work, I will feel more restrained and need to be precious about each piece I make. \n",
      " The exhibition will open in January 2017, at The Python Gallery - giving me 3 months to create the work for this. Part of this exhibition will then be exhibited in London at The Brick Lane gallery.  \n",
      "Being invited to exhibit in a London Gallery is a hugely exciting achievement for me, and this could open up so many doors and really give me the break I need to get my work seen by other galleries and collectors. Unfortunately if the Kickstarter project isn’t successful I wouldn’t be able to achieve this at this time. \n",
      "To create enough new paintings to exhibit at Python, and Brick Lane I need to produce around 25 pieces.\n",

I have a distinctive style, my work has been said to be instantly recognisable, even when exploring new techniques and materials. I tend to use an idiosyncratic colour pallet of blues, turquoises and violet hues, mixed with monochrome styles. I aim to create exciting unconventional pieces which are authentic and resonate with the viewer. \n",

And, as all that is happening every day you are enjoying looking at and living with the most unique purchase you will ever make - unless you get the collecting bug.\n",

      "CHAPTER 1\n",
      "Have you ever stood before a door and been faced with the proverbial “lady or the tiger” moment? There are rare occasions when it might actually be both. On a morning where I’d just needed to grab a change of clothes that’s what I was trying to figure out. I pressed my hand against the door of my apartment, like you would to see if it was hot during a fire, except that it wasn’t a fire on the other side of the door that I was worried about. It was the person standing in front of my apartment door that was weirding me out. She was someone familiar, but currently less so, which was scary as hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Events over the past several weeks had caused my life to tilt sideways. Not that my typical week or month was normal anyway. Having recently saved most of the student population in my high school from a slaughter you’d think that I would be a celebrated hero and that my biggest challenge would be fending off all of the people lining up to thank me. \n",
      "No, and no, and definitely not today, and really not now. \n",
      "Because of the way I lived, I needed privacy. So, no hero parades for me, thank you. \n",
      "My best friend in the world moved away two weeks ago, and my mentor, the closest thing that I have to family in Seattle, had been taken away from me too. A good friend that I had trusted with some of my most precious secrets had turned into a psychopath, or had always been one and I’d been too stupid to notice. Oh, and that former friend? He had promised to hurt people close to me if I ratted him out for the role he had played in the aforementioned attempted mass murder. Add to all of that, a man I hadn’t known a month ago, and now knowing him I wish I still didn’t, currently has tremendous influence over my life and directs virtually all of my activity during my waking hours unless I avoid him. \n",
      "So, now this. \n",
      "“Benny, I know you’re in there. Open the door.” came the voice again. \n",
      "When I’d come back to my apartment to pick up some clothes I hadn’t been prepared for the wave of emotions that had washed over me. Memories had rushed in unbidden and I’d immediately regretted coming back. I had also been totally unprepared for the visitor calling to me from the hallway. I let my forehead rest against the door and closed my eyes tightly, hoping that she would just go away. She’d been missing for almost a month and we had all resigned ourselves to the fact that she probably wasn’t ever going to be found. But there she was, standing at my door asking to be let in, and I couldn’t bring myself to open the door.\n",
      "Justine. \n",
      "Why was I reluctant to open the door? I mean, I’d kissed this girl twice, taken her to a dance, had lunch with her dozens of times and…had started to think, feel, that maybe our casual flirting and on again off again friendship was something more, a lot more. Then why hadn’t I flung the door open and thrown my arms around her? \n",
      "Because the girl standing in the hallway that I could see through the peephole didn’t look like the friend I thought I had lost. \n",
      "She looked…wrong. And she’d shown up here unannounced, unexpected and…what? Unwanted? I couldn’t get a handle on my feelings. All I knew for sure was that her showing up out of the blue was creeping me out and the way she looked wasn’t helping to calm my nerves. \n",
      "Justine Winter had been an academic All-American. The prototypical sweet-girl-next-door. She had worn her blond hair long, usually with a simple ribbon holding it back from her face. She had worn long, modest dresses or jeans, little makeup and a shy smile that flickered around her lips and eyes. I mean seriously, she was like right out of a Disney movie. \n",
      "The young woman I could see through the fish-eye lens was obviously Justine, but not the way she had always looked as long as I had known her. This version didn’t have the pink-cheeked healthy glow I remembered. This version was pale and edgy. Her hair had been cut so short that if her features hadn’t been so feminine it would have been possible at first glance to mistake her for a boy, and it wasn’t blond anymore. It was white. Her clothes were tight-fitting and revealing in a way that shouted ‘look at me’. Hip-hugger jeans that looked like they had been spray painted on and a low cut dark shirt that revealed a lot of skin, and a lot of curves. Something the old Justine would have never considered wearing.\n",
      "The left side of her face was oddly shiny. The skin stretched tight and devoid of any blemishes or wrinkles, like it had been scrubbed with a stiff brush to the point of removing a layer of skin. The other side of her face was covered in makeup and blush. \n",
      "As I watched her, she raised a hand to her lips and brushed the tips of her fingers across them. Her nails were lacquered with a dark red polish that matched the lipstick she wore. Both stood out in harsh contrast to her chalky skin.\n",
      "But the most disturbing thing about her appearance was her eyes. They had always been a golden brown. Unremarkable, but soft and wide and happy. The pair of eyes trying to peer through the lens were wary, hooded and a startling shade of purple. They seemed to glow in the dimly lit hallway. And that, more than anything else, is why I didn’t want to open the door. \n",
      "Those eyes and their lavender color were too similar to a pair owned by someone who had tried to kill me. \n",
      "Twice. \n",
      "“I heard that you’re a hero. Pretty scary. Don’t you want to talk about it?” \n",
      "\n",
      "She paused, waiting for an answer I wasn’t going to give her. \n",
      "“I can wait out here all day. I’ve gotten real good at waiting. I thought you might be happy to see me, but maybe I was wrong.” She said. \n",
      "\n",
      "I held my breath. \n",
      "“You can’t avoid me forever, Benny. I’ll catch up to you eventually.” She paused, looked down and then her head snapped up, her eyes slitted so that the purple color was hard to see. \n",
      "“We have things to talk about.” \n",
      "She moved away from the viewable range of the peephole so quickly that it was almost as though she’d disappeared. Pressing my ear to the door I strained to hear her footsteps on the stairs. The only sound I could pick up was the quiet ticking of my refrigerator in the kitchen behind me.\n",
      "Turning, with my back to the door, I leaned against it and slowly slid down to a sitting position. Resting my head on my knees I let out a long shuddering breath. \n",
      "In the back of my mind I heard a whisper from the past…\n",
      "‘People change Benny, not always in the way we would hope’ \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",

      "It's happening! After almost four years of schlepping our freezer to pop ups all around Richmond and hand packing hundreds (thousands?) of pints for delivery to get y'all through the pandemic...WE ARE OPENING OUR PARLOR!\n",
      "For the uninitiated, we are Spotty Dog Ice Cream Co., a two person dream team who have spent the last few years side hustling an ice cream pop up based in the East End of Richmond. We craft New England style ice cream, an ultra-rich, ultra-creamy ice cream with a bit of bite, inspired by the good stuff we grew up eating up north. \n",
      "Whether you've been with us since our free sample delivery days in 2017, used to shoot the shit with us at our Union Market pop ups, relied on us to get you through 2020 with weekly porch delivery, or are brand new to us and curious to try our scoops...to us, you're a SpottyHead and we need your help now more than ever!\n",
      "Perfectly situated on Jefferson Avenue, tucked in alongside our favorite East End shops--Dear Neighbor, Sub Rosa Bakery, The Roosevelt, North End Juice Co., Pizza Bones, and Union Market, to name a few--our parlor will serve New England style ice cream from our 1,366 square foot space. Half of our parlor will be dedicated to retail space, featuring bar seating to watch our scoopers craft the perfect cone, as well as booths to cozy up with your buds over a scoop or two. We will also have a walkup window, so you can order your treats ahead of time, grab, and go.  \n",
      "Our space will be a modern take on the classic parlor, providing the perfect spot for our neighbors to gather with family and friends for an afternoon treat on a hot day, to flirt on a date over a shared sundae, or to grab a few hand packed pints to go for your party or a night on the couch. \n",
      "In Fall 2017, Spotty Dog was born from delivering free ice cream samples to our neighbors in the East End. Slowly but surely, word spread throughout the neighborhood, and by Spring 2018, Spotty Dog was selling scoops at pop ups throughout Richmond. When March 2020 hit, we quickly pivoted to a pint delivery model, to ensure all the SpottyHeads out there could keep their freezers stocked. From 2017 on, our goal has remained the same -- to bring a classic ice cream parlor to the East End, sharing treats with our neighbors (just like we did back in the day). \n",
      "Your Kickstarter pledges will help us open our doors spring of 2022! So far, Spotty Dog has been fully self funded and we've relied mostly on our scrappy 'tude to make our pop-up model work. With your help, your pledges will go towards vital parlor equipment, like our dipping cabinet, where we'll scoop all of your favorite flavors, and our oven, where we will bake all of our house mix-in's. And truly... every single dollar helps! To sweeten the deal, we have some rad gear to get you excited for our opening day (like totes, lighters, tees, mugs, the works). \n",
      "While y'all anxiously await our grand opening, you can continue to support Spotty Dog (and keep your freezers stocked) by ordering from our weekly pint drop. Every Tuesday at 6pm, we release a fresh batch of pints available for delivery to all City of Richmond addresses (or Friday evening pick ups from our Church Hill test kitchen). For more info, make sure you're following us on Insta at @spottydogrva. Pints can be purchased through our site: www.spottydogicecream.com :)\n",

      "Small, independent businesses are inherently risky, and we know that. Since our inception in 2017, we've taken each step of our growth journey with caution (and excitement). This big step--opening our parlor--is no different! But our community has been behind us each step of the way and supported us during all of our challenging times, reminding us exactly WHY we do what we do. We are bringing a proper ice cream parlor to the East End because we love making ice cream and seeing your smiles when we hand over your scoop, but even more than that, we want to support a community that has been so supportive of us.\n",

      "Hello Cookie Lovers! My name is Heidi, I am the owner of Maui Cookie Lab. We offer \"fresh-from-the-oven\" Classic Cookies and sweets, all hand-crafted from scratch daily here on Maui.  Maui Cookie Lab was officially launched in late January 2020 as a side project to what was my main cookie brand: Maui Sweet Cakes, which were packaged shortbread cookies. When COVID came to town in March of 2020, Maui Sweet Cakes was forced to close, as all of our hotel and retail accounts were shuttered. \n",
      "With the effects of the shutdown here on Maui, I was worried about how I'd continue my business and be able to provide work for my team. Since Maui Cookie Lab had just launched and was a Mobile Cookie Bar, we were deemed \"essential\", and allowed to operate during the shutdown. \n",
      "With growing popularity of our \"cookie pivot\", we are in desperate need of a larger commercial kitchen. We are bursting at the seams in our current 400 square foot kitchen, and we now have the opportunity to move to a larger kitchen facility which will enable us to expand our production,  and also have space for a retail Cookie Bar & Sweet Shop to serve even more of our Cookie Loving community.\n",
      "We are about to start construction, but are in desperate need of more funds to enable us to complete the project. Costs are higher than planned and YOU can help us get to the finish line! \n",
      "Funds raised here are just a portion of what's needed to close the financial gap we face, as costs of construction,  equipment and supplies have all  risen quite a bit. \n",
      "My MCL team and I are beyond excited to have the opportunity to continue this pivot with more room to create our delicious Classic Cookies and new recipes too!\n",

      "Meet Thomas! Like you, he was fed up with the endless texting, ghosting and fake accounts on dating apps. A friend told him about Greenlight Accessories and things got instantly better. I bet you and he have a lot in common. . .\n",
      "A message from our founder: \n",
      "Hi, I’m Adrian, the creator of Greenlight Accessories.\n",
      "They say “necessity is the mother of invention” and this idea is no different.\n",
      "It started about a year ago when after 15+ years I reentered the dating scene. The more I did it, the more I hated it and after talking to others I wasn’t alone. Everyone seemed to feel the same way, dependent on digital romance as a necessary evil to find love, but miserable in the process.\n",
      "That’s when the idea hit me, how do we ditch the dating apps and meet face-to-face again? Enter a Brazilian steak house – sitting down you receive a card, green on one side and red on the other. Clear signals between the patrons and the servers – aha people like clear signals – and Greenlight Accessories was born.\n",
      "It was then that I set upon a quest to find the easiest, cheapest, most adoptable way people could send signals of approachability, and make the color green the internationally recognized color of “single and ready to mingle.”\n",
      "Ultimately, this idea is only as good as those who support it. As I said in the video, I’ve kept prices as low as possible to encourage bulk purchases. I hope similar green products become widely available online and at retail stores to enable the movement to spread quickly.\n",
      "I truly thank you for your support and look forward to hearing \"happily ever after\" stories that all started with a green wristband.\n",
      "Adrian\n",
      "One of the best things about this simple, low-tech idea is how easy it is to use it. When you want to be approachable, turn it to green. When you aren't in the mood, turn it to the design and it looks like any other bracelet. \n",
      "Finding it hard to believe so many people hate online dating? Check out Google's most requested search results when you type: \"Why Online Dating...\" \n",
      "OK, so technically I made up Online Dating Syndrome (ODS) but I'm pretty surprised it doesn't already exist. Certainly not taking anything away from those suffering with real illnesses and syndromes, but numerous studies document the mental health concerns caused by digital dating, specifically swiping.  \n",
      "Time to deep-dive into the rewards you can receive when you back different levels. Keep in mind the pricing structure is such that the per piece price drops with higher quantity orders. And your biggest reward. . . . we'll that's obviously meeting new people and getting off the dating apps for good!\n",
      " Throw a Greenlight Party - -  just remember to invite me :) \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "There is always a risk that people say “nah, I love the fake, shallow environment of online dating sooooo much I plan on swiping forever” and we fail to reach enough backers to meet our goal and deliver the wristbands. Aside from that, it’s not like we’re building a rocket propulsion system. We’re confident in our ability to produce the wristbands and have taken all necessary measures to create a realistic timeline. As long as the dating app CEO’s don’t form a secret cartel and hire mercenaries to stomp-out the “Greenlight Movement” then the risk of complications in the project are pretty low. We have a manufacturer ready to ship, a warehouse ready to pick & pack and just need your help to build initial inventory. If for whatever reason we don’t reach the goal, we appreciate those of you who supported the cause and wish everyone a life of health, happiness and quality time with a true love.\n",

The mission of Angel Numbers Jewelry is to bring awareness of spirituality and inspiration into the world! The vision of Angel Numbers Jewelry is to be the backbone of a platform called Light Workers Unite! On this platform, members will have access to funds that aid in their individual missions to better humanity.  My goal on Kickstarter is to get the help of the public to reclaim my brand. This brand of jewelry is not meant to be just a fashion trend.  Angel Numbers Jewelry has a necessary and worthy cause behind it. We are a community of lightworkers. Within this community, we democratize funding to aid in each other's missions. We are unified to help each other! We will donate to one another through the use of mobile payment services we already have access to. This monetary stream will instantly fund projects that have the intention of bringing more love and light into the world!  \n",
      "Have you ever come across repeating numbers, multiple times a day and throughout the week? 11:11 being the most urgent sequence of them all. When you see 11:11 the universe is trying to get your attention on a personal significant matter, or you may be beginning your spiritual journey. According to numerology and popular opinion, these repetitious numbers are signs from your Angels, encouraging you that you are on the right path and everything is going to be okay!\n",
      "AN INTRODUCTION TO THE NUMBER SEQUENCES: \n",
      "THE COMPANY:\n",
      "Angel Numbers Jewelry was founded in 2020 and incorporated as a Limited Liability Corporation within the state of Delaware. It was founded by Deirdre Graham who owns 100% of the business and also possesses intellectual property rights over the name Angel Numbers Jewelry, in reference to necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets, body chains and anklets. This business is 100% debt free and committed to reinvesting it's sales back into the goodness of humanity.\n",
      "MY FIRST DESIGNS:\n",
      "My previous market designs were sleek yet basic, however the ads I ran on social media sites opened the market place up... Yes, I thought it was a good idea too! The blessings behind intellectual property theft is PROOF OF CONCEPT! Seeing the amount of competition in the market place made me realize... I have to bring brand worthy creativity into my designs. Currently in production is an Urban Line, styled with wings made of detailed antiquated silver.  A Classy Line, styled with zircon accents, and the higher end lines are made with exclusive gems. For proprietary reasons, I won't show them here until I launch the line in July, but trust me when I tell you they are beautiful and unisex! These lines will be offered online and retail, providing multiple streams of income to sustain our charity platform, Lightworkers Unite!\n",
      "THE PLATFORM BEHIND THE BRAND:\n",
      "Why Angel Numbers Jewelry the brand? When I thought of getting people involved in this positive movement, the first idea that came to mind was community. This is the community that lightworkers, chosen ones, star seeds, helpers of humanity... whatever you want to call us, have been dreaming about! The Light Workers Unite platform will be hosted on Discord. Customer's will gain access to this members only community through a QR code inserted into the package label. In this community we follow the basics of crowdfunding. A large amount of people donating small amounts of money. Light workers have a lot of great ideas that can help better the world. This platform will help in the beginning phase of those individual missions. A member will post their cash handle and every member will rally behind their cause. Angel Numbers Jewelry will match all donations with a $500.00 maximum.\n",
      "HOW YOUR FUNDS WILL BE UTILIZED:\n",
      "$3750.00 - A line of brand worthy designed necklaces: 1800 pieces of the 'Basic Line' in gold and silver. 400 pieces of the 'Urban Line' in gold and silver. 600 pieces of the 'Classy Line' in gold and silver. \n",
      "$2000.00 - 2 months of Brand Ambassador Services / Marketing\n",
      "$8100.00 -  6 months of Brand Protection from the best in the industry\n",
      "$2000.00 - Business Website\n",

      "$2000.00 - Unforeseen Cost \n",
      "This investment is a catalyst for getting this brand off of the ground and into major retail markets!\n",
      "Thank you for your time and donations. I believe in this brand because, not only are we spreading positivity through jewelry, we are standing behind it with a platform that actually gives back. This brand is going to do great things and help a lot of people! The power of good needs a broader presence in this world! I'm always looking for great like minded people to work with. If you can't donate please just share! The official Angel Numbers Jewelry line will launch July 4th. Thank you Kickstarter and may us Lightworkers Unite! \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I am confident the Angel Numbers Jewelry brand will be a success with minimal risk.

Thank you so much to all of the backers that have made this possible!  I have set a new \"stretch\" goal at 16,000€.  The additional funds will be used to do outreach and PR work in order to build awareness and community around The Wild Song and its ideals.\n",

      "The Wild Song is an album that will alternate between Benjamin Britten’s beloved folksong arrangements, poetry by W.B. Yeats recited by the great Shakespearean actor Simon Russell Beale, and new electronic music by the Oscar-winning film composer, Mychael Danna. \n",
      "This will be the first album ever to combine spoken poetry with classical and new electronic music.  It is also the first album to unite artists from very different artistic backgrounds in one recording.\n",
      "The brilliant pianist Anna Tilbrook and I recorded the folksongs at the Britten Studio in Snape, England, this past July.  Snape was home to Benjamin Britten, the greatest British composer of the 20th century, for most of his life.  Britten had a very strong connection to the land in Snape and you can hear and feel his connection to the Earth in his songs. \n",
      " One of Britten’s folksongs is about a “wild song,” and that’s where the title of the album comes from. It’s the song sung by Nature.  It’s everywhere, if we listen—in the sound of the wind, the waves, our hearts.  It’s the “wild song” within us and around us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The folksongs remind us that we are part of something bigger and more beautiful than we can see, and that each of us has a duty to cultivate a physical and spiritual connection with this Earth and leave it more beautiful than we found it.\n",
      "We are now in the editing stage and I need your help to finish the album.  I won’t be able to finish it without you! The cost of producing an album like this is enormous.  In fact, the total budget for the project is close to 25,000€. The artist fees and production costs, including studio rental and the recording fees have already been covered. Yet many more post production costs remain, including: mastering, graphic art, design, photography, the actual printing of the CDs and USB keys, and the rights to Britten’s music.  Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing venture, which means that if I don’t reach the target sum, I won’t have the funds to produce the album.  Your credit card is only debited for the amount you pledge if the target sum is reached.\n",

      " Britten was very fond of Yeats’ poetry.  So much so, in fact, that he composed an arrangement to one of Yeats’ poems.  That poem was based on the lyrics of an old Irish folk tune.  Perhaps you know it?  It’s one of Britten’s most famous folksong arrangements.  It’s called “The Salley Gardens.” (It will be included on the album.)\n",
      "As I was studying the lyrics to Britten’s folksongs, I realized that the language used in all of his settings was very much like the language in “The Salley Gardens.”  That gave me the idea that it would be lovely to hear some of Yeats’ poetry recited before and after the folksongs.  I looked for poems that had the same themes as Britten’s songs and I paired them together.\n",
      "Well before I met Simon, I had written to Mychael Danna to ask him if he would be willing to compose for the project—and to my absolute delight, he agreed.  Mychael is a film composer (as was Benjamin Britten at the beginning of his career) and he is amazingly gifted for adding emotional content to the spoken word. That’s why I wanted him to compose music that would bring out Yeats’ poetry and weave a musical continuity throughout the album.  \n",

      "Mychael Danna, composer   www.mychaeldanna.com\n",
      "Mychael Danna is an Academy Award winning film composer recognized for his evocative blending of non-western traditions with orchestral and electronic music.  He composed the transculturally inspired 2013 Oscar and Golden Globe-winning score for Ang Lee’s Life of Pi, as well as many award-winning scores for his longtime collaborator, Atom Egoyan.  Danna has composed for all of Egoyan’s films since 1987’s Family Viewing, winning the Genie for their films Exotica, Felicia’s Journey, Ararat and The Sweet Hereafter.  Other noted credits include Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated films such as Moneyball, Capote, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Monsoon Wedding, Shattered Glass, Little Miss Sunshine, (500) Days of Summer, Surf’s Up, Water, Antwone Fisher, Being Julia and Girl, Interrupted. “The most gratifying filmmaking experiences are ones that take effort to unpeel the layers surrounding the heart of the story and to find the best musical expression of that heart,” says Danna.  “Those are always the film scores I am most proud of.”\n",

      "Le titre de l’album vient d’une des folksongs qui évoque une « Wild Song » : une mélodie sauvage. C’est la mélodie chantée par la Nature. Si nous écoutons, elle est partout, dans le son du vent, les vagues, nos cœurs.  C’est la mélodie sauvage qui résonne en nous et autour de nous.\n",

      "Scientific events, metaphysical and espionage are the backdrop to a revolutionary technological breakthrough in the global telecommunications sector accomplished by the protagonist, the 35 year-old Eva Castiglioni, a brilliant researcher who works at ISPRA laboratories. Working with her are Sergio and Sara two young and trusted assistants and her former university professor, Marco Vani. Once the significance of this discovery is understood, the secret service and military intelligence start to take action in order to take possession of this device that works through the physical phenomenon of quantum entanglement and therefore, does not need any cable transmission or radio waves. Eva and her friends are threatened, but don’t give in to pressure and continue their hectic work. The reaction of the powers that be was immediate: the four researchers are kidnapped, but they manage to escape in an incredible way. Just when they think they have been defeated, they realize that the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, apparently located just inside the device, has in fact already correlated with the pineal gland of Eva (the famous \"third eye\" of the human mind) and this will lead them to achieve the ultimate goal: to save the world from self-destruction. \n",

He dreams of winning the Nobel Prize for Physics.   \n",

      "\"Pieces\" has been a project 2 years in the making. From the premier date of Alan Theisen's \"Arcanum\", I knew I wanted to record an album of all unaccompanied music. There were many factors that went into making this recording, the most important being timing. For the past year I've been stationed with the 8th Army Band in Seoul, S. Korea, all the while trying to make this recording in an inexpensive way. After countless missteps, it became clear the only way to have this recording come out how I wanted was to hire the right professionals with the years of experience necessary to do it right. The perfect opportunity came to record while I would be between Army Band stations Korea and Germany, home for a month-long tour of the Southeast followed by recording.\n",
      "That's where Tommy Joe Anderson of ACA records and Spivey Hall come in. ACA has recorded a number of well known artists over its 30+ year history, including many recordings of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Spivey Hall is rated as one of the best halls for chamber music and recording in the world. This acoustic phenom comes with a price. At $1500 for the hall rental, another $1000 for recording engineer, and between $1000-$2000 for editing, this makes up the bulk of the money I'm trying to raise through Kickstarter. \n",
      "While the actual recording took place 27-28 September, \"Pieces\" is still very much a work in progress. I am still awaiting the first draft of edits and will then send it back for touch ups and mastering. There is also the costs of album graphic design, photography and video production, licensing, and printing of the physical CDs, which brings the total well past my fundraising goal. After deliberation, I settled on $6000 as a reasonable and most likely goal to raise.\n",

Can you imagine invoicing a half-million dollars for a photo shoot?  And wouldn't $1 million be enough for the potato photo?  Did he have to collect that extra $80,000?  Because (makes frowny face) \"Sorry, I just couldn't let it go for $1 million.\"\n",
      "Phantom by Peter Lik - Sold for $6.5 millionJonathan Jones of The Guardian described it as such: \"The $6.5m canyon: it's the most expensive photograph ever – but it's like a hackneyed poster in a posh hotel.\"  \n",
      "And Peter Lik's sale has NOT been substantiated.  That seems like a lot for a black and white photo, if you ask me.  Does that include a mat and a frame, or is that extra?  (I think Hobby Lobby is having a frame sale this week.)So, I want to REALLY sell the most expensive photograph ever – a verified sale – with a collective buyer (all of you), to claim rights as the most expensive photo ever sold, and to poke fun at the lunacy of these prices for a photograph.  And to do some good work with the funds, which you'll see below.\n",
      "These recent sales remind me of Marcel Duchamp's Fountain, where he could make anything, including art out of a urinal, and it would sell.\n",
      "From The Art Story Web site: Fountain (1917) \"The most notorious of the readymades, Fountain was submitted to the 1917 Society of Independent Artists under the pseudonym R. Mutt. The initial R stood for Richard, French slang for \"moneybags\" whereas Mutt referred to JL Mott Ironworks, the New York-based company, which manufactured the porcelain urinal. After the work had been rejected by the Society on the grounds that it was immoral, critics who championed it disputed this claim, arguing that an object was invested with new significance when selected by an artist for display. Testing the limits of what constitutes a work of art, Fountain staked new grounds. What started off as an elaborate prank designed to poke fun at American avant-garde art, proved to be one of most influential artworks of the 20th century.\" \n",

It was created on January 29, 2016, using a vintage Canon FL 55mm 1.2 lens on a Panasonic GF1 body once owned by famous photographer, Mike Johnston, of The Online Photographer.  There will never be another photo exactly like it and you'll have a \"piece of sky\". \n",

I believe that the questions it raises and unique predicaments make it a new story for audiences of a wide range to really be in enveloped in and enjoy. I have sent excerpts to publishers and authors , and they all give it very positive reviews. I truly think there are many out there who will enjoy this story and I really want to have the money to get it published, just so I can have people experience my story. The issue I face is , I have a life to live, and a novel of this caliber requires attention to detail and consumption of time ; I've made headway , but progress is slow. What this money would go toward is expenses so I don't need to worry about work, at least long enough so that I can finish the book. Anyone that would be willing to believe in me just the slightest, would mean the world. \n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "Pierce is quiet kid, drifting along through life , deep in quiet Appalachian mountains. His peace is only disrupted by one thing; everyone else. Still, he enjoys his stroll through life , until it begins to fall apart, and he finds himself thrown into a strange world, one only told to children in storybooks. This confusion would be fine for the bright adolescent, except for one thing: everyone wants to kill him. In a magical world he doesn't know, with friends he cant remember, and powers he doesn't understand, Pierce has to put the puzzle together piece by piece, having to act like the god-like tyrant everyone remembers him to be. Political reconciliation, romantic entanglement, and ending a war isn't something you would consider doing over a long weekend, but to Pierce , and the rest of the Ageless, its just another day's work. It could be said that his fiery passion drives him , or at least drove Demetrius, the alter ego he has taken the place of, as his anger burns bright enough for him to make an inferno from his bare hands. But what will happen to Pierce once they find a way to recover the soul that was lost nearly a decade ago? Will he just go gently into that good night, or fight them to his last breathe? Find out the secrets this world holds , and many more in The Oblivion Walker.\n",
      "Recap:\n",
      "Pierce lives a normal life, but the world he, you , and I know falls apart and he ends up in a fantasy world, competently different from here. As soon as he awakes , humans attempt to end his life, but he escapes , and a kid who claims to know who he is helps him to other old friends as they attempt to reclaim the memories he had lost while in the \"dream\", which is actually the world we know. While trying to come to grips with his existence, Pierce learns the master the power he has , including enhanced strength and ability to conjure fire, which is closely tied to his emotions. Like his friend , he is Ageless, a classification of being that live for millennium. Actually being nearly 3 hundred years old, Demetrius and Hesper had been quite the travelers, before a near fatal accident nearly ended Demetrius's life, now Hesper works to bring him back. This vast and detailed world is visited in detail in this book, as Pierce must work to not only help Hesper, but to prevent a global war. To make matters worse, they must learn more about the prophecy of the Oblivion Walker, which they fear pertains to them. Follow along as the two form a friendship and grow as companions. The world is explained in much greater detail and scientific sense than others in the fantasy genre. This story has twists around every turn and unique action sequences and plot. You wont be disappointed.  \n",

      "We (Harvey Lloyd & Ivana Lovinci) have spent ten years reinventing the art of photography for the digital age called BREAKING THE LIGHT.  Picasso said, \"I don't paint what I see, I paint what I imagine.\" We have created techniques to use our digital cameras as painter's tools and photograph that we imagine and even what we can't imagine. Using the TAO, quantum mechanics physics and metaphysics, ancient martial arts techniques, ZEN and Eastern philosophy, we are able to photograph what the eye cannot see, \"what isn't there,' until it is observed. The proof is seen on our website www.harveylloyd.com. The classic still film photography of \"what you see is what you get\" is ending as realistic painting ending over a hundred years ago,.  Alll who are young in heart and love the art of photography will shatter the past and create a new way of seeing with our digital cameras.\n",
      "BREAKING THE LIGHT reveals the astonishing wonders and beauty of the real world hidden from our eyes by early training of how our brains see. Our cameras have photographed post abstract expressionist images in New York City and New Mexico, aerial photographs of the red hot lava in the volcano five to twenty miles below the geyser basins in Yelloswtone National Park, the world's largest volcano, our moon in hyperspace in our holographic universe, Las Vegas Deconstructed; abstract impressionist images of the famous city of Lady Luck and many more.\n",
      "Each image is made during a single exposure in our digital camera. The raw images are the score for the music of light. The raw images are downloaded into our software for finishing. We do not manipulate images in any way or add to the raw images. The art is in learning to photograph the illusions of reality and bringing them to our own vision and enjoyment. A new world appears, GAIA the earth mother's beauty. Our new visions will help to protect GAIA and the environment by creating awareness of the overwhelming beauty of our hidden world.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "re risks and challenges. BREAKING THE LIGHT is a challenge to the past history of traditional photography. Our goal is to make this new work known and branded in order for it to be widely exhibited in galleries and museums. See: www.harveylloyd.com. The risks are the difficulties in getting the new art accepted at any time, as happened with modern  painters around the turn of the las century. We must use our funding to brand the work for the art world to accept what is a challenge to the past. With half a century of adventure and journalistic photography around the entire world, I have overcome all challenges. Ivana Lovincic is a lovely, brilliant intuitive artist and photographer who lives in NYC, coined the title BREAKING THE LIGHT, and will make social and art world contacts to aid our branding for collectors, museums and galleries. The work is already at the leading edge of the new art of photography and we will succeed.\n",

      "Imagine Diversifying Our Mountains\n",
      "For years, I have been fascinated with various outdoor activities like camping, fishing, hiking, snowboarding, and mountain biking. Backpacking in particular has become my favorite mindfulness activity, but I often find myself as the only person of color on the trails. This gets me in my head, trying to think of why I’m one of the few people of color who love backpacking. When I return from my trips, I always come back to the same thoughts:\n",
      "There comes a moment when you have to realize that the “system” wasn’t built to be inclusive and has extensive barriers in place that discourage black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), would-be adventurers from participating in wilderness activities.\n",
      "What do I mean by this? Food is one of the best representations of different cultures and people in America.  When you go to a grocery store or a major outdoor retailer, there are ZERO culturally relevant adventure meals for campers, backpackers, hikers, and other outdoor devotees. You see the same big-name brands serving your “traditional” meals like beef stew, lasagna, or biscuits and gravy. Personally, as a first generation Mexican-American immigrant from Michoacan, I know I would enjoy my outdoor adventures more if I had access to foods that packed real spice and flavor.\n",
      "Changing Human Behavior\n",
      "We founded Oso Meals with the goal to attract and support more BIPOC participation in wilderness activity and to introduce current explorers of every culture to a more diverse range of delicious backcountry meals. I believe we can achieve this goal by changing the normal, by creating the best adventure meals on the market and committing to sustainable and equitable food purchasing practices. I’m incredibly excited to launch Oso Meals - and to invite you to help us improve the outdoor industry through real food that is rich in taste and culture.\n",
      "Our Meals\n",
      "Dehydrated meals on the market today lack the flavor and taste of regular cooking - this is because the food is seasoned prior to dehydration (if it's even seasoned). This process sucks all the taste, spice, and goodness out of the ingredients, leaving you with a bland mass of texture. We have figured out a way to prepare and package adventure meals so that they don't lose the flavor of home cooking.  We took it a step further and created Latin meals rich in the Mexican-American flavors of our youth, ensuring that all adventurers have access to a better type of food. \n",
      "What we need - \n",
      "We have innovated a new way to cook dehydrated meals, but we still need to finalize recipes, packaging, and the manufacturing processes to ensure food quality, shelf-life and safety certifications. We are currently boot strapping this company with our own (limited) funds and need your help to accelerate  our timeline! \n",
      "Our goal is to launch Oso Adventure Meals by June 2021 so that everyone can have meals in time for summer and fall adventures. \n",
      "Oso Meals began in the mountains of Michoacan, Mexico and continues here in the Rockies of Colorado. Deep into a week-long backpacking trip, friends Dom Barrera and Felipe Vieyra were sharing stories about their abuelita’s home cooking. We remembered fresh huevos migos in the morning and giant platters of spicy enchiladas for the entire family. Dom was from Colorado and Felipe was from Michoacan, but we grew up enjoying the same flavorful meals.\n",
      " That night over a bland dinner of flavorless dehydrated beef stew, the idea for Oso Adventure Meals was born. Along with Marcos Vieyra and Connor Lawrence, we are creating a new type of adventure meal, meals based on a love for food that is rich in taste and culture.\n",
      "Oso’s soul is sharing delicious meals while you’re off the beaten path and far from home. It’s about creating access to flavors and recipes steeped in tradition. We all have fond memories of these recipes and are excited that foodies, adventurers, and all fans of good tasting food can share and enjoy the authenticity of Oso Meals.\n",
      "By you contributing to the founding of Oso Adventure Meals, you'll be a part of the journey to bring delicious meals to an ever diversifying outdoor community, you'll be a game-changer in the outdoor space and you'll be investing in a small business that's ready to disrupt a stale market. We plan to start with these 3 meals and expand to other culturally relevant options, bars, etc. \n",
      "The following meals were selected due to their history in traditional and modern Mexican culture. \n",
      "Inspired by Michoacán, Mexico \n",
      "One of the most popular dishes of Michoacán, Huevos Migas is a traditional egg-based dish from Michoacán. It's a delicious combination that you'll be eager to wake up to. \n",
      "Inspired by Mexico City, Mexico \n",
      "Mexico City is known for the many delicious meals you can come across and one of the best meals your taste buds will enjoy is Mexico City style Enchiladas. Delicious and energizing lunch or dinner for your adventure. \n",
      "Inspired by Oaxaca, Mexico\n",

      "Great coffee and shared experiences is how this US Army veteran turned coffee roaster strives to make a difference in the community.\n",
      "History\n",
      "Through the Camacho’s countless travels, moves, and deployments coffee has always been in abundance. In some places the coffee was intricate, almost delicate and in other places it was strong and bold. But regardless of the region of the world the coffee bean came from, the final beverage not only reflects the culture from where it now resides, but it also has the captivating ability to unite all those that partake of it.\n",
      "It is this “idea” that coffee unites people that intrigued one particular Colonel so he started to dabble in a new garage hobby. With each new shipment of beans from various parts of the world his skills grew in the roasting process. And with the encouragement of his spouse, family and friends and upon his retirement, the Colonel decided that coffee was what he wanted to do, “when he grew up”.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "Growing up is costly: emotionally, physically, and financially. Coffee seems like such a simple beverage; buy beans, grind beans, and then add water. Not much to it, right? That would be a resounding WRONG. Great coffee requires experience, partnerships, and equipment. We are looking for people who want to share in our passion and want to partner with us.\n",
      "Why We Want Your Help?\n",
      "Well, one particular Camacho wanted the garage back for her vehicle, especially now that it is winter in Colorado. That meant that the roaster needed a new home, one more suitable to coffee roasting. So the good Colonel packed up his roaster and moved it to a friendly commissary kitchen,  The roaster now shares a space with pies, cookies, chocolates, and some aspiring chefs. Granted coffee does pair well with all those delightful delectables, but we feel the two should be introduced at a later date when both arts have matured. \n",

      "Great Coffee and cool stuff, that's why. During our 30 years of military life we have learned that service members and their families, civilians, and contractors are a wonderful representation of America. That community secretly houses some of America's most talented treasures. We would like to showcase their talents in our products, art, and swag. Most, if not all Model Citizen Coffee designs have been created and inspired by a military spouse, veteran, dependent or other patriot who is connected to wanting to preserve this great nation. We're proud to showcase their passion in our products. \n",

We did have community, it's just our connections stretched across states, countries, and continents. Now it's time for the Camacho's to settle in Colorado and make this home. We hope to use Model Citizen Coffee as a platform to do good, not only in our geographic community, but in the lives of those we share life experiences with. One year ago we said goodbye to the military, but we continue to salute those who still answer the call every day. We find great comfort knowing the nation is in their hands.

My living expenses now are LESS than any other apartment or studio I've ever had. But Casa Xátiva is a big place, and any dream that begins and ends with oneself is not big enough. So my plan for Casa Xátiva has grown from a means of achieving my own life goals to a means of helping other artists struggling with the same challenges. I want to make Casa Xátiva a haven where fully engaged artists anywhere in the world can come to fully develop their ideas all on a minimal budget.\n",
      "“The major problem of life is learning how to handle the costly interruptions. The door that slams shut, the plan that got sidetracked, or that lovely poem that didn't get written because someone knocked on the door.” ― Martin Luther King Jr.\n",
      "I've been an artist as long as I can remember. What I can't remember is ever having a period in my life when I could work single-mindedly toward my artistic goals without the persistently encroaching financial and social disruptions of the \"real world.”\n",
      "Moving from city to city, I also found that studio space was difficult to find either because the costs were too prohibitive or my profile didn't fit the criteria of any art committee or residency program. And given the pragmatics of keeping a job and meeting various obligations, simply taking a few weeks off to attend an overpriced studio workshop abroad proved not so simple.\n",
      "The idea of buying a place that could serve as home and studio might have seemed an obvious first plan. And it might have been, had I lived and worked in an area where the real estate was affordable and banks were accommodating. However, something else gnawed at me: Could I invest the next 20 years of my life in a place that didn’t inspire me?\n",
      "So why not just give up the dream of being a consistently productive artist? Because I couldn't. In the end, persistence being my one advantage, a less than welcoming artist's community, a downturn in the economy, and my unwillingness to settle all turned out to be good things.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Don DeLillo‘s powerful post-9/11 novel Falling Man captures the first moments of the global tremor that has forever changed our emotional landscape, our memory, and our perception of the world. A man stumbles out of the falling rubble of the World Trade Center and witnesses the raw terror and absolute chaos of the shocking events of the fateful morning of September 11, 2001.\n",
      "The Center for Contemporary Opera will present the stage premiere of Kenneth Fuchs’ Falling Man, based on a text adapted by J. D. McClatchy from Don DeLillo's novel. Conceived and adapted for the stage by David Krane, the work is an operatic monodrama scored for baritone voice accompanied by an ensemble of eight instrumentalists. The solo vocal role will be performed by baritone Jarrett Ott, recently named one of “25 Rising Stars” by Opera News. The production features videography by Justin West from photographs contributed by the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. The single performance, under the musical direction of David Krane, with stage direction by Eugenia Arsenis, will take place at 8:00 p.m. on April 29, 2016, at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway (at 95th Street), in New York City.\n",
      "“Kenneth Fuchs’ Falling Man is a stunning work that truly encapsulates the ineffable experiences of that day. Fuchs’ music supports but never overshadows baritone Roderick Williams. You can hear every gripping word of the sung narrative. The London Symphony’s superb accompaniment is under the excellent direction of JoAnn Falletta. With Falling Man, Fuchs has written what for me is the defining musical memorial of 9/11. The music has the grace and strength needed for such a work.” — Jeffrey Tarlo, Expedition Audio (September 2014)\n",
      "About the Center for Contemporary Opera \n",
      "The Center for Contemporary Opera was founded in 1982 by Richard Marshall and Robert Ward, and is the oldest company in the world devoted solely to contemporary opera. CCO represents artists from all along the spectrum, from America’s most well-known composers, to emerging artists, to composers from historically underrepresented groups.\n",
      "“No company, large or small has a better track record of service to American opera” — The New York Times \n",
      "How will my gift be used?  Is it tax-deductible? \n",
      "Your tax-deductible contribution will be securely processed by Kickstarter and transferred to an account for the Center for Contemporary Opera. All contributions will be used to fund expenses for creating the production videography and hiring the eight musical instrumentalists. The Center for Contemporary Opera is an IRS recognized 501(c)3 non-profit organization. All donations are tax-deductible, minus the value of any rewards you receive. If this project meets its financial goal during the prescribed funding period, you will receive a letter acknowledging your donation once the Center for Contemporary Opera has received all funds.\n",
      "How Kickstarter Works \n",
      " For the next 21 days, you, your family, and friends can make pledges to help support this project, ranging from $25 to whatever you can afford. For your pledge, you can select one of the reward packages listed at the right. Your credit card or other account will not actually be charged at the time you make your pledge, and you can change your mind right up to the final deadline. If the final deadline comes and we've reached our goal, then everyone gets charged the amount they pledged, and we begin putting together all those rewards for you (along with producing our show, of course). But if for some reason we don't meet our goal, then the whole thing is called off. No one gets charged, no fees are applied, everyone just keeps their money. Of course, if we fail to meet the goal, then no one gets any rewards either, and some of those rewards are pretty cool, don’t you think?\n",

      "There are no risks. The production of Falling Man (paired with Jeremy Beck’s Blackwater) is scheduled to take place at Symphony Space in New York City on April 29, 2016. The Center for Contemporary Opera has already engaged performers and artisans to create the production.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "As promised to our existing backers and supporters, Truesicilian Blackbee is back for a new and exciting season. And this new season we have even bigger hopes to present the unique Sicilian black bee (apis mellifera sicula) to a much wider audience, and of course, to introduce our incredible naturally obtained honey, from these fantastic bees, to these unaware or just unlucky folks, who haven’t yet discovered it.\n",
      "Hoping to bring more admirers to this fantastic honey, while contributing to increase the Sicilian black bee population, and ultimately, bring more awareness to the vital importance of all bees and their varieties. Most of the worldwide beekeepers, nowadays basically use the same 4 or 5 bee's strains, with the Apis Ligustica or the Carsica as the main two used all over the world.\n",
      "That's why, helping local and endemic strains, as the Sicilian black bee, will instead contribute to maintain different varieties and species. It is extremely helpful for the natural ecosystems and all of nature in general, in order to ensure life for us, our planet and our future generations.\n",
      "No one was expecting a 2020 so dramatic and frighten, since its very beginning has taken all the globe to a dreadful conditions, both healthy and economically.\n",
      "Many countries are still struggling with this new and scary epidemic, some have been target deeply, such as a beautiful country named Italy, our country.\n",
      "Italy is still fiercely fighting against the Covid-19, with a very unfortunate statistics, but the country never stopped to fight back!\n",
      "This pandemy has reduced our activity drastically, making basically impossible to operate our passion as before, and the conseguent economic crisis has taking a toll on us. but with the help of our amazing bees and your support we're sure to bounce back, and gain back what has been our dearly passion since 2014.\n",
      "This round we need you more than ever!\n",
      "This time not only for preserve one of the most unique bee in our planet, but also to provide us with the strenght to carry our job in this difficult time, and stay alive for other seasons to come.\n",
      "Hopefully with your support, we will be here for many more years.\n",
      "Thank you, stay safe and bless you!\n",
      "Everything has begun with a passion for beekeeping and bees… We started to produce our raw honey, just for our family and friends a few years ago.\n",
      "Family and friends have often gifted, offered and left honey to other people to taste and we got many compliments and appreciations for our honey, coming from people we'd never met before.\n",
      "Soon people started to ask where to they could find and how to obtain this honey for themselves. This ignited the idea of producing our honey for a wider elite audience, and to share this amazing product with other lucky honey lovers around the globe.\n",
      "However, we are still very small and keen to remain like this, we cannot and certainly don’t want to compete with market giants or industrialized productions. We think a good product comes from passion, dedication and little production. Our Honey is always produced in favour of quality, instead of quantity. We put lots of passion in what we do and take great pride in our final product, which is strictly Limited Edition and only available directly from us.\n",
      "We are passionate and totally committed to our bees, our main purpose is to make them happy and healthy, and to give them the best conditions to produce their magic, in order to give us the best and sweetest food that nature has ever created.\n",
      "As Sicilians, we are lucky enough to be in one of the most beautiful island of the Mediterranean, with wonderful climate conditions and large biodiversity. Sicily is in fact the first region in Italy for organic farming and products, and the only one with an endemic bee species.\n",
      "We carefully choose the places, always trying to find a perfect spot inside national parks or untouched natural reserves around Sicily. Thanks to its several Natural Parks (Sicily has five National Parks and seventy two Regional Protected Reserves), it is a perfect place for a nomad apiculture.\n",
      "We choose meticulously the best environments for our bees, always looking to improve our honey varieties, specializing in the production of mono floral and single blossom honey, extracting basically very different honey varieties, often with different and distinctive flavours, with specific and unique properties depending on their floral origin.\n",
      "All of our bees are Apis Mellifera Sicula, also known as Sicilian Black Bee.\n",
      "Uniquely endemic of the island, they are smaller and darker than common honeybees, and are very renowned for being really docile and easy to handle, they definitely produce less honey compared to other domesticated honeybees, but their honey keeps the same levels of vitamins in smaller quantities, making their honey one of the richest ever, as several studies have proved.\n",
      "These little fellas were almost disappeared from Sicily and therefore from the entire earth, until Mr. Amodeo, a famous beekeeper from Palermo, started to take interest and created awareness for this amazing ancient bee strain. Thanks to his incredible job and dedication, the Sicilian Black Bee, has been slowly recovered from extinction and reintroduced among Sicilian beekeepers, with several of them certified as Slow Food Presidium.\n",
      "Today the Sicilian Black Bee is much more known, capturing lots of interests and attention, and its honey particularly admired and appreciated.\n",
      "Pure raw honey, it is as simple as it sounds. Following a natural way to source honey, with ancient and very respectful methods, without additives or external interventions, making nature our only ingredient.\n",
      "Our final product is therefore entirely natural, cold-extracted and never pasteurised, in order to keep intact all its properties and characteristics.\n",
      "We work hard to ensure the best conditions for our bees, in order to produce the best honey, the result is a formidable product, unique and extremely singular of its kind. As a matter of a fact, you will never find elsewhere, a honey with similar characteristics or the same intense flavour.\n",
      "Also, you will never find our honey on shops or markets shelves, but only directly from us. Our honey varieties include Orange blossom, Lemon blossom, Eucalyptus, Sulla flower, Chestnut, Thyme, Prickly Pear, wild Thistle, Sicilian mountain flowers and other unique flavours.\n",
      "This season we also have available our two Super Honey!\n",
      "Both made by simple adding some natural ingredients to our raw honey. The results are two amazing honey with incredible superpowers!\n",
      "A Balsamic one, with raw eucalyptus honey and natural essential oils as Menthol, Thyme and Eucalyptol, and an Energy one, with orange blossom raw honey, royal jelly and ginseng. The first, is the perfect natural remedy to fight winter ailments, cough and flu, and the second is able to fight fatigue and boost your energy.\n",
      "We love bees, and we love honey. Bees are good for nature and honey is just GOOD… Nothing pleases us more than to be able to keep on doing what we do, the way we do it.\n",
      "That is why we don't have big plans or big expectations. As on our previous campaigns this season's goal will help us cover all expenses, repay our work and resources, and give us the chance to continue our honey production for another season on coming.\n",
      "More important, it will also help us keep our Sicilian Black Bee's safeguard project alive and active, with the remaining funds totally reinvested in more hives and black bees!\n",
      "Looking back at our previous honey seasons, we noticed that folks backed our project mostly just to grab our unique honey, so we decided to cut any gadgets, and send just our honey, which probably will come in five or six different varieties, depending on season’s harvest conditions and results.\n",
      "Every new season we push things a little bit further, looking for new varieties to add and new honey to produce, therefore if the season goes well, we may have inedited varieties as well to offer among the rewards.\n",
      "The varieties available will only be determined at the end of the honey season, if season goes well, backers may be then invite to select preferred varieties for their rewards.\n",
      "The rewards are twelve in total, ten out of them will involve our honey, with two different size of jars available, depending on the pledge, the standard 250gr and the 500gr. Any rewards sent, will be complete of Brochure, Honey varieties leaflet and a sticker. Three rewards include also the two new Special Honeys.\n",
      "Special Honeys:\n",
      "We all know the amazing benefits of raw honey... Packed with goodies such as enzymes, phytochemicals, nutrients and vitamins. Moreover, raw honey has a high potassium, iron, calcium, magnesium, protein, and vitamin C content. It is also a strong antibacterial and an effective immunity builder. To these already amazing qualities, we’ve just added some special natural ingredients to increase benefits, in order to create an incredibly powerful and curative honey.\n",
      "#1. True Sicilian ENERGY Honey:\n",
      "Ingredients: 90% BlackBee Orange Blossom Honey, 5% Royal Jelly, 5% Ginseng\n",
      "Strong remedy against stress and fatigue. It helps reduce the feeling of tiredness and fatigue, strengthens  the immune system and the protection of cells from oxidative stress. Energizer. The taste is sweet and very fruity, with hints of citrus.\n",
      "#2. True Sicilian BALSAMIC Honey:\n",
      "Ingredients: 95% BlackBee Eucalyptus Honey, 5% Essential Oils (Menthol-Eucalyptol-Thyme)\n",
      "Its balsamic action makes this honey incredibly effective to prevent and fight seasonal ailments such as the cold or the flu. It is a powerful cough relief, a great antiseptic, and a bid help for throat pain and bronchitis. The taste is very aromatic, strong and utterly balsamic.\n",
      "Two super honeys, with exceptional properties, to be fully considered as a natural medicine, antibiotic and antibacterial, with incredible benefits.\n",
      "You can have them simply by submitting the BUILDER pledge, the DRONE pledge or the QUEEN pledge…\n",
      "Alternatively, you can have them by just adding 21 euro (19 euro honey + 2 euro shipment) to your existing pledge for each 250gr Jar of special honey you'd like to add on; or $ 23,50, if your currency is in US Dollar.\n",
      "All the jars will be individually bubbled-wrapped, in order to prevent any wiggle or clashes among themselves.\n",
      "This season if we reach euro 10.000 as goal, we''ll add a little goodie to the rewards of all the backers that will help us reaching it. \n",
      "Any backers will be homaged with a mini jar of Sicilian typical delicacies, plunged in Sicilian wild Flowers Blackbee Raw Honey.\n",
      "You would be asked to choose your mini jar among three varieties available:\n",
      "1. Etna’s Hazelnut\n",
      "2. Bronte’s Pistachio\n",
      "3. Val di Noto’s Almond\n",
      "Three special ingredients from the excellence of Sicily!\n",

      "We need YOU! Thank you.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "It's always important to remember that every project involving nature and its ecosystems comes with a multitude of risks and challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to remember that it takes the entire lifetime of 12 worker bees to produce a single teaspoon of BlackBee Honey.. Taking that further, to produce 0.5lb (227gr) of Black Bee honey it takes about 30,000 bees travelling 27,500 miles and visiting more than a million flowers just to gather the nectar required.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why any products or results are always a given gift when working with nature.. Every honey jar that we manage to fill is a precious prize to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main risk involved, would be having a bad season and end up with low honey production... That wont allow us to sell much honey after fulfilled the rewards. This is basically the bigger risk we could face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also another little risk could be to receive a damaged parcel, even if its been carefully wrapped by us, that is why we firmly remind to all backers to write down \"accept with reserve\" on the receipt or tick the relevant box \"with reserve\" when signing.\n",
      "Only like this we can claim against the Courier and try refund any damage that may occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our big challenge is meet the target and get enough fund to keep on producing our honey and perhaps be able to grow in number our hives.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'd like to specify once more time that, when working with bees and with nature in general, there are no real certity of the outcome, and with this pandemic still spreading and devastating, the results of this season's honey production will be even more uncertain. Have said that, we are very confident on a good outcome, but it's always better to prepare for the worst while hope for the best!\n",

      "The series Virgenes de la Puerta focuses on the transgender women of Lima, who continue to be cast aside by the political and religious administrations. They are often denied employment, assistance from government programs, and not given any state or government-issued forms of identification; in essence, they are being marginalized and erased.\n",
      "We honor the diversity of the Peruvian culture by re-incorporating transgender women into the cultural landscape and history of Peru. In direct contrast to their oppressor’s intentions, the work celebrates the contributions made by transgender people and presents them as iconic figures within the context of their native land. These photographs pay homage to the resilience and beauty of these women in an effort to strengthen, empower, and embed a sense of pride within the current and future generations of Peru’s LGBTQ community. \n",
      "Whether a portrait or tableau, each image is created by first constructing costumes, sculptural headpieces, and props to adorn and embellish each one of the women. The objects are all designed and fabricated in a collaboration between Barboza-Gubo & Mroczek and the local artisans of Peru who specialize in regional crafts and textiles. Each photograph utilizes culturally relevant references unique to Peru in an effort to embed the women into the culture of their homeland. \n",
      "Below you'll see our in-process image of Gaby, a respected trans activist in Lima. It's inspired by the patron saint Santa Rosa of Lima who was rumored to have worn a heavy silver crown with spikes hidden in its interior, emulating Christ’s crown of thorns. Our Santa Rosa dons a crown of thorns sculpted by Juan Jose Barboza-Gubo and finished with silver leaf that was mined in Peru. Its elongated design, which stretches above and past her shoulders, and represents the shared persecution of the people in her community. Once the image is printed at the appropriate scale and installed on gallery walls, it will be positioned at the height of the average adult so as viewers enter the space they will see, from a distance, other visitors standing beneath the crown with her… because when we persecute others, we also persecute ourselves. \n",

The large negative ensures that the image will retain its integrity when printed in larger scales…. and we want the women in the photographs to be printed close to their natural size.\n",
      "When photographing we utilize many locations throughout the city of Lima. We look for destinations off the beaten path that represent the country, the city, and its people. Each location is thoroughly researched and we often rent additional props and antiques from local dealers to complete a scene. It's truly a multi-layered production, and we do all the work ourselves without any assistants. \n",

      "La serie \"Vírgenes de la Puerta\" se centra en las mujeres transgénero de Lima, que continúan siendo dejadas de lado por las administraciones políticas y religiosas. Casi siempre se les niega el empleo, la asistencia de los programas del gobierno, y no se les da ninguna forma de identificación emitida por el gobierno; en esencia, están siendo marginadas y borradas del sistema. \n",
      "Honramos la diversidad de la cultura peruana, re-incorporando a las mujeres trangénero en el paisaje cultural y la historia del Perú. En contraste directo con las intenciones de sus opresores, la obra celebra las contribuciones de las personas transgénero y las presenta como figuras icónicas en el contexto de su tierra natal. Estas fotografías son un homenaje a la resistencia y la belleza de estas mujeres en un esfuerzo por fortalecer, capacitar e incorporar un sentido de orgullo dentro de las generaciones actuales y futuras de la comunidad LGTB del Perú. \n",
      "Ya sea un retrato o una escena, cada imagen es creada primero construyendo trajes, tocados escultóricos y accesorios para adornar y embellecer cada una de las mujeres. Los objetos diseñados y fabricados son una colaboración entre Barboza-Gubo, Mroczek y los artesanos locales del Perú que se especializan en artesanías y textilería de la región. Cada fotografía utiliza referencias de relevancia cultural única en el Perú, con el afán de integrar a las mujeres en la cultura de su tierra natal. \n",
      "Las mujeres son fotografiadas con una cámara 8x10; utilizando una película negativa de color con el fin de maximizar la capacidad de imprimir las imágenes en escalas de gran tamaño, hasta 180 cm de ancho. El gran negativo asegura que la imagen mantenga su integridad cuando se imprime en escalas mayores. El propósito es que las mujeres se impriman cerca de su tamaño natural. \n",
      "Al fotografiar, utilizamos muchos lugares de la ciudad de Lima. Buscamos destinos fuera del circuito turístico, que representen el país, la ciudad y su gente. Cada lugar es investigado a fondo y a menudo alquilamos adicionalmente objetos y antigüedades peruanas en los distribuidores locales para completar las escenas. Es realmente una producción de muchas capas, y todo el trabajo lo hacemos nosotros mismos sin ayudantes. \n",
      "Una vez finalizado, el trabajo será mostrado en galerías de arte y centros de la comunidad LGBTQ en Lima y en los EE.UU. Queremos promover un diálogo sobre la aceptación, el respeto, y sobre la supervivencia.\n",
      " Esperamos que este texto les de una idea de nuestro trabajo y de nuestra misión. La sección de preguntas frecuentes les dará un desglose exhaustivo del presupuesto, así como una sección sobre el título y algunos importantes reconocimientos y agradecimiento a personas que han ayudado a que el inicio de este proyecto sea posible. Esperamos añadir sus nombre a la lista de los que nos ayudarán a terminar este proyecto.\n",

      "We’re confident that we’ll overcome any challenge we face, and we’ve already experienced our share of downfalls – everything from faulty equipment, having to reshoot, or rethinking the overall concept of a photograph; we’ve met every glitch head-on. We also realized that every time something didn’t work out quite the way we expected it to, we took a moment to rethink and recalibrate our ideas to combat the challenges in a way that produced a stronger image and a better result. It’s all about adjusting to the process. In Peru, flexibility is key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having spent so much time in Lima working on the project already, we know what to expect and what we need to plan ahead before we travel. The availability of certain artist’s materials and some types of photography equipment can be difficult to access in Lima, so we’re partnered with some amazing colleagues and fellow artists here in the U.S. who have let us borrow what we needed ahead of time, providing us the opportunity to bring more things with us. And, if all else fails, FedEx is God!\n",

      "Hello,\n",
      "My name is Austin Speer, and I am a photographer based out of Grand Blanc Michigan.  Photography has always been something I admired and enjoyed, yet never put photography to use in my personal life.  That changed only about a  year ago.\n",
      "I began my photographic journey, as mentioned, about a year ago.  It all began when I received a GoPro for christmas in 2013.  Photography was suggested to me by a very good friend of mine to help aid my videography skills.  Not long after the purchase of my first DSLR camera, photography stuck with me.\n",
      "What kind of photography do I do you may ask?  Well, quite frankly, any photography I will tackle.  But what I have done was narrow my main focus to three categories.  They are:  Automotive, Landscape, and City photography.\n",
      "Anybody can take a photo of a car, a mountain view, or a cityscape.  But what I have done was work on bringing it a step further.  I decided to take photos and display only the best cars in the world, the best landscapes that I have been able to capture, and interesting city photos that I have been privileged to take when the time has risen.\n",
      "What I really want to do with photography is work in the automotive industry and taking photos for magazines, manufacturers, and various publications.  If I had to choose three car manufacturers to work with, they would be:\n",
      "1) Ferrari\n",
      "2) Audi\n",
      "3) Bentley\n",
      "I am not asking you to donate your life savings to my fund, but if you do that is greatly appreciated.  I am working on expanding my photographic portfolio to attract as many people as possible.  Every dollar helps greatly.  \n",

What I am looking at using Kick Starter for is to buy the supplies that will help me succeed as a young artist. I want to be able to sell my work, but I would like to do so much more than that. I want to be able to be in a career that I Enjoy to do. Photography is one of few careers that I know I am able to feel this way about. People always say to follow your dreams, but how are we suppose to do that in such a harsh world. This is where you come in. For that dream that you may not have gotten to do. You could help mine come true! I am not looking for a lot right now. Just some simple things like a light reflector, tripod, and maybe a new flash. If I have enough to get more I will be buying advertisements so people can know I am here. You may be able to change my life, YOU have that power! Even if you are not able to donate, let me know your story, or give me some advice. I would love to hear it! Thank You  for any and everything you can give!\n",

      "More than an orchestra of some of the best musicians in the UK, the Beethoven Orchestra for Humanity is a new kind of concert experience where we weave music and a provocative talk around a topical issue that all we're dealing with today. \n",
      "We're performing in intimate venues with limited seating in order that everyone can see, hear and feel inside the sound and to complete this we're inviting the audience to be completely free from any classical conventions that tell you where and when not to clap.\n",

      "It's a big melting pot where one element plays off another and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\n",
      "For our opening event we're thrilled to announce that Francesca Martinez, comedian, activist and writer, is our guest speaker:\n",
      "She'll be speaking about climate change and social responsibility and we'll be playing music from Beethoven and other composers that relates - either on themes of nature (Beethoven's incredible Pastoral Symphony), society (Górecki Symphony of Sorrowful Songs Part 2) and humanity (Beethoven's Leonora and Villa-Lobos Bachianas Brasileiras). \n",
      "We're kickstarting for £10,000 to launch a series of events starting with our first concert on Monday, 8 February 2016! Our opening night will give us the platform from which to build our future. Putting on each concert involves a unique venue, 40 musicians, guest speaker and much more, so on a straight profit sheet it's totally uneconomical.\n",
      "We want to do more than bring the sheer power and beauty of classical orchestral music to a new audience. We've designed the Beethoven Orchestra for Humanity from the ground up to create a visceral, multi-layered experience that makes a meaningful impact for audience and musicians alike.\n",

      "It's all in the mix, but in particular three things: \n",
      "Music doesn’t exist inside a vacuum. It lives inside the times in which we live. Often we use music to 'escape' our lives. Here we get right into it with a talk on an issue that we're all involved in and that sets the tone and context for the night. The music will live inside this. \n",
      "We want the audience to be central to the experience. The music we'll be playing has soul, depth, power, beauty, shock, wit, brains, all of it. Except there are unspoken rules governing classical music concerts that tell you when and when not to respond, so we're throwing that out the window. \n",
      "There's nothing like the immediacy of being up-close to an orchestra of musicians playing their hearts out, bringing thrilling music to life, in the moment. Most concerts put the orchestra separate from the audience and the further back you are the less you see and hear. The less you see and hear, the less you feel. At the Beethoven Orchestra for Humanity we want the audience to experience everything. No falling asleep in the first half here!\n",
      "Beethoven literally transformed music, tore up the rule book in the process and made it reveal both who we are and who we can be; he was possibly the greatest humanitarian in all art. As Tom Service put it so well, in any moment of Beethoven there’s the sense that everything is possible. We like that.\n",
      "P.S. We won’t only be playing Beethoven!\n",
      "A collective of like-minded musicians and entrepreneurs who believe that when the best classical music is played as it should be, with raw passion and total commitment, it hits the sweet spot of depth and accessibility and is truly life-changing stuff. It's for everybody and we want to get it out there.\n",
      "And at the same time, we think it can make the world a better place, especially when placed at the heart of the conversations that are shaping the times we live in. \n",

      "\n",
      "One risk we're taking in particular is that we're challenging the very idea of what a classical concert can be and this could alienate as many as it draws. Still, we feel this is a risk worth taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, while many of us have produced, directed or played in an orchestra before, it's our first time Kickstarting and doing something so unorthodox. It's an exciting and scary place to be in at the same time.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "5 years ago, the world of art and mainly street and pop art, took me by storm! My eyes lit up at the bold colors rising out of dilapidated urban landscapes. My brain awoke with the statements being made. Unfortunately, I lived in a small town in Missouri for 4.5 of those years and there was not much to see there. I had to live vicariously through documentaries on Netflix and google image searches. 5 months ago I moved to Los Angeles to further pursue my musical goals and dreams. While music is an amazing outlet for my creativity, I felt compelled to express myself visually in other ways. I have had runs ins with attempts painting before. I was successful at painting guitars for awhile, but only solid colors or with stripes. When it comes to drawing or painting anything in an actual artistic sense, it isn't pretty.\n",
      "Since I cannot create, I figured, why not document it and share with all my friends from other states that are not here to see it for themselves. I only had my cell phone, but figured it was good enough, so I grabbed my skateboard and started skating down every street in LA searching out as much art as I could find and photograph. A funny thing happened and some of my friends that are photographers started telling me that I had an eye for photography and that I needed to get a professional camera. That's cool and all, but I'm a musician, so i'm broke all the time. If I am a musician and a photographer, will that mean that I am somehow even more broke?\n",
      "Sometimes I have to climb a pipe and a fire escape ladder to get a good shot, sometimes I have to get over a bit of razor wire. I do whatever I can to get the best shot I can with the tools I have. I am taking this mindset to Kickstarter in an attempt to do all I can with what I have to get an actual camera and begin my newest creative venture properly.\n",
      "The camera I am after is a Fujifilm x100t. A photographer that used to take pictures of my band had one. It took amazing shots, was small and discreet, and just had an overall look that inspired me to want to wield it. One of these new runs $1200-1300. Any extra money raised from this campaign will go towards bags/cases, lenses and traveling to other cities to document the amazing art across this country and maybe even the world. Thank you all so much!\n",

While some in the U.S. population think that it's an outdated part of our constitutional rights; thinking there is no need for gun ownership; others say its one of the rights that make The United States of America Great.  One of the questions that I plan to paint about is the question of weather some laws regarding gun control make sense.  Some citizens of the United States want more laws and more controls.  There is much debate and confusion around this.  \n",
      "Each State in the United States has different laws regarding certain aspects of gun ownership causing much confusion and court cases against people whom where unaware they were breaking the law.  This is especially true when transporting guns but is also confusing in other ways as some states require permits others do not and still other states don't require permits if the gun is just in the home. \n",

      "\"[Kitty] is a lady who loves her airplane, adventure, she is brave, [with] an inner voice she rarely listen to (at least not always), a love for nature and history. In a way, she is kick ass, and I admire her ability to keep a cool head even when everything goes to hell in a handbasket around her. Yes, she does get scared at times, but with everything happening, I am awed that she acts the way she does. Awesome girl!!!\"\n",

There's definitely something real about her, as she seems more like a friend rather than someone I just happen to read about. She's clever, funny, and adventurous. Not to mention, she's an excellent pilot of a red and white seaplane. Although she does seem to get involved with a lot of trouble. It's okay, Kitty, it just makes your story more interesting.\"\n",

      "Potato chips, pretzels, cheese puffs, popcorn-- who doesn't love a good snack? The only problem is, nearly all of the tastiest snacks are unhealthy. And when we turn to healthier snacks, most of the choices are bland and taste like cardboard (we're looking at you, kale chips!).\n",
      "We've worked for over two years to bring to life a snack without any tradeoffs. To do that, we had to throw out potatoes and tortillas and create a chip out of an entirely new base-- egg whites! \n",
      "With notes of salsa and spice, our signature flavor combines the eggcitement of gourmet huevos rancheros with the convenience of a bag of chips. With only 2 net carbs per bag, it fits right in to the Keto lifestyle. Did we mention it'll get you jacked, too? Each bag of Rancheros has 10 GRAMS of protein. And as if that all weren't good enough, this flavor has 6 grams of fiber. If you watch your macros, you need some Quevos Rancheros!\n",
      "Sour Cream & Onion, like all our flavors, is lactose free, but you would never know it! If you're looking for a delicious, creamy flavor with a hint of onion zest, this one's for you. Sour Cream & Onion has the same stellar macros as Quevos Rancheros-- 10 grams of protein, 2 net carbs, and 6 grams of fiber. \n",
      "A NEW FLAVOR LAUNCHING RIGHT HERE ON KICKSTARTER!\n",
      "Fresh off the grill, this flavor provides the classic Barbeque chip experience. On the sweeter side but with a hint of smoke, this one on is a snack lovers dream! We pack in five grams of protein and five grams of fiber into every bag of Sweet Barbeque so you can indulge without any of the guilt of a conventional BBQ snack! \n",
      "This flavor is also a NEW INTRODUCTION to the Quevos family specially released for kickstarter! Cheddar has the same macros as Sweet Barbeque, but with a strong cheesy punch. If you like cheese, order these, please! Incredibly, despite the powerful flavor on this chip, Cheddar Quevos are lactose free.\n",
      "Most delicious snacks are cursed with one or more nutritional weaknesses. Often, they have artificial ingredients, high levels of sugar and unhealthy fats, and/or they're loaded with starch from sources like potatoes, corn, and white flour. On top of that, they're typically fried. And worst of all, most tasty snacks usually have deceivingly small serving sizes, making a quick snack into something close to a MEAL if we're not careful. \n",
      "Quevos were created as an answer to these nutritional problems. But we spent a painstaking amount of time making sure we didn't lose out on deliciousness as we crafted our product. After all, we wanted people to EAT our snack, not just think it was a cool idea! What we came up with is a revolution in the snack category. Quevos pack over twice as much protein and fiber into each serving than conventional snacks like potato and tortilla chips do. We get fats from superfood sources like avocado oil and chia seeds. Our chips are gluten free, lactose free, and soy free. Quevos don't have artificial ingredients, and they're not fried. And to put a cherry on top, each bag (one serving) is over 30 chips! Quevos leave you satisfied-- happy with a delicious snack and full and nourished from our incredible nutrient composition! \n",

      "Zack, our co founder, is type 1 diabetic and frequently cooks egg whites as a low carb snack. His favorite part of any egg dish he makes are the crispy pieces left in the pan. In June 2016, he was eating some egg white crispies and couldn't help but think about how they crunched and cracked just like potato chips. He wondered, \"Is it possible to make a chip out of egg whites?\" He saw the potential for a higher protein, lower carb, and overall more nutritious snack. So he called Nick (his best friend since age 9!) over and they began formulating in Zack's kitchen. \n",
      "Things got serious when Nick took the idea for Quevos and our early prototypes to the New Venture Challenge at University of Chicago. Ben, David, Nick, and Zack spent 10 weeks in a rigorous business development course that taught us about customer discovery, market sizing, financial projections, and creating a business plan. At the end of the course, we pitched to a panel of 19 investors who judged us against the 9 other teams in the class. We won first place, taking home $15,000 from the Booth School of Business.\n",
      "For most of last year, our main focus was perfecting our product. We used our early seed funding to buy hundreds of ingredients, which we tried out in over a thousand different combinations. Plus, we experimented with different cooking processes at a pilot production lab we rented space in. To get feedback on each new version, we sampled with healthy snackers in gyms and health food shops around Chicago. Slowly, but surely, Quevos were improving.\n",
      "Feedback on Quevos had become very positive by the fall of 2018 and we knew we were ready to go. Zack and Nick were working long days during the summer, and it was clear that we wouldn't be able to commit to both Quevos and our education fully. So we dropped out of college to work on Quevos full time! We found a commercial kitchen space, began production, and launched our market test around Chicago stores and online. It was tremendous to finally have a product in a package on a shelf. Our idea had become a reality! \n",
      "The reception of Quevos has been phenomenal, so much so that we sold out of our entire inventory in March. Now we are scaling up to produce at higher volumes so we can get our snack out there to every healthy snacker in need of a better option! We can't do this alone, though. WE NEED YOUR HELP to fund our first large scale production run so that we can make thousands of bags to sell online and in natural food stores around the country!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "There are abundant risks with any startup company bringing a product to market. Thankfully, we have already gone through a good portion of them. We completed a market test over the last 4 months, selling online on quevos.com and in ten stores around Chicago. The reception Quevos received was fantastic, which is why we are scaling up our manufacturing facility and launching in earnest now. We need your help fronting the costs of a large production run we want to do in May.  If all goes according to plan and we hit our goal in this Kickstarter, we will ship out your rewards in June!\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we need to buy new packaging equipment and that has a lead time between 3-6 weeks, there could be delays which cause our shipments to arrive at your door in July. But rest assured, if we hit our funding goal we'll go straight into squaring everything away for production and then start manufacturing bags of Quevos by the thousands!\n",

      "After a seismic event event off the coast of Florida deep below the surface, a couple unknowingly discover something extraordinary in a subterranean cavern that defies their senses. Relying on their ambitions and curiosities, Mike (played by SETH REMIS) and Tracy (played by Mariela Martinez) strive to mend their ideals with this discovery, only to learn it was something that mankind wasn't meant to disturb.\n",
      "Filled with adventure, and a lesson to be learned, Mike and his girlfriend Tracy, unravel the enigma of the plant through a series of mysterious events and encounters only to return what does not belong to them.\n",
      "Asarum is a myth meets reality adventure set in modern-day 2016 written by Allen Driscoll. We pitched the script and our ideas to a few people and they loved it! Their reaction matched our motivation! A film like this is very needed and different from what is out there today. Our society is lacking films reminiscent of the 80's with a great story, like ET and Raiders of the Lost Ark, in which the whole family can enjoy, and Asarum offers a chance to bring it to them in theaters abroad.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Inspired by the musical comedy of Spike Jones and a British humorist named Gerald Hoffnung, I started presenting satirical concerts in the 1950’s at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City and the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado, leading eventually to the first public P.D.Q. Bach concert, as it had come to be called, at New York’s Town Hall.  Hard as it is to believe, it was 50 years ago that the music of P.D.Q. Bach first wormed its way into the ears of the unsuspecting public.  P.D.Q. Bach was the twenty-first of Johann Sebastian Bach’s twenty children, and his music demonstrated the warped influences of his father as well as his contemporaries, Vivaldi, Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven.  The concerts became an annual last-week-in-December tradition at Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall in New York City, presenting an ever-increasing array of original compositions attributed to “the scourge of Wein-am-Rhein.”  People began to notice that one could actually learn something about 18th-century classical music from these misguided pieces, some of which have infiltrated classroom syllabi. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We think it's most fitting to commemorate this occasion with a special concert at Town Hall, where the first concert took place in 1965. We've picked a day, December 28th, and The Town Hall’s available, but what stands in the way is the cost of putting it together. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Music Pathology at the University of Southern North Dakota at Hoople has had some funding cuts, and we need your help to get this project off the ground and onto the stage.  It costs money, a lot of money, to put on a concert: we have to rent the hall, pay the orchestra, stagehands and performers, print programs, hire a producer, rent sound equipment, etc. Even in the event of a sold-out show, professional classical orchestral concerts are perennial money losers, made possible by generous donations made to the orchestra and/or the presenting organization. In this case, we’re the presenting organization, and the orchestra will be one we hire, so we’re using Kickstarter to appeal directly to folks like you who like music and comedy.  With your help, I think we can pull this off!\n",
      "\n",
      "If we can raise the funding, the show can go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the way, Kickstarter will only let you back once and we couldn't feasibly offer every combination of rewards, so if you would like to combine two or more reward packages, just pick the one that has a limited quantity available and pledge the combined amount of the packages and drop us a line letting us know what you want and we'll take care of you. That is, if you want a diploma ($100) and 2 premium tickets ($250), pick the tickets and pledge $350 and let us know and you'll get both. We tried to make sure that there are good packages available for both people who can make the concert and those who cannot, but that means if you want tickets and swag (which is a situation we'd be delighted with) you may have to design your own package in this way.\n",

We had been developing photos and discussing future projects we had in mind for a designated week at the end of the term where students could pursue an independent topic.  Recognizing our common interests, we started plotting to collaborate.  We wanted to draw from our passions – photography, writing, and activism – to create a compelling product, thus bringing about the concept of a zine on women in male-dominated industries.  In order to cover a greater breadth of professional environments, we decided to branch out from our home of Putney, Vermont and contact women in New York City.  Among them, we ended up speaking with an executive chef, the founder of the field of psycho-oncology, a filmmaker, and an all-female collective that designs, produces, and sells their own furniture.  Our week in New York allowed us to hear perspectives from women ages thirty to eighty-eight, all sharing a unique story, and ready to continue fighting for gender equality, no matter how steep the climb. \n",

But by seeking out more opportunities for humor and laughter, you can improve your emotional health, strengthen your relationships, find greater happiness—and even add years to your life.\n",

      "We are living in a time when everyone is walking on eggshells, not knowing what’s okay to joke about and constantly censoring ourselves... or are we? When we’re around people we love and trust, we let loose – at least we hope so. The comedies on TV, aside from shows like South Park and Curb Your Enthusiasm, no longer make jokes that are offensive. When did America get so sensitive? We don’t believe it did and hope you don’t either. That’s why we want to bring back a style of unfiltered comedy.\n",
      "The show is about three best friends in their late 20s from the suburbs of Massachusetts who own a gym together. We chose this location because the stereotypes are true – people from Massachusetts have no filter and can be offensive. But at the end of the day are mostly good. They’ll yell at you for no reason, but if you’re cold they’ll give you the shirt off their back. We chose a gym because it’s a location that is ripe for unique characters: the person who made a New Year’s Eve resolution, the nerdy high school kid trying to get strong, the college football player, the hot divorced mom, the old lady who lifts the two-pound dumbbells, the overweight guy who wants to be thin, the shallow person who needs to stay sexy. This list can go on forever. When you're at the gym, your group identity doesn't matter because you're an individual with your own goals. \n",
      "In the pilot, the three best friends are in danger of losing their gym, the one place they believe everyone is free to be themselves. If they lose it, they’ll lose their life savings and the community they’ve built, but the most important thing they'd lose is their friendship.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "While many ANC earphones simply mimic the generic earphone style, we are here to introduce a completely new take on mobile music enjoyment. We designed the WG-1 to combine class-leading noise-canceling technology, the immersive acoustic performance of the audiophile world, and the freedom of a TWS design. On top of that, the ergonomic shape provides a secure and comfortable fit. Certified IPX5 waterproof, you can feel free to wear the earbuds anywhere, from the gym to long jogs in the rain.\n",
      "Adopting the innovative Active Noise Cancellation Technology, the WG-1 can automatically recognize and capture the environment noise, and then deliver noise reduction up to 25dB. Combined with the powerful 10mm dynamic driver, which generates accurate anti-noise sound signals, the WG-1 ANC earbuds are ready to bring the tranquility and purity to your favorite soundtracks.  No matter whether you are sitting in the crowded metro, eating in a noisy restaurant, or resting on a plane, you can enjoy pure crystal clear music whenever you like.\n",
      "Moreover, the WG-1 allows you to personalize the ANC effect according to your personal needs. You can effortlessly switch between the ambient sound control mode and the pure cancellation mode with a simple touch of the panel.\n",
      "Many TWS face difficulties in finding the best balance point between sound quality and portability. This becomes a further more difficult task if the TWS tries to incorporate the ANC feature. Our solution to this problem was to utilize the same Hi-Fi dynamic driver that is often used in Custom In-Ear Monitors (CIEM) for the WG-1 ANC true wireless earbuds. CIEMs are popular among the world’s greatest musicians for their precise audio reproduction that delivers accurate monitor playback, which is often needed for stage performances.\n",
      "We have tuned our 10mm dynamic drivers meticulously so that the WG-1 can produce the entire sound frequency range, from the deep pounding sub-bass to the crystal clear high notes. The tuning of the drivers aims to bring a balanced sound signature that allows the listeners to enjoy every aspect of the sound range equally and proportionally. Thanks to the BES2300zp chipset, the WG-1 supports playback up to 20kHz, starting as low as 20Hz.  From the subtleties of instruments to a bare whispered solo, capturing all of the details hidden in a music track has never been easier.\n",
      "Currently, most of the chipsets on the market either have to give up the ANC feature or sacrifice the acoustic performance. There are only a few chipsets that can support active noise cancelation while delivering lossless sound quality. Of them, the BES2300zp is the latest and the best. Built with this BES2300zp chipset, the WG-1 supports both ANC and AAC/SBC codecs to achieve lossless sound quality and seamless audio transmission. Not only has your music never sounded this good before, but now you can enjoy your movies and games with sync rivaling even wired earphones.\n",
      "The latest Bluetooth 5.0 chip is embedded in the WG-1 to provide a stable and reliable connection hour after hour of high-quality wireless streaming. Additionally, the chipset utilizes the Low Band Bluetooth Retransmission Technology (LBRT) to better ensure the synchronization between the two earbuds, so as to offer a seamless music listening experience. Most importantly, the WG-1 also syncs perfectly with what you see on your phone’s/tablet’s screen for latency-free media enjoyment. Put on the WG-1, you will never skip a beat of your favorite songs.\n",
      "With smart touch gestures, the WG-1 puts the music and call controls right at your fingertips. After the first successful connection, both earbuds will automatically connect to the last connected device when they are powered on. Through simple gestures, your music is at your command!\n",
      "Water Resistance\n",
      "The WG-1 is certified IPX5 water-resistant to ensure it works functionally in sweat and light rain. It is your perfect companion wherever you go, whatever terrain it may be! Don’t let a little rain or splash worry you anymore.\n",
      "Embedded Microphone, Hands-free Talking\n",
      "Enjoy the hands-free calling with the WG-1 wherever you are! Whether it’s an online meeting or a calling on the way, we have got you covered!\n",
      "Battery Life\n",
      "The WG-1 comes with a handy magnetic charging case embedded with a 400mA battery.  You can enjoy a tangle-free wireless experience for 3-4 hours within one charge.\n",

Full of laughs and a real ‘coming of age’ story with the Villa amazing season the backdrop. The book has to date sold over 35,000 copies. It is really based on me (a season ticket holder in the Trinity for the last 40 seasons) and has proved very popular with Villa fans of a similar age.\n",
      "In 2020, just before Covid, I was approached by a Birmingham film producer to turn the book into a movie. Things have snowballed since, with a number of Villa celebrity fans now lined up for parts, screenplay being written by a Villa fan and some key investors lined up. You can find out more about it at Just14TheMovie.com.\n",
      "We are looking to create a feelgood film that is a blend of ‘Fever Pitch’ and ‘Adrian Mole’ with a blend of ‘Gregory’s Girl’. It won't just be a football film but will be very much a 'Coming of Age' comedy. It'll have romance, bullying, local football rivalries and tearjerkers along the way. Obviously the ending at Highbury is euphoric, oh dear spoiler alert.\n",
      "We have a number of high profile investors lined up as well as famous actors (many with a Villa connection), but these investments take time and we don't want to lose the energy this project currently has.

      " Ralph:  A 70-year-old Jewish man born and raised in the heart of New York City. He can be described as a smart ass, to say the least. While Stoic and wise, he can be condescending at times, however, this is usually to humor a situation for his own entertainment. Ralph is a Vietnam war veteran and while he is proud to have served this country, he is deeply troubled by Patrick's view that there is more honor in fighting for a flag than there is in fighting for the things/people you love.\n",
      "Patrick:  A 70-year-old Irish/Catholic man. He has a rough exterior and uses it as a brick wall. His wits aren't near as strong as Ralph's, which causes him to be quite defensive, lighting a quick fuse to anything that might come off as slightly belittling him. Patrick dreads sharing the same room as Ralph and beyond anything, hates the thought of spending his final years in a nursing home. For that matter, hates the fact that he's even in a time block considered his \"final years\". Underneath his thick skin, is a kind and understanding individual who believes in doing the right thing.\n",
      "Vince: In addition to being the embodiment of the Travis Bickle archetype through and through, Vince is one of the staff members of the nursing home. To a passerby, he resembles something of a backwoods lone wolf. There is and always has been a fire deep down in his heart that comes out through his piercing yet wirey gaze and minister-like pattern of speech...that fire being...Tapioca Pudding. The nursing facility is home to a state-of-the-art pudding supply room with enough of every flavor to last someone years.  The residents are just roadblocks in Vince's hunger. His mantra is “To be in control of the supply room, by any means necessary.”\n",
      "Carroll: The kind-hearted receptionist who is the life of this rather dull environment. While she is someone the residents are drawn to for her friendliness, this truly stems from her control over the pudding room.  When Vince sets out on his mission to assume dominance over this sacred room, Carroll just becomes a chess pawn in his devastating and morbid attempt to seize the room for himself. \n",

Depeche Mode’s Dave Gahan, Martin Gore, and Julian Casablanca from The Strokes have voiced their admiration for Sune’s work, and luminaries such as Little Steven and Johnny Marr(The Smiths) claim to be longtime fans. In December 2014, Sune scored his first commercial no.1 hit in Germany, having co-written “Blue Heart” for contestant Charley Ann Schmutzler, for the popular TV show ‘The Voice’. He recently co-wrote and co-produced an album for Danish platinum singer-songwriter, Mads Langer, released on Sony Music and produced Danish artist Carl Emil’s record on Universal Music, Denmark. Sune’s success and versatility as a songwriter is perhaps even more evident when considering the vast number of creative syncs under his name. Over the last two decades, he has generated millions of dollars from syncs alone. His songs feature regularly on TV shows, commercials, and film soundtracks. The list includes leading brands such as Jim Beam, Lego, Toyota, Converse, Corona, Nationwide, Lacoste, The Gap, and Tumi. Hit shows like The OC, CSI, True Blood, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, and Lucifer have featured tracks penned by the prolific songwriter and producer who also wrote and recorded a track for the hugely popular video game \"Batman: Arkham City\". Films such as “Still Alice”, “Molly’s Game”, “Whip It”, “Drive Angry”, “Trick ‘r Treat”, “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playground”, “American Honey” stand out amongst his long list of sync coups. “The Christmas Song” written in 2008 remains one of Sune’s most successful works, it continues to feature in countless Christmas compilations and television commercials every year and was used in the opening scene of silver screen modern classic “Christmas With The Kranks”. Sune has also achieved indie chart success as a producer/mixer. ‘Too True’ by Dum Dum Girls, is a collaboration with legendary songwriter and Blondie producer, Richard Gottehrer. The album reached no.1 on the CMJ charts and remained at the top spot for 4 consecutive weeks.  While Sune continues to consolidate his legacy as a songwriter and producer, present and future projects see him expanding into the world of film. He scored his first feature film \"A War\", which was nominated for an Oscar in 2016. His success in the field has led to big-name projects such as the music production/orchestration for season 6’s \"Game Of Thrones\" trailer. Further industry recognition followed as the track “Recharge and Revolt”, which featured on the award-winning British drama “American Honey” picked up “Best Individual Sync” at the 2017 Music Week Awards.

      "UPDATE: This project has reached its minimum funding goal - a grateful thanks to my backers! There is still time for other interested participants to get involved!\n",
      "Digital camera - $600. \n",
      "Plane ticket to Kuwait - $1500. \n",
      "Body Armor and Kevlar helmet - $1800. \n",
      "Embedding alongside US soldiers at war in Iraq - Priceless. \n",
      "But...printing a full-color book documenting this time in Iraq, and telling and showing the stories of those soldiers - About as expensive as all combined. \n",
      "\"Can't Give This War Away: Three Iraqi Summers of Change and Conflict\" will be a book of photos and essays that document my trips to Iraq from 2007 to 2009. \n",
      "In other forms, this work has appeared in daily newpapers across the country, such as the Buffalo News, Bakersfield, Ca. Californian, Worcester, Ma. Telegram, and many others. The photographs have been displayed in museums and other venues.\n",
      "Publication of this book will enable me to contact agents and publishers with a visual introduction to my work, as I continue working toward full publication of a much longer manuscript. However, in the short term, \"Can't Give This War Away\" will provide a colorful and dramatically visual presentation of soldiers in Iraq, in up-close and personal photography rarely seen in newspapers and other media outlets. \n",
      "Funding rewards will bring this book to my Kickstarter supporters, in several different forms. In a short-run publication, photo books are expensive to produce - but can still be the high-quality equal of any coffee table art book purchased in a book store. \n",
      "The funding received through Kickstarter will enable me to do the following: \n",
      "1. Produce approximately 50-60 paperback copies of approx. 120 pages, in 8x10 landscape format, on high-quality glossy paper. \n",
      "2. Promote my work in a professional and visually compelling style. Most will go to agents and publishers for promotional use, while I continue working on the full manuscript. \n",
      "3. Bring my photos to published life, most for the first time. For many of the photos, this will be the first and only time they are published. Even if published by a major publisher, it's doubtful that as many photos would be used as I will be able to include in this edition. \n",
      "4. Through copies earned by funding rewards, bring copies of this work to a small, but hopefully growing, audience. Supporters will have access to different levels of printing quality - but the work and photo quality wil always be the same high quality! \n",
      "For those helping to fund this project through Kickstarter, several editions of this book will be produced, as noted in the list of funding rewards: \n",
      "A PDF version that I email to funders. This will include all the written and photographic content, and would be printable by the recipient. \n",
      "A \"basic edition\" of approximately 80 pages, printed in 7x7 paperback format. This would not include all of the photographs or text (but you would get the PDF with all content). \n",
      "A \"deluxe edition\" of approx. 120 pages, as noted above. \n",
      "For funders at the higher end of support, some versions of the book will be printed in hardcover, with photographs included that are unique to that single edition. Other rewards will include signed prints of various photographs, printed thanks within the book, and in some cases, unique \"thank you\" pages actually printed within the book itself. \n",
      "Because of the short-run printing costs, only at the $75 funding level is it feasible to provide a printed copy of the actual \"deluxe edition.\" This, however, will enable me to use your funding support to produce the \"deluxe\" copies for my own promotional use, and hopefully your support will eventually bring the stories and photos to a larger audience. All I can say is that if the full book was ever published in a truly professional form, I would not forget any of the Kickstarter funders that helped me get that far; I'd like to think you'd hear from me again! \n",
      "Funding at the lower levels means you still get a PDF copy of the work, or even a signed print of one of the museum-quality photographs. And at any level of funding, you have my thanks! The hard part of this work is finished! I already went to Iraq, already took these pictures, and already wrote most of the content. My funding goal will enable me to transform already-existing rough product into a professional, finished form. I anticipate printing these copies and rewarding funders within 90 days of successful funding. That's not a promise, but it is an expectation.\n",
      "Examples of my work are not hard to find; I hope they give me credibility to earn your support. \n",
      "Finally, through this work, you are supporting a visual and written record of soldiers at war. As the United States prepares to depart Iraq, it might be hard to remember that our national committment there is nearly 10 years long - more than 20 years, if you date back to 1991's Desert Storm. \n",
      "When soldiers return from overseas, they take off their uniform and blend back into society; maybe it will be hard to remember what these men and women looked like when they were young and at war in a place very far from home. I hope these photographs and stories help an audience appreciate and understand what it looked and felt like during these three summers in Iraq where the temperature rarely dipped below 125 degrees and a stubborn enemy rarely stood and fought. \n",
      "It was not a good place to be, but for a good chunk of their youth it's a place these soldiers chose to be, on behalf of their country and all of us. But even though we're leaving Iraq, and think we've handed control back over to the citizens of that country, we can't wash our hands of it; we might think we can, but we can't give this war away.\n",

      "--------2054706999/blue-grass-grounds-restoring-americas-prairies------\n",
      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "This will enable me to convert my 200 acres of Kentucky farmland from agricultural uses back to a diverse ecosystem of natural native grasslands.\n",
      "Kentucky, like other Midwestern states, was once covered by millions of acres of native grasslands. The prairie ecosystem is now one of the rarest plant communities in North America, and few natural ecosystems have been so thoroughly destroyed by human land-use practices. Before modern settlement in the early 1800s, the biologically rich ecosystem of the North American midwest grasslands was comparable in numbers of wildlife to the African Savanna. It would have been a beautiful sight much like the Great Serengeti.\n",
      "We can not return the midwest prairie to its former glory but we can return a portion of it in a way that benefits us all.\n",
      "How?\n",
      "By combining the synergistic effect of a large carbon sink, preserving natural habitat, reducing machinery, fuel, and fertilizer use as well as increasing the numbers of endangered insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals that thrive in large scale grasslands.\n",
      "My mission is a conservation effort to restore grasslands (Prairie) starting with my farms in Kentucky as a proof of concept. Then, expanding outward by leasing and establishing prairie on private lands. The plan is to strategically link prairie lands to create a continuous migration path for birds, insects, and small mammals while also capturing carbon from the air and putting it back into the soil.\n",
      "We can make this happen with the use of crowdfunding to rent private land and employ farmers to plant, care for, and maintain a portion of their former crop ground as a permanent natural prairie.\n",
      "It takes decades to establish a forest. We will be able to establish a diverse grassland ecosystem in 2 or 3 years and start the process of transforming the soil's microbiome back to its natural condition. This will be possible by utilizing farmers that have a love for the land, who are already in place, and who already have all the required equipment and knowledge.\n",
      "With all these factors in place, this plan is immediately scalable.\n",
      "Most current farmland in privately held hands is held as an investment. Those landowners consist of family farms, corporate farms, institutional investors, hedge funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and some wealthy foreign investors. If you invest in mutual funds or a 401 K-style retirement account, you probably own some land inside those investments. And as an Investor, you expect a return.\n",
      "So when a farmer leases land to grow crops, that farmer is expected to rent it all year every year, even if some portion of the land is of marginal production value, or the investor will find another farmer that will. So in some cases, crops are grown on land that is a guaranteed loss to keep the other land under a lease that is the most profitable. In some years crop futures predict that farmers will lose money and “burn equity” before they even plant the first seed.\n",
      "You might think some farmers would just take the year off instead of working for nothing. But ‘Farmer A’ has to lease all the ground and plant it anyway or the investor will give it to ‘Farmer B’ and now ‘Farmer A’ is out of luck next year when prices increase and profitability returns. Therefore, American farmers generally overproduce crops.\n",
      "As a farmer myself, I have attended many educational seminars to get better and better at the craft and try to find an advantage to compete. It is the entrepreneurial spirit that drives us to get more efficient and produce more with less. So we all strive for excellence and overproduce. In essence, we are running ourselves out of business.\n",
      "We are taxing our natural resources in the process and making less and less profit. The one benefit, and it is a big one, is that food is cheap in the USA. I say all this to explain that land use is complicated and I do not want to hurt farmers by pulling large amounts of profitable land out of production.\n",
      "I want to help them by giving them the means to earn income by working the land they already use and letting the farmer and the investor decide what portion of the land to conserve and what land to plant crops on while paying them a price equal to what they would make from the normal agricultural crop lease.\n",
      "In the 1989 movie, Field of Dreams, The character played by Kevin Costner converted a portion of his crop ground into a baseball field. He had a vision that drove him, at great financial risk, to build this sports complex in the middle of his highly productive cropland. This fantasy worked out and the movie was a box office success.\n",
      "I have a similar vision, but, instead of drawing in ghost baseball players, I believe we will see a resurgence of wildlife. Starting with beneficial insects, endangered pollinators like the Monarch Butterfly, Bumble Bee, wild Honey Bees, etc.\n",
      "Then the amphibians, reptiles, small and large mammals, etc. Conservationists can assist in quickly reestablishing animal life, but most species will come back on their own if we rebuild an ecosystem where they can thrive.\n",
      "But what if some disaster creates a food shortage with all this land tied up in conservation?\n",
      "Although it’s probably not likely due to the increasing efficiency of American agriculture, in an emergency, some of this land could be returned to agriculture instantly and it would produce abundantly due to the beneficial rebalance of the soil microbiome. All of that carbon our grass is pulling out of the atmosphere and then depositing into the soil is free fertilizer.\n",
      "Once the emergency is over, the grassland could be replanted or planted elsewhere. That is one of the limitations of forestry land and why many landowners don’t commit to growing trees. The commitment is nearly a lifetime, and the conversion can actually hurt the value of their real estate investment.\n",
      "Interesting Facts And Questions Answered...\n",
      "Benefits of warm-season grasses and orbs compared to typical lawn grass.\n",
      "Root depths are only as deep as the grass is tall. Cool-season lawn grasses only penetrate a few inches into the soil and therefore cannot push carbon any deeper. Like trees, warm-season grass can drive 6 feet into the ground allowing more space to store captured carbon.\n",
      "The Carbon Cycle.\n",
      "We are carbon-based life forms. All life is carbon-based. Most of the Earth's carbon is stored in the ground. We are pulling unnaturally large amounts of carbon out of the ground and disbursing it into the atmosphere. We have to do everything we can to put it back into the ground.\n",
      "Aren't crops plants?\n",
      "They cycle carbon through the roots like other plants but don’t put a net positive into the ground. Crops put carbon into the food we harvest. We eat it and our bodies disperse much of it into the atmosphere. Or in the case of biofuels, they go in a gas tank, and carbon is released from the exhaust.\n",
      "Fun fact!\n",
      "Cows and other ruminants add methane to the atmosphere but cows do get a bad rap. First of all, cows do not fart. They burp. All animals that eat food release carbon. Should we condemn animals that exist to feed humans? Humans also maintain pets purely for pleasure which contributes to the carbon cycle. If we add up all the pets on the planet, including large pleasure animals like horses, would it exceed the impact of cattle?\n",
      "Nothing against pets. I have pets. I’m not sure I would want to live in a world without cats and dogs. But for about the same cost of maintaining a pet, you can join me and grow and maintain an acre of grassland where you will be sustaining homes for thousands of wild pets!\n",
      "Why Am I On This Mission?\n",
      "One day my 22-year-old son expressed his dismay at the current trajectory we are on with climate change and told me that he was thinking he probably should not have children so they would not have to endure the disastrous future that lies ahead. I tried to explain that there are lots of reasons why that may not be the case and that it pays to be optimistic about the future but I was not able to see any supporting evidence.\n",
      "He was able to show me plenty to the contrary. So I have decided that I have to do something. If the rest of his generation has a similar belief, we are headed for trouble. So I must take action.\n",
      "The man in the middle is me.\n",
      "I am a retired Air Force C130 Pilot. Currently, I work for the United Parcel Service (UPS). However, when asked about my occupation, I say I am a farmer. Farming is my real passion.\n",
      "A Bit About My Background\n",
      "I developed a love for the land growing up in rural Shelby County, Kentucky. My family were part-time tobacco farmers and many of my extended family had farms that I would visit and help out. One of my aunt and uncle ran a dairy operation and another had beef cows, but as was common at the time everyone had a tobacco crop. Regardless of what one thinks of the tobacco industry,(there is plenty not to like) it provided many Kentucky farm families with much-needed extra cash.\n",
      "It was a true family business. About 3 times per year it was all hands on deck to plant, harvest, and process the crop. Everything had to be done by hand as there is very little mechanization for any part of the process. It brought families close together and often neighbors helped each other which made for some tight-knit communities. Tobacco and dairy are all but gone now, but I have kept a love of the outdoors and an interest in sustainable agriculture.\n",
      "I purchased a run-down farm in 2014 and began investing heavily in the renovation of the land to return fertility to the soil and build out an infrastructure that would be safe for my family to operate. It had to be positive for the environment and wildlife. These efforts were recognized by my local conservation district. I humbly accepted the title of Master Conservationist in 2017 and later that year my efforts were recognized by the Kentucky Association of Conservation Districts as the runner-up Outstanding Conservation Cooperator of the Year.\n",
      "The work did not stop! I continued to improve my land and recently acquired the family farm purchased by my great grandfather in 1917. It’s a special place for me, but, rather than continue an intensive farming operation, my goal is to dedicate it to conservation.\n",
      "I have been experimenting with warm-season native grasses on my farms for about 6 years.\n",
      "Starting with a pure stand of Eastern Gamma Grass that has been established for about 5 years now and a more natural mixture of Big BlueStem, Little BlueStem, SideOats Grama, and native wildflowers such as Partridge Pea, Purple ConeFlower, Black-Eyed Susan, Illinois BundleFlower, Lance-Leaved Coreopsis, Lemon mint, Wild Blue Lupine, Gray-headed Coneflower, and Milkweed.\n",
      "All seeds are sourced from a company that specializes in heritage seeds harvested locally from ancient stands to ensure the integrity of the claim to establishing Native Grasslands. It's very expensive and labor-intensive to establish so I only have a few small plots at this time but hope to grow exponentially with this new effort.\n",
      "The hope is that it continues beyond my land because of the realization that it will take a massive effort to make a lasting change to the trajectory we are on with climate change. If we can piece together thousands of acres of native grasslands, we can make a difference and maybe it will be contagious and others will try to do the same.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "There are no risks involved with my restoration mission. One challenge, however, is to create enough interest with fellow conservationists who see the urgency of climate change. Another challenge is filling all 200 openings. This is the crucial start to a mission that I feel will be a major success. A mission that is immediately scaleable.\n",

They grew up together in Lawrence, Kansas one illustrating and the other cooking and both obsessed with stationary and nice pens. You Can Cook Anything is a celebration of friendship across time and space with a collector's twist. Each pack of recipe-postcards contains seven recipe postcards and a cover card, all with unique illustrations. We invite you join our correspondence and send and receive these postcards with your pen pals, lovers, rivals, family, and friends. Try and collect them all as we expand the collection of recipes and introduce guest chefs, shiny postcards, golden tickets, and more. @youcancookliterallyanything\n",

      "Each postcard has an illustration of a connoisseur caught in a moment we imagine you might find yourself in after cooking these recipes. The intention of these postcards is to share this universe in order to fortify our own with more beauty, care, and possibility— and maybe, even as importantly, good food fuels.\n",
      "You funds matter because we want to make more postcards. This project (albeit an incredible amount of fun) takes time and resources. We have already spent lots of time illustrating, imagining, designing, developing, connecting, researching, packaging, printing.

Throughout the month of June we’ll be finalizing the details of custom stamps for our packaging, finishing touches on our postcard designs and tweaks for our recipes. Should we meet our fundraising goal, all rewards will be distributed in the month of July.

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "In 2007, Nigel and Julia Gant discovered a mutual passion for history, and they decided to teach history through social customs, manners, and FOOD.  In order to realize this passion, they designed a field kitchen, with reproduction kitchenalia as historically accurate as possible!  They discovered there was very little information available, from how to design a hot box, to the recipes available.  Thousands of research hours were undertaken, including field trips throughout the UK and the USA,  to artisan craftsmen for the kit needed to create food authentically, trips to libraries to copy out recipes from manuscripts of the time, then translating, and modernizing the recipes.  From this was born 4 and 20 Blackbirds.  This group presented fashionable foods of the past 700 years researched from original manuscripts, created with authentic methods, demonstrated by accurately costumed re-enactors in various events in stately homes, palaces and fields travelling through England, Wales and parts of Europe covering the Saxons to World War 2!\n",
      "Enough never being sufficient, Julia had a dream of passing on the legacy that 4 and 20 Blackbirds had begun, by writing a book that could be used as a handbook for setting up a medieval field kitchen (which we used for foods up to the 19th century) , including successes and pitfalls, menus, foods of the era, and fifty of our best recipes taken from the early writings, and converted to use either on wood fires in a camp, or in a modern kitchen.  Suggestions for things ranging from shopping, to hygiene and safety are included.  In short this was to make it possible for someone to recreate a bit of history, on a camp or in a kitchen...whether one dish, or an entire medieval feast.\n",
      "If this was still insufficient, she decided to create a whimsical cookbook based on multi period recipes with the time travelling narrator  Heartsfelled , the narrator of a short film to be released soon, with a true epicurean flavour, and an interesting take on how recipes were created.  It is a true bit of whimsy, but the small collection of recipes are truly our favourites, from Chocolate Port, to Andalusian Lamb.  These span 700 years and are delicious.\n",
      "in 2019 , twelve years after we began, we began to feel our age, particularly with erecting and dropping 6 canvas tents, lugging 50 litre cauldrons, etc., so in the spirit of good stewardship, we sold off all of our Medieval through Elizabethan eras kit.  We didn't realize at that time that Nigel had aggressive cancer, and would have only 15 months left to live!  His final acts were to complete the first book, \"A Tasty Dish\" which is the medieval cookbook, and to revise \"Heartsfelled's Favourites\", the romp through the kitchens of the ages.  This became a sacred trust to finish these two books, and make them available as we had originally planned, to people who had an interest, nay, a passion.  Nigel died November 2020, in the second lockdown, attended by those who loved him, and with the promise to finish our project and fulfill his final dream.\n",
      "The books are completed, edited, and ready to go to the printers.  All they require is a modest sum to print, and ship, and we hope to have them printed and ready to go within a month of the campaign's end.\n",
      "Thank you for reading our story, and we hope you will love trying Pears in Red Wine, Pumpes(meatballs) Chocolate Port, Syllabub, and many other delicious recipes!\n",

      "Getting children to take medication especially when you are young is a tough task for all parents. Educating your child about what their medication is treating and how it makes them feel better is the first task to accomplish for a life time of better health. Being different at an early age can cause a child to feel left out or embarrassed, then top that off with medication that is obvious to everyone when they see you use it. Being aware that you are not the only one who takes medication brings those children together and opens a door of compassion to those children who do not take medication. Asthma is treated with inhaled medication and exercise induced asthma needs a bronchial dilator spray to help children to run and play at home or at school. This book shows that taking your medication and playing with your friends is a lot better than not taking your medication and not playing. I am raising funds to get my book published, the illustrations are done by Blake Morgan who did a fantastic job with water color pencils and it has been edited by Jonatha Elenburg so it's ready to go and I need help for the last step. Thanks for all your support now and possibly when the book is out and available for purchase. Thanks, Cindi Hoiness\n",

      "Jeliel, an angel who walks the streets of his city sending to the other side the souls of those who have just died, decides to experience humanity through the love offered to him by Güendalina, a girl who decides to stay with Jeliel to keep him company. Or at least that's what they will try, since a demonic entity will visit our plane to claim her.\n",
      "Who will love THE ETERNAL CITY?\n",
      "THE ETERNAL CITY is a comic that tells us how love gives meaning to our existence and that, no matter how eternal our struggles may be, life is about living in the moment. If you enjoyed Neil Gaiman’s DEATH: THE HIGH COST OF LIVING and CONSTANTINE, this story is ideal for you.\n",
      "What you get by Backing\n",
      "THE ETERNAL CITY (part 1 of 2) is a 23 pages comic (plus sketches and extra material) that will be delivered to you by e-mail in PDF format and depending on how much you want to support this work, it can also come with the additional short comic EMPTINESS, wallpapers in different formats for your devices, a full color digital portrait of yourself, or a digital commission of your character of choice also in full color.\n",
      "The Author\n",
      "SERGIO CARRERA is an Argentine comic author (writer, penciler, inker and colorist) who has worked for the American publishers DC Comics, Image Comics, Boom Studios and IDW Publishing. He has also collaborated in several issues of VIVA magazine of Clarín newspaper and has worked in the art of albums of Argentine musicians such as Zolvein Vixon, Psycho Side and the British Anthony Mullen. Currently, in addition to working for the French market, he has taken his first steps in the Spanish comic publishing together with the novelist Claudio Cerdán their first joint work: Toxic Detective, a police graphic novel that has conquered the specialized critics.\n",
      "MICHAEL HOFFERT JR. has lettered comic books as “Hallowed” and “Gumbo” and “Identity Stunt II” as well as every comic book he’s written. He’s currently working on his own mini-series “Postage Due” and lives just outside of Buffalo, NY with this wife and daughter.\n",
      "Funds are for…\n",
      "The funds raised will be used to allow the authors to live on the time it takes to draw, color, and letter the comic. As you can see in the images published here, part of the work is already done, so the total work will be finished in 45 days and immediately sent to all the backers.\n",
      "The author's idea is to be able to enjoy continuing to develop comics in the most personal and independent way and it is with the support of all of you that he will be able to finance this goal. And for that, we thank you very much!\n",
      "Images of what you can enjoy if you also want to receive the EMPTINESS comic:\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Since this is a digital project, which therefore will not need printing or distribution, and since I am the only artist involved, I don't need a big budget and I can guarantee that every step of the realization is already organized and follows all its course as planned. The delivery of the work on the agreed date is guaranteed!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Masaleydaar (adjective); meaning: flavorful. \n",
      "Masaleydaar explores the dozens of classic Indian spice-blends that shape its complex regional flavors. This cookbook will capture regional Indian spice blends from across its 28 states and 8 union territories in one amazing cookbook. \n",
      " Maseleydaar includes both: the recipes for spice-blend and for regional dishes that use them. It is one part ambitious, two parts exciting, and will be one cookbook to stand as the ultimate, 'holy grail' of Indian spice-blends.\n",
      "Indian spice blends are multipurpose work-horses that use locally preferred ingredients to enhance the flavor profiles of dishes.\n",
      "Every region has its own iconic spice blends shaped by local climate, community profile, and dietary needs. Some blends include only a handful of spices, others use a dozen or more. While many are in powdered form, there are dozens of spice pastes as well. Whether they are dish-specific or for multi-purpose use – they are considered pantry staples. From Bafad or Bottle Masala of the Anglo Indians, Vaduvam of Pondicherry, Kashaundi of Bengal, Vaer of Kashmir and countless others that are far more complex that even the best known garam masala. Many serve as a separate layer in addition to or in place of garam masala.\n",
      "As a very large collective, these blends represent India's vast gastronomic diversity. They open the doors to culinary creativity, and make a practical addition to ones' culinary repertoire. In comparison, any store-bought garam masala, no matter the brand, represents a sliver of flavors.\n",
      "For as long as I can remember, my mother has made her own powdered spices and spice blends. As a child, I learned to winnow ingredients to separate dust from the spices, sitting in the late afternoon sun to clean the spices, and even being quarantined indoors when three varieties of dried hot chilies were being pounded to make my moms’ particular blend of cayenne pepper. For decades, mom would make large batches for our kitchen, for friends and family.\n",
      "Ten years ago, my mom started teaching me how to make her spice blends. That first year we even had our little spice blends on consignment in a local store :) Passing the ‘pestle’, so to speak.\n",
      "In the two decades that I've been teaching Indian cooking to others, and writing cookbooks, I recognize that recipes to classic spice blends that shape our iconic cuisine are fading. Many are inaccessible because no one has written them all down, or they are only passed down verbally from one generation to another, and therefore never experienced outside home kitchens.\n",
      "Just like ours, recipes for classic Indian spice blends are often passed down through the women in a family. However, there is no one repository for spice-blends or traditions. Masaleydaar hopes to change that.\n",
      "India includes 28 states and 8 union territories. Even if Masaleydaar included only one spice blend recipe from each of India's 28 states and 8 union territory, the book would have too many recipes to start. Additionally most states have 3-5 unique gastronomic regions. Including all representatives will be nearly impossible in the trim version of Masaleydaar.\n",
      "To keep this book manageable, I will carefully select recipes from across the country based on three aspects:\n",
      "With an initial funding goal, $8000, the book will include 48 recipes (24+24), broken down as follows:\n",
      "The success of this campaign will determine the ultimate scale and scope of the collection of recipes included in Masaleydaar.\n",
      "I am sharing stretch goals, so you can envision Masaleydaar's vast potential. In order to explore more spices and blends, Masaleydaar can be expanded with each stretch goal.\n",
      "I am unbelievably excited to begin working on Masaleydaar, a project that has been on my mind for more than two decades – ever since I entered the food space. I thank you for all your support through the years and hope we continue making great cookbooks together.\n",
      "Please feel free to reach out and ask questions. I am looking forward to a mighty Masaleydaar year ahead!\n",
      "Best wishes,\n",

      "Supplemental reading/articles that I have written discussing regional spice-blends\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Logistics & Budgeting:\n",
      "Each spice blend recipe requires its own testing and photography, and then another round for the dish that uses the spice blend. The funding structure is a projected estimate to produce a 6” X 9” color soft-bound cookbook. The skinniest version of this book will likely be 0.75” thick and weigh about 1 lb.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do all my own writing, food photography, graphic design, and indexing, while my husband edits and converts each book into an eBook in exchange for the picture-plate dishes. If delegated to a third-party entity like a book-designer, eBook producer etc, each would cost the project several thousand dollars. For instance, a indexing a single cookbook costs on average $4000+ (after doing it all for six cookbooks, I am not looking to outsource anything). \n",
      "\n",
      "By doing it all in-house, I pass on the savings to you, the backer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I can’t do everything. As a small business myself, I am a big proponent of supporting small businesses, and rely on a long-time local vendor to print the book. They have worked with me on all previous books and respect my expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also use the local USPS postal services for shipping. USPS has further increased prices for 2022, and even a Priority Mail envelope, domestic, will now cost more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides USPS, our printer has also mentioned higher printing costs since early 2021. In general, costs have increased across the board. I can only use my best guess to determine how much this project will cost. \n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations:\n",
      "This is my 8th Kickstarter campaign. Of prior campaigns, only two were relaunched for the same project (same project, smaller product, trim funding goals). Eventually, all projects were successful. To the best of my knowledge, 99.9% of the backers were happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we meet or exceed our campaign goal, Masaleydaar would be my SEVENTH cookbook produced entirely through crowdfunding. I am familiar with the pieces of it: the good and bad of a crowdfunding campaign. While 95% of my crowdfunding and production experience has been positive and without hiccups, I know to leave a margin of 5% for unplanned events.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Things you should know:\n",
      "Generalized Delay: \n",
      "While I have written, photographed, designed, and shipped cookbooks in as little as 8 months (Crack the Code), as the only person who does the bulk of the work, it is hard on the production quality and is not feasible overall. Additionally, the pandemic has made most schedules moot. I can only project a timeline and do my best to adhere to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Missed Communications: \n",
      "Please use a personal email on your Kickstarter account because work-based email addresses are not reliable in the long term. Please adjust your messaging settings (I cannot do it for your account) if you wish to receive fewer project updates. Long-time backers know that I use the project updates to routinely communicate with campaign backers. Some may be pledge-level-specific, others may be public or for all campaign backers. Project updates are typically once a month after the project is funded, and once every two weeks when the book is nearing completion and about to be shipped/e-delivered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital Rewards: \n",
      "Due to copyright restrictions, I am unable to provide pdf’s of the book to any backer at any time. Only two versions of eBooks are available – iBook (Apple devices) and GooglePlay (Android devices). GooglePlay books REQUIRE a _____@gmail.com address. Please update your profile while pledging. Also, please confirm your device compatibility and regional permissions compatibility before pledging. Kindle books are not available. eBooks are not available to backers in China. Project updates will provide a timeline for a one-time use, digital redemption, with an expiry date.  Digital rewards once distributed will not be re-assigned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic Shipping: \n",
      "As I only ship using USPS through Priority Mail, the tracking numbers are provided if the books are not received within 2 weeks of the shipping-specific project update. \n",
      "\n",
      "International Shipping: \n",
      "While I cannot offer guarantees on international delivery times as the tracking is not applicable after it leaves US soil, I send out the Customs’ Slip to international backers so that they too can keep a lookout for it. Across six campaigns and 30+ countries, the postal service has lost two books, one was never delivered in China, and another because the Australian backer moved and missed giving a forwarding address.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add-ons: \n",
      "Spice-kits (advents, samplers) are only available to backers in the domestic USA. Due to customs restrictions these are not available to international backers. My apologies – I wish I had a better solution to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third-Party Service: \n",
      "For what it is worth, I do not, and have never used a third-party service to fulfill rewards. I don't intend to do that for this campaign either. While third-party services would free up my time, it would also require me to inflate the funding goals over and above budgeting for Kickstarter and shipping. A third-party service also makes room for errors. As there isn’t a production facility or a staff that will handle all the pieces, I hope backers extend their patience during production and later during fulfillment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Solicitation: \n",
      "Please do not contact me to offer services. In the past I have reported the individual or company that solicits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that backers recognize that overall success requires a fair measure of being pragmatic and respectful about roles and expectations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Please reach out for any clarifications.\n",

      "For decades, I have always been very passionate about cooking, from delicious food and desserts from here in Mexico to even international ones. My years of experience back me up, as well as the almost 4,000 followers in my official Facebook group which you can find a link to at the end in the contacts section.\n",
      "My motivation to do this began in 2016, after having to deal with many hardships, I had two surgeries, one of them for a tumor and the other for thyroid cancer. Thankfully, after many months of struggle, I overcame it and now I'm moving forward. My love for my family and determination to fulfill my dreams are what made me come through this stronger than ever.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "Mi motivación de hacer el libro empezó en 2016, luego de experiencias difíciles, tuve dos cirugías, una por un tumor y la otra por cancer de tiroides. Gracias a Dios, después de meses de lucha, logré superar ésta etapa. Mi amor por mi familia y determinación de hacer mi sueño una realidad son las cosas que me hicieron más fuerte que nunca.\n",
      "After these events, I decided to make an attempt to create my own cookbooks to share my recipes with everyone, delicious all-natural and authentic Mexican food and desserts, I always prepare my food with love for my family and friends and I want to share part of that love to the world through my recipes, from the bottom of my heart.\n",
      "Thanks to wonderful people in Kickstarter I was able to already make 4 VOLUMES and now, I'm ready to make the 5th! With the special little twist of dedicating it to desserts <3\n",

      "Luego de estos eventos, he decidido intentar hacer mis propios libros de cocina para compartir mis recetas con todos, deliciosas, 100% natural, y auténtica comida y postres mexicanos. Yo siempre preparo mi comida con amor para mi familia y amigos y quiero compartir un poco de ese amor con el mundo a través de mis recetas desde el fondo de mi corazón.\n",

      "Pero eso no es todo! Mi conocimiento no solo está limitado a comida y postres mexicanos, igual compartiré contigo recetas increíbles de otros países!\n",
      "The main goal is mostly to spread these recipes to the world, share with everyone the beautiful and delicious variety of dishes and desserts that exists in Mexico. My love for the culinary art and cooking is big and what I do I do it for love.\n",
      "The goal is mostly to cover shipping and production expenses, I do this because I love it.\n",
      "Anything I receive over the goal will be mostly to continue doing this, make further volumes and maybe even YouTube videos.\n",

      "Mi cantidad objetivo es más que nada para cubrir costos de envío y producción, lo hago porque lo amo.\n",
      "Cualquier cantidad que reciba por encima del mi objetivo será para continuar haciendo ésto, hacer más volúmenes y quizás incluso videos de YouTube.\n",
      "Your help will not only allow me to make my dream a reality, it will also allow me to help bring new flavors to everyone who is willing to learn more about gastronomy.\n",
      "I'll be able to, if enough funding is reached, reach more people with my videos, be able to supply them with the right and necessary ingredients that might be difficult to find in other countries and help them create even more dishes that will blow everyone away.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Tu ayuda no solo me ayudará a cumplir mi sueño, igual me permitirá ayudar a traer nuevos sabores a todos los que estén dispuestos a aprender más sobre gastronomía.\n",

      "Cooking is one of the most basic things in life, something we do every day, unless you’re a particularly lazy multimillionaire. So, why not make the most of it, make it more fun, more playful?  \n",
      "Intuitive Cooking is here to provide you with inspiration, a seed for you to grow, a catalyst, rather than a rigid set of rules. It will empower you to trust your instincts, tastes, imagination and intuition to grow as a cook and (who knows?) as a person too.  It will:\n",
      "The recipes\n",
      "Naturally, Intuitive Cooking is chock-full of mouthwatering recipes! Most of these are vegetarian and/or vegan, and those that are slightly meaty or fishy can be easily adapted to the former. For those dipping their toes into the meat-free swimming pool, I’ve prepared a mini-manual with plenty of great alternatives to get started.  \n",
      " As I've lived for many years in Spain, many recipes are Mediterranean-inspired, but others are from different corners of the world, some are very simple, others more elaborate: all are as sustainable as possible. There's something for anyone and everyone!    \n",
      "Making things fun again\n",
      "In these times of information overload, Instagram food porn, bake-off TV shows and guru chefs, cooking can become more than a little intimidating. With personal tales and anecdotes, I take a fun and liberating look at this culinary straightjacket. Intuitive Cooking helps you to once again become your own easy-going boss in the kitchen and takes the grind out of everyday cooking.  \n",
      "But wait, there's more!\n",
      "Intuitive Cooking also comes with a handy separate booklet to help you implement your new-found inspiration and va-va-voom! The goal is to provide you with ideas to allow you to play and give free reign to your culinary creativity. It covers a wide range of subjects: how to play with texture, temperature and tastes, flavour groups and intensifiers, fun ways of encouraging your kids to eat healthier and so much more. It also includes spaces to jot down your ideas so you can really personalise this book and turn it into something to cherish forever. \n",

      "ABOUT ME \n",
      "Hi! I'm Katrien Claus, and I've always been passionate about food: when I was a lot younger, my chaotically delicious dinner parties for my fellow-students became the stuff of legend. After graduating, I travelled the world, stimulating still further my insatiable curiosity, culinary and otherwise. I then settled with my partner, Roly, in Barcelona, where I experienced first-hand the city’s gastronomic and social revolution of the 90s. There, I began organising food tours and cooking classes for both locals and international travellers alike, which are still popular today. I now live in a mountain village in the Catalan Pyrenees, where I offer culinary (and other) workshops. There, I enjoys rummaging around in my kitchen garden and the other delights of country living.\n",
      "My mission\n",
      "Intuitive Cooking is is designed to bring the fun back to the kitchen for everyone. Cooking and eating is not a life-or-death competition: it’s about being together, having fun and bringing comfort. Let’s face it, who doesn’t have a jolly smile on their face after enjoying a great meal, either on their own or in good company? The book will help boost your culinary confidence and to take of yourself, your loved ones and the planet. \n",
      "Where we are now\n",
      "I've been working hard on Intuitive Cooking for nearly two years now, with the support of my small but extremely talented and dedicated team. There's been a lot of research, trialling and tasting recipes, discussions of ideas and content… We're nearly there. I have the prototype of the book and its accompanying booklet in my sticky little hands now, and we've carried out the final corrections.   \n",
      "Next stop is the printer's! And it's here that I really need your support, as well as to pay the illustrator and graphic designer for their hard—and beautiful—work over the last year or so. \n",
      "Making a book as special as Intuitive Cooking is not exactly a cheap process, but I also want to make it relatively affordable, and the price per copy of 1,000 books is a LOT cheaper than that for 500 copies: the issue is that the overall upfront cost is higher, and that's where Kickstarter and your support comes in.\n",
      "As I want to keep things transparent,  here's an overview of the costs:\n",
      "How can you support Intuitive Cooking?\n",
      "There are many ways—just check out all our different pledges! For those of you living in the US and the UK, we really recommend clubbing together, ordering with friends and having all the books sent to one address: the overall shipping costs will be a lot lower!\n",
      "Also, if you like the project, it would be a great help in you could a share it with friends and on social media.  Intuitive Cooking is present on Instagram and Facebook. Give us a like and follow us! We also have a YouTube channel, chock full o' funny videos.\n",
      "And as always with Kickstarter, if we don't meet our goal, you'll get your money back in full.\n",
      "Where has all this been cooked up?\n",
      "At Montepallars, a retreat centre in a stunning village in the foothills of the Spanish Pyrenees. There, people get a chance to discover a new passion, explore their creativity or simply focus on what they really like doing. In all its workshops, nature provides the starting point to inspire that creativity.\n",
      "Montepallars offers all kinds of workshop holidays: yoga, drawing, writing, painting and more, as well as cooking, of course! Whatever the subject, I provide the food, always cooking scrumptious, healthy food prepared with lots of love. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We've already shouldered most of the risk: the writing, photos, illustrations and design are all complete, and we've already consulted with the printers and received a prototype copy of the book. It looks really great! All the recipes have been tried, tasted and given an enthusiastic thumbs up. \n",
      "\n",
      "All that remains is a final review and the actual print job. We're working with one of Europe's top printers to ensure a truly professional result. \n",
      "\n",
      "With the current crisis, the availability and pricing of the quality and environmentally-friendly paper we want to use may cause a minor delay, but we'll do our best to get this beautiful book in your hands as soon as possible and keep you posted of its progress.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "I've been cooking with my family since I was a young child. My late grandmother was making drop scones with my sister and I in her ancient tiled kitchen before I could even read. My mother taught me how to make risotto and bolognese, goats cheese tart and bean chilli. In part, this recipe book is homage to the women in my family who imparted a love of food that has stayed with me my whole life.\n",
      "It's also a love letter to every busy, exhausted, disorganised home cook who loves food but struggles to manage four different pots at once and follow instructions that seem to contain 100 steps to make one meal. I see you. I am you.\n",
      "I'm an autistic home cook with ADHD, and something I know I'm not alone in struggling with is my executive function - my ability to organise and prioritise tasks, and plan ahead. Focusing on complicated information feels impossible when I'm time limited or already tired from a long day.\n",
      "This recipe book aims to be different. It aims to bring you glorious, nourishing food to bring you comfort or entertain your friends without stressing you out. These recipes are easy to follow, require minimal equipment (hello one pan meals!) and all take under an hour to prepare. Using many of the same core ingredients in different ways, and making incredible meals with everyday spices, your weekly food shop doesn't have to be agonising to plan. What's more, with this book, you'll dish up family favourites without creating a daunting pile of dishes.\n",
      "I'm now hoping to work towards a NEW STRETCH GOAL OF £5,000 for an audio book version after many requests. This will be available a month after the e-book and paperback versions are released, to give me time to record audio files of the highest quality. \n",
      "It's taken ten years of writing food blogs to get here. This recipe book has been a dream of mine since I was a teenager, and I'm just months away from realising it. The money raised on Kickstarter will go towards a professional photoshoot, cover design, formatting and editing, and of course towards your pledge rewards. Thank you for helping my dream become a reality.\n",

I was also inspired by some of my earliest influences as a filmmaker, specifically Steven Spielberg. I have always found his mastery of tone between scenes to be particularly impressive.

      "The Interruption is a Lancaster/Harrisburg/NYC based music crew spearheaded by Douglas Thomas. Five years ago Douglas pulled together a diverse group of talented musicians to help him craft and perform a collection of songs he'd composed.  Michael Ray Fisher, a Broadway singer from New York took on lead vocals. DeJuan Rosado, AKA Spoken Musik, a prolific and accomplished percussionist known for his work in the local gospel scene came on as the drummer. Benjamin Weiss, who goes by the stage name Teheru, was recruited to write and perform rap/spoken word verses. But after playing just a few gigs, a series of mishaps resulted in the disintegration of the project. \n",
      "Fortunately, four years later the stars aligned and The Interruption was reborn in spectacular fashion. The group added masterful Congolese guitarist/bassist Emmanuel Nsingani. They began playing shows again and built a local following. The five musicians started recording an 11 song album. After working for months on the first five songs, it became apparent that the collection of music would work best as two short EP's with the names \"Foreplay\" and \"HindSight.\" The first EP is set to be released on Friday May 13th. To celebrate, The Interruption will host an album release party at Zoetropolis Cinema & Stillhouse in Lancaster featuring three live sets of music performed by the band. \n",

It comes accompanied with a base box that has a built-in battery and is applied as a charger and a BT speaker. Starting $59 per set\n",
      "True wireless earbuds are common in the market. However due to the use of different brands chipsets, the quality of earbuds from different providers vary from one to another, and some of them have the quality issues like bad connection, signal drop, unclear sound, much power consumption, short play time …… etc., which have caused much inconvenience to end users.\n",
      "Virtual Acoustic® TS-2 true wireless earbuds are DIFFERENT !\n",
      "Our true wireless earbuds TS-2, is professionally designed using world leading Qualcomm® QCC3020 chipset of BT 5.0 and Qualcomm® aptX™ encoding & decoding technology. It differs from others. The highlights are :  \n",
      "Virtual Acoustic® TS-2 true wireless earbuds use advanced Qualcomm® QCC3020 chipset of BT 5.0 technology, to meet the needs of the industry as the global wireless standard for simple, secure connectivity, and to ensure the super stable stereo sound is obtained. This transformative BT 5.0 technology significantly increases the range and speed of connectivity, thus the super stability of wireless connection.\n",

      "Unlike other wireless BT earbuds that one earbud receives BT signal and then transmits to the other, both of two earbuds of Virtual Acoustic® TS-2 receive BT signal  independently and simultaneouslyfrom audio devices. This strongly enhances the stability of BT signal connection and transmission.\n",
      "Qualcomm® aptX™ audio codec is widely used on world’s finest smartphones, speakers, tablets. With application of this technology, our TS-2 earbuds deliver audio of more consistent, higher resolution and lower latency to enhance the much better wireless sound quality.\n",
      "Previous wireless BT earbuds in market can ONLY have one earbud working when making/taking a call, so you listen to the call only in ONE ear. Benefited from Qualcomm® QCC3020 chipset and BT 5.0 technology, both of two earbuds of our TS-2 are connected to smart phones independently and simultaneously, meaning when making/taking a call, you listen to it in Both of Ears. A different experience.\n",
      "Due to the limitation of chipset used, two sides of most of the existing wireless BT earbuds in the market cannot receive audio signal simultaneously, namely one earbud receives audio and then transmits to the other. This eventually consumes more power of battery. Needless to say, the earbuds play time is shortened.\n",
      "With the application of advanced Qualcomm® QCC3020 chipset of BT 5.0, Virtual Acoustic® TS-2 is professionally designed to have two sides of earbuds receive audio signal independently and simultaneously with no more extra transmission, which saves battery power consumption by 50% at most and extends the play time.\n",
      "With analysis of dozens of different ear shapes, Virtual Acoustic® TS-2 is finely engineered to have the best ergonomic fit for ears. It brings you the pleasure of not only enjoyment of high quality audio but also experience of more comfortable wearing, even you are on a move.\n",
      "Virtual Acoustic® TS-2 earbuds are accompanied with a holding box and a base box. Each box has a built-in battery already installed. There are two ways to charge TS-2 as follows :\n",
      "With smart pairing technology applied, Virtual Acoustic® TS-2 earbuds are required to pair with BT devices manually only for the first time. After that, any time the moment TS-2 is taken out of holding box, the moment it is instantly and automatically connected to the same BT device that has been paired. No hassle or extra process.\n",
      "Many wireless earbuds in the market are set some touch controls on one side of earbuds and other touch controls on the other side. This is confusing and hard to remember.\n",
      "Our TS-2 is designed to provide you with much easier and more convenient operation of touch controls by tapping EITHER of two earbuds.\n",
      "Placing holding box that has TS-2 earbuds in onto base box turns base box into a Bluetooth Speaker automatically and immediately. Yes it’s that simple. Enjoy music via this BT Speaker.\n",

We try to do this by offering our JackSavior technology to well known cable and plug manufacturers or brands to incorporate it in their products. We make the JackSavior technology implementation easier for the factories by running a project with them, which we offer to pay for. This offered instrument cable is such a project. We aim to reach as much people as possible with this project to get the following word on the street: There is a new jack plug in town which is smaller, flexible and 10x stronger.\n",
      "The beginning\n",
      "The design of audio jacks found in modern headphones dates back to 1876 and was invented by Tividar Puskás. It is by no means a bad design, but at JackSavior, we feel that an update is long overdue. Audio jacks break frequent between the wires and the plug. We solve this by connecting the wires inside. But selling headphones makes no sense, as there are already many great brands selling audio products and our founder Bouwy is not Dr. Dre. We are licensing out the technology to these brands but apparently, no manager is interested in preventing jack failure problems for their customers. So we ran a crowdfunding campaign to pay for the first tooling and convince big brands to incorporate the JackSavior plug into their products.\n",
      "What happened after the first crowdfunding campaign?\n",
      "We shipped all the promised rewards/perks and our goal of convincing big brands succeeded as multiple brands want to have it. They requested a quotation from their factory, who did not give any reply to that request. They said that they cannot give a quotation as they cannot estimate the planning sufficiently to comply with planning rules and involved penalties. This is because they have no experience with making a million JackSavior plugs. We have to buildup to those order sizes and increase manufacturability to achieve predictability for those big manufacturers.\n",
      "Small OEM partner to grow predictable manufacturing\n",
      "We decided to find a smaller factory to cooperate with us and increase manufacturability and thereby the predictability of the whole process. We will be growing from this factory towards the big factories to ultimately supply to the big headphone brands. We need to produce products to identify optimizations in the production process. This campaign will help us to pay for these production batches and save the world from jack failure.\n",
      "We've been around in the jack plug business for a couple of years and often wondered why plugs don’t have any color, except silver or gold. We stumbled on some sample material with a black zinc coating. Unfortunately, this was not wear resistant, it was easily scratchable. In the discussion with our local metal supplier, black nickel came out as a possibility!\n",
      "Why aren’t there any other black jacks? We think it’s because it is harder to solder. But with the JackSavior production process we can solder this difficult material. This gives you the opportunity to be rewarded with a cool looking cable and spreading the JackSavior technology.\n",
      "The first prototype of the JackSavior black edition is demonstrated in the video below. You'll hear that the black nickel plating is not affecting the performance of the cable. We furthermore tested the conductivity in the factory and confirmed that the black plating doesn't affect the signal transfer. The cable in this prototype is just a sample, the reward will be shipped with a premium 5 mm braided cable.\n",
      "We solder the wires inside the plug that goes inside your device. This part is not moving constantly, which results in the 10x better test results.\n",
      "Thanks to https://max.guitars/ who where so kind to let us film some cool shots in their store.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "This is our 4th Kickstarter project. The first project had some delay as we moved from a press fit connection to a soldering connection inside the plug for more durability. We have successfully validated this technique and used it in mass production to make the Kickstarter pledges, which made all the backers happy when they had the product in their hands! By delivering a violin cable to a big brand, we proved production of the 1/4\"(6.35 mm) jack. We intent to provide weekly or biweekly updates about the process.\n",

      "Hanging With Doctor Z is a 1970s style talk show, where the witty and charming host, Doctor Z (Dana Gould) interviews current well known guests, such as Steven Weber, Patton Oswalt, Will Forte, Bobcat Goldthwait, Andy Richter, Janet Varney, Tim Meadows, Paget Brewster and Dana Gould (yeah, you read that right) to name a few.  \n",
      "The show debuted on YouTube in February of 2021 and was met with praise, being featured in Paste Magazine, The Comic's Comic Podcast, The Comedy Bureau, Film Stories, Meta Filter and more.  If the comment sections on Hanging With Doctor Z's YouTube Channel made one thing clear, it's that there is a demand for a second season. So, here we are!\n",
      "Hanging With Doctor Z star, and one of the creators, Dana Gould, has been making live appearances of the beloved Doctor for years, including on TCM's Big Screen Classics, at the 50th Anniversary screening of Planet Of The Apes, on Jimmy Kimmel Live and at live comedy shows. As COVID hit and the world shut down, Dana with friends, Robert Cohen and Pete Aronson brainstormed together, eager to start a new project and trying to come up with something that would be COVID safe to make. The concept for Hanging With Doctor Z was born. This was their passion project and they put their all into it, funding it out of pocket. \n",
      "Funny you should ask! They're right over to the side and there is a ton of them! However, below are some photos to go along with some of our specific rewards:\n",

      "These statuettes fit onto a shelf and are detailed down to the paisley print on the good Doctor's robe. They are designed by Andy Schoneberg and only a limited amount will be available. \n",
      "There is a demand for a second season of this series, but as the first season was funded out of pocket, there are some financial restraints that make creating a second season difficult. That's where you come in.  Doctor Z needs your help.  As expenses such as paying a crew, paying an editor, renting production equipment,  the costs of a sound stage and other expenses that come up,  a season two really isn't possible without a little help.  It costs about $40,000 to make a season of Hanging With Doctor Z. We want YOU to be our partner and help us with half! Our goal is $20,000, when everything is added up together, that's the minimum of (half! of) what it will take to make a second season that lives up to the quality of the first.  With your help, we can do this! \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Luckily we've already overcome most of the risks in Season One. Creating a series and putting it out to the world, always comes with the risk of how it will be received. Luckily, Hanging With Doctor Z was received well! The challenges with Season Two are just financial and will we be able to top season one? But we are excited and up for the challenge.\n",

      "We chose to create a jump rope because of how effective jumping rope really is. Jumping rope engages more muscles than any other form of cardio. The weighted ropes add resistance so you can get a great upper body workout while building strength and gaining endurance.\n",

Want more of a challenge? Switch to a heavier rope. Traveling? You don’t have to worry about breaking up your routine, you can easily take your jump rope with you wherever you go. Short on time? A ten-minute workout can burn up to 300 calories. Like working out with a partner? Share one with a friend.\n",
      "With the Remace Jump Rope system, you’re set up for success. Cardio never felt so good.\n",
      "You don’t need a personal trainer, gym membership or expensive equipment to get in shape. The Remace Jump rope is a fraction of the price of other, more costly, traditional fitness options and more effective.\n",

      "Sharing the Remace Jump Rope campaign with friends and family is a great way you can help to support this project. To show our appreciation to those who do so, we will include a free jump rope carrying pouch to anyone who helps us spread the word. Just let us know in the comments when you do so and we’ll add the pouch to your order.\n",

People have to live in campers in homes that are falling into the ground and there are no jobs to be found anywhere. People are on drugs and the stories get sadder to where government agencies are telling people that they will not get a job even if they have an impressive and experienced resume in an industry that can be used here (Story from a heavy machine operator who became unemployed when the mine shut down) I intend to expose this story to the rest of the world and show the nation how the other half lives in the rural ghettos of America. These people only resort to crime and drugs out of depression and despration of the lack of ability to make a living in this region. Most people don't want to live off the goverment for the rest of their lives, but they have to.

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "ToeJam & Earl’s Funky Fresh Foods of Funkotron is a colorful, weird, and funky cookbook coming to you soon. This official cookbook draws inspiration from the classic ToeJam & Earl video game series as well as real world foods and flavors. You don't have to be a fan of the series to get behind this cookbook. Just like the game series it's based on, Funky Fresh Foods is designed for beginners and pros alike. You don't have to be familiar with the series to jump in and enjoy the recipes in this cookbook! There is something for everyone in this book. It's weird, it's alien, it's interesting! ☄️\n",
      "Funky Fresh Foods of Funkotron tells the story of how the groovy extraterrestrial duo, ToeJam and Earl, embark on an epic quest from the Funkapotamus himself to bring new tastes, interstellar peace, and funky, fresh flavors to planet Earth. This cookbook is chock full of classic dishes re-imagined with a vibrant, otherworldly vibe. How about a funky beat cake made with real beets? Would you try some Tomato Jam and Earl Grey shortbread cookies (a specialty of Mama Flo)? Oh, maybe Big Earl will finally share the secret recipe behind his world famous hot dog! Sounds weird, looks weirder, but all tastes amazing. Funky Fresh Foods will teach you to prepare meals that will take your taste buds to the moon and back. 🚀\n",
      "ToeJam & Earl is all about fun and trying out new things, just like our recipes! The series has always been about bringing people together and showing them new cultures and ideas with excitement, mystery, and imagination. This cookbook continues that tradition. We won't just show you new recipes, we'll also teach you a lot about how to cook and how much fun it can be. This isn't the first time we've made a cookbook either. Members of the team behind this cookbook have previously worked on two incredible culinary projects that were both major successes: Mother's Cookbook and The Legend's Cookbook. With all that experience and a brand new intergalactic setting, we’ll expand your mind and taste buds with far out dishes that will change the way you think about yourself, the universe, and food. 🛸\n",
      "If you're not familiar with the ToeJam & Earl series, that's ok! We'll give you a super quick rundown. The series debuted on the SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive back in 1991 and was a cult hit with three more entries made since then. The newest game, ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove, released in 2019 on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.  The games star intergalactic alien rappers, ToeJam (the red one) and Earl (the yellow one), who crash their ship on our planet. Not only do they make a mess, they also run around collecting the parts of their ship, getting into trouble, and eating everything they can get their hands on (even though sometimes they probably shouldn't eat that moldy bread). The gameplay is fun and fast-paced with an emphasis on randomly generated levels, a funk-inspired soundtrack, and a healthy dose of 90's nostalgia. You don't have to be a TJ&E fan to enjoy this cookbook, but if this cookbook has piqued your interest, check out the games. They're a lot of fun. 🙂\n",
      "Now that we've covered the source material, we can talk about the book more! ToeJam & Earl’s Funky Fresh Foods of Funkotron will be available in digital, paperback, and hardcover formats so you can choose (I always opt for the hardcover because I always get too much butter on my fingers to use my tablet). The book will be 8\" x 10\" (20.3cm x 25.4cm) and contain over 100 pages of funktastic photos, art, and recipes. You'll find over 44 original recipes (with the possibility of more with stretch goals 😉). This is a quality-made book too, unlike certain spaceships. It’ll hold up to kitchen use with a strong smyth sewn binding, deliciously heavyweight internal paper stock (makes the pages sauce-resistant), and a hardy matte laminate cover to keep the stains away. 💪\n",
      "Food has been a longtime staple in all manner of video games. The ToeJam & Earl series is no exception to that. The dynamic duo have been running around and chowing down on all kinds of comfort food ever since the first game. As a kid, I always wondered what an alien's take on pizza or ice cream would be and now I finally have the opportunity to show everybody! I also figured aliens probably ate a little bit healthier than most Earthlings, part of being an advanced civilization and such. With that in mind, this cookbook will heavily feature healthy recipes and vegetarian options and won’t contain any recipes that have red meat (then what’s in Earl’s hot dog??? Guess you'll have to back it to find out.) Here's a link to seven sample recipes! Not to mention, the food in our cookbook looks absolutely out-of-this-world and we know you'll want to show it off on social media. Hopefully it'll inspire some of your friends to try out some of our nutritious nosh. That being said, we want you all to live long and prosper. 🖖\n",
      "Hi! My name is June Kirsch and I'll be your fresh chef today on this funky adventure of a cookbook. I have been cooking forever. I just love it. I went to the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York and graduated in 2016 with a degree in Culinary Arts and Applied Food Studies. Or, as I like to call, \"How to Make Food and How to Make it Good\". \n",
      "My philosophy about cooking has always been about bringing people together. Meals are best shared and sometimes even if you can't be in the same room as someone, you can share a recipe with them and be a part of their life. I was born in Kenya and spent most of my childhood moving all over the planet, but we always made a point to share our meals together. It brought us together no matter the distance.\n",
      "I learned a lot about cooking from all of my travels and my experience in culinary school but the best place to learn how to cook is your own kitchen. ToeJam & Earl resonates with me because they came to a new place, tried different things, and went outside their comfort zone, and these are all things I'm hoping to bring to this cookbook! I'm happy to be your pilot and I hope we don't crash land, but even if we do, I'm sure we'll have a great time making all manner of Funky Fresh Foods!\n",
      "We’ve been working on this cookbook for quite a while! We started cooking almost a year ago, coinciding with the release of ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove.  A few of them have been tweaked a little since then, but you should check out our awesomely funky cooking videos. 🎥\n",
      "Our plan is to wrap up our taste testing and finalize our recipes. We’ve been at it a while so that’s nearly done. Then we finish up all our art and photos. Then we get the books printed and shipped out to all you hungry backers. 🥡\n",
      "We have a few unlockable recipes waiting for only the funkiest of funklords. We're talking, of course, about our new Community Challenges!

      "Could we take the sound of an analog legend and craft it for the future? The answer–after years of development–was the creation of the SB01 (Space Bee) analog synthesizer.  \n",
      "An instrument that puts classic sound in a modern package and adds a number of essential upgrades. \n",
      "The SB01 is the world's thinnest and first rechargeable analog synthesizer.\n",
      "While the SB01 is a new form of synthesizer, it may sound familiar to many–our inspiration was one of the sonic engines that laid the foundation of electronic music. We worked with Open Music Labs to create and carefully hone a 1:1 version of the signature circuits that bring it to life.  \n",
      "A 3340 voltage controlled oscillator feeds into a 4-pole OTA filter that makes for an iconic and unmistakable sound. Make it snap and sing with responsive analog envelopes, modulation, and portamento, or bring in external CV for deeper VCO and VCF control.\n",
      "For us, true portability meant incorporating fully rechargeable battery power. A generous 16-hour battery life allows for extended usage between charges. In addition, the battery is user-replaceable to ensure an instrument that lasts many years into the future. \n",
      "- Nick Kwas (WANDERTALK) \n",
      "We created a flexible new step sequencer for the SB01, centered around fluid live performance and intuitive for all skill levels. Simply load a sequence by entering notes in order, along with rests or slides, and hit play. Patterns with up to 256 notes can be saved in 64 different locations. \n",
      "\n",
      "     While playing, queue up stored sequences with CHAIN mode or start them immediately with JUMP. In addition, we've included a unique MODULO mode for interleaving sequences. A sequence direction modifier and transpose latching function enable new possibilities, while the arpeggiator gives you several modes including random play. \n",
      "A dual-sequencer means two different independent sequences can run simultaneously on internal and external tracks. This means you can drive external CV or MIDI gear with the SB01 keyboard, arpeggiator, or sequencer while having the same freedom onboard. To aid with performance, a color-coded layer feature always lets you see which track is active.\n",
      "Earlier this year we brought several SB01 prototypes to the Superbooth tradeshow in Berlin, where we showed the synth for the first time and got our first feedback from musicians. Check out press coverage here:\n",
      "Our instrument not only reimagines what a modern synthesizer can do, but how it can be made. Machined out of a single block of aluminum, the SB01 was an exercise in distilling a synth to its most essential form. \n",
      "Full-size tactile keys rise from a rugged, yet portable casing that is compact enough to fit into a carry-on suitcase, or our accessory tote bag. \n",
      "—AXEL HARTMANN \n",
      "Ultra-compact form was enabled by a newly-developed keyboard design based on a quiet, fast-action rubber dome switch. Each tactile and electronic element was custom developed for optimal performance, using the highest quality components.\n",
      "Our fundamental goal was to build something that lasts. Built in the US, using the highest-quality components, the SB01 is a no-compromise performance instrument.  \n",
      "From the individual component selection to the keyboard action and metal construction, every aspect of the SB01 was designed to be long lasting and repairable. With a background in music performance and vintage synthesizer restoration, our founder and designer Ben Stamas understood the need for reliability that spans the life of the instrument. True to these values, we are planning to release the circuit schematic and firmware of the SB01 and future products to allow for longevity well into the future.\n",
      "The SB01 is the first synthesizer from Superlative, and also one that demonstrates our vision going forward- truly portable, next-generation performance instruments that are built to last. We are working on several new products, but excited to bring you the SB01 as our debut. We look forward to hearing from our backers and giving them a chance to provide feedback as we put on the final touches.\n",

      "\n",
      "The SB01 is an instrument with a number of custom components, and we have outlined a typical production schedule that allows for any minor challenges that may occur. We are confident our synthesizer can be manufactured to the highest standards and begin shipping to our backers early next Summer.\n",

The Jig Jug keeps the lures easily accessible while actively fishing, yet keeps the hook points concealed so you’re not snagging pant legs or dumping them out when you’re running the deck and fighting fish. Having all your lures at the ready allows you to rig up or switch tackle swiftly without worrying about the hassle of putting things back in a tackle box to rust or spill in the process. Just swap and drop right in to the jug and stay focused on fishing!\n",

The 1.0 version was a great success and showed us it's no-brainer tool to keep tackle organized in a simple, yet neat and tidy manner.  We made a few, slapped them on our buckets, and went fishing! \n",

      "Why is it important?  Trees are commonly considered one of our best weapons in the fight against climate change. And yet, so many of them are being destroyed, including the 40 million Christmas trees that are harvested each year in the US & UK alone. Christmas trees were once respected, used in sacred ceremonies and protected. Nowadays they are merely commodities of Christmas and this practice is destroying our environment. The 'How to eat your Christmas tree' cookbook is a first step into re-thinking how we treat our Christmas trees and the planet! \n",
      "What your donation will do... I have self funded and self published this little, green cookbook so that I can spread the word of tree. Your donation to the project will help me get this book off the ground by paying for the first print run, selling the first batch of books and paying back all of the wonderful friends, designers and photographers who got involved in this project. \n",
      "Making this book... The'How to eat your Christmas tree' cookbook has been printed with a lot of love and respect for the environment. The book is printed by environmentally sympathetic print house St. Austell's in Cornwall, UK. Packaging and delivery methods are as sustainable as possible. \n",
      "All that is left to say is thankyou for supporting my project. I hope that you will enjoy the recipes in my cookbook as much as I have enjoyed concocting them over the last few years! \n",
      "Just give me the trees! \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Durch dieses Projekt entsteht ein Bluetooth-Audio-Modul für hörbert, den MP3-Player aus Holz für Kinder. Mit dem Modul kann man Kopfhörer mit hörbert verbinden und außerdem hörbert als Bluetooth-Lautsprecher verwenden und noch mehr... \n",
      "Das Modul kann in jeden hörbert nachträglich eingebaut werden.\n",
      "English translation: Please see below   /   Traduction française : Voir ci-dessous\n",
      "Hallo, mein Name ist hörbert. Ich werde im Dezember 8 Jahre alt und habe in meinem Leben bereits viele tausend Familien als Freunde gewonnen. Manchmal leben wir hörberts auch zu zweit oder sogar zu dritt in einer Familie. Die Kinder lieben uns, tragen uns hin und her und nehmen uns mit in jeden Urlaub. Das ist wunderschön! Und als Gegenleistung spielen wir Musik und Geschichten und bringen ganz viel Freude.\n",
      "Mein Erfinder hat im Jahr 2011 extra für mich eine Firma gegründet, die Firma heißt WINZKI und befindet sich in Frickenhausen in Deutschland. Die lieben Leute, die uns hörberts bauen, nenne ich immer die WINZKIs. Die sind richtig nett und bauen jeden hörbert mit Liebe und Leidenschaft in Handarbeit zusammen.\n",
      "Meine Hörbücher und Musik spiele ich immer über meinen eingebauten Lautsprecher ab. Auf seinen Klang bin ich sehr stolz. Ab und zu wollen mich die Kinder jedoch ganz für sich alleine haben, ohne dass die Anderen mithören. Oder es ist so laut, dass die Kinder mich nicht verstehen können. Dann wünschen sie sich Kopfhörer für ihren hörbert. Also für mich. Und weil ich keine Kabel mag, die man mir ausreißen kann, oder die sich den Kindern um den Hals legen, haben sich die WINZKIs etwas Neues ausgedacht. Sie haben beschlossen: \"Wir entwickeln ein Bluetooth-Modul für hörbert: Für Bluetooth-Kopfhörer!\"\n",
      "Das löst alle möglichen Probleme: Ich bin dann im Auto laut genug für das Kind und auf dem Familienfest leise genug für die Leute drum herum.\n",
      "Eigentlich weiß ich schon, dass die WINZKIs mich immer noch ein bisschen besser machen, als sie eigentlich müssen. Die finden das toll, weil mich meine Familien dann noch viel mehr liebhaben. Damit Du unendlich viele Inhalte über mich abspielen kannst, kannst Du auch Dein Handy mit meinem Bluetooth-Modul verbinden. Dann spiele ich als Bluetooth-Lautsprecher alles ab, was Du von Deinem Handy per Bluetooth an mich streamst: Deine ganz privaten eigenen Aufnahmen oder Deine Musik und Hörspiele von Spotify oder Audible und den ganzen anderen Internet-Radios.\n",
      "Wenn ich die Lieblings-Playlist zum Einschlafen für Dein Kind spiele, schlummert es oft nach ein paar Liedern sanft ein. Damit meine Akkus nicht schon nach ein paar durchgemachten Nächten schlapp machen, haben die WINZKIs bereits letztes Jahr etwas für mich zum Nachrüsten gebaut: Einen Timer zur automatischen Abschaltung. Und den bauen die WINZKIs auch gleich in das Bluetooth-Modul mit ein. Du stellst dann ganz einfach ein, wie lange ich noch für Dein Kind spielen soll, bis auch ich mich dann leise schlafen lege.\n",
      "Übrigens: Ungefähr so wie dieses Teil - nur etwas größer und mit mehr Kabeln - stellen wir uns das Bluetooth-Modul vor. Das erfolgreiche Konzept dieser Bauart möchten wir gerne  beibehalten.\n",
      "Du und ich, wir lieben die Umwelt. Darum gehen wir beide schonend mit ihr um. Damit Deine tollen Akkus, die mich versorgen, möglichst lange leben, passt das Bluetooth-Modul auf sie auf. Du sagst mir nur mit einem Schalter, ob Du mich mit Batterien oder Akkus betreibst. Aus Batterien hole ich nämlich alles heraus, damit sie nicht halb leer weggeworfen werden, und trotzdem nicht auslaufen. Auf Deine Akkus passe ich besser auf, denn sie mögen es nicht, ganz leer gesaugt zu werden, das macht sie ganz schlapp. Diese Funktion haben die WINZKIs auch schon in den Timer zur automatischen Abschaltung gebaut, das kennen sie schon. Die Akkus erzählen mir immer, dass das die totale Wellness für sie ist.\n",
      "Du kannst das Modul in jedem hörbert seit Nummer 1 aus dem Dezember 2011 nachrüsten. Wenn Du ein bisschen geschickt mit den Fingern bist, dann kannst Du das Bluetooth-Modul zuhause selbst einbauen. Das kenne ich schon, das haben die WINZKIs mit der automatischen Abschaltung auch schon so gemacht.  Bisher hat das Nachrüsten immer prima geklappt, auch wenn mich das an der Stelle immer wie verrückt kitzelt. Die WINZKIs erledigen den Einbau für Dich auch in ihrer Werkstatt, wenn Du willst. Kitzelt genauso.\n",
      "Weil an dem Modul später mindestens vier Kabel hängen, die Du beim Einbau aus- und ein- und umstecken musst - keine Angst: Mit Anleitung und ohne Löten - haben die WINZKIs dem Bluetooth-Modul offiziell einen klingenden Namen gegeben: \n",
      "\"Das Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel\"\n",
      "Immer lustig, die WINZKIs ;-)\n",
      "Die Auswahl des Bluetooth-Moduls und des Prozessors sind getroffen. Der Prozessor, der das Bluetooth Modul steuern wird, steckt bisher noch als separate Platine auf dem Evaluations-Board des Bluetooth Moduls. Der Prozessor kann schon die einzelnen Anwendungsszenarien abwickeln, wie Du oben im Video siehst.\n",
      "Die nächsten notwendigen Schritte wären jetzt:\n",
      "Was machen die WINZKIs mit Deinem Geld? Sie haben mir erklärt, wie knifflig es ist, die richtige Anzahl an Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddels zu fertigen, damit nachher jeder eins bekommt. Wenn die WINZKIs zu wenige bauen, endet das mit traurigen Familien, wenn sie zu viele bauen, können ganz schlimme Dinge passieren, über die sie gar nicht gerne reden.\n",
      "Jedenfalls kosten die ganzen Chips und Kabel und Platinen und Tests und Prüfungen und die SMD-Bestückung der Platinen beim Zulieferer im Nachbarort so viel, dass die WINZKIs das nicht einfach so im Voraus bezahlen können. Und jetzt bitten sie um Deine Unterstützung: Wenn Du ein Unternehmen mit Fertigung in Deutschland unterstützen möchtest oder Du Dir Dein Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel als Vorbestellung sichern willst, oder wenn Du sogar einen ganzen hörbert mit eingebautem Modul vorbestellen möchtest, dann klicke jetzt gleich auf Unterstütze dieses Projekt!\n",
      "Mit Deiner Unterstützung gibst Du den WINZKIs die Chance, das Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel serienreif zu bekommen und noch vor dem Winter zu verschicken. Der Prototyp auf diesem Bild funktioniert schon, Du kannst ihn im Video sehen und hören.\n",
      "Das Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel werden Alex und Rainer entwickeln, bis es produktionsreif ist. Die Prüfung im Labor übernimmt ein Labor in Stuttgart, und die Produktion eine Firma in einem Nachbarort. Mit diesen Firmen arbeiten die WINZKIs schon länger erfolgreich zusammen.\n",
      "Christine wird mit den Lieferanten verhandeln und dafür sorgen, dass Dein vorausbezahltes Geld sparsam ausgegeben wird.\n",
      "Jacqueline, Christian und Simon werden die Endproduktion der Bluetooth-Module und den Test in unserer Firma durchführen.\n",
      "Sandra und Ulla werden sich um Deine Fragen zur Abwicklung kümmern. \n",
      "Unsere Sandras, Bianca und Simone werden sich darum kümmern, dass so viele wie möglich in der weiten Welt über mich und meine tolles neues Zubehör erfahren.\n",
      "Esther, Gabi, Günter und Tanja werden sich um den Einbau des Bluetooth-Module für die Paketangebote und die Nachrüstungen kümmern.\n",
      "Thilo wird Dich in technischen Fragen unterstützen, falls ein Problem beim Einbau auftritt. \n",
      "Madlen und Miriam werden die ganzen Kickstarter Belohnungen verpacken dafür sorgen, dass jede Belohnung schnell bei Dir ankommt, sobald sie verfügbar ist.\n",
      "Nicole und Stefanie kümmern sich mit Personalplanung und Teampflege um die Menschen, damit das Projekt die WINZKIs nicht aus dem Tritt bringt.\n",
      "This project creates a Bluetooth audio module for hörbert, the wooden MP3 player for children. With this module you can connect headphones with hörbert and also use hörbert as Bluetooth speaker and even more... \n",
      "The module can be retrofitted into any hörbert.\n",
      "Hello, my name is hörbert. I will be 8 years old in December and have already made many thousands of families friends in my life. Sometimes we hörberts live also in twos or even in threes in a family. The children love us, carry us back and forth and take us on every holiday. That's beautiful! And in return we play music and stories and bring a lot of joy.\n",
      "My inventor founded a company especially for me in 2011, the company is called WINZKI and is located in Frickenhausen in Germany. I always call the dear people who build us hörberts 'the WINZKIs'. They are really nice and build every hörbert with love and passion in manual labour.\n",
      "I always play my audio books and music through my built-in speaker. I am very proud of its great sound. From time to time, however, the children want to have me all to themselves, without the others listening in. Or it's so loud that the children can't understand me. Then they want headphones for their hörbert. For me, that is. And because I don't like cables that can be torn out of me, or that may wrap around children's necks, the WINZKIs have come up with something new. They decided: \"We are developing a Bluetooth module for hörbert: For Bluetooth headphones!\"\n",
      "This solves all kinds of problems: I'll be loud enough for the child in the car and quiet enough for the people around at the family party.\n",
      "Actually, I already know that the WINZKIs always make me a little better than they actually have to. They think it's great because my families love me even more. In order for you to listen to an infinite amount of content with me, you can also connect your mobile phone to my Bluetooth module. Then I work as a Bluetooth speaker and play everything you stream from your mobile phone to me via Bluetooth: your very own private recordings or your music and audio books and podcasts from Spotify or Audible and all the other Internet radio stations.\n",
      "When I play the favourite playlist for your child to fall asleep, it often falls asleep gently after a few songs. So that my batteries don't wear out after just a few nights, the WINZKIs already built something for me last year to retrofit: A timer for automatic switch-off. And the WINZKIs are going to also integrate this into the Bluetooth module. Then you simply set how long I should play for your child until I go to sleep quietly, too.\n",
      "By the way: About the same as this part - just a little bigger and with more cables - we imagine the Bluetooth module to become. We would like to keep the successful concept of this design.\n",
      "You and me, we love the environment. That's why we both care for it. The Bluetooth module takes care of your rechargeable batteries so that they last as long as possible. You just tell me with a switch whether you are using batteries or rechargeable batteries. I squeeze as much as I can out of primary batteries so that they are not thrown away half empty and yet do not leak. I take better care of your rechargeable batteries, because they don't like to be sucked completely empty, that wears them out early. The WINZKIs have already built this feature into the timer for automatic switch-off, they already know how to do that. Btw: The rechargeable batteries always tell me that this gentle treatment is like wellness for them.\n",
      "You can upgrade any hörbert with this module since hörbert number 1 from December 2011. If you are a bit clever with your hands, you can install the Bluetooth module at home yourself. I already know that, because the WINZKIs have already done that with the automatic switch-off.  Up to now, retrofitting has always worked great, even though it always tickles me like crazy. The WINZKIs can also do the installation for you in their workshop, if you like. (It tickles just the same)\n",
      "Because at least four cables hang from the module later, which you have to plug out and in and change during installation - don't worry: with instructions and without soldering - the WINZKIs have officially given the Bluetooth module a sounding name: \n",
      "\"The Bluetooth kuddelmuddel\" ('the bluetooth muddle')\n",
      "Always funny, the WINZKIs ;-)\n",
      "The Bluetooth module and the microprocessor have been chosen. The microprocessor, which will control the Bluetooth module, is still plugged as a separate board on the evaluation board of the Bluetooth module. The processor can already handle the individual application scenarios, as you can see in the video above.\n",
      "The next necessary steps would be now:\n",
      "What do the WINZKIs do with your money? They explained to me how tricky it is to make the right amount of Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddels so that everyone gets one afterwards. If the WINZKIs build too few, it ends with sad families or children, if they build too many, bad things can happen that they don't like to talk about.\n",
      "In any case, all the chips and cables and circuit boards and tests and inspections and the SMD assembly of the circuit boards at the supplier in the neighbouring town cost so much that the WINZKIs cannot simply pay for it in advance. And now they're asking for your support: If you want to support a company with production in Germany or you want to secure your Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel as a pre-order, or if you even want to pre-order a whole hörbert with abuilt-in bluetooth module, then click on Support this project right now!\n",
      "With your pledge you give the WINZKIs the chance to get the Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel ready for series production and to ship it before winter. The prototype already works, you can see and hear it in the video.\n",
      "The Bluetooth Kuddelmuddel will be developed by Alex and Rainer until it is ready for production. The testing in the laboratory will be done by a laboratory in Stuttgart, and the production by a company in a neighbouring town. The WINZKIs have been working successfully with these companies for a long time.\n",
      "Christine will negotiate prices and amounts with the suppliers and make sure that your prepaid money is spent sparingly.\n",
      "Jacqueline, Christian and Simon will carry out the final production of the Bluetooth modules and the test in our company.\n",
      "Sandra and Ulla will take care of your questions about the handling. \n",
      "Our Sandras, Bianca and Simone will see to it that as many people as possible in the world learn about me and my great new accessories.\n",
      "Esther, Gabi, Günter and Tanja will take care of the installation of the Bluetooth module for the package offers and the retrofits.\n",
      "Thilo will support you with technical questions if you have a problem during the installation. \n",
      "Madlen and Miriam will pack all the Kickstarter rewards and make sure that every reward arrives as soon as it is available.\n",
      "Nicole and Stefanie take care of the people with personnel planning and team care so that the WINZKIs do not get out of step during the project.\n",
      "Ce projet crée un module audio Bluetooth pour hörbert, le lecteur MP3 en bois pour enfants. Avec ce module, vous pouvez connecter un casque avec hörbert et utiliser hörbert comme haut-parleur Bluetooth et plus encore.... \n",
      "Le module peut être installé ultérieurement dans n'importe quel hörbert.\n",
      "Bonjour, je m'appelle hörbert. J'aurai 8 ans en décembre et j'ai déjà fait des milliers d'amis dans ma vie. Parfois, nous vivons dans une famille avec deux ou même trois d'entre nous. Les enfants nous aiment, nous portent d'avant en arrière et nous emmènent en vacances. C'est magnifique ! Et en retour, nous jouons de la musique et des histoires et nous apportons beaucoup de joie.\n",
      "Mon développeur a fondé spécialement une société spécialement pour moi en 2011, la société s'appelle WINZKI et est située à Frickenhausen en Allemagne. J'appelle toujours les êtres chers qui nous construisent les WINZKIs. Ils sont vraiment sympathiques et construisent tous les hörbert avec amour et passion en travail manuel.\n",
      "Je joue toujours mes livres audio et ma musique avec mon haut-parleur intégré. Je suis très fier de son son son. De temps en temps, cependant, les enfants veulent m'avoir pour eux tout seuls sans que les autres m'écoutent. Ou c'est si fort que les enfants ne peuvent pas me comprendre. Alors ils veulent des écouteurs pour leur hörbert. Donc pour moi. Et parce que je n'aime pas les câbles qui peuvent être arrachés de moi ou qui s'enroulent autour du cou des enfants, les WINZKIs ont trouvé quelque chose de nouveau. Ils ont décidé : \"Nous développons un module Bluetooth pour hörbert : Pour casques Bluetooth!\"\n",
      "Cela résout toutes sortes de problèmes : Je serai assez fort pour l'enfant dans la voiture et à la fête de famille assez calme pour les gens autour.\n",
      "En fait, je sais déjà que les WINZKIs me rendent toujours un peu mieux qu'il ne le faut. Ils pensent que c'est génial parce que mes familles m'aiment ainsi encore plus. Pour que vous puissiez jouer une quantité infinie de contenu sur moi, vous pouvez également connecter votre téléphone portable à mon module Bluetooth. Ensuite, je joue en tant que haut-parleur Bluetooth tout ce que vous diffusez de votre téléphone portable vers moi via Bluetooth : vos propres enregistrements privés ou votre musique et vos émissions radio de Spotify ou d'Audible et de toutes les autres radios Internet.\n",
      "Quand je joue la playlist préférée de votre enfant pour qu'il s'endorme, il s'endort souvent doucement après quelques chansons. Pour que mes batteries ne s'épuissent pas après quelques nuits, les WINZKIs ont déjà construit quelque chose pour moi l'année dernière pour la modernisation : Une minuterie pour un arrêt automatique. Et les WINZKIs l'intègrent également dans le module Bluetooth. Ensuite, vous fixez simplement combien de temps je dois encore jouer pour votre enfant jusqu'à ce que je m'allonge aussi pour dormir tranquillement.\n",
      "D'ailleurs : Nous imaginons que le module Bluetooth est à peu près le même que ce composant - juste un peu plus grand et avec plus de câbles. Nous aimerions conserver le concept à succès de ce design.\n",
      "Vous et moi, on aime l'environnement. C'est pourquoi nous le traitons tous les deux avec douceur. Le module Bluetooth s'occupe de vos piles rechargeables pour qu'elles durent le plus longtemps possible. Il vous suffit simplement de me dire à l'aide d'un interrupteur si vous utilisez des batteries ou des piles rechargeables. Je retire tout ce qui se trouve dans les batteries pour qu'elles ne soient pas jetées à moitié vides et qu'elles ne fuient pas. Je prends mieux soin de vos piles rechargeables, parce qu'elles n'aiment pas être sucées complètement vides, ce qui les rend très fatiguées. Les WINZKIs ont déjà intégré cette fonction dans la minuterie d'arrêt automatique, ils le savent déjà. Les piles me disent toujours que c'est le bien-être total pour eux.\n",
      "Le module peut être installé ultérieurement dans n'importe quel hörbert depuis le numéro 1 à partir de décembre 2011. Si vous êtes un peu habilé avec vos doigts, vous pouvez installer le module Bluetooth vous même chez vous. Je le connais déjà, les WINZKIs l'ont déjà fait avec l'arrêt automatique.  Jusqu'à présent, la réadaption a toujours bien fonctionné, même si cela me chatouille toujours comme un fou à cet endroit. Les WINZKIs peuvent aussi faire l'installation pour vous dans leur atelier, si vous le souhaitez. Ça chatouille quand même...\n",
      "Parce qu'au moins quatre câbles sont suspendus au module par la suite qu'il faut debrancher,  brancher et changer pendant l'installation - ne vous inquiétez pas : avec des instructions et sans soudure - les WINZKIs ont officiellement donné un nom sonore au module Bluetooth : \n",
      "\"Le Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel\" (le Bluetooth-embrouillamini)\n",
      "Toujours drôle, les WINZKIs  ;-)\n",
      "Le module Bluetooth et le microprocesseur ont été choisis. Le microprocesseur, qui contrôlera le module Bluetooth, est encore branché comme une carte séparée sur la carte d'évaluation du module Bluetooth. Le microprocesseur peut déjà gérer les scénarios d'application individuels, comme vous pouvez le voir dans la vidéo ci-dessus.\n",
      "Les prochaines étapes nécessaires seraient maintenant :\n",
      "Que font les WINZKIs de votre argent ? Ils m'ont expliqué à quel point il est difficile de faire la bonne quantité de Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel pour que tout le monde en reçoive une par la suite. Si les WINZKIs en construisent trop peu, cela finit avec des familles où des enfants tristes, s'ils en construisent trop, de mauvaises choses peuvent arriver dont ils n'aiment pas parler.\n",
      "En tout cas toutes les puces, les câbles, les circuits imprimés, les tests et les inspections ainsi que l'assemblage CMS des circuits imprimés chez le fournisseur dans la ville voisine coûtent tellement cher que les WINZKIs ne peuvent pas simplement les payer à l'avance. Et maintenant, ils vous demandent votre soutien : si vous voulez soutenir une entreprise avec une production en Allemagne ou si vous voulez sécuriser votre Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel en pré-commande, ou si vous voulez même pré-commander un hörbert complet avec un module intégré, alors cliquez sur Support ce projet dès maintenant !\n",
      "Avec votre soutien, vous donnez aux WINZKI la chance de préparer le Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel pour la production en série et à l'envoyer avant l'hiver. Le prototype fonctionne déjà, vous pouvez le voir et l'entendre dans la vidéo.\n",
      "Le Bluetooth Kuddelmuddel sera développé par Alex et Rainer jusqu'à sa mise en production. Les tests en laboratoire seront effectués par un laboratoire à Stuttgart et la production par une entreprise d'une ville voisine. Les WINZKIs travaillent avec ces entreprises avec succès depuis longtemps.\n",
      "Christine négociera avec les fournisseurs et s'assurera que votre argent prépayé est dépensé avec parcimonie.\n",

Frustrated by the lack of opportunities to produce out-of-the-ordinary, hybrid shows that don’t just follow the typical comedy formats of improv, sketch or stand-up, they concocted a weeklong festival of over 30 brand new shows and workshops from a diverse lineup of Philly comedians.\n",
      "The results were so well-received and liberating that the second Five Dollar Comedy Week happened a mere six months later, kickstarting a bi-annual tradition with an all-new set of 30 original high-concept shows, completely different from the first festival.\n",
      "In late 2015, Five Dollar Comedy Week had yielded over 100 distinct, sometimes batshit crazy new shows and thus, Good Good Comedy was born - to keep the spirit of Five Dollar Comedy Week alive every week of the year.

      "That means you’ll now be able to count on something awesome to do in Philly every night of the week. It also means comedians will have ample opportunities to flesh out their wildest ideas, collaborate, and create all kinds of new comedy for you, the almighty audience. And most importantly, we’ll be able to keep our shows cheap as F - the majority of ‘em will remain at $5 a ticket. \n",
      "It also means Good Good Comedy will be able to offer full classes for the first time ever. Exciting! Our classes will focus on a wide spectrum of comedic fields of interest, many of which have never been offered in Philadelphia before, and all of which will be available at fair, affordable prices just like our shows.\n",
      "Creating a new theater is a huge undertaking and one that we don’t take lightly. We’ve already been hard at work at making this dream a reality for the past year. This Kickstarter will not be our sole source of funding for Good Good Comedy Theatre, but the money we make here will go a long, long way toward some of our most significant expenses.\n",
      "Here’s some of what your contribution will go toward (estimates only): \n",

But if you’re the kind of person that watches movie trailers for entertainment or something, we can give you a juicy little preview right here. We’re giving away things like free tickets, an exclusive t-shirt, a limited edition art print from renowned artist / funny person Andrew Jeffrey Wright and more. You can get your name carved onto a plaque that will be displayed in our theatre FOREVER, and you can even write whatever the stank you want on one of our theatre chairs! \n",
      "Plus, this Kickstarter will be the ONLY place you can get a discounted full week pass for the next Five Dollar Comedy Week, which is huge. And if that wasn’t huge enough, we’re even offering an exclusive FULL MONTH PASS to a month of your choosing at the new space. That means you can see everything all month for FREE just for donating here. Don’t miss these hot, hot chances.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "The Kreis Cup is a biodegradable and reusable cup made from used coffee grounds and plant-based materials, free of petroleum-based plastics. It is heat resistant and designed to keep your coffee hot longer.\n",
      "It comes in two versions: Kreis Travel Cup and Kreis Latte Cup. Both are break resistant and dishwasher friendly, which makes them suitable for home and commercial use.\n",
      "Kreis means circle, resembling our circular economy model based on the regeneration of natural materials into a sustainable product. The Kreis Cup is an alternative to disposable paper cups and aims to replace the end-of-life concept of used coffee grounds.\n",
      "Our story is very simple. \n",
      "Just like most of you, we drink coffee every morning and are left with a dirty coffee filter containing wet coffee grounds that need to be discarded and washed away, many times creating a nice smelling mess. \n",
      "Just like disposable coffee paper cups, these coffee grounds end up in a landfill, where they take months to decompose.\n",
      "As an experiment, we started accumulating this “waste“ daily in our home and reached 4 pounds of coffee grounds in one month. \n",
      "We couldn’t stop thinking about all the coffee grounds thrown away in coffee shops and asked ourselves: \"What if this waste is not really meant to be waste?\"\n",
      "By using used coffee grounds collected from local coffee shops, restaurants, offices and hotels we are recycling millions of tons of coffee waste that otherwise ends up in landfills causing numerous problems such as the production of greenhouse gasses and acidic leachate, which can damage the surrounding soil where they are disposed.\n",
      "The Kreis Cup is free from petroleum-based plastics or any other environment harming substances. It is 100% sustainable, reusable and recyclable. The Kreis Way, our recycle program is intended to collect Kreis Cups at the end of their life span and repurpose them into new cups, never touching the landfill.\n",
      "The Kreis Cup is designed and engineered to last for years in homes, coffee shops, offices, hotels or restaurants.\n",
      "Made from recycled coffee grounds and innovative ecological materials, our Kreis Cup will take your coffee experience to the next level due to its natural coffee scent.\n",
      "The Kreis Cup is designed to keep your coffee hot longer and your iced coffee cold until the last sip, thanks to its double-walled insulation.*\n",
      "The Kreis Cup is heat resistant and dishwasher safe. We understand no one wants to do more work.\n",
      "The Kreis Cup is half the weight of regular reusable cups.\n",
      "*Kreis Travel cup comes with double-walled insulation.   \n",

Their Team includes professionals from product design, engineering, and manufacturing, who have partnered with coffee roasters, shops and distributors to fulfill this dream of transforming the coffee industry. This has given them the expertise and knowledge to create an innovative solution to the coffee waste resulting in The Kreis Cups.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Employing Japanese press die casting technology with extravagent alloy, this puzzle is perfect for passing the time! What’s more when finished, it makes for a brilliant interior piece.\n",
      "While it looks simple, it will puzzle you for ages, thanks to the 8 outer pieces which surround the inner design of the puzzle. While each piece looks the same, each piece only has its own place! You’ll be thinking to yourself, “Why is it so hard? Why can’t I complete it?”, while you spend hours lost in concentration trying to solve it, and feel that amazing sense of accomplishment when you finish it.\n",
      "A solution isn’t included with the puzzle. Complete this puzzle on your own back, and feel the thrill when it all comes together! \n",
      "A look at the media introduction for our original design that was widely well received! The Sakura Model!\n",
      "mono magazine May 2021\n",
      "Japanese TV Show「行列のできる法律相談所」OA\n",
      "When you finish the puzzle, in the middle several symbols of Japan appear. Instead of being printed onto the metal, the pictures are made due to the gaps and spaces between the pieces. As the pieces form together, you can find a samurai warrior in armour and holding a katana while riding a horse. In the background, Mt. Fuji stands tall, giving a brilliant backdrop for the puzzle, which we get to experience everyday as our company is located near to Mt. Fuji in Yamanashi Prefecture. \n",
      "This version when compared to the symmetrical sakura model, this Kickstarter model is not as difficult. If you want to try a much harder puzzle we recommend you pick up the sakura version as well!\n",
      "As we are a precision parts maker, we have used this chance to show off the best of our abilities. Each side has a mirror finish to it, which makes it impossible to tell which side goes up or down, which helps to hopefully double the time you’ll be pondering over this puzzle.\n",
      "We hope that the pieces of the puzzle are something you’ve never seen before! We have put a lot of attention to detail into the creation of the pieces.\n",
      "Each piece may look similar to the next, but when you look closely, in order to create a puzzle that has only one solution, each one has very minute differences. This also means that when you fit the right pieces together, they have a very satisfying feel as they slide effortlessly into each other.\n",
      "For most general puzzles, between the pieces there will always be some gaps. With our ZIREL puzzle, the gaps between the pieces are just 0.004mm, which means when you slot them together, they slide into place and the lines seem to disappear before your eyes, thanks to the brilliant fit. \n",
      "0.004mm is extremely thin! The average width of a Japanese girl's hair is about on average 0.08mm, meaning that this gap is 1/20 thinner! Making a gap this thin takes extreme precision and skill to do so. \n",
      "Thanks to the mirror finish on both sides, when completed it makes for a beautiful interior piece. As it is made to be a self standing 8 sided puzzle, it looks great when displayed. Weighing 196g, it is 58mm x 58mm with a depth of about 10mm. While it is small it can act as a great paperweight.\n",
      "Design details\n",
      "The motif of the puzzle as we stated before is a samurai general in front of Mt Fuji while riding a horse, with sakura flowers around the outside. Made to be a octagon, the number 8 is said to be quite auspicious in Japan, bringing good luck. The character used for 8 [八] opens up at the bottom and it is said to symbols growth or development. When celebrating someone, it is often recommended to send something which incorporates 8!\n",
      "Goods made in Japan have for a while been seen as being high quality all over the world. So even though we are making items for playing with, we wanted to create the best, hence the focus on making a puzzle with such a small gap between the pieces, creating a puzzle that many adults can enjoy.\n",
      "Why can we make items that have just a 0.004mm gap then?\n",
      " The press that we use is a punch and die method of processing items. A punch is pressed into the material forcing the material into the correct shape. With this method, if the punch and die machinery isn’t set correctly, it can create burrs and bends to the pieces, which make them unusable. Much care goes into making the pieces and then into quality control after, to make sure each puzzle is the highest quality that they can be. It’s thanks to this that we are able to produce these on a large scale.\n",
      "One of our strengths as a company is the fact that we can design and then press and process everything in house. This item is no exception, with each puzzle being made by us. We hope that you take the chance to try out high quality metal work items that bear the Made in Japan mark.\n",

These parts are often found within your phones or cars and so on. We deal mainly with other businesses so we don’t have much contact with regards to dealing with users of our items directly.\n",
      "We take pride in making the smallest gap possible between items. We are able to make a space that is thinner that the width of a single strand of hair. \n",
      "We hope that through our puzzle, you can find the joy and sense of fulfilment when you slot a piece in that slides and joins almost seamlessly. We would love to hear from you about your experience of solving the puzzle when you receive it! \n",

      "We bring you completely new, never before seen productions that otherwise might never have seen the light of day. \n",
      "On occasion over the years we have asked you, our wonderful and supportive audience, for help to continue our efforts at supporting new plays  - and we need your help again. \n",
      "When we moved into our current location at 1203 Camden we knew we had our work cut out for us.\n",
      "We were taking over a building that was never meant to be a theater and turned it into two. Yep. Our building was a lab! That's right! It has ugly white and green linoleum flooring. We want to put down a new floor and paint the plain white walls a nice warm tan color. We would also like to paint the outside and do a nice mural to let everyone know we ARE A THEATER! \n",
      "Now it’s time to give our little corner of downtown another makeover. \n",
      "We ask for your help to give our theater a few much-needed changes:  replace the floors in the lobby and hallway, replace the ceiling tiles and light bulbs, get an external sign for the theater, and give the outside of our building paint job. Help us make our space more inviting and welcoming to our audiences!\n",
      "With your generous donations we will be able to do all of this  - and hopefully more! \n",

      "Thanks to our community of supporters, we are ready to expand our reach AND our space. Friends, it is time for Arlekin Players Theatre to have our own residence for rehearsals, events, and performances. Currently the growth and production capabilities of our troupe is limited by our space's small size, forcing us to rent venues from other companies in the region to host events and performances.  \n",
      "With your generous support, we will remodel the space adjacent to our studio as an addition and stationary residence for our company's season. Our dedicated volunteers are ready to get their hands dirty by scrubbing, painting and cleaning the new studio, but we need the help of professionals to get the space up to code and make sure our renovations are both smart and safe.\n",

      "Arlekin Players Theatre was created in Boston in 2009 under the leadership of Artistic Director Igor Golyak. Arlekin Players Theatre has toured in New York, Chicago, and Hartford, Conn., and was a guest participant of the International Festival “Golden Lion” in Lviv, Ukraine. In September 2012, Arlekin Players Theatre was invited to perform its production of “The Guest,” by Alexander Pushkin, in Moscow Art Theatre School. Performed on one of the most admired stages in Moscow, the production was greeted with a standing ovation. In 2013 we were honored to represent the United States at the prestigious Mondial du Théâtre in Monaco, hosted by Prince Albert. Currently, we are planning the spring premiere of Natasha's Dream, our first production in English. Our company takes strong pride in our emphasis on self-identity; we are viewed as a Russian troupe to our English audience yet we are not viewed in the same regard to our international audience. Essentially, we are a company of immigrants performing works that play on the ideas of cross-culture, home, and traditions, challenging the idea of nationality, and finding common themes that unite us all.\n",

      "We propose to create a permanent Fringe Theatre venue in Manchester: Hope Mill Theatre. The theatre will hold up to 100 seats with a varied programme of shows running all year round. Musicals, Plays, one night Cabarets, Gigs, Movie Nights, Comedy Nights etc. it will be primarily a fringe theatre offering a platform for new writers, performers and entertainers alike. The theatre space will also be used as a studio space to be hired out as a rehearsal space for local theatre companies, dance schools and for auditions. We plan each year to be part of the annual Manchester Fringe Theatre, offering a performance space for theatre companies. We want to offer a platform for young writers every year with the opportunity for their work to be produced and performed for an audience. We also want to offer the same opportunity for film students to premiere new movies/ documentaries etc. The venue will also hold The Engine Room Café and Bar.

A few smaller fringe venues in Manchester have been forced to close due to funding being used for larger, commercial venues and the lack of audience support. We feel that, like London, the fringe scene up north has to be put on the map and with Manchester being a real hub for artists/ creatives there is no reason it cannot have an all year round fringe scene, which gives a platform for the stars of the future and top quality productions.\n",

      "What is BassMe?\n",
      "Don’t just listen. Feel your music.  With the power of a personal subwoofer on your chest, BassMe propels the sound into your heart the way it was intended to be experienced by combining a state-of-the-art sound wave and vibration system.\n",
      "This brings your senses a new dimension of an elevated auditory experience, immersing you in your music, movies and games.\n",
      "Today, more and more entertainment content such as video games are consumed without sound systems or via mobile devices. The problem is that when listening with earphones, you don’t get that full feeling. You don’t feel the sounds. \n",
      "Unfortunately, many listeners raise the volume to crazy high levels in an effort to get that  “kick”, an emotional auditory we all want when playing games or listening to music. BassMe delivers the vibes exactly to where we like them: straight to your core. \n",
      "The vibes are so pronounced that with BassMe, users often reduce the headset volume because they are receiving the tactile sensation, so you're also protecting your hearing.\n",
      "BassMe  was designed by music lovers looking to ehnance their sound experience.  No matter what activity you are doing, BassMe can be there with you.Regardless what shape or size, adapting to your comfort is priority through its ergonomic design and “soft touch” material.\n",
      "Connect your headset via Bluetooth®, place BassMe on your right shoulder and start your music, video games or movies for a unique experience. The subwoofer should be installed in the center of the chest, at the sternum to use the ribcage as a sounding board.\n",
      "     Dive as if you were in action. Be at the center of your favorite movie. Hang on to your plane seat while you enjoy the rhythms of your favorite band.\n",
      "     Feel the sound in your bones as you discover what's behind your system.\n",
      "BassMe has the capacity to completely immerse users in sound when coupled with other mobile technologies, such as gaming consoles, smartphones and audio devices.\n",
      "The story of BassMe started at the Startup Weekend Perpignan competition in October 2017.\n",
      "For 50 hours, we worked and gave life to the project. Finishing first in the contest, we decided to continue the adventure together. The company STUDIO-DUROY begins its activity with the marketing of BassMe, the accessory that gives life to sound.\n",
      "We are a team that understands the relationship between sound, emotion and immersion. We are a group of passionate people. We believe BassMe can improve many areas and bring people closer to the immersive content of today and tomorrow. We are very excited to introduce this device.\n",
      "BassMe is compatible to any headset and any audio source. It's universal. Simply connect your headset to BassMe and with any gaming gear, any mobile device, any console, PC, tablet, Home Cinema with Bluetooth or audio cable.

      "In today’s digital world, everyone deserves the unbeatable sound of true wireless earbuds, free from cables and comfortable enough to forget they're even in your ears. Aoumini is a 2 in 1 Earbuds & Speaker with unparalleled sound performance, state-of-the-art technology and refined design.  Its ergonomic design is guaranteed to never fall out and never cause soreness in ears. Let the music on the go.\n",
      "Aou-mini is not only a wireless earbuds and a wireless speaker. It can fit confortably in your pocket and have non-stop Hi-Fi music anytime, anywhere. In addition to being a portable bluetooth speaker, Aou-mini integrates a wireless earphone that delivers 40 hours of clear voice with one full charge.  \n",
      "The Aou-mini provide a rich, high-quality, bass boosted, AAC audio. It’s a great-sounding music, movies, and more to your ears.\n",
      "With our proprietary in-ear ergonomic design, cancel out external  sounds, other voices, and ambient noise when you’re listening to music  or on a call. \n",
      "Aou-mini wireless earbuds implemented a Qualcomm QCC302X chipset, which is  compatible with the latest Bluetooth version 5.0, on each side of the  earbuds.   \n",
      "More Stable BT Connection\n",
      "The latest Bluetooth 5.0 chipset features 4x range and simultaneous  connection of both earbuds. And along with PIFA antenna, Aou-mini secures you uninterrupted connection even in crowded places. \n",
      "The existing true wireless Bluetooth earbuds only have one side of  earbud that has signal receiver. And the receiver side transmit the  signal to the other earbud. Now, the two sides of earbuds could receive  signal from your audio devices simultaneously, which largely increased  the connection stability of Bluetooth signal.   \n",
      "Bluetooth 5.0 is the ubiquitous wireless technology’s latest iteration which enhances connectivity within a 10m range and maintains a super stable wireless connection. A stronger connection means that music is streamed flawlessly with lower power consumption that translates into less recharging and longer playback times.\n",
      "With Bluetooth 5.0, you get the strongest, most reliable connection and seamless connectivity between your devices. Strong connection and speed  allows more detailed and robust audio fidelity transmission and zero  audio-video lag. \n",
      "The built-in bluetooth speaker and wireless earpiece, allowing you to stream your music anytime, in anywhere.\n",
      "As active, digital natives, we understand the need to go longer between recharges. Aou-minni were designed with unrivaled battery life. They provide up to 5 hours of play time off of a single charge and when used in conjunction with the patented charging case, 40 hours of total play time can be achieved. It will get you through any workout and entertain you during days of travel.\n",
      "The ergonomic shape of Aou-mini is based on the analysis of dozens of different ear shapes, to achieve the best comfort and grip for most ear shapes in every situation. Just pop the it into your ears and play your music. \n",
      " Aou-mini are engineered to stay comfortably in your ears on the go during any activity. With a lightweight, comfort-fit design, you won’t feel anything except the music.\n",
      "The Aou-mini's charging compartment is designed as a built-in speaker. Using a unique digital signal processor, and customized ultra slim dynamic speaker, we eliminated every bit of wasted space and shrink the speaker down to a compact dimension without giving up high performance audio fidelity.\n",
      "When you put the earbuds into the storage box and turn on theswitch, you can enter the audio mode. \n",
      "Make your video accessible in other languages and to deaf and hard-of-hearing backers.\n",
      "Aluminum body and let music go wherever you go\n",
      "Aou-mini is designed to go wherever you go. And it's as durable as it is portable, with an aluminum body that delivers a quality and luxurious feel.    \n",
      "Another problem of the existing true wireless Bluetooth earbuds is when  taking calls, there is only one side of earphone working. Cause one  channel would be used for mic audio output. Benefit from the Bluetooth  5.0 tech, both of the earbuds could be the receiver of audio signal and  only take one channel. So when taking phone calls,  Aou-mini allow you to fully listen in both ears. \n",
      "With a gentle tap on the smart button on the Aou-mini, you can play/pause musics, answer/end calls and call up the digital assistant. \n",
      "With Qualcomm® aptX™ audio codec ensures high quality audio of Aou-mini wireless. Qualcomm® aptX™ audio coding algorithm provides a means to consistent, low latency and high-quality audio via Bluetooth. It has been used by major consumer electronics products, like the Samsung S9，B&O Beoplay H9, etc.\n",
      "Aou-mini automatically turns on, enters pairing mode and turns off when you are done using it.\n",
      "IPX5 rating makes Aou-mini earbuds & speaker perfect for outdoor activities on the beach,  poolside, car, boat or golf cart. It can resist gentle water spray and splash but not submersion in water.\n",
      "The charging case is small and lightweight enough to be stored in your pocket. We have added a hangable opening when designing the product, you can hang the product where you want to prevent it, or carry it anytime, anywhere. \n",
      "You can listen to music anytime, anywhere, in any outdoor activity, whether you want to use it as a earbuds or speaker.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We understand and acknowledge that no project comes without risks and challenges. Despite our planning, there are circumstances that may be out of our control. If we are met with these events, we promise to communicate with full transparency to you, our backers, and work to resolve all issues in a timely manner.\n",

      "CANNED LAUGHTER is a short film that tells the story of Deirdre Gossamer, a retired comedian who has knitted herself an audience in lieu of performing to a real one. \n",
      "But when one of her home-made punters comes to life and destroys her career memorabilia, she’s forced to re-think her attachment to the ‘glory days’ and face the once unthinkable prospect of moving on... \n",
      "Deirdre Gossamer is a woman caught in the grip of nostalgia for her own career. \n",
      "She's very much a character close to my own heart, caught in limbo between lauding her former glories yet feeling anchored down by them.\n",
      "Clinging on, not moving on.\n",
      "Looking back on my own fledgling comedy career over a decade ago, I often wonder where I'd be now had I pursued it further.  But unlike Deirdre Gossamer I always try to look ahead with fresh eyes instead of over my shoulder with rose-tinted ones.\n",
      "CANNED LAUGHTER builds upon a common theme in my work; of fringe figures and outsiders projecting their neuroses onto the inanimate. \n",
      "In Deirdre's case, her hand-knitted antagonist ‘The Heckler’ initially appears to embody the dissatisfaction she has with her lack of a career as it rampages through her memorabilia collection.  But by the time its trail of destruction peaks, Deirdre comes to understand something deeper about its actions, and ultimately herself...\n",
      "The Heckler is trying to teach her to let go.\n",
      "Loss is a rite of passage that everyone experiences, but what makes us human is how we react to that loss and what aspects of it we carry forward as we continue to move through life. \n",
      "In CANNED LAUGHTER Deirdre finds herself at that very juncture, confronting her own constructed stage-persona and being forced to re-consider her attachment to it. \n",
      "Without uttering a single word, The Heckler asks Deirdre the question at the heart of the film...\n",
      "What defines you?\n",
      "Deirdre Gossamer's antagonist in the film is the humourless, destructive audience member of her own making; The Heckler. \n",
      "Like everyone else in Deirdre's self-constructed crowd, The Heckler is cobbled together from a mix of tatty old clothes and junk, with his hands and face stitched together from one of Deirdre's trademark wooly jumpers.\n",
      "To bring this unusual character to life, we'll be using puppetry.\n",
      "I've always had a huge fascination and appreciation for the use of puppetry in films, which I was lucky enough to put into practice on my previous short film SCRAPS: \n",
      "The choice to animate the character of The Heckler this way, as opposed to using a creature costume or a live-action actor, is rooted in the idea that objects can take on lives of their own. \n",
      "Deirdre's collection of career memorabilia becomes more than just an assortment of nostalgic knick-knacks.  They become ghosts of a time in her life that haunt her.  \n",
      "The Heckler just takes this torment to the extreme.\n",
      " OLIVER JAMES HYMANS is an award-winning London-based puppet artist. He trained on the MA Scenography course at Central Saint Martins in 2006 and has since worked on a variety of theatre projects as a director, designer, performer and puppeteer. \n",
      "His work has been presented in theatres and beyond, including at the Little Angel Theatre, Tate Modern, The National Gallery, Camden Roundhouse, Museum of London, Almeida Theatre and Blind Summit Theatre.\n",
      "Oliver has also worked across short films and music videos, designing and puppeteering the eponymous puppet for Chris Brake’s short film SCRAPS, as well as the title character in HOW A KITE FLIES, voiced by Sir Ian McKellen. \n",
      "He also served as director of puppetry on a music video for The Correspondents and provided puppeteering for the Hot Chip video SPELL.\n",
      "CANNED LAUGHTER is the story of one woman's obsession with her glory days, and her inability to move past them.\n",
      "It follows in the footsteps of other 'faded star' films that explore the trappings of fame and its toxic allure for those who have lost it.  Films like WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE and SUNSET BOULEVARD that have characters in a state of arrested development at their heart. \n",
      "The look of these films, with their heavy shadows and high contrast lighting, is something we also want to draw inspiration from as we create the dark and dingy basement 'comedy club' where Deirdre relives her greatest moments.\n",
      "Throughout the film we'll also be using warped and cracked reflections as a recurring image, suggestive of both Deirdre's inability to escape her own reflections upon her career and her increasingly fragile state of mind as The Heckler's rampage takes its toll.  \n",
      "It's a motif that's used to powerful effect in other films as diverse as THE OLD DARK HOUSE, THE WRONG MAN and BAIT.\n",
      "For the handmade members of Deirdre's audience we'll also be taking inspiration from the paper bag masks of cartoonist SAUL STEINBERG, with their rictus grins that are permanently locked into silent laughs.  \n",
      "This odd assortment of inanimate punters are all that Deirdre has for company, so saying goodbye to them will be a true test of whether she can ever move on from the past.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "After I started cooking on my own, I realized my mom had been trying to kill me. Okay, that’s not really true. But I did realize that some of her recipes, while still delicious, could use a little California makeover. That’s what Family Style is all about. It’s been a labor of love turning my childhood favorites into healthier, wholesome dishes that still taste amazing.  \n",
      "A COOKBOOK FOR THE CONFLICTED MIDWESTERNER IN US ALL\n",
      "These days, most of us are seeking out healthier options—and all of us have less time to fuss in the kitchen. That’s why Family Style is made for everyone. Sure, you’ll find gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan recipes, but it’s designed to use however it fits your life, whether that’s as an everyday cookbook or as a go-to when you’re craving a taste of home but need both nourishment and comfort.\n",
      "Every dish in the book features my mom’s original recipe alongside my modified version, so you can follow step-by-step or make modifications of your own! I’ve made them easy to follow and accessible to make—after all, I’m just a home chef trying to cook like mom.\n",
      "I’ve also filled Family Style with my own notes and my mother’s wisdom, accompanied by beautiful photographs from my talented friend Jenna Peffley. \n",
      "WHERE IT ALL BEGAN\n",
      "Family Style began over lemon bars. My mom was visiting me in L.A. and we were preparing ingredients together. As she began reciting “butter, sugar, flour,” I was echoing with “coconut oil, coconut sugar, gluten-free flour.” She stopped me. “You can’t make these healthy! They won’t taste good!” But I knew that was far from the truth. And the idea for this cookbook was born.\n",
      "“Mom,” I told her. “I’m going to write a book, just like you always wanted me to.”\n",
      "GETTING TO HEALTHIER\n",
      "Don’t get me wrong—my mom is an amazing cook. I ate whatever she put in front of me (usually at 5:30pm) and never really thought about what was in it or whether it was good for me: Oreos, mac ‘n cheese, and all the meat, butter, and carbs you could ever want. But all that changed when I left home and I started cooking for myself. \n",
      "For one, I naturally gravitated away from meat. I didn’t love handling it and it was expensive! Then one of my friends was diagnosed as Celiac, and I made a pact to go gluten-free with her. This was a time when the gluten-free life was not trending, and options were seriously limited. I learned to get creative with substitutions, and these little changes gradually introduced me to the world of clean eating.\n",
      "That’s when I noticed a real change in my body. My skin cleared up, I had more energy, and I just felt good. I realized that cleaning up my diet actually changed my life.\n",
      "MAKING A CAREER OUT OF EATING (AND WRITING ABOUT IT)\n",
      "My own diet was just the first step. While I was experimenting with new ingredients in my tiny apartment kitchen, I was also studying journalism at Indiana University. After I graduated and moved to L.A., I started working as a TV host. My first gigs were in entertainment news covering celebrity gossip. It gave me valuable experience, yet it quickly burned me out. I began searching for what else was out there, and landed on a show called Food Feed on the Young Hollywood channel.\n",
      "That was it. Even after just the very first episode I felt this crazy excitement stirring up within me, and a new wish revealed itself: I wanted to make a career out of eating—or at least being in the world of food. So I continued to host Food Feed while also immersing myself in wellness, lifestyle, and food writing to bring it all together, contributing to Refinery29, The Chalkboard Mag and Angeleno Magazine. I’ve interviewed chefs, toured amazing restaurants, rolled up and my sleeves in kitchens, continuing to learn and eventually bringing these experiences to Family Style.\n",
      "MAKING AND PUBLISHING FAMILY STYLE\n",
      "Just like my entry into clean eating, my transition to writing a cookbook has been all about experimentation and learning. I had the idea (thanks to the lemon bars) but no idea on how to start.\n",
      "Luckily, I had an expert in my circle. Victor Gonzalez, founder of GRØSS Magazine, offered to help me publish it, and also helped me assemble my rockstar crew: Casey Martin of Play Studio to lend his design expertise, Jenna Peffley to photograph, Bridge Stuart to help with video and production, and Lisa Plachy to bring the writing together. Your contribution supports not just me and this endeavor, but all the partners who made Family Style possible.\n",
      "Meanwhile, it’s been my full-time job schlepping back and forth (and back and forth again) to every grocery store in L.A. as I assemble, bake, test and retest every recipe in Family Style. A special shoutout to every friend who received an assignment from me to also test the recipes to make sure it worked for everybody, not just me.\n",
      "But then, of course, I had to call mom. Over the past year we’ve exchanged endless texts and phone calls to share recipes. Most of the ones in Family Style came to me as pictures of post-it notes. Like most good cooks, my mom’s recipes were more in her head and heart than formally written down. It gave me extra room to make them my own, and of course, plenty of space to make them yours, too. \n",
      "THE MONEY\n",
      "We're printing a batch of 1,000 premium books which takes up a major portion of the funds we're raising. The remainder of the funds we raise go towards the branding & design, photography, videography, shipping, writing and overall production of this exciting book.  \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I'm so fortunate to be working with a seasoned team of professionals and friends which minimizes risks. The only thing big risk is that printing & or shipping may take a bit longer than expected but we've added in a bit of cushion to the production schedule to ensure on-time delivery!\n",

      "Hi friends. Time to get real with y'all for a minute and tell you that the whole music business is in your hands. That's right! Labels are dying. Record stores are dead -- streaming is in. But wait, there's more! : ]\n",
      "Streaming services like Spotify pay between nothing to half a penny per stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? Music royalties rates were written in the 1950's before streaming music was invented. So it's a new frontier, and currently songwriters like myself face a challenging road ahead. That's why a direct connection to an audience is the one saving grace for an independent musician like me. \n",
      "Even a million streams a year equals around $13 per day. \n",
      "Old music business: Artists would spend a bunch of money (or borrow from a label), make a record, and hope to sell enough to make the money back and stay afloat till the next project. My first studio record, Congress Hotel cost upwards of $50,000 to make, distribute, and promote.  New music business:The artist launches a pre-sale for the record before it is made. If there isn't enough demand for the project (i.e. the artist doesn't reach their funding goal), all the people who backed the project get their money back and the record doesn't get made. If the campaign is successful though, the artist can make the record without having to worry about the initial costs or if they'll sell enough to make it back.\n",
      "This is HUGE for 3 reasons. \n",
      "1. Y'all are the new record label. Which is good because I'm making music for you, not for the music industry. \n",
      "2. Kickstarter offers something the traditional music business doesn't. EXPERIENCE AND COMMUNITY. I've done 2 Kickstarters in the past, and saw how much more FUN it is to launch a record this way. Having you along for the process of making it, sharing the updates, getting your feedback on the song choices, artwork, etc., is a way better experience than it would be just making it on my own and putting it on iTunes / Spotify. \n",
      "3. Lastly, I know not everyone wants to pay as little as possible for music. I know that there are many out there that truly believe in artists, that care about and want to see independent artists continue making art. If you're reading this, you're likely one of these people already (thank you!). So this is where Kickstarter makes such a difference. Pre-purchasing a record or any of the extra rewards through a campaign like this provides the absolute biggest bang for the buck in terms of what the artist gets to keep. So your contribution here has a bigger impact than nearly any other way of buying or streaming music. \n",

      "With your help, we want to get the first 4 chapters of this legend into one beautiful, shiny book. (Some say \"graphic novels,\" some say \"trade paperback.\" I say, \"beautiful, shiny book.\")\n",
      "Ok, it's the royal \"we,\" because it's me - Kelci Crawford, maker of fine comics for nearly 8 years. And I've run KickStarter campaigns nearly every year since I started, so I know what I'm doing.\n",
      "The Legend of Jamie Roberts is under my small-press company, Fantasyville Productions, LLC. Sounds like a fancy title, like Captain O'Malley. But sadly, I am a one-person operation on a tight budget, which is why I'm on KickStarter to begin with.\n",
      "This is the story I needed when I was a teenager - confused about my gender identity, wanting to sail the seas and go adventuring away from my positively crap-tastic circumstances. I'm making this story for all those out there like teenage-me, sailing the chaotic seas of their own identity, wanting something new and exciting and adventurous!\n",

Moementality is a comedic peek into the life and mind of a mother that suffers from the relentless monotony of everyday parenting, overactive imagination, and the challenges of being a raging chocoholic with social anxiety. This comic strip has been a passion project of mine since 2016 when it began, and since it's creation I have always hoped to see it come together in print. And that, my friends, is why we are here! \n",
      "This 44 page book will feature my favorite comics from the webcomic Moementality, as well as fifteen brand new, never-before-seen comic strips that you won't find anywhere else. These high quality books are a first edition printing, and will be numbered and signed.\n",
      "In addition to that, there are stickers available, original sketch cards, post cards, and even a calendar featuring Hershel the Hot Chocolate character, for your viewing pleasure!\n",
      "These days, we could all use a laugh. Parenting is already a mix of struggle and laughs,  and this past year it's been more struggle than we'd all like. I'd like this book to be a light in the dark, and bring laughter to those who need a bit of levity. Although this comic is inspired by my life, it's not just about me. The best thing about Moe is that when you read the comics, I think you'll find that whoever you are, whatever stage of life you find yourself in, you'll find a bit of Moe in you too. \n",
      "Rewards for this Kickstarter include high quality vinyl stickers, post cards, personally drawn original sketch cards, and even a saucy calendar featuring Hershel (move over, Chippendale!). This calendar's photo size is 6.5 x 8.5. so it won't overwhelm your wall. The calendar runs from April 2021 - March 2022, so there are no wasted months! You'll get to enjoy hot chocolate allll year long... \n",
      "I like to say that I am a human being made entirely out of coffee and chocolate, and it's mostly true. I achieved a BFA in sequential art from the Savannah College of Art and Design, and draw in a variety of styles. I am often working on projects with dark and gritty themes, so I like to balance that out by also drawing things that put a smile on your face. Projects that I've worked on include Whiz Bang the Boy Robot, The Black Wall, and many freelance and personal projects which include the webcomic Moementality.\n",

      "Go Get a Roomie! can be read online for free HERE! Book 1 and 2 are sold HERE!\n",
      "Chlove, the author of Go Get a Roomie!, is teaming up with Hiveworks again to print the third book of the now completed webcomic! This third printed book will contain chapters 24 to 33, plus some special bonus material, and of course, it’s printed in color - specifically in the pink tint you know and love.\n",
      "A lot can happen within a group of friends. Sometimes they become roomies. Sometimes they grow into something more, all of them forming different kinds of families together.\n",
      "Go Get a Roomie! is the light-hearted and tender story of the evolving relationship between Roomie, the fun-loving sensual hippie, and Lillian, the sleepy story-teller and vivid dreamer. Gravitating around them is a cast of diverse characters including Ramona, the angry a-dolt, and Richard, the bubbly sub. The third book follows these characters as connections shift, tempers rise, and understanding and hugs are found.\n",
      "Where is Roomie going, with that happy smile and drunken saunter? How is Lillian changing, still safekeeping her precious dreams and stories, but growing accustomed to Roomie's chaste presence in her bed... to a point where sleeping alone feels off? Why is Ramona so reluctant to explore her soft and spiritual side, unable to compromise the hardcore image she's been building for so long? And little Richie boy... just go get that prince of yours and be careful with them, okay?\n",
      "Go Get a Roomie! can be described as a sensual, dreamlike, and spiritual comedy, built lovingly over ten years. The story is told in a strip format and focuses on the themes of joy, connectivity and personal growth. It's also very gay. Unbelievably gay. Most of the cast is queer (LGBT+) and much of the story is focused on queer romance.\n",
      "The comic is aimed at an adult audience and contains (non-sexualized) nudity.\n",
      "Go Get a Roomie! was distributed online through the publisher and studio Hiveworks. While the webcomic has now completed its decade-long run, it is still welcoming both new and old readers with open arms, as the strips are being \"re-run\" with author commentary during 2021 and 2022 while Chlove prepares a new comic for online serialization.\n",
      "Books 1 & 2 of Go Get a Roomie! have been Kickstarted (and printed) in 2014 and 2018 respectively, with the 2018 edition including a reprint of book 1. Thanks to the success of those Kickstarters, we can now bring you book 3!\n",
      "Book 3 contains chapters 24 to 33, along with some bonus material. It is designed to match book 1 & 2 perfectly. The books are printed in color, measuring in at 9x7 inches and are available in three formats: ebook, softcover, and hardcover.\n",
      "We'll be producing brand-new merchandise to sweeten the deal on higher tiers! Here are the different options you can select as a backer:\n",
      "The rewards in the Goodie bundle include a double-sided bookmark, a mini print, and a sticker sheet. Higher tiers include signed bookplates - a stylish adhesive plate autographed and numbered by Chlove herself. Bookplates will be received with a lining covering the sticky side. Backers can then remove the lining and stick the bookplate wherever they please in their book. \n",
      "Fans who have not yet purchased any of the books but find they have a Roomie-shaped gap in their bookcase have the chance to purchase books 1-2-3 in a trilogy bundle. A few lucky fans will be able to back the tiers to receive one of the original traditionally drawn strips.\n",
      "* We will consult backers to see which strips they would like, but not all strips are available.\n",
      "As the two previous Kickstarters included a special stretch goal to print a limited hardcover edition of book 1 and 2, we decided to include the hardcover option in this project from the start. We are not including any stretch goals in this campaign so as to focus the collected budget on the production of both editions.\n",
      "The Hiveworks team will be assisting Chlove during the campaign by managing updates, backer contact, as well as printing and shipping. However, this campaign faces a unique challenge - book production and shipping to backers will be heavily impacted by covid. 2021 is still carrying the issues created by the pandemic of 2020. We will, as always, do our best to meet the suggested estimated delivery date and have made sure to pad the estimated dates to work around potential delays. However, those potential delays are harder to predict and circumvent in the current situation. We thank you all for your kindness and patience in this trying time!\n",

      " *Case design might slightly vary it's final design (always looking cooler)\n",
      "Three years ago Ramon Mañas, the founder of Odisei Music moved to Berlin to study Song Writing. While living there, he started learning how to play the saxophone his cousin gave him. At that time he was sharing a flat with 2 other musicians and he started facing the first serious problem. \n",
      "PROBLEM 1)\n",
      "It's a loud instrument - so practicing late at night was impossible and practicing at other times was not easy because you disturb your family and neighbors. (Even if you are a superb PRO player). \n",
      "One day his neighbours even called the police 👮‍♂🚨🚔 because he was playing the saxophone at 10 pm. Fortunately, nothing serious happened.\n",
      "At that time however, he had no choice other than start practicing in different places like public parks. This was cool until the winter came. \n",
      "On top of travelling a lot for business, he started facing a second problem. \n",
      "PROBLEM 2)\n",
      "Carrying the saxophone when travelling is very expensive and it is not convenient because it is a heavy instrument.\n",
      "He started looking for solutions in the market to solve his problem and he found very few options 🤷‍♂.\n",
      "The electronic saxophones he found where too big to carry them on a daily basis and the keys weren't feeling like playing a real saxophone.\n",
      "At that point, he decided, together with his friend Guillem to start building the first real electronic Travel Sax prototype. \n",
      "While developing Travel Sax we interviewed more than 50 different saxophone players and we noticed that all of them had the same two problems (noise and transportation). So, we set out design objectives.\n",
      "1. Design the smallest and lightest electronic saxophone in the market.\n",
      "2. Make sure that the position of the Keys and the pressure needed to play them where as similar as a conventional saxophone.\n",
      "3. Create a user-friendly instrument that helps saxophone players practice without disturbing anyone.\n",
      "4. Develop a smartphone app that helps you set practicing routines and teaches you cool saxophone concepts.\n",

We want you to become part of this project from the beginning, and feel part of the Travel Sax community. We are sure that Travel Sax will change the way Saxophone players practice and it will help them improve much faster.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Hello, my name is Anna (also known as private.milk on most social media).\n",
      "Around last year I got invested into Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor, and noticed how little merchandise there is from the show and manga. Simply put, this is a passion project born from my love of the series and my want to see plush toys from it! I decided to create designs of Kaiji and Kazuya as their relationship was one of the more impactful to me from the series.\n",
      "The plush is sized at 20 cm (or ~7.9 inches) and would be be made with fleece materials and embroidery.\n",
      "This kickstarter is to help me gauge how many others feel the same way and to fund this project (as ordering plushies from a manufacturer is an expensive venture).\n",
      "IMPORTANT NOTE (PLEASE READ BEFORE PLEDGING): This kickstarter is targeted to fund the Kaiji plush first and foremost. This is because of my expectations of how many people will help to fund this project. HOWEVER, if the project gets more funding than expected, the Kazuya plush will get made, as well. I included both designs to gauge people's interest in the project. The funding will cover the cost I took out on both samples and if the Kazuya plush gets made, you can sub him in exchange for Kaiji (on either the single or double plushie pledge), but note that this is by no means guaranteed. Leftovers will be put on my Etsy shop. Put more simply, Kazuya is a stretch goal plush if and only we get past the initial $3,000. Please do not buy the 2 plush pledge under the expectation that Kazuya is guaranteed to get funded. Thank you!\n",
      "Finally, production of the final plush will only start once and if the Kickstarter gets funded. Seeing as I'm giving this campaign a 60 day trial, I wanted to plan around the possibility around any delays in shipping, so I'm guessing the delivery of the plush would be around September (but I will keep everyone updated if that changes!).\n",
      "To keep up with any major updates, please check out either my instagram (private.milk) or my twitter (@Private_Milk_).\n",
      "If you wish to support the project without actually getting a plushie, any shares or small donations are greatly appreciated. I'm not the type to ask of things like that, but I would love to see this project get off the ground. Thank you so much for reading and considering supporting my little passion project! :D Zawa Zawa~  \n",
      " Out of curiosity, I also made a poll for interest in any future FKMT themed plushies:\n",
      "https://strawpoll.com/polls/XmZRj88MPZd \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "It's very possible that this project won't get fully funded (or heck, funded at all if it doesn't garner attention), so this kickstarter will only start the production phase if it gets decent amount of funding. Another risk is that the manufacturer may be delayed for any number of reasons, as we are still going through a pandemic at this time. This is all a learning process for me, as I am new at selling a product; but I poured many hours into researching how to do so. I hope it all goes smoothly, but these are the risks associated with this project. As a point of reference, I would need 50 backers of the single plush in order to fund the project. If I wanted to fund Kazuya without going out of pocket, I would need around 100 backers.\n",

      "\"DAY 1\"\n",
      "I have been dreaming of the day that I could release a solo studio album since I was 11 years old and first played bass in church. Since that day, I have sought to play music that inspires hope in people and gives glory to the creator. Which is why I am over the moon excited to be recording and releasing this album! \n",
      "Utilizing crowdfunding is empowering me to make an album that is true to my vision and doesn't compromise it's message of the overwhelming and incredible love of the Father, shown through His son Jesus and given to us by His Spirit. Also this album is just plain funky! So if the lyrics don't grab you the hard grooves and expert notes layed down by musicians: Tom Amend (Keys), Julian Carey (Bass), and Brian Claxton (Drums) will make your booty sway all day long.  \n",
      "I held nothing back on this album. There are songs with full percussion breaks, songs with fat horn lines and even songs with a gospel choir!  I am so proud of this album and can't wait to blow you away with what myself and some incredible people have created.  \n",
      "I have grown up playing music in many different fields and have garnered connections all over the world.  This record will be promoted and used to build up people in all walks of life and will lead to opportunities for more people to get involved and create music that brings hope and love to this earth.  \n",
      "When you give to this project simply tell me what \"You want\" and I will deliver it to you. Whether it is a copy of the album, a personalized singing message or a song written just for you; I want to give you something that shows my immense gratitude for you helping me create this album.\n",
      "Thanks for taking the time to check out this project and I can't wait to share the finished product with you!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Making an album can be a slow moving and expensive task.  I began recording this album in May and have been back several times to Mighty Fine Studios in Denver, Colorado. The challenge of finding studio time, working with schedules of musicians and engineers has made this projects timeline expand beyond what I had originally planned.  The plus side of this is I have had time to really workshop the songs and be sure that they are presented in the best and most clear way. But, as studio time extends, expenses extend. Fortunately I have already had plenty of experience in creating, promoting and delivering a quality album, having co-written, produced and promoted every album \"The Burroughs\" have released. If I am given the resources I know I can deliver something that is worth not only the money but the time spent creating it.\n",

      "Hey guys,\n",
      "I took two years out, no performances, no new music, stayed low key. Studio- home- studio-home and endless writing sessions. I had to compromise many friendships to get to this space, because staying focused has been The Priority and I do hope many of you can forgive me for being so absent. I finished 4 or 5 projects during that time, but nothing was good enough, nothing was truly ME. I've gone through a break up, a  creative depression, lost some good friends, reached a quarter life crisis and then ... it finally came, 5 months of inspiration that lead me to writing my best work yet. \"Situationships\" is going to be a playlist, with a new song released every couple of weeks, a collection of my thoughts, feelings and experiences all in one place. Drawing references to social media, infidelity and passion, the music will leave you pondering the complexity of your own relationships. It truly speaks for the emotional state of this generation.\n",
      "I'm a very proud person, but the truth is - I can't do this alone.\n",
      "I shot two videos already, the first one will be dropping on the 9th of May. I need to do more, I MUST do more and I need your support. I must shoot another two videos. I've put my everything into this, literally everything I have, so I just need a little help. I need a minimum of £800 just to cover the costs of videos, if we can get more, that would be amazing, I will use the rest for PR. \n",
      "I can't tell you how much this means to me. I live and breathe music, I can't wait to get back on the stage. I would appreciate every contributions whether it's £1 or £50, does not matter, I will be extremely grateful. You can share this with a few friends or people you think might support it.\n",

      "Chef Bear is teaming up with Chef Osa Bear and their cub Lil' Osito Bear to bring you the first ever cookbook from Cow by Bear. Equal parts mouthwatering recipes and amusing biography, the book will be accompanied by gorgeous photography and whimsical illustrations. With an estimated 200 original recipes, this fully-colored, hardcover cookbook promises to be like no other on your shelf.  \n",
      "Hello you beautiful human! My name is Chef Bear. I imagine I've had the great pleasure of mingling with many of you at one of my Cow by Bear gastronomical experiences, but if this is our first meeting please allow me to introduce myself.\n",
      "I was born many moons ago in Kodiak, Alaska. I spent my youth like any other cub, playing caribou eyes and raiding the tents of unsuspecting campers. My idyllic world all came crashing down, however, when I was witness to my parents' grizzly murder by the hands of poachers. I was kidnapped and sold into a traveling circus. While in France performing stunts with the bearded lady, I seized an opportunity to flee my circus-performing captors. I was quickly befriended by a group of local artists who introduced me to human culture and cultivated my \"awakening,\" in which I learned to walk, talk and, most importantly, cook. I ultimately worked my way up to head chef at a famous Parisian restaurant before taking my talents on the road all over the globe. It's so crazy to think about now, but I have cooked on every continent and in over 100 countries, bringing people together with my wild dinner parties.\n",
      "In 2011, after a series of traumatic events, I arrived in San Diego and opened the first official Cow by Bear location.  \n",
      "Cow by Bear is a 'dinner party experience experiment' started out of my downtown San Diego den in 2011. It has grown more than I ever could have imagined since then, operating nearly every night in secret locations around San Diego, Seattle and Savannah (GA). Reserved to just 14 guests in a communal, social setting, the experience is designed to bring strangers together at one table, connecting them via the best food, drink and story imaginable. It's a place where you not only eat a world class meal cooked by a bear, but leave with new friends and stories to remember. \n",
      "Now with Food by Bear, I'll be sharing my tales and giving you the recipes and tools needed to bear fruit with your own dinner parties, bringing people together around your magical table. \n",
      "I have wanted to write this cookbook forever, but between the rigorous Cow by Bear dinner schedule and intermittent hibernating, I haven't been able to find the time to write a truly great memoir (and yes, this is a memoir. I can't write a cookbook without writing about what got me to this place). After recently deciding to wind down the Cow by Bear dinner series, I've taken a deep dive into my diaries and recipe journals to organize the crème de la crème into this book. I've been writing a monthly newsletter with stories and recipes for years now, but this cookbook will contain nearly 200 new and original recipes never before published. Hardback and fully colored, it will be every bit as epic as our guests have come to expect from Cow by Bear.    \n",
      "Food by Bear will be structured by my experiences cooking and hosting dinner parties in eight different countries that have a particularly raucous significance in my journey. Beginning in France where I had my awakening and ending in San Diego with the creation of Cow by Bear, the book will take you through everything I've learned along the way in my fabled journey. Mix and match recipes from various chapters or stick to the script, I'll give you everything you need to create your own dinner party experience experiment.\n",
      "Cow by Bear would never have sustained for so long without the support of so many of you fine humans and it's my hope we can draw from that same spirit to bring this book to life.\n",
      "Let's do this together!  \n",
      "Much of the content for this book has already been created, and I'm now testing a series of new recipes and the stories that inspired them. I have a wonderful team assembled to produce the photography and illustrations that will assist in making this a truly unique cookbook. I can bearly wait to put it in your paws.\n",
      "I originally intended this book to be traditionally published, but after conversations with several publishers it became clear they wouldn't allow me to write the book my way. My spiritual advisor, the Great Oso, suggested Kickstarter.\n",
      "I've consulted with a sloth of human professionals and concluded the $35,000 fundraising goal is the minimum needed to produce, print and deliver the first run of this book in a way that I would be proud to put my stamp on. Any amount raised above that will go towards further enhancing the quality of the book (recipe count, paper type, dimensions of the book), marketing and to print more copies once it sells out. Your support will go directly towards creating the best book possible with each and every one of my special creature powers. \n",
      "Cow by Bear began as a grass roots experience. There was never any money or outside backing involved, just a wild idea and even wilder guests that were interested in something fresh. That's exactly what I'm aiming for with Food by Bear - a cookbook like no other and enough humans out there crazy enough to want to be a part of it.\n",
      "Thank you all from the bottom of my big bear heart!\n",
      "I'm pleased to offer not only several levels to pledge for the Food by Bear cookbook itself, but other exciting ways to be involved with and help support the project. The Collector's Package gets you the cookbook along with the essentials from every Cow by Bear dinner: my apron, a flask to carry your Haitian rhum, four dinner plates and four sets of cutlery. \n",
      "The remaining Cow by Bear dinners on our calendar are sold out and I don't plan on offering that (un)traditional experience in the future. Exclusive to this campaign, however, we're offering two ways to attend a Cow by Bear dinner: pledge for 1) your own private party of 14 guests or 2) two seats at a small run of special dinners we're putting on to support Food by Bear. Both experiences come with a signed copy of the book for every guest in attendance. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Please bear in mind that a cookbook can be a lengthy production. I am estimating the delivery of the book at twenty months. I believe this to be highly conservative and hope to under-promise and over-deliver. That said, the most important aspect of this cookbook is that it's as fantastic as it can possibly be, so I want to make sure we give ourselves as much time as necessary to achieve our goals and account for any unexpected delays. By understanding the process of what it takes to produce this book and the potential hurdles we could be up against, I hope we are able to mitigate the risk posed by any of the challenges we may face.\n",

      " Precious Rascals is a slice-of-life comic strip that documents the happenings of our household. I started making the strips as a way to record family memories, so in a way it's like a family album that I'm sharing with you! It's been fun to look back and watch the style of the strips evolve over time as our kids grow up. Come by and hang out with our family! \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Glo uses interactive technology to transform the sounds of your world into a melodic ambient soundtrack. Relaxing, meditative and fun, it matches your mood with the push of a button. \n",
      "There are four basic soundscapes or \"channels\". Each one has a different rhythm and background texture, inspired by one of the elements: Earth, Air, Water and Fire. You can enjoy forests with birds, howling winds, waves of the sea and fantastic space frequencies. \n",
      "You create your own musical theatre, designed to invoke positive emotions. Your polyphonic whale composes these soundscapes by integrating surrounding sound – your singing, humming, tapping on a surface, leaves rustling in the trees or under your feet, a barking dog or laughing child.\n",
      "There is no doubt that sounds of nature have positive effects on our minds. That's why we’ve chosen only natural sounds as a base for your ambient soundscapes. Waves lapping on the sea shore, birds chirping, wind playing in the trees. All this evokes feelings with psychological benefits, from nostalgia to optimism, social connectedness and self-esteem. \n",
      "These uplifting and calming sounds play a big role in regulating our emotions and attitude towards our own self. \n",
      "We believe that Glo can help you to find your voice and be confident in it. Singing or humming makes us happy, relieves anxiety... Music has great healing powers. \n",
      "The way Glo reacts to your voice is very interesting; you can imagine it as oscillating strings that resonate with your singing. When you hit the correct note, Glo responds by amplifying it further into its characteristic deep, bright tones, giving you instant feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Motion Algorithm \n",
      "The Whale is aware of its orientation in 3D space. To make your track even more interesting, variations are introduced depending on roll and pitch. For example, when you are in the “Water” channel and you dive the Whale’s head down, the sound of sea waves increases. When it emerges back from the deep, the waves will slowly fade away, giving more space for the environmental ambience.\n",
      "When the Whale rolls around, effects are applied to the sound making it even more mesmerizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prototype - Currently implemented functionality \n",
      "The videos below are a raw and unedited recording from the whale, no added effects or post processing (only cut to make the demo shorter). The external sound is not mixed in apart from a few seconds here and there to demonstrate what comes in from the environment. \n",
      " All glitches and hisses included :) In the final version the plastic buttons will be replaced with silicone (currently they are very crackly).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is exactly how we recorded sounds for the Kickstarter video (you can find the music without voiceover here).\n",
      "There are other demos on our Youtube Channel. \n",
      "The Whale does not have a built-in speaker although it might look like it does, thanks to the \"gills\" (or grills? :) these are there so the sound can reach microphones. \n",
      "Listening to these demos on headphones will give you a precise idea of what would you hear from the whale itself.\n",
      "It is very easy to grasp the controls and understand how different movements translate to sound effects and variations. You don’t need to be a musician to play it; you will be in a full control of the soundscape in no time. However, the mighty whale may have a surprise for you here and there. \n",
      "There is no screen to guide you through channels and options. We designed it this way to minimize distractions. Simply press ‘ON’ button and channel 1 will start. To switch between channels press ON button repeatedly. Be creative and explore sound possibilities. If you want to give your brain a special treat, enable the binaural beats mode by holding the ‘ON’ button for 4 seconds.\n",
      " \n",
      "We recommend you use this option sitting or lying down with your eyes closed. Do not overdo it if you are just starting, it is quite a workout for your brain and you need to give it time to adapt. Just 10 minutes is enough in the beginning. To switch back to the normal mode, just press the ‘ON’ button once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case is made from a combination of maple and american chestnut-tree wood with eco-friendly beeswax finish. Each durable case is beautifully handmade and unique with a responsive silicon keypad. \n",
      "Pocket Size: The device fits into your pocket comfortably, however you will be tempted to fish it out very often! :) It runs on two AA batteries. \n",
      "This is optional and experimental feature. You do not have use it and it is not something that can get activated accidentally. At the moment it is not integrated into the main firmware, only exists in a separate code branch. \n",
      " It works by alternating one of the polyphonic voices by a frequency difference. We want to work with people who are interested in this subject to gather feedback and fine tune the functionality. The goal is to make it work well, while soundscapes keep their pleasant sound.\n",
      "What are binaural beats? \n",
      "For example, when you are studying, your encephalogram may show patterns with frequency around 20 Hz which we call Beta waves (12.5 Hz to 30 Hz). When you are relaxing with your eyes closed, your EEG will show frequencies around 10 Hz, Alpha waves (7.5 Hz to 12.5 Hz). In 1839 German professor Heinrich Wilhelm Dove discovered that we can actually stimulate the brain to activate these frequencies by creating external sounds with certain properties - binaural beats. \n",
      "So imagine you would like to use your lunch break to meditate, but it’s difficult to quiet down your mind during a busy day. With binaural beats, you can “slow down” your brain to Theta frequencies and enjoy an effective meditation in a short time. How this works is that each of your ears receives sound of different frequencies through headphones and your brain recognises the difference. If one ear is receiving 87 Hz and another 82 Hz, your brain focuses on the 5 Hz gap and actually generates the illusion of that frequency, which you can hear. \n",
      " There are four basic types of brain waves that can be triggered by a binaural beats program. They are defined by a frequency at which neural signals oscillate:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "We are Anna and Mario, designer/developer team based in Ireland. Our background is in design, programming and arts & crafts. \n",
      "In 2016 we ran our first Kickstarter - Gecho Loopsynth, a polyphonic pocket synthesizer, which was successfully funded and fulfilled to everyone's satisfaction. \n",

      "This is our second venture where we are evolving our proven concept of digital synthesizer into a more portable format.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the heart of the whale ticks a powerful dual‑core signal processor, as found in many digital synthesizers (but hardly ever in this form factor, the board is only 53x25mm). We also included a dedicated high quality, low noise audio chip to handle inputs and outputs to ensure nothing is lost when Glo sings. \n",
      "If you are not afraid of the soldering iron, there are more possibilities for you. Make your own music instrument, designed in any way you want or \"circuit bend\" an existing toy.\n",
      "This tier is offering the same board as used in the wooden whale tier, with all SMD elements in place but allows for modifications. The additional SMD elements are for alternative powering scheme - rechargeable cell, also for Rx/Tx indication of USB-serial line (uploading and downloading firmware). \n",
      "You do not have to solder everything on to make it work; if you want to put the board into an enclosure of your choice and keep it powered with two AAA batteries as usual, you only need to solder 2 wires - positive and negative wire to the battery holder.\n",
      "More information about DIY options (diagrams, schematics and wiring examples) can be found here.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "This is a complex hardware product and brings associated risks. To minimize them we are going to work with manufacturers with whom we have had a good experience in our previous project. The critical components i.e. wooden cases, electronics and silicon keypads are made by contractors in EU. They will sub-contract certain operations to Asia but it would be to their trusted partner. PCB assembly is carried out in Poland and all woodworking in Slovakia.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid common problem of elements shortage, where possible we chose readily stocked parts, and where that was not possible we have started stocking any harder to get components to do our best to ensure sufficient supply for the first production batch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain parts of the functionality are still work in progress. The risk is that the version of the software you will receive with your unit might contain bugs. There should be enough time to iron it out and ship with fully tested firmware, however if something slips through, you may need to update your unit later via a micro USB cable.\n",
      "\n",
      "There might be delays caused by manufacturing of accessories too (e.g. hard cases), as some of these are made outside of EU. To minimize this we are already scheduling the production where possible.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "TUNNELS is a new type of Eurorack utility module that allows you to duplicate and route signals across your modular synthesizer.  We call it the “Infinite Multiple,” but you could also describe it as an “Inter-Panel Buffered Multiple,” or perhaps a “Mult Bus.”  \n",
      "TUNNELS is comprised of two distinct modules : TUNNEL IN and TUNNEL OUT.  The TUNNEL IN module by itself is a buffered multiple, duplicating an input signal to create multiple outputs.  The TUNNEL OUT module expands the TUNNEL IN module to add additional outputs at another location in your synthesizer.  TUNNEL OUT modules can be chained together infinitely to create massive buffered multiple banks or send common signals like clocks and 1v/oct signals to strategic locations in your synth.\n",
      "The TUNNEL IN module has three inputs, each routed to a pair of outputs.  When disconnected, the inputs are normalled to the previous input, allowing for a variety of configurations.  With the first input connected it is a 1 in : 6 out multiple.  Using the first two inputs makes a 1 in : 2 out multiple and a 1 in : 4 out multiple.  With all three inputs connected, it acts as three 1 in : 2 out multiples.\n",
      "The TUNNEL OUT module receives the three channels from TUNNEL IN via a TUNNEL LINK cable, adding three additional buffered outputs per channel.  With one input connected, for example, you would now have a 1 in : 15 out multiple.  Add additional TUNNEL OUT modules to expand your TUNNELS system however you see fit.\n",
      "Because TUNNELS is a buffered (non-passive or powered) multiple, critical signals like 1 volt per octave control voltages are able to maintain their integrity regardless of the size of the TUNNELS system.   \n",
      "TUNNELS is engineered with live-patching in mind.  Normalled connections between inputs are also buffered, preventing the momentary short that can happen with other multiples. This means no dropped clocks or audible glitches in modulation or pitch while working on your patch.\n",
      "Both TUNNEL IN and TUNNEL OUT modules are 4 HP and have a depth of 1.5\" (38mm) from the backside of the front panel to the top of the Link cable when plugged in.\n",
      "Max Current Draw :TUNNEL IN +12v 33mA -12v 20mA+ 5v 0 mA\n",
      "TUNNEL OUT+12v 36mA -12v 26mA+ 5v 0 mA\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "In Japan there is a concept of \"michi\" (道) often meaning road or path, where the kanji character is used for tea ceremony (茶道), flower arrangement (華道), judo (柔道), and kendo (剣道). It is so much more than just learning techniques or skills, it is about how to move your body, how to handle the tools, starting and finishing, how to show respect to the other person, etc. Cherishing the sincerity of the heart. Basically, it is a place of learning to live as a person.\n",
      " I noticed that the calligraphy box set that many of the adult students would use were the exact same ones made for children that you buy in elementary school. This was something disappointing to see.\n",
      "I searched all over but just could not find a nice box set anywhere. “If there isn’t one, let’s make one!” So when I made up plans for a calligraphy box set that would be suitable for adults, I got a big response and support from people, some even saying they wanted to start up calligraphy again using this box set.\n",
      "Then I started hearing people from other countries also saying how they thought calligraphy looked cool and that they wanted to try too, but didn’t know what sort of supplies they needed. So I started to think how about I’d like to introduce this calligraphy box set to foreigners too and have them experience the comfort and pleasantness of calligraphy.\n",
      "Today we are surrounded by a lot of information and are busy every day. As technology advances and everything becomes more convenient, the brain actually feels more exhausted even if things are physically easier to do. This might be why many people are looking for healing and comfort in yoga, meditation, and Zen teachings. In Japan, calligraphy is also considered something to create calmness. Calligraphy is so much more than just writing practice.  For example, while arranging the brushes, inkstones, sumi ink sticks, calligraphy paper, etc., one by one, you gradually shift away from all the thoughts in your head, and the rhythm of rubbing the ink stick calms your breathing. Then once you start writing your breathing adjusts again, and the comfortable tension and black-and-white graciously unravels your mind as the sound of the brush running along the paper and the scent of ink takes you into even further relaxation and enjoyment. When you have finished writing you put the tools back in their place, and once there is nothing on the table, you will find a new and refreshed you, your work, and your calligraphy kit quietly dazed.\n",
      "Japanese calligraphy is when you write letters or characters with a brush, which uses a special ink stick (“sumi”) that you can adjust its density/boldness with water. The brush itself is very expressive. Depending on how it is used it exhibits a variety of expressions.\n",
      "For example, “kasure”, a more harsh scratch looking drybrush streak is one of the most dynamic, greatest features in Japanese calligraphy. By having these strokes, it can express many different feelings and emotions such as a sense of movement and force, happiness or loneliness, even joy or anger. \n",
      "Another feature is “nijimi”, a completely different technique that creates the ink to naturally bleed. Depending on the property of the paper and the thickness of the ink, you will get a completely different expression and look. You can express warmth and coldness, softness and hardness, and some people even sense the passing of time or seasons, weather, and brightness. Just like any other piece of art, each person is able to both express themselves and perceive it differently. How do you interpret it? What sort of impression does it leave? \n",
      "                  And with that, let's get to writing characters!\n",
      "This is the kanji (Chinese character) for \"cloud\" (“kumo” in Japanese). It is necessary to practice like this, but even though you only black ink, you will be surprised at all the various expressions you can give off with the same character. Already, it is art.\n",
      "Next, let's write someone’s name. For example, Noah and Emma.\n",
      "There are three types of characters in Japanese; kanji (Chinese characters), hiragana, and katakana. Among those three, there are many characters that have the same pronunciation but use different kanji to create a word. So for the name Noah for example, you can use some kanji characters you like to create the name like 乃亜 or 野阿. It is also fun making business cards with the name you wrote yourself.\n",
      "【 細筆・太筆 】 - Fine Brush / Thick Brush -\n",
      "The brush is one of the leading tools in calligraphy. There are many types of brushes, such as soft, stiff, long, short, etc., which you use depending on the expression matter and personal taste. Using each of them to learn about their characteristics and features, finding a brush that suits you best is one of the joys in Japanese calligraphy. For this project, the brushes I chose for the set are standard brushes that are easy for anyone to handle and allows one to frankly express themselves. It includes a thick brush that allows you to write large characters/letters and thick lines, and a small brush that you can use when you want to create smaller characters/letters for things like letters to someone.\n",
      "【 硯 】 - Inkstone, “Suzuri” -\n",
      "An inkstone is a tool in calligraphy that creates ink by adding water to a solidified ink block while rubbing against it. Since the inkstone produces a good amount of ink, it is almost like it is bottled liquid ink in itself. Inkstones are made by carving out natural stones one by one. In recent years, there are many cases where light plastic inkstones are used because they do not break even if dropped, but since you cannot grind against the solid ink, we decided to use a naturally made inkstone for this project.\n",
      "【 墨 】 - Ink stick, “Sumi” -\n",
      "There are two types of ink, solid and liquid. The solid ink is a collection of soot that has hardened and takes a good amount of time and effort to be made which is why it is a bit more expensive than its liquid form. Even when using it, you need to grind it against an inkstone until you get the right concentration while adding water. It takes a bit of time to prepare before you actually start writing. In that respect, the liquified ink is already a liquid, so it can be used immediately and is more convenient when you need a large amount of ink. However, there is a slight difference in expression between the ink produced from grinding solid ink and liquid ink which is due to factors like the grain/particle sizes. It is said that the solid ink creates a deeper and more interesting finish.\n",
      "*This set does not contain ink.\n",
      "【 水滴 】 - Calligraphy Water-Dropper, “Suiteki” -\n",
      "The “suiteki”, a water-dropper is a water dish used when grinding/rubbing the ink stick ink or to adjust the density of ink in Japanese calligraphy. To have good water-droppers their appearance and shape are very important, but it is essential that you are able to control the amount of water poured. The dropper included in the box set for this project is made by a potter, so not only will fit comfortably in your hand it has a proper pour allowing you to control the water drop by drop. It also looks like a cute little milk pitcher that you would want to collect.\n",
      "【 半紙 】 - Japanese Calligraphy Paper, “Hanshi” -\n",
      "This is also an indispensable item for calligraphy, it is called “hanshin” and it is the paper used when writing calligraphy. A size of 243mm x 333mm (9.5\" x 13\") is typical, and there are many types such as ones made in Japan, made in China, hand-made and machine-made, easy to bleed (like for the nijimi technique), etc. We have decided to include Japanese-made calligraphy paper for this project which is very easy to write on. While Western-made paper is also very easy to use, it does not absorb moisture as well which makes it hard to dry completely and handle once you have finished writing. In addition, smooth paper does not easily give off the brush's characteristic \"kasure”, the drybrush streak look. It will allow you to write clear and sharp characters, but it will lack the known appeal.\n",
      "【下敷き 】 - Underlay Pad, “Shitajiki” -\n",
      "The brush used for Japanese calligraphy contains a fair amount of ink, and since the “hanshin” paper is very thin, the ink will bleed through onto the table or floor and the paper will tear if you do not lay anything underneath it. So you use this “shitajiki” pad to prevent that from happening. The underlay pad that is included in the set is made of felt. A pad made from felt has the trait of having a sturdy weave, has a hardness to it, and is less likely to wrinkle which is very important to be able to produce the look you want when writing. Although it is a material that does not easily wrinkle, you can easily put it away by rolling it up rather than folding it.\n",
      "【 文鎮 】 - Paperweight, “Bunchin” -\n",
      "The “bunchin” is used to prevent the paper from moving while writing, essentially a paperweight. They come in many shapes and kinds, like metal ones made from iron or brass, glass, resin, etc. The paperweight we have prepared this time is made using Japan’s representative tree, the cherry tree. Since it contains lead, it has some weight to it despite how it looks playing the role of a proper paperweight. This simple paperweight has a gentle scent of wood which heals the soul.\n",
      "【筆置き】 - Brush Rest, “Fude-Oki” -\n",
      "You use the brush rest as a holder for the brush before writing or when you want to set down your brush while writing. It is made of wood making it light, manageable, and a lovely appearance. A great point to this rest is that it allows you to set two brushes on it. This is also made of cherry tree wood, adding to the beautiful relaxed feeling.\n",
      "【 筆巻 】 - Roll-up Brush Holder, “Fude-Maki” -\n",
      "A roll-up brush holder is originally used to carry a used brush and is made by connecting strips of bamboo with a thread. Also to protect the brush from getting damaged and keeping the tips straight, it is made according to the brush’s thickness and shape. It is designed to wrap up. The holder is designed to be rolled up, so after using the brush, wash it well and dry it thoroughly before wrapping it up in the holder.\n",
      "For the set, you get a beautiful paulownia box to keep all your calligraphy supplies in. We have prepared four colors and a story for each of the boxes.\n",
      "Black (Rain That Falls at Night)\n",
      "The rain that falls quietly in the middle of the night seems to wash away various idle thoughts and feelings, almost resetting you into a new self. There is a similar feeling in the flow of Japanese calligraphy, from setting up to cleaning up. We took that feeling and put it into a jet black box that looks like it was wet in the rain. We hope you enjoy it as a type of scenery in your room as well.\n",
      "White (Fresh Snow in the Early Morning)\n",
      "On an early winter morning, when you see pure white, untouched snow that has piled up over the night, you sense new freshness as if something is about to begin. Even in calligraphy, when rubbing the ink stick and having a piece of white calligraphy paper in front of me, I feel that same freshness and clarity every time. With the hope that we can briefly start fresh, leaving the good and bad and concentrating on the now, we made a white calligraphy supplies case with a special coating that resembles powdered snow.\n",
      "Earth (Forget-Me-Not Flower)\n",
      "I think there are many things that are often too close to us to be seen. The earth we live on is one of them. I have heard that while in space, astronauts are often deeply moved by the beauty of the earth, but it is not like we as regular people can go to space so easily. However, I think that by just imagining something, you are still able to see it clearly. Calligraphy requires the imagination to shape the worldview of words. It is like the act of seeing something you actually cannot. So with that in mind, we created a blue case that reflects the image of the earth. The countless number of white dots on the blue box will stir your imagination each time you look at it.\n",
      "Moon (Bay Laurel)\n",
      "The moon continues to always orbit the earth showing everyone its various expressions. In reality though, the size and shape of the moon itself actually does not change, its appearance changes depending on the position of the sun and the earth, with the sun lighting up different regions of the moon creating its different phases. In short, depending on how you perceive something your feelings will change. In calligraphy too, while writing the same characters with the exact same movement, there is an aspect where notice that you feel differently than you did the day before, from the week before, and are able to realize yourself in the now. In order to adjust and improve oneself, we think it is important to know who you currently are as a person. With that in mind, we made a moonlight calligraphy set box. Just looking at it gushes inspiration.\n",
      "There are two levels of the basic set, a shallow box and a deeper box.\n",
      "The brush rest, water-dropper, and paperweight go inside the smaller, shallower box along with the removable insert board.\n",
      "You get a refreshing swift scent of natural wood when you open it up every time. Just looking at it is will make you feel better. Supplies that are made of natural materials will casually become a part of your calligraphy life.\n",
      "◆ Box size: W 323mm x D 116mm x H 119mm (12.7” x 4.6” x 4.68”)\n",
      "◆ Materials: Box - paulownia, paperweight and brush rest - cherry blossom wood, removable insert board - camphor tree wood, water-dropper - porcelain\n",
      "◆ Coating: Special Polyurethane wood finish\n",
      "*Since natural materials are used, including the insert board, please be aware that the grain is different in each item.\n",
      "The box will perfectly fit in this azuma cloth bag.\n",
      "Japan has given its heart and mind to the moon since ancient times. This is why there are a number of names and words in relation to it. Another word for the full moon is “mochi” (望), and the new moon is also called \"tsuitachi\" (朔). “Mochi” means “to be full”, and “tsuitachi” means “beginning”, both representing a cycle. It is with that we made a black and white azuma cloth bag to wrap up the important calligraphy box. Made of durable canvas, it has a chic appearance with a small crimson touch.\n",
      "◆ Size when unfolded: W 500mm x H 500mm (19.6” x 19.6”)\n",
      "◆ Material: No. 11 canvas\n",
      "*A string is attached to the center to keep the bag closed.\n",
      "We’ve prepared a video example of using the calligraphy set!\n",
      "This is just a single part of it. We will provide backers who get the box set with a site address for the example. So we hope that you all are excited for that! Japanese calligraphy has continued to become very popular with those all over the world. However, figuring out how to write yourself is a difficult hurdle for many of those who do buy the supplies. But if you have this box set and example, you should be able to start today! So we hope that you are able to calm your heart and mind, and relax while confronting yourself.\n",
      "- Preparation -\n",
      "1. Take out the underlay pad and roll-up brush holder from the bottom box and lay out the underlay.\n",
      "2. Take out the inkstone, paperweight, brush rest, and the ink stick from the top box and set them next to the underlay.\n",
      "3. Place the brush on the brush rest.\n",
      "4. Add some water to the water-dropper.\n",
      "5. Pour water little by little from the dropper on the inkstone and grind/rub the ink stick.\n",
      "6. Place a piece of calligraphy paper on the underlay pad, then the paperweight on the top corners to prevent the paper from moving.\n",
      "7. Start writing making sure there is plenty of ink on the brush.\n",
      "8. Lay the finished paper on something like a newspaper and let it dry.\n",
      "- Clean up -\n",
      "1. Wipe off the remaining ink on the inkstone on a piece of paper (like a piece of calligraphy paper that you made a mistake on), wash it with water, then let it dry.\n",
      "2. Wash the ink covered brush in a glass of water until clear.\n",
      "3. Put the inkstone, paperweight, brush rest, and ink stick in their usual place in the top box.\n",
      "4. Roll the brush up in the brush holder (please make sure the brush is completely dry).\n",
      "5. Wrap up the underlay pad.\n",
      "6. Put the roll-up brush holder and underlay pad in the box that goes on the bottom.\n",
      "We aim to create products that show the creators’ faces.\n",
      "These supplies are made by craftsmen and writers in Fukui and Toyama prefectures.\n",
      "The woodcarver Kazunori Ichihashi creates the paperweight, brush rest, and insert board. Starting off with transoms and Buddhist statues, from traditional to modern, Ichihashi has experience doing an extensive variety of wood carving works, creating something that is sincere, warm, and personal.\n",
      "The porcelain water-dropper is made by Manabu Tanaka, an active potter in the port city Mikuni in Fukui prefecture. Tanaka is gaining popularity for his unique character and worldview that came from being in the Department of Architecture. Please get the full sense of how well this water-dropper allows you to control its water flow as you work.\n",
      "The two-tiered box is made by Keizou Urata from Urata Co., Ltd., who mainly manufactures paulownia boxes in Takaoka City, Toyama prefecture. For requests for detailed measurements and specification changes, he is a reliable craftsman that responds promptly and throughly. It is Urata that made moving forward in making of the calligraphy box for this project possible.\n",
      "The one responsible for the azuma cloth bag that holds the box is Rieko Kataoka of KATA+. She makes things using canvas and is active in various craft exhibitions and events, solo exhibitions, etc.\n",
      "The calligraphy box is painted by MARUHIRO SPRAY’s Yasuhiro Hirose. He works with urethane resin coating in Kawada, Fukui Prefecture, the producing are of Echizen lacquerware, and continues to explore unique expressions that are different from traditional/regular “urushi” lacquer. Without MARUHIRO, the calligraphy box’s image and beautiful look would not be what it is.\n",
      "Then, for brushes, roll-up brush holder, inkstones, ink stick, ink, and underlay pad, you have the cooperation from a book store in Nara prefecture, Sasakawa Bunrindo. Sasakawa Bunrindo is a long-established bookstore on Sanjo-dori in Nara, and has been making traditional Nara brushes for over 160 years as well as having a large selection of calligraphy supplies.\n",

      "Culture is backed by history and is seen as having a very important element in human activity. We are always thinking about how to make the world more enjoyable and how to make use of its wonderful essence in the present age. We started this project with the hopes and desire for people all around the world to know, feel, and utilize the culture of Japanese calligraphy. We are sure there are many people that are under the impression that calligraphy is difficult and time-consuming. And yes, in today's busy world it might be a bit of a hassle. However we feel that it is within that inconvenience that there are a ton of important things. And then there is writing characters/letters by hand. We think that it is about knowing who you are and touching the story the characters hold. But these are things you feel the first time you try. In order to make it even more possible to touch such a wonderful world, we decided to create equally wonderful calligraphy tools and supplies!\n",

      "Hello, friends!\n",
      "My name is Anna, I'm from Ukraine, Kharkiv. I was born in a small town with a population of 10 thousand people in the Kharkiv region.\n",
      "I lived in Kharkiv for 12 years, where I studied, worked, got married, made wonderful new friends, and developed my business. Not only that, but I woke up from the explosions at 5 am on 24.02.2022, and it was hard to believe that the war has started. It took me two days to realize it!\n",
      "In the early days of the war, I tried to volunteer online from my phone, sitting in the basement of the house! I helped people find lodging and food and looked for transportation to meet their needs.\n",
      "When I was in a small village in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, the first thing I thought to myself was: “HOW CAN I HELP PEOPLE IN WAR AND BE HELPFUL TO PEOPLE AROUND?”\n",
      "I don't want to just take the money and give it away, I want to give something useful in return!\n",
      "SO I CAME UP WITH AN IDEA.\n",
      "I had the idea of creating a planner with quick and easy planning technology, which I have been using personally for 4 years. I can say that 97% of the time my goals and plans come true, not only because of my efforts, but also because of effective planning!\n",
      "Furthermore, I came up with the planner in a day, the cover design was created in 5 minutes, and it took me 4 weeks to develop it.\n",
      "My husband, a translator and graphic designer, is helping me to publish the planner.\n",
      "We have found one of the few printing houses now working in Ukraine, and we are collecting the funds to print it ourselves.\n",
      "The edition will be in 3 languages:\n",
      "-Ukrainian\n",
      "-English\n",
      "-Russian (for those who are used to speaking and writing in the Russian language, it is the whole of eastern and central Ukraine).\n",
      "I tried to promote the sales of the planner, which has not yet been published on my account and many people are already willing to buy it, even with my signature as an author!\n",
      "This confirms that it is NEEDED and people see its value.\n",
      "All that's left is to get it into printing. It is expensive to print on your own. We designed it in color, and I included instructions for filling out the week and day with examples of “how I keep it” to make it easier and more interesting for the user to keep it.\n",
      "To whom I have already shown it, they said: great, I already want to hold it in my hands!\n",
      "My goal is to raise €20,000 for the first edition.\n",
      "This amount includes a print run of 500 copies of the notebook:\n",
      "200 in Ukrainian\n",
      "50 in Russian\n",
      "250 in English\n",
      "Marketing and advertising (targeting and advertising from bloggers) are included in the funding.\n",
      "Delivery is possible worldwide with service the Mail of Ukraine, which is now resumed work in Ukraine and can do international shipments.\n",
      "I have already invested personal money in the design, layout, and translation. But the printing and distribution are unaffordable for me at the moment, so please help me!\n",
      "Each person's €40 contribution to the campaign will help make this project a reality, and consider it as you've already bought a signed hardcover planner.\n",
      "I would like to add that this is not just a planner, but it is the symbol of freedom and victory!\n",
      "The important thing is that 50% of the sale of the planner will go to the psychological recovery of the victims (women, men, and children) of the hostilities.\n",
      "The money from the sales of the planner will pay for consultations of the best psychologists, who have already had the experience in rehabilitation of victims of military actions.\n",
      "I want to show concern not only about the economic growth of the country, but also about the psychological health of the population. I think it is very essential, and I hope you will support me.\n",
      "As in any crowdfunding campaign, donations are the key. But the sharing and spreading of this are also influential. If you share on social media and tell your friends, it will help bring the project to life.\n",

      "I plan to take still and moving photos of police partaking in actions that put the public in danger. The majority of these actions are the illegal and dangerous parking of vehicles. NYPD continually blocks fire hydrants, crosswalks, and curb cuts while not performing official police duties or responding to calls. This practice endangers all pedestrians and drivers especially the elderly and infirm who have trouble safely navigating the streets while the police are parked in this illegal and dangerous manner. Almost all of the time when parked like this, the police are shopping while on duty, picking up lunch, or having casual conversations with friends on the street. All of the time there are plenty of safe spaces to park close by. I have seen empty police cars blocking fire hydrants for hours at a time with no police in sight. Shiny badges to not grant special rights. All people whether law enforcement are required to follow the   traffic and parking laws except in an emergency. These officers are abusing their badges to park so that they can more easily shop or pickup lunch. You or I would get a summons in a second if we did any of these things. Equal rights for all means that the law should be applied to police the same way it is applied to citizens. \n",

      "The main focus of this particular exploration will be the daily lives of children in the region.

In this way the cycle of poverty, violence, and instability has been perpetuated for generations. \n",

      "Work will be published through a blog, and I will seek to have it published elsewhere upon completion. I thank you all for your support and generosity.\n",
      "The budget for this project will consist mostly of travel expenses. Airfare from Florida to Bogota, Colombia for one, from Bogota to Southern Colombia for two, and the journey by bus into Putumayo for two. Other expenses will include a camera lens, photo prints, and small photo books. \n",

      "I will be photographing subjects, buildings, gestures, and moments  that capture the Christmas spirit as the beginning project for a unique travel blog. The finding Christmas Magic project will be used to launch a paid website and continue the travel blog portion over the next year. We plan to create a blog where you will be able to find and submit stories, ideas, crafts and videos that capture the essence of Christmas. This will also serve as a travel blog where you will vote on what destination to send us to! Of course this will be dependent on just how much money we raise but I can tell you Iceland is a photographers dream in the winter and I have never been. That being said, we live in the beautiful state of Oregon which also has some  incredible places that shine with Christmas Spirit this time of year. The small resort town of Sun River is a short drive from us and will serve as our first destination review. I would love the opportunity to capture the Christmas Spirit near and far. We live in another small town in Oregon where people still greet one another on the street and we all know our neighbors. \n",
      "Just for fun we will Photoshop some of you into our travel pics! (but only if we have prior permission and a request to do so!). \n",
      "We want this site to be interactive. It is our hope that we will create more than just another travel blog, but a place where lifelong friendships can be born and nurtured (for those of  us who will always be kids at heart and for those who will never forget the true meaning of Christmas). Come join our family and celebrate the magic of Christmas.\n",
      " Please check our website often as it is a work in progress in its beginning stages!\n",
      "I will also be attaching a rough budget so you can see how the money will be spent. Basically we will break it down into travel/transportation to photo shoot locations and destinations, any additional camera equipment that may be needed (we have most of what we need), craft supplies, cooking ingredients for the recipes we will be demonstrating and other supplies needed for demonstration videos, printing costs for prints, etc.  I think it is important for those who are considering making pledges to have a clear idea of where that money is going and what an important part it will play in this project. If there are left over funds we would like to pay it forward with small acts of kindness as well as a trip to New York to capture New Years Eve in Time Square!  Like the others, these photos will be shared on our website and discussed in our blog. We cannot do this without your support and appreciate everyone who backs  us in any way that they can. Purchasing prints from our website is another great way to lend your support. These will be available for purchase beginning the first week of December. It has been our dream to go to New York City for New Years Eve. If our \n",

Lets make it viral! Perhaps together we can make spreading Christmas Magic a world wide project. So, lets get started in our search of Christmas Magic...\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",

I am starting with a budget that is lower than I would like to secure to make this project all that it can be, but have insured that it is enough to keep us going through January 1, 2015. A lack of funding will have disadvantages and will limit the travel portion of our project and related site visits. However, if we meet our initial goal it will be an amazing experience that is sure to spread Christmas Magic and urge others to do the same with small acts of kindness and little challenges that our blog will share.

      "Below I'll describe how this whole idea came to fruition, what it means to me, and what bringing this 5-6 song EP to life will entail! \n",
      "I've enjoyed experimenting with songwriting for years now, but until last summer, it was never a \"serious\" pursuit for me. That changed June of 2016 when I attended Kristin Andreassen & Laura Cortese's magical \"Miles of Music Camp.\" The expansive songwriting classes and professional guidance and encouragement of the instructors there gave me the push I needed to gain confidence in the contemporary songwriting realm. A class called \"Band in a Box\" gave me the opportunity to hear an original song, usually played just me and my ol' guitar, complete with a backup band of bass, drums, keys, and horns. I couldn't ignore the possibility of groove that existed in these songs when arranged with a larger band, and after that June, I couldn't stop writing. \n",
      "Here is that \"Band in a Box\" recording-- a good example of what this EP will sound like when my original songs are energized with a full band. Joined by local drummer Jabin Baxter, Stray Birds bass player Charlie Muench, & a TBA horn section, I will bring my acoustic folk songs to life with a discernible R&B and jazz edge. \n",
      "https://soundcloud.com/nina-de-vitry/baby-in-the-shade\n",
      "The songs on this EP are a collection I wrote while questioning the avail of following dreams, resenting transitions, and wrestling with the passage of time. With its themes of trusting your heart & believing life will take you where it should, my aspiration for the album is that it will communicate the boundless reaches of hope to people of any age. \n",
      "Over the past few months, I have been working to collaborate with different musicians, schedule gigs, and put samples of my original material online. On Youtube you can find a few more original songs that may appear on the EP with groovier, full band arrangements... \n",
      "There is a beautiful sense of liberty that accompanies being an independent artist, but with this comes the call for considerable community support. In short, I quite honestly could not be doing this project without all of you! As a person who can talk about, share, or donate to this project, YOU are acting as my record label. YOU are empowered to bring this project to life & win some cool rewards in the process! It will truly take a village to pull this thing together, but in choosing to spread the word or back this thing, YOU will cause a domino effect & become implemental in the creation of a new piece of art in our community. \n",
      "Starting in May and continuing through the end of August, I will be busy in the Sugartank Recording Studio in downtown Lancaster, PA arranging, tracking & mixing the songs that will appear on the EP. Once these tracks are perfected, they will be sent off for mastering. The final step is getting the product onto CD discs & ordering digital downloads so that I can give it to all of you! Based on this timeline, the reward shipments will begin in November and the official release date will follow. \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "THE BOOK: Cooking for Conservation is part cookbook, part travelogue, part detailed account of the challenges of conservation in the African bush. Jamie Sparks's beautiful new book on her experiences and time in the canvas kitchen at Camp Nomade in Tchad's Zakouma National Park takes the reader on an evocative journey into the heart of Africa, its people, flavors and incredible wildlife. \n",
      "THE GOAL: Defending what's left of the natural world is no easy task – protecting the wilderness takes courage, and international NGO African Parks has made conservation their mission. This book shares that mission. $100,000 of the book’s profit will go to African Parks, and 25% of all profits will go to African Parks thereafter.\n",
      "With your support, Tchad: Cooking for Conservation will be a beautiful cookbook/coffee table book filled with spectacular images of Zakouma National Park donated by professional guides and conservationists. Interwoven between scenes from the bush and the daily happenings at camp is a gastronomic safari. As you turn the pages, you taste your way through a week at Camp Nomade. \n",
      "HOW IT ALL STARTED: Jamie was tasked with setting up Camp Nomade with a food experience equal to its wildlife experience. Hours were spent searching through dusty market stalls, attempting to explain to chef Abdoulaye in broken French the nuance of flavors in fine dining, and introducing the eager group of Tchadian staff to waiting tables and hosting. \n",
      "THE SPARK: Evenings were spent around the table with the park managers, who told stories of the passions and personalities of African Parks, the organization that rescued Zakouma's animals from poachers and helped raise the park out of decline.Inspired by her surroundings and the stories she heard, Jamie knew almost immediately that she needed to write a book about this place - this connection between food and community, between conservation and sense of place.\n",
      "Ms. Sparks will be sharing her recipes, created in Camp Nomade's canvas-tented kitchen in the middle of Zakouma's dry, dusty planes. Cooling melon in vanilla syrup for when temperatures reach 45° Celsius in the middle of the day, pizzas cooked straight on the coals, sweet sesame snaps found in the sticky hands of cheeky local children, and spiced falafel served to guests out in the bush.\n",
      "This book does a lot more than tell tales of safari: it's a book on the lighter side of Tchad, a place that is complex, enchanting, and quite unimaginable.\n",
      "ZAKOUMA: During her time at Camp Nomade in Zakouma, these are just a few of the things Jamie came to learn: \n",
      "AFRICAN PARKS: Zakouma's inspiring success story is not unique. African Parks has stories like this from their other parks too. Currently African Parks manages 15 parks in nine countries, making up the largest and most ecologically diverse portfolio of parks in Africa under the protection of any single NGO.\n",
      "The money raised by Cooking for Conservation will help African Parks continue this amazing work in Zakouma and in every park under their care across the continent.\n",
      "People are quick to give money to support majestic elephants and big cats, but what about the snakes, beetles, rodents and bats? What about funding grassland, beehives or fisheries? African Parks protects ecosystems, rather than particular species. And the money raised through Cooking for Conservation will be used with their wisdom where it is needed most.\n",
      "ONGOING UPDATES: African Parks will provide regular updates on how the money donated is being utilized, which we will share here on Kickstarter and on the Cooking for Conservation website, to let supporters know how their money is helping the cause.\n",
      "Sign up to our newsletter to get all of our updates. \n",
      "SOPHY ROBERTS (foreword)\n",
      "\"On my first morning on safari in Chad, I trip up in an elephant's footprint. It is January 15, and I'm the first guest at Camp Nomade, a new mobile safari camp in Zakouma National Park...\n",
      "We penetrate deeper into the bush, and I hear it for the first time: the trumpeting pitch, like the creak of the Earth's crust. In a small clearing emerges a phalanx of steel skins lined up like shields. Their wide ears face us – about 40 elephants in view, with many more implied in the rustle of feet... I feel the infinite possibilities of this place... I realise I have been completely seduced – by the optimism Zakouma represents...\"\n",
      "Sophy Roberts, writing FT Weekend 31 january 2015.\n",
      "Sophy Roberts is an award-winning UK-based writer, who contributes regularly to the Financial Times, among other publications. Her stories focus on remote places, where travel meets conservation, with much of her time spent in Africa and Siberia. She visited Chad for the first time in 2015, a guest at Camp Nomade. \n",

      "Katie de Klee has lived in South Africa for the last six and a half years, working as a journalist and editor. For over two years, she worked as editor in chief for Design Indaba, the largest creative platform on the African continent. Originally from England, she is passionate about travel and story telling, especially stories of how creativity can help overcome obstacles.\n",
      "MICHAEL LORENTZ (contributed scene photographs)\n",
      "Michael Lorentz is a prominent South African guide who believes that travel, conservation, and philanthropy is an increasingly important place and one that he feels he can play an active role in. He also cofounded and is acting CEO of Passage to Africa and he cofounded Safarious.com, a social networking site for safari-goers. \n",
      "Michael is a passionately talented photographer and when speaking to him about the book, without hesitation, he offered to hand over years of Zakouma photographs for the project. The beauty of the book is in large part thanks to his generosity.\n",
      "JEAN LABUSCHAGNE (contributed scene photographs)\n",
      "Jean Labuschagne is not only a dedicated conservationist, having grown up in national parks in South Africa, Malawi, and Tanzania, but she also has a keen eye for photography. Jean introduced Jamie to Tchad, African Parks, and Zakouma, where her parents acted as park manager and special projects manager. Through her captured images she manages to open your eyes to her world.\n",
      "WHY KICKSTARTER?\n",
      "By using Kickstarter to pre-sell books we have a greater chance of raising the funds needed to print the number of books necessary to reach the $100,000 donation goal to African Parks. If we hit our goal of $36,000, the first print run of 3000 will leave us with paid-for books that we can later sell in order to pay for a second print run. With a portion of the profits from those sold books, we will also be able to start donating to African Parks.\n",
      "Jamie Sparks took a nine month sabbatical from work in order to write, recipe test, photograph, and format this book into something both visually pleasing, informative and fun to cook with. Once the funds from this campaign are confirmed she will proceed with a print test run, with printing and distribution to follow.  \n",

To sit near one of its myriad pools, watching life unfold in every different direction in the three dimension plane or to peer into an elephant eye and wonder what all it has seen, to marvel at the perfect symbiotic uninterrupted relationship between all of its flora and fauna or to watch the synchronised dance of millions of queleas, thousands of crowned cranes, hundreds of open-billed storks - that  is for us to be in our own happy place. We are lost in a mythical past but also find what truly is important to us in the present.

      "                        An orphan,  Ryuga has grown up assuming that no matter what he does, the memories of all his past pains are going to come back to haunt him. He expects nothing but torment from the world, and his loneliness follows him everywhere he goes. Most horrifically, he begins dreaming about his mother, seeing visions in his mind of her untimely death. These visions are torture for the boy, and it seems that nothing will free him from them. All he wants to do is rest, to feel that he belongs somewhere, to understand his place in the world.\n",

In fact, he is extraordinary – a boy who can wield an immense power, controlling creatures far stronger than any other person. This is a unique gift, but at first, he doesn't understand it. For anyone who has ever recognized their own talents but struggled to figure out how to make the most of them, this manga will resonate in a real way, inspiring the reader to look ever deeper within himself or herself and to accept the responsibility that comes with our gifts and talents.\n",

This too is a part of the manga that will connect with people on a deep level, encouraging them to seek out opportunities to learn. In Sleeping Dragon King Chronicles, Ryuga must overcome a wide range of difficulties before he can take full advantage of everything that his sensei has to offer him. Learning to communicate, to clean, and to look after himself,  Ryuga  is a lost child – but a lost child whose value is undeniable to the sensei and anyone else who understands what it signifies. This is a captivating story that will stick with you – and perhaps even motivate you to recognize and cherish everything that makes you unique.\n",

      "Slightly Damned is a webcomic that debuted in 2004 and can be read for free (always!) at sdamned.com! It is the story of Rhea Snaketail, a girl killed through mysterious circumstances, who escapes the afterlife and returns to the land of the living. She is joined by her friends, the kindhearted Demon, Buwaro, and the shy Angel warrior, Kieri, as they uncover the secrets of an ancient feud between Heaven and Hell.\n",
      "Slightly Damned won two Ursa Major Awards in 2012 and won two more in 2013 for \"Best Graphic Story\" and \"Best Literary Work\", and was nominated again in 2019 for \"Best Graphic Story\". In 2014, its first Kickstarter campaign was successfully completed to manufacture plush dolls based on the comic's lead characters. In 2018, another Kickstarter campaign was held in order to fund the reprinting of Book One. The comic is currently published online in collaboration with Hiveworks, and copies of Book One are available through its online store!\n",
      "This campaign will be its third campaign, and it's all about continuing the printed versions of the series by focusing on Book Two!\n",
      "Slightly Damned: Book Two contains the  webcomic's pages from #188 to #376, proofread by several editors. The word balloons have been redone to improve legibility, and some pages have been reformatted in order to fit properly on physical pages. The art has not been altered in order to preserve the original story, but the book IS filled with exclusive new artwork!\n",
      "Slightly Damned: Book Two will contain new chapter covers, new gag strips, and a few select redrawn pages!\n",
      "Also, some rewards allow backers--like you, perhaps!-- to add new content to the bonus section in the back of the book, like writing your own gag strips and nominating old pages to be redrawn with new art! User-generated content... how modern!\n",
      "Our main goal is to create softcover physical copies of Book Two, and to sweeten the deal, we're also including the opportunity to get your hands on a new bookmark, prints, bookplates, and stickers. \n",
      "The Signed bookplate is a stylish adhesive plate autographed by Chu. Bookplates will be received with a paper covering the sticky side. Backers can then remove the paper and stick the bookplate wherever they please in their book. \n",
      "Just like the book 1 Kickstarter, four original pencils pages from Chu's private archive will be available as rewards. These are the original pencil sketches, on paper, from which a comic page was created. Since the original pencils to each Slightly Damned page are one-of-a-kind items, some pages are unavailable.\n",
      "We're keeping things simple and only have one goal: if this Kickstarter campaign reaches $40,000, then we will have the funds to make everything AND we can skip right ahead to printing the second edition of Book Three without the need for a separate campaign!\n",
      "Book Three will also come with its own set of brand new bonus material, including redrawn covers and new comics.\n",
      "For a couple of years, I used a print-on-demand service to produce copies of Slightly Damned: Book One, Book Two, and Book Three. They were sold online and at conventions. Unfortunately, print-on-demand is not practical for printing full-color, 200-300 page books. The books were expensive, flimsy, and sometimes I even had to discard copies because they were assembled incorrectly. Therefore, the first editions of these books have long since been discontinued.\n",
      "The books made through this campaign are of higher quality and will cost less per copy. To make the second edition more special, I've worked hard to include TONS of bonus material.\n",
      "If you've already got one of those first edition copies, then I am still very grateful for your support! But if you like the comic and would like to help it succeed, then I hope you'll find it in your heart to pledge towards the creation of the new versions. Even if you don't want a second copy, they make great gifts for getting your friends hooked or even as a donation to your local library! And, of course, there are the backer-exclusive rewards to consider! For as little as $5, you can get your name in the book and be able to download a digital version so you can check out the bonus art and comics, which are not uploaded anywhere else.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "My last two campaigns on Kickstarter have been successful, so I am optimistic about this one. I also have the support of Hiveworks on my side to ensure fulfillment is taken care of without a hitch!\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the definitive editions of my webcomic that is fast approaching its 20th anniversary. As these campaigns continue to be successful, I'll eventually be all caught up, and the chapters that have been online only so far will finally be bookificated!\n",
      "\n",
      "Honesty and transparency are very important to me, I intend to keep backers informed every step of the way. Slightly Damned has persisted this long with the support of its readers, and I intend to always do right by you!\n",

I would love to hear how women view sex, how other queer people view sex, how people who don't have sex view sex. My hopes are to provide people a platform to talk about sex openly and safely to people who are rarely given the opportunity to do so.

      "Mother’s Cookbook is a beautifully quirky and tasty EarthBound-inspired cookbook written by Hillary Froemel with original recipes developed by Chef Bryan Connor. We’re excited to be joined by additional professional artists, photographers, and a slew of other collaborators such as Alyssa Browning, Nick Lauer, and Patrick Ryan Deasy.

      "You might be unfamiliar with the quirky charm of the cult classic game EarthBound. Originally released on the SNES in 1995, EarthBound (or MOTHER 2 as it is known in Japan) is a role-playing game (RPG) designed by Shigesato Itoi and developed by APE Inc. The game stood out among the thriving role-playing game market due to it’s unique setting. While games like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest were bringing the genre over to the US with fantasy medieval settings, EarthBound put the RPG style of gameplay in a modern time period. The game is set idyllic, yet satirical, version of America. Gone are the dragons and magic potions of classical fantasy games. In their place are angry ducks, hippies, and “All-American Foods” like cheeseburgers and pizza. \n",
      "EarthBound is a heartwarming and strange game that is impossible not to fall in love with. It's a cult classic filled to the brim with memorable characters, constant pop culture references, and an overwhelming sense of charm. The wacky and sometimes outlandish food in the game struck a chord with many of its fans, us included. Who can forget Trout Yogurt?\n",
      "Our goal is to capture this game’s unparalleled charm in a brand new package; a cookbook! Our book includes over 50 original recipes inspired by the game’s memorable characters, fantastical locations, and sometimes odd food items. This 8\" x 10\" cookbook will be available in hardcover, paperback, and digital form. We're pulling some recipes straight from the game like Mammoth Burgers, Magic Cake, and Peanut Cheese Bars. However, we are also creating recipes inspired the game’s characters and locations such as New Age Retro Hummus, Tessie Watchin' Stew, and Lier X. Agerate's Famous Roasted Garlic Bread!\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t worry, the game may have stunk but all the recipes in this book will produce delicious and funky fresh dishes! We hope you enjoy over 140 pages of full-color professional photos, easy-to-read cooking instructions, delightful doodles, and endearing notes from mom herself.\n",
      " \n",
      "Our fellow EarthBound fans at Fangamer are Kickstarter veterans who have pledged their support for this project. They’ll be handling production of the book as well as fulfillment of the physical rewards in the $95 and below tiers.\n",
      "This book is not only a must-have for all you EarthBound/MOTHER series fans out there but also completely accessible and enjoyable for anyone looking for a fun time cooking original and interesting recipes. The recipes in this book range from beginners snacks to advanced baked goods. We made it our mission to strike a balance between simple dishes that could be whipped up from ingredients found in any kitchen to more involved exotic dishes which might require a trip to a specialty food store. Our book explores the themes of exploration, overcoming the odds, and trying new things just as the game itself does. Not to worry; if you get homesick there’s even a recipe for steak done just how Mom used to make it! \n",

      "The team behind this book is comprised of professionals with decades of experience working both in the kitchen and the writer's room. Every one of us is an EarthBound/MOTHER superfan. This series of games has had a huge impact on our lives and driven our creative projects. \n",
      "A rising trend in games is the addition of cooking and unique foods to help flesh-out a game’s universe or feel. You can see great examples of this in games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Final Fantasy XV, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. \n",
      " \n",
      "We have spent the last 10 months creating recipes, writing drafts, photographing fresh produce, testing, tasting, and playing video games. We’ve gone as far as we can on this project without additional funding, so we are here to ask for your help. We need backers to help us fund the development of the remaining recipes, as well as testing in our test kitchen, and covering the print cost for the initial run of cookbooks and backer rewards. The group behind this book is dedicated and driven. So many wonderful people have already committed their time, taste buds, and kitchens to working on this project. After 10 months of hard work, we are ready to show our work to the world. We cannot emphasize enough that the recipes in this book are for everyone. You don’t have to be a fan of the series, nor do you even need to be a gamer.\n",

      "*OBTAINED!* $11,000 Jackie’s Cafe - A slew of mind-boggling and intensely playful cocktail recipes inspired by various characters, sayings, and PK/PSI powers in the game. Ever wanted to find out what exactly a PK Fire Omega might taste like on the rocks? Here’s a clue, a lot of whiskey. We recognize a lot of our backers might not be of age to purchase alcohol but EarthBound was released over 21 years ago, so we wanted to do something special for the fans who really did grow up with the game.\n",
      "*OBTAINED!* $12,000 Octopus Erasing Machine - Did you know that in the Japanese version of EarthBound the “Trout Yogurt” item was initially “Strawberry Tofu?” That wasn’t the only item changed either! With this stretch goal, we hope to bring a distinctly Japanese flair to this cookbook by including recipes for some of the region-locked items only available in the Japanese version of the game, where the game went by a much different title, MOTHER 2. (Do you understand the cookbook name now? It is a pun, cause the EarthBound series is called the MOTHER series in Japan. We're so witty.) \n",
      "*OBTAINED!* $14,000 Wel come to moo nsi ns dem oons ide - In the game, there is a uniquely wonky town known as ‘Moonside’. A magical, technicolor place where everything’s reversed and weird. ‘Up’ means ‘down’ and burgers are a bun sandwiched between two patties! This stretch goal will allow us to include some insane twists on standard food fare recipes. Hot ice cream? Frozen sandwiches? MADNESS! \n",
      "*OBTAINED!* $16,000 - Handy Dandy Hand-aid - Feel like you might need a hand finding you way around your new cookbook? Well we'll do you one better and give you a hand, with this Stretch Goal, the Handy Dandy Hand-aid! Named after the eponymous \"Hand-aid\" item from EarthBound (think \"Band-aid\", but with less trademark infringement). This stretch goal, will allow us to add a robust section dedicated to cooking tips, tricks, and general advice from mom. It will include helpful guidance with topics such as cooking methods, knife skills, kitchen equipment, and how to convert recipes to your liking (and even into metric measurements!) This section will be useful for both beginner and advanced cooks. Mom’s tips will help you be the best darn cook you can be!  \n",
      "*OBTAINED!* $20,000 - Abstract Art - Like the art in the book? Hitting this stretch goal adds an entire artist's gallery, featuring a few pages of original art from all of this project's artists. You'll see a little behind-the-scenes of the creative process that really added a lot to this project!\n",
      "*OBTAINED!* $25,000 - Sunflower Fields - Reaching this goal adds even more recipes to every version of the book! What kind of recipes you might ask? Well, we'll be adding MOTHER 3 recipes! For those who don't know, MOTHER 3 is the sequel game to EarthBound. The Japanese-only game was originally released in 2006 and has never been localized. Die-hard fans have been waiting over a decade for an official English release that has just not appeared but with this stretch goal, we'll give you a little taste of what it might be. We'll add quite a few recipes inspired by the Tazmily Village area. With all your support we'll actually be able to add some of Hinawa's recipes to the cookbook! Some examples are nut cookies and fluffy omelets! The pages in this chapter will be inspired by the beauty and emotion in her letters.\n",
      "*OBTAINED!* $35,000 - I (oo) NEW PORK - DO YOU WANT MORE RECIPES IN EVERY COPY OF THE BOOK?! WELL WE CAN DO THAT! We'll add more recipes to the book inspired by the New Pork City area of EarthBound's sequel, MOTHER 3. If our project raises $35,000, we’ll be adding dishes inspired by some iconic food items such as Hot Dog Sushi, Rich Kid Stew, Pasta with a Past, King Burgers and more! Bring the flavor of his royal porkness into your very own kitchens!\n",

      "Funded! With a record-setting sum that's hit two stretch goals! We're getting an extra-long Volume 3, and a cool new custom-drawn fantasy map of the Leif & Thorn world.\n",
      " Leif & Thorn is a original, LGBTQ-centric, fantasy webcomic, about a magic knight trying to have a romance in his second language.\n",
      "Also, trying to shield his love interest from a tangled web of shady debts, shadier politics, and spelltech-enforced behavior controls.\n",
      "Also: going to the opera.\n",
      "Read Leif & Thorn online to get caught up with the backstory, follow the latest strips, and stay on top of news about future books...\n",
      "Volumes 1 and 2 have already been printed, using the funds we raised with Kickstarter! This is the campaign where we fund Volume 3.\n",
      "If you like song parodies, Madoka Magica, worldbuilding, Arthurian mythos, romantic solos, or Hamilton...there's something for you in this book.\n",
      "The story so far:\n",
      "Thorn has been on Embassy guard duty for a year now, and it's going great. His team of knights has expanded! Their magical-girl-in-training is about to level up! He has a boyfriend, sort of! He's won free tickets to the opera!\n",
      "That's right, the smash-hit historical musical Leachtric is in town. An Embassy diplomat is taking his daughters, so they need a few guards to tag along. Just as a formality. What could go wrong?\n",
      "...except for backstage smugglers, rival secret agents, a magical boy suppressing his powers, a time traveler who almost blows her cover, a knight who calls in sick because he's growing wings, and, oh yes, somebody let a giant monster plant loose in the pipes.\n",
      "Leif wants to be a supportive sorta-kinda-boyfriend, but he only has clearance to know about half the stuff Thorn's involved in. Luckily, he also has plenty of experience working around secrets.\n",
      "For teens and up. (Don't give this one to small children -- it includes  mature topics like character death, mind control, consent issues, government corruption, and predatory lending agents.)\n",
      "Leif & Thorn Volume 3 covers the daily strips from early 2018 to the middle of 2019, along with info pages, AU side stories, and other bonuses.\n",
      "Like Volumes 1 and 2, it'll be 8.25\" X 10.25\", full-color, with a wraparound cover and a bunch of exclusive art inside. Previous volumes were 180 pages, but thanks to a record amount of funding, Volume 3 has gotten bumped up to 192.\n",
      "Here's a quick taste of the interior:\n",
      " At the time I was drawing these strips, Volume 1 had just funded! Which means Volume 3 is the first in the series that was consciously planned for print. I had the basic layout all sorted. I knew how many pages each book would have.\n",
      "And although Leif & Thorn has always had overarching plot arcs...this is the first time I was able to deliberately place a lot of setup at The Start Of The Volume, and schedule the resolutions for within the next 180 pages.\n",
      "Not only that: it's also when I spruce up the lettering, upgrade the shading, and branch out with lighting techniques. There's a lot of reasons the first storyline in this book is called \"Level Up.\"\n",
      "A sampling of the other storylines inside:\n",
      "THE SHOW MUST GROW ON (Act I) - Magic swords are cool! Magic swords that reveal you're the reincarnation of your country's greatest legendary hero are terrifying. A national history lesson told in song parodies.\n",
      "A lot of these strips have been color-adjusted to look fancier in print -- and the bonus material includes a bunch of never-before-shared extended lyrics.\n",
      "THE SHOW MUST GROW ON (Intermission) - Rowan had to take a week off from being a knight because he's growing wings. Luckily, his siblings are around to help in his time of need...by reminding him that there are worse pains.\n",
      "THE SHOW MUST GROW ON (Act II) - The opera building -- full of actors and cosplayers, with special-effects \"magic\" and prop swords -- gets overrun by an all-too-real plant monster.\n",
      " A NIGHT TO REMEMBER - Thorn tries to reconstruct what really happened during the opera rescue, working around mind-altering powers and top-secret pasts.\n",
      "GRASSIE KNOWS HER HISTORY - A time-traveling older Thorn winds up in a century before his own - where the comedy is classic, the spelltech is antique, and his cover story needs work.\n",
      "CAN'T YOU READ THE SIGNS - Back at the present-day Embassy, Leif is busy setting up subplots for Volume 4. That is, if he can get his co-workers on board.\n",
      "HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED - Holly, the magical girl who's been working with Thorn's team, prepares to graduate to her next job: tutor for a recently-superpowered teen pop star.\n",
      "BONUS STRIPS - Alternate-universe adventures, worldbuilding tidbits, one-off jokes, and other extra moments. \n",
      "Your writer/artist/creator is Erin Ptah. I've been doing this webcomic thing for 15+ years now - inspired first by newspaper comics like Doonesbury or Calvin & Hobbes, then by manga like Sailor Moon and Hellsing...and these days, by other webcomics.\n",
      "Keep up with my work on Twitter, on Deviantart, or on Patreon. (Come for the public announcements, subscribe for the patron-locked bonus art!)\n",
      "Current webcomic projects: Leif & Thorn (of course) and But I'm A Cat Person (a full-page adventure comedy, about broke queer millennials with battle monsters).\n",
      "I told you above that this book was LGBTQ-centric, so I should probably show some of the representation, huh?\n",
      "The title characters are both guys, they're from two different races and nationalities, and they are In Love. In spite of the language barrier, in defiance of all kinds of cultural baggage: they make each other so starry-eyed, you could see it from space.\n",
      "Their supporting Cast Full Of Gay includes cute goth teenagers with f/f crushes:\n",
      "Cute pop-star teenagers with m/m crushes:\n",
      "Historical lesbians who have healthy friendships with their exes:\n",
      "Rival transgender secret agents, a single trans woman and a married nonbinary showoff:\n",
      "Butch/femme wives who get each other, even when nobody else does:\n",
      "Ace people who get to have a good night's sleep:\n",
      "And more!\n",
      "(In this world, the default assumption is that most people are bi. But don't worry: even though straight people are a minority, we can still love and respect their confusing non-traditional ways.)\n",

      "\"I had completely forgotten about the existence of Artie, because they  had never really had the limelight. I just went through every page with  their character tag, and now I love them.\" ~Nova\n",
      "\"I AM MAKING AN UNDIGNIFIED AMOUNT OF NOISE AT MIDNIGHT\" ~Lielac\n",
      "\"This is a very satisfying reveal and I’m SUPER pumped to see where things are going to go from here.\" ~Diva\n",
      "\"I just wanted to say, as part of a diverse community I really appreciate  you creating a comic universe in which wearing pretty makeup is not  something the characters feel must be a flamboyant thing done for  attention. And being nonbinary is also a normal thing. So it will be  cool to see whichever way you go.\" ~Nora\n",
      "\"*clutches heart* ugh he still has his original eyes ow\" ~Kiwi\n",
      "The part you've all been waiting for!\n",
      "All claimed on Day 1!\n",
      "The first 15 backers who pledge at least $15 get a Leif & Thorn bonus sketch! \n",
      "Almost any characters, any  scenario, canon or AU. The only restrictions are (a) the content has to be safe-for-work, and (b) it has to involve characters who appear in Volume 3. See, these go in the book - to fill spaces that would otherwise be blank, at the bottom of pages or the end of chapters. Like so:\n",
      "As with Volumes 1 and 2, the sketches I do for Early Bird requests are book-exclusive. That means you'll have to pick up a copy to see them. (Totally worth it, btw. People have some great ideas.) Early backers will also get a special thanks on the credits page, no matter what tier you're in. \n",

      "Here's what to do:\n",
      " And here's a preview of the add-ons available:\n",
      "Some financial and technical details:\n",
      "Why Kickstarter? Because I can't pull a  couple thousand dollars out-of-pocket to do a print run (even knowing I can sell the books afterward). A Kickstarter campaign lets  me bring a bunch of people together for pre-orders, so I can fund the  printing upfront.\n",
      "Where exactly is the money going? Mostly to printing and shipping the books. Especially the shipping costs of those full 3-book sets.\n",
      "Here's a detailed pie-chart breakdown:\n",
      "How long will it take me to get my book? Here's the planned timeline:\n",
      "So, listen, you follow the news, right? I don't need to explain that there are Problems In The World that could slow down the mail. Or any other part of this process.\n",
      "But I've gone through printing and shipping with two books already. I know how to deal with unexpected challenges. And I'll always keep backers in the loop when they come up.\n",
      "(Also, I'm washing my hands, wearing my mask, and my early-voting ballot is cast.)\n",
      "What happens if we make more than the goal? Well, first of all, that means we have more backers than expected - so  some of the extra cash goes toward making and shipping more rewards.\n",
      "But if we seriously over-fund...for the first time, we have stretch goals!\n",
      "Making the book is just the first step. Here's some bonuses we could add to it.\n",
      "UNLOCKED: $3,323: More Book! Instead of another 180 pages, the length of Volume 3 will jump to 192! Enough to add a bunch of extra comics and bonus material, but not so much that it raises the shipping cost.\n",
      "UNLOCKED: $4,100: Fancier Map! Commissioning a new artist to do a beautiful, detailed map of the Leif & Thorn world, to replace the computer-generated one in the front of the books. Too expensive to impulse-buy, but with your help we can afford it. (Not actually sure how long it'll take to get this right -- if the work pushes back the printing, I'll keep you posted on why.)\n",
      "Maybe Next Year: $5,100: Extra Merch! Don't worry, now that the map is funded, this will be able to come back as one of the first stretch goals in Volume 4.\n",
      "This has been Leif & Thorn Volume 3!\n",
      "Thank you for your interest and support. Don't forget to watch the comic's website for new updates, future books, and (as always) the latest strips.\n",

      "We hit our funding goal (which was admittedly pretty low) so that means the book will be made and everybody that orders it will get one!\n",
      "300 Comics About Frogs is the first collection of Frog Crisis comics by creator Greg Hyland.\n",
      "The book is 312 pages, featuring the first three hundred Frog Crisis comic strips originally seen on Facebook (@FrogCrisis) and on frogcrisis.com (where you can see  samples of the comic strip). The book also features a look at the history of Frog Crisis, which started as an animated film in 1991.\n",
      "The loose, hand-drawn style of Frog Crisis is due to the fact that I treat the making of the comic as an exercise, limiting myself to 15 minutes to draw the comic and then post it on-line.\n",
      "“Frog Crisis is the essential exploration of a Canadian, self-employed, artistic, hockey-playing amphibian with a sharp sense of humour.” -Glenn Kay (Monster Atlas)\n",
      "The names of all backers will be listed in 300 Comics About Frogs.\n",
      "Add-ons for the campaign include five reproductions of Frog Crisis minicomics originally done in 1992, an \"animation cel\" print using artwork I did in 1991 for my animated Frog Crisis college film, an original customized frog sketch by me, and a page of an original Frog Crisis comic strip that was used in the book!\n",
      "Stretch Goal Achieved!\n",
      "If we raise $700 our first Stretch Goal will be two 5x7\" reproductions of mini-posters that were made in 1992 for the Frog Crisis minicomic.  \n",

      "--------sodapop-audio/sodapop-portable-wireless-speaker-bass-reinvented------\n",
      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "The Sodapop speaker has been designed to solve the main problem for small portable loudspeakers: They struggle to reproduce low frequency bass, resulting in a somewhat feeble sound. The Sodapop invention solves this problem by connecting the speaker to its own carrying case or any other suitable plastic bottle. This offers a compact portable wireless speaker that provide you with louder music, twice as much bass and an overall superior sound.\n",
      "The Sodapop is designed and developed in Oslo, Norway by a team consisting of award-winning industrial designers, acousticians, tech enthusiasts, speaker nerds and music loving entrepreneurs.\n",
      "Sodapop combines Scandinavian design, quality and innovation to form a new type of compact portable speakers that looks great and sounds amazing. \n",
      "Scandinavian design - characterized by functionality, quality, simplicity and clean lines - ensures that playing music from your mobile devices is intuitive, easy and fun.\n",
      "The custom made bass bottle doubles as a protective carrying case for the speaker unit. Even so, the threaded interface that fastens the bottle is compatible with most regular plastic beverage bottles just about anywhere in the world. This makes the Sodapop speaker the perfect travelling companion: You can find a suitable bottle everywhere; in your hotel room, the local store, at the beach etc. \n",
      "Using the Sodapop speaker is a fun, low-cost experience with a significant wow-factor, all the while creating a new use for the drinking bottle, extending its life cycle and adding value to the empty container.\n",
      "The Sodapop speaker forms a natural link between people and popular music. In a fun and social setting, when friends are hanging out and playing music, the Sodapop speaker and a soda bottle can be the center of attention. The speaker creates an exciting, new functional value for the bottle, and the users will be able to compare and evaluate different bottle designs, sizes and materials.\n",
      "So there you have it, real bass requires real space.\n",
      "By utilizing the characteristics of the bottle material and the air inside the bottle, the Sodapop speaker can increase the sound volume in the bass range by as much as 10dB. \n",
      "To the human ear a 10dB increase will sound approximately twice as loud, so in other words the Sodapop speaker can generate twice as much bass, just by connecting an ordinary soda bottle. The effect is striking once the bottle is attached.\n",
      "We have tested the Sodapop in a professional sound lab and the results are exactly what we were aiming for. As the frequency response graphs shows, the Sodapop speaker delivers unmatched power\n",
      " throughout the whole audio spectrum.\n",
      "Our goal is to achieve the best sound quality in a portable wireless speaker, with as much bass as possible without loss of definition, and at a very consumer-friendly price. \n",
      "The Sodapop team has been working with professionals in the music and product development industry. They have provided us with regular feedback on prototypes and helped us to get closer and closer to the ultimate sound experience. \n",
      "Hundreds of sketches and prototypes have been 3D-printed to find the optimal combination of sound, functionality and design.\n",
      "We have teamed up with Permafrost, a Norwegian design studio based in Oslo consisting of five industrial designers. Their design philosophy is all about creating consumer products that are user friendly, simple and safe, with just enough personality to make them stand out. \n",
      "At Permafrost they are particularly fond of projects that bridge the gap between technology and art, and believe designers have an obligation to turn all the world’s technological achievements into meaningful innovations for people.\n",
      "We have spent a lot of time finding the right manufacturer for the Sodapop speaker. After several trips to China we finally found the perfect manufacturer in Shenzhen. Having developed and produced speakers since 1999, they have tons of experience and a great track record. Currently, our manufacturer produces 4 million units pr. year. We are very confident that they are up for the task and ready to deliver the high-quality product that meets our Scandinavian expectations and demands.\n",
      "It’s difficult to present sound in a video! Make sure you connect some good headphones, so you can get an impression of how the Sodapop sounds like. But still the reproduction of the sound will not be as good as live listening.\n",
      "The founders who came up with the Sodapop idea all share a passion for music and technology, and they have a lot of experience in electronics and consumer products. \n",
      "The founders gathered experts in multiple domains such as audio design, Industrial design, music-, speaker- and tech industries. Between them, the team members have over 20 years of experience in audio, technology, product design and manufacturing. \n",
      "Getting Sodapop from idea to reality has been a tremendous team effort. We’ve worked on it full time since 2016. Our Sodapop portable speakers are now ready for production, and we’re so excited to share what we’ve built with the Kickstarter community.\n",
      "Early after the birth of the idea of Sodapop, the original founders of the Sodapop concept initialized a cooperation with Permafrost design studio. \n",
      "Permafrost is a groundbreaking Norwegian design studio with multiple Red-Dot award including best of the best awards. Permafrost was established in 2000, founded by 4 industrial designers all educated from the Oslo School of Architecture. Today Permafrost consist of 5 brilliant industrial designers and is leading and carrying out the design process for the Sodapop speaker.\n",
      "Øyvind Warp, Co-founder of Sodapop, and head of Product Development, has significant knowledge and experience with speakers and tech-business in general from over 20 years working with electronics. He is also a passionate part-time designer and has done the artwork on this Kickstarter campaign including videos and animations. Øyvind is also taking care of the marketing for this Kickstarter campaign.\n",
      "Priding himself on being very hands-on, Øyvind spends a lot of time in Norway and China ensuring that the Sodapop is developed using the very latest technology, whilst making no compromises on quality. Øyvind's passion for tech was the very motivation to start up the company – and he was the one bringing the Sodapop from idea to reality by making the first prototypes in the back office of his electronics store. Øyvind has great passion for music, his music taste was a bit stuck in electronica in his early years, but luckily his taste for music has expanded to almost every genre you can imagine.\n",
      "Øystein Lien, Co-founder of Sodapop, is educated in marketing from the Norwegian Business School (BI), has a long experience in customer relations and service and has worked for more that 15 years in the payment industry.\n",
      "Together with Nicolai, Øystein will take care of Sales and Distributions of the Sodapop. And together with Øyvind he is bringing his marketing skills to the test. Øystein has a passion for football and he is often referred to as \"Factastein\" as he has knowledge of things nobody else has the brainpower to remember. His taste in music spans from 70´s Bowie and 90´s grimey hip-hop in Wu-Tang Clan, to the 00´s Norwegian golden age of electronica and rock music personified in Queens of the Stoneage, Foo Fighters and The White Stripes.\n",
      "Ole Nicolai Olsen, Co-founder of Sodapop, is educated within maritime disciplines from Southampton University, has worked within the shipping business for the last 18 years. Nicolai is head of the company board and our financial guru. Together with Øystein he is also in charge of Sales and Distributions of the Sodapop speaker. Nicolai has a big heart, and he is a funny guy to hang out with, but he can also be very focused and disciplined, and that’s a good thing when he uses that to keep the project on the right tracks. Nicolai also plays the guitar, used to be in a band, and is a huge Pixies fan.\n",
      "Tom Alexander Trones, Acoustician, is educated from The Norwegian School of Science and Technology and have worked as a sound consultant on the Sodapop project. We knew it would work, Tom explained to us why it did. Tom also has a great passion for guitars and he used to have long hair to go with it, today he has cut his hair but still loves his guitars, so much he is even building his own on his free time. It looks like his music taste all spans around bands that frequently uses the guitar in their songs. We like that about Tom, he´s got passion!\n",
      "We are all audiophiles here. Every member of our team participates in different ways in the product development process, from the conception of the idea to fulfillment. We develop the kind of product we would love to have ourselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have already spend a lot of our own money on the development of this speaker, now we need your help to make this project come to life.\n",
      "We love cakes! Let us visualize the spending for you.\n",
      "The production and development of the moulds + the speakers itself carries the largest cost, after that comes marketing costs of this campaign, because we need to boost our campaign-related posts on Facebook and Instagram in order to stand out from the crowd.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "As a start-up, we are fully aware of the risks we are facing and have taken pro-active steps to manage and reduce them. Having identified our own strengths and weaknesses, we have teamed up with best-in-class partners wherever we can, in order to have access to appropriate expertise wherever we need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have identified the below as our main risk factors, and taken the following steps to eliminate and reduce risk where we can:\n",
      "\n",
      "Production\n",
      "\n",
      "The main concept of our speaker is to deliver superior quality at an unbeatable price. We have chosen to outsource production to a Chinese factory with a long and strong track record of delivering speakers to European markets. The factory was chosen after careful vetting, and we are confident we have made the right selection. Our research revealed that this factory has delivered with error margins down as low as 0,3% (i.e. 3 of 1,000 speakers returned after sales due to errors (this is very good in electronics, where retailers usually accept up to 2%). \n",
      "\n",
      "We intend to keep personnel regularly at the factory once production is up and running to monitor the process and ensure our quality requirements are strictly followed. Sodapop intends to start of production in small batches to ensure we are able to monitor and adjust the production to any unforeseen issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "For larger quantities, we run typical supply chain risk. We've done mass production before and we have existing relationship with the manufacturer, who has years of experience with large volumes and has well established connections with subcontractors for the parts needed in this product. Our factory partner can deliver well in excess of 4 million speakers per year and hence factory capacity is unlikely to become an issue in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concept quality\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to ensure maximum sound performance, we partnered with an experienced acoustician and an industrial design studio to optimize the design and structure of the speaker. Throughout the process, we have tested the prototypes in a professional sound studio. \n",
      "\n",
      "Financing \n",
      "\n",
      "Revolving credit facility for orders up to 10,000 units is already in place. If the product proves to be a big success the credit facility would have to be re-negotiated, but we believe the credit facility we already have negotiated, should be sufficient to handle the demand. The company also has the option of having orders shipped by air freight, reducing the time the drawn credit is used and hence can increase the rotation of the credit to handle an increased number of orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logistics \n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure that the distribution of our speakers will go as smoothly as possible, we have outsourced the logistics to a professional third-party service provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sales \n",
      "\n",
      "This is an ongoing process which will be intensified once the first production batch has arrived. We have tested our speaker with a couple of electronics retailers and received very positive feedback, but most retailers are reluctant to make orders based on prototypes. Still, we have already secured the commitment of one of the leading electronics retailers in Scandinavia, and we believe we have already validated the commercial potential for the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marketing \n",
      "\n",
      "This is also an ongoing process, where we will make use of the different resources available to us at every step of way.  We are committed to renewing ourselves constantly, staying updated on the latest tools and trends, to get this speaker on top of every potential portable speaker customer’s mind. We also have the advantage of having an in-house team of great creative artists that can produce and deliver any marketing material needed, from in-store graphics, packaging and sales material to commercial videos, webpages, banners and posts for social media marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patent rights \n",
      "\n",
      "The company has already secured international patent rights for our speaker under The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) network which consists of 152 countries and states. We are in the process of securing our patent in most of this network with the help of the biggest intellectual property law firm in Norway, also listed as top tier in the world regarding trademark, copyright and patent law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local taxes \n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that whilst we endeavor to ensure that import taxes and duties are kept to a minimum for territories outside of our warehouse locations, local import taxes and duties may be required to be paid. Sodapop has no control over local customs offices and, as such, cannot be held responsible should you be charged import taxes and duties in addition to your purchase and shipping price. It is always best to check the position in your country beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank You!\n",
      "\n",
      "All that's left to say is a big THANK YOU! We at Sodapop sincerely appreciate your support of our project and for backing us. May we bring real bass to small speakers together!\n",

      "If you haven't done so yet, your pledge to this Kickstarter will mean the entire group of films – unseen by and unavailable to the public since 1928 – will be back on screens for fans to enjoy. If you've already pledged and wish to adjust your pledge amount to help out, follow these steps to do so.\n",
      "_________________________________________________________\n",
      "(Aug 2, 2020) -- This Kickstarter will fund a project that brings 5 rare Edward Everett Horton silent comedy shorts from 1927-1928 to DVD. Yes, you read that right -- silent comedy film shorts starring Edward Everett Horton. \n",
      "These comedies were produced by Harold Lloyd and released by Paramount, and have been preserved in 35mm from original nitrate elements. They are charming and hilarious, and boast excellent production values. They have not been seen by the general public since 1928.\n",
      "The films that will be on the DVD will be seen in new 2K digital scans of archival materials preserved by the Library of  Congress, and will be scanned by the Library of Congress' lab. I will create a brand new custom musical score for each film.\n",
      "The films on the DVD will be: No Publicity (1927), Find the King (1927), Dad's Choice (1928), Horse Shy (1928), Vacation Waves (1928).\n",
      "This Kickstarter covers all costs for the DVD's production and release, as well as the making and shipping of backer DVDs.\n",
      "The DVD box art will be created by professional graphic designer and silent era aficionado Marlene Weisman. The films will have digital cleanup and stabilization work done on them, as well as dedicated video gradung (exposure correction).The DVDs will be professionally authored and they will be made available for sale online as MOD (manufacture-on-demand) discs. The finished DVD will be available via outlets like Amazon.com, TCM Shop, DeepDiscount and more, as well as international online retailers. The release will be publicized and reviewed. The DVD will be NTSC format, and will be region “0” (region-free). \n",
      "This is the same workflow as I have been doing successfully for all 23 of my DVD releases.\n",
      "I expect to be able to have the DVD finished for you by the end of January 2021, and ready for the public for a March 2021 release. It is entirely possible that, because of the pandemic, the project might finish a month or so sooner...or later.\n",
      "Backers of this project will receive a copy of the DVD. Kickstarter backers will get their copies of the DVD before it becomes available to the general public.\n",
      "I make a point of sending regular updates with behind the scenes information about the films and about the restoration and production process. Some of these are done in text form and some as videos. Last year, during a 2-3 month pause while waiting for digital restoration work on the Douglas MacLean films to be done, we sent out an update every day or two with reviews of each of MacLean's 26 feature films; MacLean is completely forgotten and most of his films are lost or survive incomplete, and these updates gave backers the opportunity to become experts on MacLean's filmography.\n",
      "We've all heard of great silent films having been preserved at a film archive and thought, \"wouldn't it be great if somebody put that out on DVD?\". Here's a chance for you to be part of that \"somebody\"! Make your pledge to \"The Edward Everett Horton DVD Project\"…and participate in a unique silent film enterprise.\n",
      "I've been accompanying silent movies on piano and organ for nearly 4 decades; I play for silents at The Museum of Modern Art, Library of Congress, Silent Clowns Film Series (which I also produce) in NYC, and at festivals, historic theatres, schools and universities throughout the US and internationally. I've scored dozens of silent films for DVD release by companies like KinoLorber, Milestone, ReelclassicDVD and Thanhouser, for my own label (Undercrank Productions) as well as for broadcast on TCM.\n",
      "Over the last 7 years, I've produced and distributed 23 DVDs of rare silent films – great silent films you've never heard of…but should – fan-funded via Kickstarter. The films have been sourced either from collectors or from the Library of Congress, with whom I have a co-branding arrangement.\n",
      "My website is silentfilmmusic.com, and my complete line of DVDs can be seen at Undercrank Productions.\n",

      "\"The Edward Everett Horton DVD Project\" is my NINTH Kickstarter-crowdfunded  project, and all previous projects were successfully completed, and were done so on time or rather close to the expected date, and each went about $1,000 over the funding goal. Those DVD projects have been  well-reviewed in publications such as the NY Times, Sight & Sound, Cinema Crazed, DVDTalk and classic film blogs, and by dozens of Amazon  customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is always the chance that a scheduling or tech issue, or a  hiccup in the life/schedule of yours truly or someone on the production team may arise during the production of any DVD project, and when that's happened  previously it has only delayed the release by a month or two. The one  exception was on \"When Knighthood\" when, just as things were wrapping up  on production, a reel of nitrate 35mm containing 6 mins of lost footage  turned up; it was worth spending the extra few months getting that  print to the Library of Congress for preservation and scanning in order  to complete the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the current pandemic has made guaranteeing the scheduling of just about everything kind of a wild card. I will keep you posted on any shifts in our production schedule as they happen, and beg your patience with all this, as well as with the deliver of your copy of the DVD given the various unknown factors currently inhabiting the USPS and foreign mail services.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll keep you updated weekly with my progress, and if there are any  unforeseen delays you'll find out as soon as I know. For background, you  can read all the updates from \"Accidentally Preserved\", \"Musty Suffer\"  and \"Marcel Perez vol 1\" and \"When Knighthood Was in Flower\" and \"The Alice Howell Collection\" and \"The Douglas MacLean Collection\" on their respective Kickstarter pages.

In this campaign, I hope to document the early stage of building Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX)'s new spaceport in Texas, the world's first private spaceport. Ideally, I will begin photographing their property before they begin major construction, then continue in later campaigns to documenting further changes as they progress toward completion. I could use a little help getting there, though. That's where you come in. \n",

I can only do my best in that regard. I can promise that I will shoot photos of as much as gets in front of my camera as I can. I have driven many thousands of miles back and forth across Texas and surrounding states, shooting hundreds of photos during weeks-long road trips. I'm used to the challenges of these types of trips. My main weakness is processing the photos once I've returned; it typically takes me months to go through all of them. \n",

      "However, releasing music is more expensive than most realize! Even on a smaller project, the combination of producer and engineer fees, studio rental, mixing and mastering fees, merchandising, marketing, and creating a tangible, non-digital product has the potential to put an artist several thousand dollars in debt. However, by funding the project independently (i.e. without a record label backing me), I will own \"the masters\" of each song. That basically means I have the power to do WHAT I want to do with my music it WHEN I want to do it. After many years working in this crazy industry, I have learned that to be invaluable. \n",
      "Furthermore, I have made the [apparently] revolutionary decision to use REAL HUMAN MUSICIANS to play my original songs. This project is essentially an homage to my upbringing in Memphis, surrounded by soul music and soul artists. Digital instrumentation simply cannot provide the heart and grit that I hope to have on this project. I grew listening to music that was recorded live. They were all together, all in a single room, just playing some tunes, and thriving on the creative experience. It wasn't \"pop-perfect,\" but you felt the music. That's what I hope to do. This EP calls for the organic, old-fashioned relationship between a singer/songwriter and her players. \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "This project is brought to you by Sue Heale and Joshua Sibley, who have led the non-profit Kirkland Academy of Music and Performance in Kirkland,  Washington for the past 13 years.  Our goal is to bring live theater and film back to the Audion for the first time since 1942, making the facility a hub for community cultural events and education.\n",
      "Kickstarter pledges for this project are tax deductible!  We are a 501c-3!  \n",
      "Originally built as a mercantile and boarding house in 1889 after the July 4, 1889 Ellensburg fire destroyed much of the town, the Audion theater building became the Orpheus theater around the turn of the 20th Century and began live theater productions.  In 1912, the boarding house was closed by the City for being a brothel.  That floor of the building looks as if everyone walked out in 1912 and left the upper floor of the building frozen in time.  Some of the rooms even have the original beds and desks/dressers in them!  Who knows?  Maybe there is even a ghost or two in the cavernous space!\n",
      "In 1914, the theater celebrated a grand re-opening as the Colonial Theater which it was until the Farrell family remodeled it into the art deco form it is now.  Silent films were the hit then with the theater showing famous silent films by Charlie Chaplin and Hal Roach.  Traveling shows from Broadway came to town on the railroads and Ellensburg was hopping with four live performance venues.\n",
      "After decades of decline and empty buildings and storefronts, this community of 16,000 residents is seeing a robust revitalization thanks to the many hard-working and visionary folks who have a stake in Ellensburg.  The community has surrounded us with support-- the Chamber of Commerce, the Ellensburg Downtown Association,  Valley Musical Theater group, Boulet Productions in Roslyn, and more!  \n",
      "Theater and music events bring people into town!  Those people eat in restaurants, they shop in stores, they support the other local businesses around theaters.  Our work is about much more than getting to do what we enjoy so much which is theater!  It's about sustainability and revival of a small community just 90 miles from Seattle.  \n",
      "Our goal is to purchase and restore the building using loans from Craft3, a non-profit lender, and grants from the National Historic Preservation Trust and the National Endowment for the arts, combined with grants and funding from other Washington trusts and restoration groups.  Combined with some private funding, our goal is to have the theater operational within 2 years of the purchase.\n",
      "Goal #1-- $35,000 to get the organic coffee shop open in the lobby!  With 10,000 CWU students just a few blocks away and the Ellensburg community of 16,000, we're hoping that an organic coffee shop and place to grab an acai bowl or quick lunch will thrive.  The Coffee House will have Open Mic nights, poetry slams, and other community gatherings to engage the community in the theater restoration process and produce funds for the renovations.\n",
      "Goal #2-- If we reach our $35,000 goal, the next $50,000 will go towards opening the Boarding House on  the upper floor.  With 8-10 rooms, the goal is to have a place for artists residences and AirBNB options for those who might want to stay in a historic hotel space from the early 1900's.  Wouldn't it be fun to spend the night in a former brothel??  Honeymoon suite?? \n",
      "Goal #3-- If we keep hitting our stretch goals with amazing support from the community, the incoming funds will be directed towards the renovation of the theater space itself which is a lot of work.  The old dressing rooms remain as well as the original wooden fly system.  The rake is there underneath levels of flooring that were added for the antique mall that operated in the building beginning in the early 1980's.  The art deco style remains throughout the space, particularly in the lobby area.  We are working with a historic preservation architect to restore the theater to it's original character as much as possible.\n",
      "We hope to bring musical theater education and performance to Ellensburg as we have in Kirkland.  Our community theater group in Kirkland performs 2-3 shows per year with an all ages cast that consists of regular members of our community-- teachers, bankers, tech workers, stay-at-home moms and more!  With our over 4000 piece costume collection, we'll be able to continue our tradition of high quality original shows, written from public domain material.  We just landed a publishing deal with Chatwin Books of Seattle for our full length and school shows.  We will be publishing 1-2 per year as well as continuing our original writing. \n",
      "We are also excited to bring our musical theater restorations to Ellensburg.  Since 2013, we've restored the 1903 Wizard of Oz and the 1904 George M. Cohan work, Little Johnny Jones.  Our restoration work is very unique and well received by audiences.  These very shows would have played in theaters like the Audion in the early 1900's when George M. Cohan ruled Broadway and took his shows all over the United States. \n",
      "We have very few resources ourselves.  We cannot do this project without your support.  We are not seeking major donors, but, rather, everyday people who love music and theater who can support our project with small gifts.  Our goal is to get 2000 people to contribute $50 each.  \n",
      "Sue and Josh have a dream.  With our video garnering over 12,000 views in the first week we had our Facebook page, the Ellensburg community and surrounding areas are clearly very interested in our project.  Sue has met with several key community members already --Chamber of Commerce and Ellensburg Downtown Association leaders,  professors and students from CWU, members of the community who are doing other arts-related renovations, store and restaurant owners whose businesses in Downtown Ellensburg would benefit from the Audion being open and thriving and MORE!  All of these people have expressed a high level of support for this project!  \n",
      "Can you join us??\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The largest risk would be our funding for the purchase of the building falling through.  We feel quite confident that with Craft3 assisting us, the purchase of the building will happen.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Construction costs and timelines can be very tricky to navigate and end up being more than anticipated.  We are working closely with a historic architect local to Ellensburg to help us stay on budget and on the timeframe we'd like to achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have already met with City of Ellensburg historic preservation specialists to make sure the building can be restored and we've received the green light from them.  The current owner did a lot of necessary earthquake upgrades after the 2001 Nisqually earthquake so we feel confident we will not hit any structural issues that require major funding to fix.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A study done for CWU when they were considering purchasing this building showed the theater would be in use over 150 nights per year.  Many other groups have contacted us already, seeking space to rent and venue space for their existing groups.  We feel confident we'd be able to generate a large amount of revenue from renting the facility to for-profit groups and we promise to work with our lender to be able to offer either free or very low cost rental fees for other non-profits.\n",

      "Beautiful objects have been built to produce music throughout history.  Some continue to be used for decades or centuries, while others collect dust, as their music sources become obsolete.  Throughout the last century, millions of wonderful, unique AM radios were produced around the world to proudly broadcast from tables, bookshelves and mantles, yet when was the last time you turned one on? We're dusting off the vintage radio and giving it a chance to sing again.  Introducing the Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "These beautiful musical relics deserve a chance to shine again.  We're bringing them back to life by replacing their aged electronics with a brand new 8W Bluetooth 4.0 amplifier.  This transforms these obsolete radios into beautiful universal Bluetooth speakers, ready to play any music your heart desires. Mixing old and new not only produces completely unique Bluetooth speakers, it is also environmentally friendly.  As the only new components are the circuit-boards, power cords, and a little wiring, every Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speaker produced is one less vintage radio in landfill and one less new speaker and casing produced.\n",

      "With an unlimited number of unique styles, there is a Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speaker for every room of your home, office or workshop. Each converted radio comes with a brand new amplifier for reliability and peace-of-mind, while retaining the original speaker for a classic sound. Simply plug it in, turn on your phone's Bluetooth and turn up the tunes! The amplifier runs Bluetooth 4.0, so will work with a huge range of devices.  No special apps needed, just connect and hit play.  \n",

      "Take your Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speaker with you wherever you chose. Power is supplied via a special USB cable, allowing your new speaker to be powered just about anywhere, via your phone charger, in the car, or add a USB battery bank* and play music anywhere.  Anything with a 1.5A or higher USB output will get the tunes cranking. By connecting to your existing battery bank* or charger, we're avoiding making unnecessary batteries and power supplies, making our speakers even more environmentally friendly.\n",

      "Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speakers are the first product range in our effort to breathe new life into beautiful old objects. At Boe we love the look of 1930s to 1970s mantel and tabletop radios, but with their aging electronics and AM only reception we don't have a use for them. Bluetooth speakers are popping up everywhere and we love their convenience, we don't want yet another throw-away electronic device.  We decided to fill two needs with one deed, giving old radios a new life and getting a bluetooth speaker without the waste. Our grand plan is to continue to blur the line between new and old, by developing quality products that meet the same needs as new devices, but with unique style and reduced environmental impact through re-use.\n",
      "We carefully hand pick every radio that we convert. All our converted radios proudly show the battle scars of a life well lived. They have chips or scratches, marks or fading, but they are solid and they are beautiful. Every one tells a story, and with our conversion, every one now has another lifetime to live. We all have a story to tell, so too should our possessions.\n",

      "As a trained designer and engineer, I have spent years finding new ways to make use of old products.  With the recent birth of my first child I feel the time is now right to put all of my energy into creating a better world for our generation and the ones following, by re-imagining the re-use and re-creation of products.

Because we are not using the original electronic components, their variety is not a concern. We have carefully selected a bluetooth amplifier board that is compact enough to fit in any case, with the volume control and power connection on separate wires so that they can be located wherever the case requires. The volume control has a nice universal fitting so that we can generally reuse the original volume knob, while the power connection has been selected to fit unobtrusively where the original power cord exited.\n",

All speakers are 12V only, powered by a unique USB cable that connects directly to your existing phone charger or USB battery bank*. To make things even safer we've kept soldering to a minimum, and fused the power input on every conversion.

      "WEDNESDAY IN SPACE is a low-budget sci-fi comedy written and directed by Hudson Hughes. A small diner in the galaxy's armpit is turned into a crime scene after the staff find a man's body lying on the bathroom floor - his head decorating all four walls. Not an uncommon sight for the diner's staff, but this was no ordinary space-sucking citizen - this was a Boogeyman.\n",
      "Traffic warden Lucha Flax is no detective but she's the only one for the job, and possibly the only one who cares. With starving musicians, government spooks, French rebels and increasingly aggressive TV commercials, this will be anything but a normal Wednesday. Wednesday in Space is a laugh-a-minute sci-fi comedy, heavily inspired by 70s space movies but with a unique and twisted sense of humour (or humor, if you're into American comedy).\n",
      "I have been creating comedy films (and stage shows) for several years and in 2019 I decided to push myself and a group of 20 talented friends into the creative unknown - the final frontier, if you'll pardon the pun (please). It took the contents of my piggy bank and a metric ass-load of favours to obtain all the costumes, prop and set required to shoot this crazy film. The space diner was built over the course of a month in my reasonably-sized garage.\n",
      "The film was shot in the space of 7 days, again pardon the pun. The unique blend of improv and sleep deprivation is what lends Wednesday in Space its signature flavour.\n",
      "After the main shoot, it was time for some old-school visual effects using detailed miniatures and compositing techniques. Additionally, the film is broken up by intermittent TV commercials with a variety of whacky presenters, sometimes passive-aggressive and sometimes aggressive-aggressive. These were all shot on the same day and almost entirely improvised.\n",
      "When I started this project I knew I had the tools required to see it through to film festivals, where it has successfully been selected and awarded, but after an early cut received raucous laughter at a private cinema screening I knew WEDNESDAY IN SPACE could have a life beyond the festivals.\n",

You're Matt Damon and I'm George Clooney. And I'm also Brad Pitt. And Don Cheadle. Screw it, I'm all eleven of them and you're Julia Roberts. The point is, we need your help.\n",
      "As explained in the video, the money is split between marketing, distribution and getting the film cinema-ready. Getting an age-rating certificate from the BBFC (the UK's organisation for film classification and censorship) ain't cheap, nor is getting the video and sound in a playable cinema format. Within our marketing budget is the cost of a fancy premiere at one of London's best independent cinemas. You can attend this black-tie event yourself or if you're too far away then look at our pledging options where you'll see the option to join our virtual premiere months before the film reaches streaming services (you can still wear a tux in front of your computer though). Costs also go towards the (might I venture to say:) epic rewards on offer, such as posters, prints, stickers, badges, tote bags and shipping!

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "What is Ronald's Little Factory, and who the F is Ronald?\n",
      "In 1976, a top Mormon leader gave an anti \"Self touching\" talk to young men. He likened their reproductive systems to Little Factories. The talk was used for decades to create young obedient Mormons . It was known as \"The Little Factory\" talk.\n",
      "Ronald is a good young Mormon in the year 1989. Like all good Mormon men who turn 19, Ronald is preparing to go on his 2 year mission for the church. But the night before he leaves,  he becomes tempted to commit the horrible sin of \"Self loving\" his little factory. So he decides to take measures into his own hands and handcuffs his sinful hand to the bedpost. Success...until he can't find the keys. What follows is a crazy satire about Religion, bondage and sex...with oneself.\n",
      "Who are you?\n",
      "Brent Bokovoy was raised in San Diego. He was raised a Mormon and went on a 2 year mission to Seattle. Just like Ronald, Brent was the perfect little Mormon boy...but then he found Rated R movies and it went all downhill from there. Brent is pretty much Ronald...except Brent is probably a lot more awkward. Perhaps YOU can find a little or a lot of Ronald in yourself!\n",
      "How offensive is this to Mormons?\n",
      "The point is not to make fun of Mormons but to have fun with the culture of Mormonism. It is certainly geared towards ExMormons and Post-Mormons but my hope is that active, open minded, Cards of Humanity playing Mormons can find it enjoyable as well.\n",
      "Why Crowdfunding and where will the money go?\n",
      "Ronald's Little Factory is a niche film that will probably not appeal to an ultra wide market, making the film hard to make through a conventional studio. So we are going directly to the fans to help produce the film and in return there are some great rewards!\n",
      "Where will the film be distributed? \n",
      "The plan is to have several theatrical events in Utah. Each event will be hosted by someone in the post-Mormon world and there will be a Q&A after the show with the filmmakers and audience. Soon after the limited theatrical events, the film will be released worldwide for online purchases and rentals.\n",
      "Did someone say rewards?\n",
      "Hell yeah! Check out the rewards (to the right) you receive for pledging and becoming part of the team! The rewards range from receiving a copy of the finished film, invites to events and parties, crazy merchandise, producer credit roles, sponsorship, filming an advertisement for your company and more!\n",
      "Just a couple of the 80's style merchandise mock-ups.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The Covid-19 virus has turned the entire world upside, as we all know. The time frame of production and release of the film will largely depend on where we are in the world in relation to the virus. The plan is to shoot in late September/early October, if the virus situation is way better. If not, we may have to temporarily hold off on the shoot but our intention is to shoot 2 months after the end of the campaign and release the film in spring of 2021.\n",

      "'Numbleypeg' is a short short. We're here for a good time not a long time.\n",
      "The film is funny, occasionally gross, and also completely heartfelt. It's about the weird rivalries and deep understandings that exist between siblings.\n",
      " 'Numbleypeg' stars Garth Hodgson (Resident Alien, The Twighlight Zone) and Matthew Graham (Heel Kick!, Supernaturals) as two estranged brothers trying to reconnect on a weekend camping trip in the bush. But when a dispute arises between the pair and neither is prepared to compromise, things take a turn for the deadly.\n",
      "'Numbleypeg' will be shot in one day, using outdoor locations. A production crew of just 8 people will make it happen. All of the crew members will be working for minimum wage, plus expenses. This means we can create something of exceptional quality technically that is far below the market rate of production. In short, the money goes on screen, not in anyones pocket.\n",

      "Since the weather is flipped from the USA and South Africa, in December it will be summer there. Therefore, I am hoping the weather will not be a problem and will not rain or thunderstorm, causing the production to be postponed a day or so.

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "After years messing around baking in my kitchen, I finally decided to start writing down my (successful) recipes to put together into a cook book. Because I also have a love for art and illustration, hand drawing each page has become my ultimate labor of love. The joy I get from combining all of my interests including pastry, art and graphic design into one huge mega project has been the driving force behind me spending hours in my kitchen baking and creating. While reading this cook book I hope you are pleasantly surprised by all the time and effort I put into its design and take the time to discover all the delicious recipes within. \n",
      "This cook book is completely hand drawn and designed by me, filled with all sorts of recipes from tartlets to eclairs to cupcakes, but with entirely new and unique flavor combinations. Ever tried black sesame and lemon curd together? Or wondered what other colors of sweet potato pies there are? What about making a cupcake filled with \"the other carrot\" and topped with tangy, sweet maple cream cheese frosting? Throughout this cook book you will enjoy the wonderful recipes (all created and baked in my home kitchen and tasted by most of my neighborhood) along with the beautiful and fun artwork decorating each page. \n",
      " \n",
      "This whole process begins with the recipes themselves. I draw inspiration from classic dishes but infuse anything-but-classic flavor pairings into them. This will hopefully  expose the reader to ingredients they never thought would go so well together and maybe even ones they have never tried or even heard of. After many trials to fine tune my recipe idea, I make the final version and write down all of my steps, ending with a few nice photographs of the bake. I then use these photographs to draw each of the recipes and ingredients and think up a fun name. The drawings themselves are not super fancy: just black ink on white paper. Its after scanning them in that I am able to transform and color them on Adobe Illustrator. Armed with a somewhat witty title and all my images, I go about designing the rest of the page and layout then the page is finished. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "The timeline for this project is pretty fast paced due to the fact that when I'm excited about a project I go full force into it. I plan on the entire recipe creation and design process to take about 5-6 weeks. The rest of the time is dedicated to working with a publisher to fine tune the book and get it printed! I expect the entire process to be done sometime in July or August at the latest, with books widely available in September. \n",
      "Your generous donations will help make this book a reality. I've decided to divid the budget into two main categories: materials and book (including printing and publishing costs). Materials include all of the ingredients and supplies I go through creating the recipes and will receive about 25% of the funds. The other 3 quarters of the budget will be saved for printing and publishing costs associated with creating, making and marketing the book. \n",
      " \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "In creating my cook book there are two challenges that I plan on possibly encountering. The first being a personal one. Being an artist has its ups and downs, creativity comes in waves and then leaves you all at once for a few days even. With all my art in the past, I've encountered this mental block, but the thing that helps me power through is having a predetermined plan ahead of time, full of different projects and options. I often start a drawing by having five different options and ideas, so when I get stuck I can go right on to the other and just come back to it later. The same goes for recipe creation. By planning out a whole list of the recipes I want to tackle, if ever I get stuck or frustrated I can go on to another (even if I have to stare at my lumpy caramel for a few seconds to sulk).\n",
      "\n",
      "The second hurdle may come with the publishing. I have currently been talking to a plethora of different publishing companies, I just have yet to commit to one and start the publishing process. I see this happening within the next few weeks, but if for any reason this is not possible, I will self publish the book and still be able to send it to backers.\n",

      "Celebrating food and culture, The Recipe Box Project gathers more than 50 passionate chefs and creative vendors to share their recipes in showcasing Vancouver's diverse flavours. \n",
      "The recipes cover a wide range of tantalizing items from breakfast to midnight snacks flavoured by sugar, spice and everything nice! There are even cocktails and concoctions! \n",
      "With 100 recipes, there is something for everyone...including the vegans! \n",
      " \n",
      "Vancouver is a place where people welcome diversity and embrace cultural backgrounds – these qualities are very well integrated into the food community. But it is only through traveling in different countries around the world that confirms how diverse the food scene really is. Italian, Japanese, Thai, Greek, Arabic, Caribbean, Burmese - name it and you can find it, done well. \n",
      "When there is a lot to offer, we often expect the quality scale to tip one way or the other. Not here, where, chefs share strong passions toward their roots. Evidently, the level of authenticity for each cuisine is striking. Vancouver is also home for food startups that consistently reinvent, mostly driven by the large amount of \"foodies\" on a constant search for the next it food. \n",
      "Unmistakably a major centre full of gourmet fanatics, passionate chefs and creative vendors blessed with an abundance of fresh Pacific Northwest ingredients, it's no surprise that Vancouver ranks 14th on Condé Nast Traveler® Best Food Cities in the World\n",

      "This ultimate recipe collection features some of the best chefs in the city including celebrity chef, Vikram Vij, California-roll creator, Hidekazu Tojo, mastermind of asian-fare empire, Angus An, upscale “haute Italian” pioneer, Pino Posteraro, and internationally acclaimed chocolatier and pastry chef, Thomas Haas. \n",
      "Restaurant participants include the iconic Café Medina, Miku, Bauhaus, Torafuku, Havana, Nuba, Kingyo, Earnest Ice Cream, Japadog and many, many more. From casual grub to upscale dining, every contributor engaged in this project is locally acclaimed and a paragon to its genre - many which are well recognized by Van Magazine's Best Restaurant Awards, Georgia Straight's Golden Plates, and a few listed on \"Canada's 100 Best\".\n",
      " \n",
      "The \"box\" is a metaphor for Vancouver’s cultural melting-pot. And, because old-school is the new cool! We all remember grandmother's index-card recipe box - why not bring it back with a modern twist?\n",
      "Cookbooks and big coffee table books are great to look at but people rarely bring them into the kitchen. \n",
      "Keeping functionality and beauty in mind, the box format allows a contemporary design with wooden surface suitable for kitchen space and on book shelves. \n",
      "The recipe cards are water-resistant, beautifully printed on 4\" x 6\" format showcasing drool-worthy photographs along with clear, approachable instructions that will guarantee to inspire home cooks and food enthusiasts alike.

Coffee Houses, ice cream shops, restaurants, bars, bakeries, art galleries, and glorious, GLORIOUS pizza — all within walking distance! \n",
      "But every silver cloud has a grey lining.\n",
      "We looked around and realized that the nearest movie theater was a 45-minute walk from home. We decided to drive to a different theater 30 minutes away, and suddenly a Saturday night movie seemed more like a chore than a night out, and a rip-off, rather than a treat.. \n",

      "Knowing our audience also means we can provide better service at a more reasonable price point. Most importantly, we can engage our community in a way that the big boys can’t touch—  by treating people like neighbors, friends, and family... not just profit centers.   \n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Enter Adam Cramer. The owner of Liberty Vintage Motorcycles, resident of Fishtown for over a decade, and Brass Ribbon's future landlord. From his Massive 4000 Square Foot Warehouse on Sepviva St.,  he's seen the neighborhood transform into what it is today. Real estate prices being what they are, he could have sold the garage, closed the shop, and made a tidy sum years ago. However, he was intentional about seeing the space turned into a neighborhood hub. .\n",
      "...And it started with a Facebook post.\n",
      "We connected with Adam through a community Facebook page. Adam had put up a post looking for a tenant that would make use of half of his Garage in a way that would be fun, and would add value  the neighborhood we call home. It didn't take long for us to fall in love with the space, and after meeting Adam and hearing his story, we knew we had found the perfect location.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that while half of the 4,000 square foot garage will be renovated to accommodate Brass Ribbon Cinema, the other half will remain as a haven for vintage motorcycles— some of which will be on full display for everyone to enjoy!

The beauty of this is that it gives all of us an equal opportunity to take something good from a story that we may never live ourselves.\" - Mairobi\n",

      "Starting any new business is not without its risks and challenges. For us, that means we have 4 significant bridges to cross. .\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial sustainability: A real (but perhaps unfounded) concern that we have is that people will simply not show up. The truth is that Fishtown doesn’t have a movie theater currently in operation, and the nearest small theater is in the heart of Center City. This doesn’t give us much to go on as far as what kind of attendance to expect. Keeping that in mind, we designed our budget to be able to survive for on a bare minimum. Filling just 6% of our seats per day will provide enough revenue to cover all of our operating costs for the duration of our lease. This budget also doesn't account for revenue from things like theater rentals, on-screen advertising, concessions or merchandising. We feel that this gives us a great buffer against fluctuations in attendance, and will allow us a great deal of flexibility in finding the most profitable way to operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acceptance: Fishtown can be a deeply political place, and we’ve already encountered folks who for one reason or another are less than thrilled with the idea of someone opening a movie theater here. One of the unique things about what we are doing is that instead of destroying a Fishtown landmark and replacing it with something new, we’ve found a happy medium, by partnering with a long-term resident we can create something new out of a space that's already here. In time, in we think that those who feel apprehensive about what we intend to do will realize that we’re just another part of why this is such a great place to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "Renovation: As inspiring as the Liberty Vintage garage is, a movie theater it is not. The bulk of our costs will be spent transforming this space into Fishtown's only neighborhood cinema. We are confident that with a solid vision, a written plan, and a great general contractor, we can build something enjoyable  and functional.\n",
      "\n",
      "Licensing: There is also the issue of licensing films. Before we can (legally) screen a movie publicly, we must get a license to do so from the distributor. We are actively contacting distributors in order to expand our catalog for opening day. Having a great selection on opening day and beyond is extremely important to us. The challenge comes with getting the right films at the right price at the right time in order to give everyone the best experience possible.\n",

Originally designed and opened in 1914, we are set to return this beautiful building to its original luster. \n",
      "The renovation boasts a 500-seat house along with an upscale restaurant/bar and gift shop for its patrons.  The target market is any fan of Fort Worth, music, comedy, stage performances, movies and entertainment. The Isis offers family events appealing to cowboys and cowgirls of all ages. \n",
      "The theatre will take you back in time with its ambiance, but it will give you some of the greatest acoustic and \"stripped down\" performances guaranteed to wow every week. Additional opportunities are available through movies running daily that stay true to the authentic world of the Fort Worth Stockyards. Attendees at all functions will also be afforded the opportunity to shop a variety of souvenir offerings in the gift shop or to simply enjoy a beverage at the bar. Additional functions are happening year round, available through our collaboration with film festivals, Stock Shows and Rodeos, and other community events in the area.  \n",
      "As you can see, there is a lot of work to be done.  This campaign is a small amount, but will have a huge impact on the success of our renovation.  We are confident we are prepared financially, but the unknown stumbling blocks are having an effect on the day to day operations.  This Kickstarter campaign will tremendously help us close that financial gap between what we know and what may be beyond our control.   \n",
      "The Isis Theatre has a rich history, one we are committed to preserving for years to come, and we are ready to begin.  Downtown Cowtown at the Isis is looking to the community at large play a part in the saving of this beautiful building, to have a hand in the salvage process, and contributions from the Kickstarter community is the best vehicle for that to occur.  The Isis theatre has been standing dormant since the early 80's, and everyone has wanted to see this beautiful building come back to life. We want you to be a part of this rich history.  We are committed to providing you regular updates on our progress, special events that will be happening during the renovation process, and unique insights to the building as it comes back to life.  All of the proceeds from this campaign are dedicated to the revival of this great building, and your contributions will not go unnoticed.  Your name will be enshrined for all to see that you helped bring this building back to life.  We have created a Wall of Fame for all contributors.  Your name will be seen by all the visitors world wide that come to see this great establishment.  Whether attending a concert or event, or simply touring the facility to see its rich history, you can brag to your friends how your small contribution to our project made a big difference.  \n",

As you can see from the video, a lot of work needs to be done, and it comes with a hefty price tag.  Whereas we feel confident that we can afford the major renovation, it is important to us that the community has the opportunity to share in this historical revitalization.  We also want to stay viable during the renovation, and additional liquid capital will help us do just that.  \n",

Each member has their area of expertise, and are dedicated to making this building a thriving part of the Stockyards community.  As we are a multi purpose facility, we have worked hard to build a strong advisory board, a strong team of consultants and a clear plan to bring this building back to life.  With the onset of two of the worst Hurricanes in history, we know that our timeline may extend, materials may increase in cost, and we may have to fill a gap to meet these new challenges.  We believe this small Kickstarter will also help fill that gap.\n",

      "Eight Beat Measure needs YOU to help them make their full-length album, \"Polarized\" a reality.\n",
      " \n",
      "**\n",
      "Help the hard working college students of the all-male collegiate a cappella group Eight Beat Measure fund the release of “Polarized”, an all new concept album. Just what is that concept? It's an R&B genre only album featuring some of your favorite and soon to be favorite songs. **\n",
      "No collegiate a cappella group has produced an all R&B album. Eight Beat Measure would like to take this opportunity to not only convey their music, but also as chance to start a new trend in a cappella helping to define Eight Beat as innovative and once again place them at the forefront of collegiate a cappella.  \n",
      "Who is Eight Beat Measure? Well, they are all full-time students at Rochester Institute of Technology, all majoring in non-music fields, who simply come together with a passion for music. Eight Beat Measure is one of the nations top collegiate a cappella groups with a long range of accomplishments:\n",
      "What does this project means to Eight Beat Measure? Eight Beat has been hard at work towards arranging, performing and recording this album. This project is a concept that is very rare in the world of a cappella, a single genre album. Most conventional storybook albums convey an entire year or two of songs sang by a group, this album covers songs from only one genre sang by Eight Beat over the course of two years.\n",
      "What does your money go toward? Any money received from the backing of this project goes toward the final production. This includes the final recording, mixing, editing and mastering. Many hours spent toward perfecting every track, note & rhythm produced by Eight Beat, not including the two years to learn, practice, perfect & record each song.\n",
      "What happens if we exceed our $10,000 goal? If this amazing opportunity were to happen Eight Beat plans to use excess money for two amazing opportunities:\n",
      "$15,000- This would fund a high school tour for Eight Beat Measure, where they will not only perform for but work with high school students interested in music and spread their passion for music. These students would learn how to arrange, blend when singing, record, vocal percuss and how to network themselves.\n",
      "$20,000- Eight Beat would professionally record a music video of one of the tracks off the CD in collaboration with Dangerous Signs, a deaf sign language performance troupe at RIT, bridging deaf culture with a cappella music in a way never done before.\n",
      "How can you help? Simple, just click the \"Back This Project\" button on the top of the page, you know that nice green one.\n",
      "Eight Beat Measure would like to say \"Thank You!\" to everyone who has made their dream become a reality. They could not do it without all of your generous donations.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "With all their hard work done to produce their album, they just need that final push, one that comes with its own struggles. One of the unique characteristics of Eight Beat is that not one member studies music. All members are full-time students who major in engineering, computer science, chemistry and business. They simply love to make music and share their love with the world. Due to this it makes the ability of recording, arranging and performing an extra effort, one that they have continued to excel in. While this project is underway, many of the songs need to go through a post production process and some final recordings. The post production involves mixing, editing and when all is right mastering. A concept album featuring only one genre of music is something not normally done in the a cappella world, this project breaks the trend of traditional storybook albums.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With your backing we will fulfill our ultimate goal of releasing the most ambitious goal Eight Beat has ever taken upon. Thanks for your donation, you will not be disappointed!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "The MEGAschino Amplifier (or simply \"MEGA\") is an audio power amp combining massive headroom with outstanding sonics.  The MEGA is offered in Stereo and MONO versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "BRIEF HISTORY\n",
      "We started producing the DAC4800A amplifier in 2006.  It was a pro-sumer type product with a Run/Stand-By toggle button and Power/Clip/Protect/Run LEDs on the front.\n",
      "We later put the LEDs inside (they shine through the lid vent holes) and added a red anodized 3/8\" thick brushed aluminum faceplate.  This was our first Cherry Amplifier ®.  Later, we moved to a simple lineup: Stereo or MONO and Standard or ULTRA.  Several faceplate options were added, like silver, black, and even cherry wood.  We still make these amplifiers today.  The ULTRA versions have 1500W transformers and GOLD WBT posts with improved output filters and double power supply capacitance on the MONO ULTRA version.\n",
      "After years of successful production and great reviews, we introduced the Maraschino Amplifier.  The Maraschino was a new circuit design able to reach 100kHz bandwidth with end-to-end DC coupling for response down to 0Hz and no bass phase shift.  The ground of the amplifier is locked to the preamp (or DAC) ground to eliminate hum and ground noise.  The result?  Customers and pro reviewers alike praise the Maraschino for sonics that go way beyond today's cookie-cutter \"me-too\" module based high-end amplifiers.\n",
      "The Maraschino Amplifier product line grew to include Desktop Maraschino, a new shape for monoblock amplifiers, In-Line Maraschino, amplifiers so light, you can hang them from your speakers, yet so powerful, they can deliver up to 1000W into 1.8Ω, and Stereo Maraschino, an integrated amp with front and back inputs plus volume control.\n",
      "Although the Maraschino's power delivery into 4Ω is an admirable 400W (with 60V 1kW power supply), what if you crave even more power with that signature super-clean-and-fast Maraschino sound?  How about more than double the power?\n",
      "CULMINATION\n",
      "Enter the MEGAschino: Maraschino sound with Classic Cherry power ....and so much more. This is the new level of amplification.  We combined what we learned from the Maraschino with a few new ideas (years of R&D), allowing higher voltage plus higher current carrying capability. This was no easy feat.\n",
      "The result is simply amazing sound. This graph shows sonic performance versus power output of the Cherry Classic, Maraschino, and new MEGAschino: \n",
      "About the Technology ---- How does this affect the SOUND?\n",
      "The MEGA uses 12 output devices per channel, and the Maraschino uses 4.  This is like comparing a V4 engine to a V12 engine. The result is essentially 3 times the current handling capability.\n",
      "We also developed a superior method for removing spurs in the passband at low levels, thus allowing an even lower \"spike free\" noise floor than Maraschino.\n",
      "\n",
      "The huge headroom and DC coupling of the MEGA deliver stunning bass with \"hit you in the chest\" transients.  This amp can deliver serious current (peaks above 50A)!  With a super strong toroidal transformer based power supply and ultra low output impedance into the upper registers, instruments and voices are rendered with unrivaled clarity on even power hungry speakers.  It's like a bottomless pit of super clean power!  Plus, the highs have a silkiness that allows the proper fade to cymbals, and super fast transients are no longer inhibited.  The most surprising thing of all is the performance at low volumes.  You don't need to crank it up to get refined focus and locked-in imaging.\n",
      "The MEGA is capable of a feather touch as well as the brute force of previous \"super amps\".\n",
      "The MEGAschino Upgrade !\n",
      "Classic Cherry owners can upgrade their amps to MEGAschino level. We do this by replacing the boards. Everything else stays the same, including the transformer and connectors. With the MEGA's even lower output impedance and wider pulse differentials, you can get approximately 10% more power into your speakers from the same power supply. This gives you more \"slam\" for bass dynamics.\n",
      "New MEGAschinos\n",
      "New MEGAs come with black faceplates and 750W transformers.  That's per amp, so MEGA MONOs have one 750W transformer per channel while a Stereo MEGA drives two channels with a single 750W transformer.  Options include 1500W transformer upgrades and double or quadruple capacitance.  Note that quadruple capacitance is only available on the MONO MEGA.  We plan to offer a 2000W transformer upgrade in the near future.\n",
      "Early Acclaim\n",
      "Customers and reviewers have already praised the MEGA for it's sound quality....\n",
      "    \"Outrageous detail even at the lowest levels!\"        - Nick M / Allentown PA\n",
      "    \"Best Class-D I've ever heard and probably the best high power amp.\"        - Jack Roberts / The Audio Beatnik\n",
      "    \"Nothing makes my Legacies sing like the MEGA.  Amazing!\"        - Brian F / New Port Richey FL\n",
      "    \"....it sounded just perfect to me.  Besides the point that I think the MEGAschino and the Tektons are a perfect match.\"        - John J / Freehold NJ\n",
      "The MEGA has similar sound quality to the Maraschino, with more authority and refinement.  There are many reviews of Maraschino and MEGAschino amplifiers HERE.\n",
      "What's Inside?\n",
      "The MEGAschino uses key parts of the Classic Cherry design, such as a large toroidal transformer and a built-like-a-tank 16 gauge steel chassis.\n",
      "The MEGA board set consists of a motherboard and one or two channel boards.  The channel boards are oriented vertically.  Large power capacitors (up to 8) are mounted to the motherboard.\n",

      "RISKS ARE LOW\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital Amplifier Company has a history of successfully amplifier designs spanning more than 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Confidence is very high that we will be able to optimize the MEGAschino Cherry Amplifier board set because the modifications are minimal -- mostly parts placement. We successfully prototyped the boards for our previous Kickstarter project.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also confident in our ability to successfully develop a 2000W transformer to fit our existing chassis. Countermeasures are in place to accommodate a taller transformer by modifying the chassis lid if necessary. We recently built a 2000W prototype transformer that exceeded maximum internal height by less than 0.5\".  Worst case, we will get as close as possible to 2000W.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our customer-first philosophy has led to a growing and loyal customer base, so we expect sufficient participation in this Kickstarter project. We also have a track record of four successfully funded Kickstarter projects. We reached our funding goal on Day 1 of our two most recent Kickstarter projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHALLENGES\n",
      "\n",
      "Our biggest challenges with this project are logistics and timing. This is common for any new product development where the technology is already proven.\n",

      "SUPPLY CHAIN / TIME LINE\n",
      "\n",
      "The supply chain for the MEGAschino is already established through previous designs and prototyping of the original MEGAschino boards. We are using the Classic Cherry chassis, so wire harnesses, transformers, faceplates, and shipping containers have all been used in production amplifiers for several years.\n",

      "A twist on a classic effect, with plenty of delay time and endless tweakability. Our high-quality digital hardware platform allows you to experiment like never before. Create sounds ranging from subtle echos, to mind-bending reversed multi-delays.\n",
      "Modulation Mode \n",
      "Four modulation types including volume, low-pass, high-pass and resonant filtering. Choose from three modulation sub-modes, allowing you to decide where the modulation occurs; at signal input (PRE), before feedback (MOD) or after feedback (POST).\n",
      "Control modulation rate/speed (rightmost knob) and depth (middle knob), turning the rate knob fully clockwise allows you use the filters without modulation. This is especially useful in 'POST' modulation mode, where you can repeatedly feed the sound through the filter.\n",
      "ProTip: In 'PRE' modulation mode, you can turn the decay knob fully counter-clockwise to use the pedal for modulation/tremolo without delay!\n",
      "Multi Mode\n",
      "A delay with multiple copies of your repeats. Real-time pattern creation and sixteen customizable repeat patterns. Three multi-mode playback settings including standard, reverse and octave. Allowing you to change the way individual repeats sound.\n",
      "In Multi Mode, the middle knob allows you to select the repeat pattern. The cluster of four LEDs shows the pattern you are selecting.\n",
      "ProTip For Geeks: The pattern LED arrangements represent binary numbers 0000 - 1111. \n",
      "Pattern 0 (or 0000) is real-time creation mode. When this pattern is selected, you can use the black button to tap your pattern between delays.\n",
      "Swell\n",
      "In any mode, holding the tap footswitch will swell the decay setting. Releasing the footswitch will allow the decay to decrease until it settles back to its original setting. This feature is great for emphasizing repeats, and creating monstrous walls of sound. While swell mode is engaged, the middle four LEDs will indicate the swell level. Swell attack and decay times can also be configured in our MIRAGE Tools application.\n",
      "Tap Tempo\n",
      "Dial in your delay time using the tap switch or an external footswitch. \n",
      "Expression Control and External Switch\n",
      "The MIRAGE features 3.5mm expression and switch inputs. The function of each of these inputs can be configured on-the-go, defaults can also be set up in the MIRAGE Tools application.\n",
      "An expression pedal can be mapped to any of the top 3 knobs or the mix control. This is accomplished by holding down the middle button and selecting using the decay knob. The top three LEDs indicate which knob the expression input is controlling.\n",
      "The external switch can be mapped to any of the bottom 3 switches/buttons. This is accomplished by holding down the middle button and selecting using the rate|var knob. The bottom three LEDs indicate which switch will be controlled externally.\n",
      "MIRAGE Tools Web-Application\n",
      "We've developed a simple web application that allows you to create and edit patterns, and modify a variety of the MIRAGE's core settings. This application works in conjunction with our firmware update software.\n",
      "Some available settings:\n",
      "MIRAGE Tools will continue to be developed after this campaign, and MIRAGE owners are encouraged to give feature recommendations.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "I am excited about this project because I feel like I have a new love in my spirit this time.  I recently went out of the country and traveled to Athens, Greece to be with a closed friend for 12-days.  It was mine first time visiting an International country.  I could feel God's spirit around me tugging at my heart to pick up my work.  I also want to contribute something to my late grandson Titan who has been deceased for about 2 years.  I am inspire to keep moving in pushing my dreams into reality.\n",
      "What I am raising is, the funds that I need to help me fund for my books and magazines of getting them printed, published, book signing, traveling to speak at conferences and other things.  It is to help me get connected and network with others who are successful in the world.  \n",
      "Why do I care about it, is important to me and I have a passion for wanting to help those who have lost hope in their life.  I am the only one pushing my dream and believing that the work that I am doing will someday be great among all people in the world.  Although, we may be scarred but not forgotten because WE let others know that God loves us.  My work and projects have great potential and I see it in myself.\n",
      "How do I plan to make it happen, is through my websites and social media of letting others know that my work will be ready for them to see and read.  I will also begin to make homemade Butterscotch pie to help increase my funds. Last thing look into taking out a personal loan to help pay for expenses.\n",
      "Who I am, is a Writer, Author, Songwriter, Movie Script and an Visionary with a passion for those who have been scarred but not forgotten.  Let them know that there is still hope in their scars.  Encourage those who have went through death, tragedy, violence, hatred and hopelessness.  Become a Better Me and You.\n",
      "The rewards are great because God said that my latter years shall be greater.  If I work my faith around my projects and push my dream into reality.  I just learn to work hard and keep pushing my dream into reality.  I have plenty of books and magazines to write.  I have a story to tell to those movie producers and others.  The purpose in my life has great reward and others will begin to see it as well.  Because I do have what it takes to be successful in this world.  I have swag in my style and different from the rest. It's within me. \n",
      "In addition, Swag In My Style started out to be a book, but I decided to put it in a magazine because magazines are easier to read and short.  Most magazines issues come out monthly so it is easy to keep up with my work and projects.\n",
      "My project was uploaded but slides may not be in order.  I apology for not having a photographer because I did the work myself. Please polish it up for me. If you need details please let me know and I will walk you through it. I hope you enjoy magazine and books and other things to come!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I do not see any risks or challenges at this time.  I have a team that I am working with. D.Peter-Artists and Graphic Designer, Ezekiel-Photographer, Denny-Photographer, El Marchbanks Jr-Artists, Musician, and The Richardson-Interior and Exterior Designers.  The only thing that may hold up things is from Archway Publishing whom I asked to check back with me next March to see if I can up with the money.  I am on a free 30-day trial basis and I had to make payment arrangements.  Archway Publishing is better than my last publisher.  Archway Publishing is under Simon&Schuster New York, NY.\n",

      "'The recipes here are an ethereal mix of hearty and delicate, of simple and complex… I could eat any and all.'Shaun Hill, Food writer, broadcaster and Michelin-starred chef/patron at The Walnut Tree Inn\n",
      "I've written my first cookbook for 20 years and I think it's a cracker. It's a collection of the very best recipes from both my cafes and my home life. The best of the best. I'd like your help to get it published.\n",
      "Thanks to all the wonderful backers Bill's Kitchen has now reached its initial Kickstarter funding target of £15,000. If we can get to £20,000 before 31st May then I'll know that the interest in it is even stronger than I'd hoped for and I'll increase the print run.\n",
      "I created my first restaurant  ‘The Place Below’ in the crypt of St Mary-le-Bow  in 1989, followed by Café @ All Saints, Hereford (1997), The Refectory at St David’s Cathedral (2005) and the Michaelhouse Café, situated in St Michaels Church in Cambridge (2008).\n",
      "My previous 2 books (Food From The Place Below and Feasts From The Place Below) have been much loved and have sold between them around 20,000 copies and are still selling today. But my cooking has moved on and I'm excited and delighted to have the opportunity to write another cookbook with everything that is most delicious from my life of food over the last 20 years.\n",
      "Having been a vegetarian for 10 years, for the last 20 years my cooking and the menus in my cafes have been thoroughly omnivorous. In Bill's Kitchen you'll find recipes for pulled brisket and rabbit with cider and mustard alongside roast aubergine ratatouille with spiced chickpeas and lentil, leek and parmesan bake. \n",
      "And throughout the book you'll find a commitment to local sourcing and attention to provenance - indeed there's a chapter devoted to this subject. Whenever we recruit a new manager at the cafes I take them to visit the Tudge family's pig farm where we source all our bacon, sausages and ham. Our goat's cheese and apple juice come from local producers in Cambridge and Herefordshire. We only use free range chicken and it all comes from beautiful Springfield farm near Leominster. These connections inform my cooking and this cookbook.\n",
      "But I don't want any of this beautiful, carefully sourced food to go to waste. So there's a chapter on leftovers and another on 'family weekday suppers'. Both chapters focus on delicious strategies for using what happens to be in your fridge.\n",
      "The decision to crowdfund the publication of the book has been incredibly liberating. It's meant that I have complete control over what the book is like rather than having to negotiate with a publisher. So it will be a top quality hardback with coloured cloth place-markers and with each copy shrink-wrapped to make sure that they reach you in tip-top condition. \n",
      "Financing the project this way means that I've been able to build my own team. Michael Phillips has created an elegant, appealing and practical design. Jay Watson has taken tinglingly good photos that bring every recipe to life. And Marianne Ryan, the editor, has made sure that the text and recipes are all clear and consistent and that the index makes it a great book to use.\n",
      "The recipes are all clearly laid out. Each one is beautifully illustrated and and introduced in an entertaining and informative way. It will be a book that will be a pleasure to use. Like my first two books I'm hoping that you will still be cooking from a food-splattered copy in 20 years time.\n",
      "Here's a Taster so you can get a feel for the style of the book  http://www.billscafes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/A-Life-of-Food-TASTER-low-resolution.pdf \n",
      "The money raised by this campaign will go to printing the book, paying the editor and some of the photography costs. The designer and myself will only be paid out of subsequent books sales after the book is published. If we can raise more than the target amount then that will be a clear sign that demand for the book is high and we'll increase the print run.\n",
      " \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The recipes are all written and the photos are all taken. There's still some work to do on design and editing but we've allowed sufficient time for that and everything is currently on track so that we can deliver finished copies in October 2017. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sending all the rewards out (books, brownies and aprons) as promptly as possible will be a challenge but I'll make sure that we're well organized and have all the correct packaging sorted.\n",
      "\n",

      "It's a way to turn your kitchen into an adventure zone!\n",
      "Cooking with Dice is like a traditional tabletop role playing game, but it comes with a delicious twist. You take on the role of a chef-adventurer, and cook your way out of trouble... in real life... in your own kitchen. \n",
      "Whether you're looking for a way to make your friendly game night more delicious, or a way to make your family dinnertime more fun... we've got you covered. \n",
      "Neither have we! That's why we created it!\n",
      "Cooking with Dice combines the best parts of an RPG with real-life cooking. You're presented with a set of character sheets, a scenario, a selection of formulas, roll tables, and a scoring system that allows you to level up  your characters. You can play solo, cooperatively, or competitively with friends and family. \n",
      "On the contrary - The Acid Test is all ABOUT appetizers. It's the first book in the Cooking with Dice series, and includes at least 140 pages of scrumptious content by Jennifer Howlett and delectable illustrations by Yuribelle. We're hoping you'll love it and will beg us to create more books. \n",
      "You could say that this book will be the ACID TEST for the whole Cooking with Dice concept. \n",
      "Hehe. \n",
      "Sorry. Puns are my weakness. \n",
      "We'd like to use the Cooking with Dice series to break some of the basic assumptions about cooking. In this case, the assumption is, \"Cooking requires heat.\" \n",
      "In The Acid Test, you're tasked with helping a pair of acid dragons to impress their friends and neighbors with a legendary cocktail party. But there's a catch: they want to feature appetizers cooked with acid, rather than fire. \n",
      "No need for an oven or stove - you'll be using acidic ingredients like vinegar and lemon juice to take the place of heat (though you might use the microwave here or there to speed things up a bit.)\n",
      "You'll be using acid to 'cook' a variety of foods, and will be learning a bit about food chemistry along the way!\n",
      "Your goal is to use your superlative cooking skills to blow the socks off of the dragons that hired you. It's going to take some effort, though. These dragons aren't easy to please.\n",
      " \n",
      " To help you on your quest, you're equipped with ten easy-to-follow formulas (click for photos):\n",
      "No No No... not ten recipes - ten FORMULAS! \n",
      "Each of the ten formulas comes with multiple roll charts to help you create your own unique recipes. You can use our roll charts to swap out key ingredients to make THOUSANDS of dishes from each formula. \n",
      "Each formula includes information about the time to complete the dish, the quantity created, the equipment required, the components needed, steps to completing the dish, tips for success, and rolling tables to substitute key ingredients.  \n",
      "Check out our Quickles formula (click to enlarge image):\n",
      " \n",
      "This is the simplest formula in the book - they get more complex as you go up in levels. \n",
      "Yes! And eating it too! There are lots of 'tabletop' games that incorporate food themes. This is not that. Cooking with Dice is a 'kitchen' game that incorporates RPG elements. \n",
      "Think of it as a Counter-top Role Playing Game. Or maybe a LERP - a Live Eating Role Playing game.\n",
      "That's not really part of this game, but if it helps you get into character, we fully support you. Please send videos. \n",
      "There are eight base characters in the book, each based classic RPG character types, combined with the traditional Brigade de Cuisine in a French kitchen. (click to enlarge image)\n",
      " \n",
      "From left to right:\n",
      "The Book includes a character sheet for each one of them. (click to enlarge image)\n",
      " \n",
      " Each character's description and special ability is shown on the character sheet, along with places to record your progress in the story. \n",
      "Each time you cook a recipe using one of the formulas, you earn points that help you move from the rank of Plongeur (dishwasher) to Chef de Cuisine (the head chef). The more adventurous you are with your recipes, the faster you climb the kitchen ladder. \n",
      " \n",
      "It's up to you to score your dishes and to determine whether they were a success. If you're playing the competitive version of the game, you can also vote on a favorite dish. \n",
      "After each dish, depending on how you do, you might be awarded with a chest of gold, or be chased to the edge of the world by an angry she-dragon. \n",
      "Each formula contains a new challenge, with more opportunities to level up your character. Eventually, when you reach the status of Chef de Cuisine, you'll feel the innate satisfaction of mastering a skill. \n",
      "More importantly, you can rub your success in the face of your friends and loved ones. \n",
      "Cooking with Dice is a perfect family-friendly activity. You can compete or work together to achieve your goals. \n",
      "If you've been looking for a way to get your kids excited about cooking, this could be your answer. With just a few game sessions, we absolutely guarantee* that anyone who plays Cooking with Dice will become highly skilled master chef with their own TV cooking show. \n",
      "*absolutely not a guarantee. \n",
      "The game mechanics and formulas have been created and tested, and the book has been written and illustrated, but we need some help to pay for layout and printing costs. We've also budgeted for marketing costs, including showing off the book at conventions. If the Kickstarter goes really well, we'd love to add extra content to the book, and print it in color instead of black and white. It would also be awesome to create some Cooking with Dice themed accessories!\n",
      "As Head Gnome-Master for Adventure Scents, Jennifer Howlett has put most of this project together, but she's gotten help from her husband and two gnome-younglings. They've gotten to do a LOT of play-tasting, which can be both a blessing and a curse. \n",
      "We've also gotten some help from our friends over at Battlebards, who offered to donate some of their fantastic audio tracks. Their tavern keeper voice-overs are hilarious!\n",
      "If you have a game- or cooking-related company and would like to support us with merchandise donations, please message us.  \n",

      "When creating Songs for a Sloth, both co-writer Richard Hollman and I had similar feelings - like we lost our way over the years - and we wanted to make a film that discussed this theme. I didn’t realize how cathartic the process was going to be though. While I was happy to get to express some of the emotions I had over the years through the protagonist, the act of creating the film itself proved to have the real power for me. I’ll never forget that feeling I had the morning after we wrapped. While previously focusing on how slowly it was taking me to take the next steps in my career, at this moment I only felt gratitude that the first step was finally taken. \n",
      "While we approached this topic overall with levity, I’m also hoping that the audience is moved enough by the story that they take inventory of some of their own dreams that may have been sitting dormant for years, and that watching the film inspires them to once again pursue the goals in life that make them happiest. It's never too late, even if we get there slowly.\n",

      "Joseph Fulton, a well-regarded fifty-eight year-old director of romantic comedies, wants to become assistant groundskeeper at a local cemetery. He wants to work outdoors and be close to nature. Meanwhile, he thinks it’s important to have his last will and testament drawn up. But his highly dramatic actress girlfriend thinks he must be dying and that he is just too brave to tell anyone. The rumor spreads and soon everyone he knows—and some he doesn’t—are crowded in to his small apartment to say their last farewells.\n",
      "During my Kickstarter campaign for the Henry Fool Trilogy in 2017 I suggested I would also include in that boxed-set edition a documentary film reflecting on my life and career. This was to be called, Where To Land.\n",
      "But I could not do it. I am not a gifted documentary filmmaker and I'm not crazy about writing my autobiography either.\n",
      "However, I am not bad at making up stories! So I started making up a story about a guy, kind of like me, and what he thinks about. Specifically—what he thinks he should do with the rest of his life.\n",
      "I'm sixty-years-old now and have been making films professionally for thirty of those years. I do sometimes wonder if I want to continue—even though I know it’s the only thing I can do halfway well. But might there not be other ways of engaging with the world and continuing to learn—even new ways of supporting myself? The unbelievable truth of it all is: one keeps changing. I'm asking myself the same questions I asked at twenty: What do I want to be? How do I want to achieve that? When—if ever—will I know I've arrived? Where will I land?\n",
      "As I thought about these things, the story became a series of portraits of the different people our hero, Joseph Fulton, knows and loves: his girlfriend, Muriel, who is a famous television actress eager for some deeper artistic commitment; his friend Eric who is an aging rocker concerned with putting his daughter through graduate school; his college age niece, Veronica; his ex-wife, Clara, who is still his best friend; his lawyer, Laura; his 100-year-old friend, the philosopher, Elizabeth; and others… \n",
      "I think it’s the best thing I’ve written. \n",
      "But don't take my word for it. My good friend and long time collaborator, Bill Sage, who will play Joe Fulton says: “Wow! I’m absolutely blown away by this script. It’s a brilliant symphony of hilarious and heartbreaking love and friendship.”\n",
      "I cannot improve upon that except to add that Robert Burke, who will play the cemetery’s chief groundskeeper, Leonard, texted: “exquisite,” and left it at that. \n",
      "Elina Lowensohn, who will play the remarkably well preserved 100-year-old philosopher, Elizabeth, wrote from Paris: “Oh Hal! I am so, so impressed. So moving, wise, always extremely funny, bright and witty. And what I love also is that it is filled with generosity and humbleness towards those who might read it and, later, watch it. It draws such an intimate picture of who, for instance, Hal might be right now—the workingman, the working artist. Perhaps a picture of us all…”\n",

      "Joseph Fulton, un réalisateur de comédies romantiques de cinquante-huit ans à la réputation bien établie, souhaite devenir l’assistant du gardien de son cimetière local. Il souhaite travailler à l’extérieur et être proche de la nature. Simultanément, il pense qu’il est important de faire rédiger son testament. Mais sa petite amie, une actrice pour le moins très expressive, se persuade qu’il est mourant mais aussi trop courageux pour en parler à quelqu’un. La rumeur se répand et rapidement, toutes les personnes que Joe connaît – ansi que d’autres qu’il ne connaît pas -, se rassemblent dans son appartement pour faire leurs adieux.\n",
      "En 2017, durant ma campagne Kickstarter pour la trilogie Henry Fool, j’ai émis l’idée d’éventuellement inclure dans le coffret un documentaire portant sur ma vie et ma carrière. Ce documentaire devait s’intituler Where To Land.\n",
      "Hélas, je n’ai pas pu le réaliser. Je ne suis pas doué pour réaliser des documentaires et écrire mon autobiographie n’est pas exactement ma tasse de thé non plus.\n",
      "Cependant, je ne suis pas trop mauvais quand il s’agit d’inventer des histoires. Alors j’ai commencé à écrire une histoire portant sur un type un peu comme moi et ses pensées. Plus spécifiquement, sur ce qu’il pense devoir faire du reste de sa vie.\n",
      "J’ai aujourd’hui soixante ans et j’ai passé la moitié de ma vie à réaliser des films. Il m’arrive de m’interroger et de me demander si je souhaite continuer - même si en réalité c’est la seule chose que je sais à peu près faire. Je me demande dans ces cas-là s’il n’y aurait pas d’autres manières d’envisager le monde et de continuer à apprendre - et, pourquoi pas, d’autres manières de gagner ma vie. L’incroyable vérité dans tout ça, c’est qu’on ne cesse de changer. Je me pose encore les mêmes questions que quand j’avais vingt ans : Qu’est-ce que je veux être ? Et quelle que soit la réponse à cette question, comment y parvenir ? À quel moment - si jamais cela arrive - saurai-je si j’y suis parvenu ? Quelle sera la destination ?\n",
      "Je réfléchissais à tout ça et l’histoire s’est transformée en une série de portraits des diverses personnes que notre héros - Joseph Fulton - connaît et apprécie : sa petite amie, Muriel, une célèbre actrice de télévision qui souhaite faire du grand art ; son ami Eric, un rocker vieillissant qui se demande de quelle manière il paiera pour les études de sa fille ; sa jeune nièce, Veronica ; son ex-femme, Clara, qui demeure sa meilleure amie ; son avocate, Laura, son amie centenaire, la philosophe Elizabeth, et bien d’autres...\n",
      "Je pense que c’est ce que j’ai écrit de mieux.\n",
      "Mais je ne vous demande pas de me croire sur parole. Bill Sage, ami de longue date avec qui j’ai souvent travaillé et qui incarnera Joe Fulton, m’a dit : « Mon dieu ! Ce scénario est génial. C’est une superbe symphonie d’amour, d’amitié, pleine d’humour et très touchante. »\n",
      "Difficile d’entendre plus plaisant que ce compliment mais ajoutons tout de même que Robert Burke, qui incarnera pour sa part le gardien du cimetière, m’a envoyé un court message suite à la lecture du scénario. Celui-ci disait sobrement : \"C’est exquis\".\n",
      "Elina Lowensohn, qui incarnera pour sa part Elisabeth, la philosophe centenaire incroyablement bien conservée, m’a écrit de Paris : « Oh, Hal ! Je suis très impressionnée. C’est si touchant, si intelligent, toujours extrêmement drôle, brillant et très spirituel. Et j’aime particulièrement le fait qu’il y a une grande générosité et beaucoup d’humilité envers ceux qui liront le script ou plus tard verront le film. Cela donne à voir un portrait très intime de ce que Hal pourrait être aujourd’hui : un homme, un artiste qui travaille. C’est peut-être notre portrait à tous... »\n",

Er möchte gerne im Freien arbeiten und der Natur nahe sein. Ausserdem denkt er, es wäre wichtig sein Testament zu machen. Aber seine hochdramatische Freundin, eine Schauspielerin, glaubt, dass er sterben muss und dass er einfach zu trotzig ist, um es irgendjemandem zu erzählen. Das Gerücht verbreitet sich und bald drängen sich alle die er kennt - und einige, die er nicht kennt - in seiner kleinen Wohnung, um sich von ihm zu verabschieden.\n",
      "Während meiner Kickstarter-Kampagne für die Henry-Fool-Trilogie im Jahr 2017 hatte ich vor einen Dokumentarfilm für diese Boxed-Set-Edition zu machen, eine Art Reflexion über mein Leben und meine Karriere. Der Name sollte sein: Where To Land.\n",
      "Aber ich konnte es nicht. Ich bin kein begabter Dokumentarfilmer und ich bin auch nicht sehr begeistert davon meine Autobiografie zu schreiben.\n",
      "Ich bin aber nicht schlecht darin, Geschichten zu erfinden! Also fing ich an, eine Geschichte über einen Typen zu schreiben, der mir ähnlich ist und darüber, was er denkt. Speziell - was er darüber denkt, was er mit dem Rest seines Lebens anfangen sollte.\n",
      "Ich bin jetzt 60 Jahre alt und mache seit 30 Jahren Filme. Ich frage mich manchmal, ob ich wirklich damit weitermachen möchte, auch wenn ich weiß, dass es das einzige ist, was ich halbwegs gut kann. Aber gäbe es nicht auch andere Möglichkeiten, sich mit der Welt auseinanderzusetzen und zu weiter zu lernen - eventuell sogar neue Wege, mich selbst zu versorgen? Die unglaubliche Wahrheit dazu ist: Man verändert sich ständig. Ich stelle mir die gleichen Fragen, die ich mir mit zwanzig gestellt habe: Was möchte ich sein? Wie will ich das erreichen? Wann - wenn überhaupt jemals - werde ich wissen, dass ich dort angekommen bin? Wo werde ich landen?\n",
      "Als ich über diese Dinge nachdachte, wurde die Geschichte zu einer Reihe von Porträts der verschiedenen Menschen, die unser Held Joseph Fulton kennt und liebt: Seine Freundin Muriel, eine berühmte Fernsehschauspielerin, begierig nach tieferem künstlerischen Engagement; sein Freund Eric, ein alternder Rocker, der besorgt ist, ob seine Tochter die Hochschule schaffen wird; seine Nichte im College-Alter, Veronica; seine Ex-Frau Clara, die immer noch seine beste Freundin ist; seine Anwältin Laura; seine 100-jährige Freundin, die Philosophin Elizabeth; und andere…\n",
      "Ich denke, es ist das Beste, was ich je geschrieben habe.\n",
      "Aber ihr müsst euch nicht auf mein Wort verlassen. Mein guter Freund und langjähriger Kollaborateur Bill Sage, der Joe Fulton spielen wird, sagt: „Wow! Ich bin absolut begeistert von diesem Drehbuch. Eine großartige Symphonie aus urkomischer und herzzerreißender Liebe und Freundschaft.\"\n",
      "Dem kann ich nichts hinzufügen, außer dass Robert Burke, der den Platzwart des Friedhofs, Leonard, spielen wird, mir eine SMS geschrieben hat: „Exquisit“. Dabei hat er es dann belassen.\n",
      "Elina Lowensohn, die die bemerkenswert gut erhaltene 100-jährige Philosophin Elizabeth spielen wird, schrieb aus Paris: „Oh Hal! Ich bin so beeindruckt. So bewegend, weise, immer extrem lustig, clever und geistreich. Und was ich auch liebe, ist die Großzügigkeit und Demut denen gegenüber, die es lesen und, später, anschauen werden. Es zeichnet ein so intimes Bild davon, wer, zum Beispiel Hal, gerade sein könnte - der Arbeiter, der arbeitende Künstler. Vielleicht ein Bild von uns allen ... \"\n",
      "Parker Posey (die einzig wahre Fay Grim), die Laura, Joes Anwalt, spielen wird, schrieb: \"Ich brauchte nur einen kurzen Blick und bin dabei! xo! \"\n",
      "Zu guter letzt Tatiana Abracos (das einzig wahre Girl From Monday), die die hysterisch und dramatische Muriel spielen wird: „Sie ist absolut liebenswert! Ich finde sie großartig. Das ist alles so echt in Bezug auf die Gefühle und Emotionen der Menschen. Ich finde, es ist einfach sehr gut gemacht, Padre!!

Quiere trabajar al aire libre y estar en contacto con la naturaleza. Entre tanto, cree que es importante preparar su última decisión y testamento. Pero su novia actriz, quien es muy dramática, piensa que se debe estar muriendo y que tiene demasiado orgullo como para contarle a alguien. El rumor se dispersa y pronto todos a quien él conoce—y algunos que no—se juntan en su pequeño departamento para despedirse.\n",
      "Durante mi campaña de Kickstarter para la Trilogía de Henry Fool en 2017 sugerí que iría a incluir en esa edición recopilatoria una película documental que reflexionara sobre mi vida y carrera. Se titularía Where To Land [Dónde aterrizar].\n",
      "Pero no lo pude hacer. No tengo talento para filmar documentales y la idea de escribir mi autobiografía tampoco me entusiasma.\n",
      "De todas maneras, ¡el inventar historias no me sale mal! Así que comencé a inventar una historia acerca de un tipo parecido a mí, y sobre las cosas que él piensa. Específicamente, lo que piensa que debiera hacer con el resto de su vida.\n",
      "Tengo sesenta años y he realizado películas profesionalmente durante treinta de esos años. A veces me pregunto si quiero continuar realizándolas—si bien sé que es la única cosa que puedo hacer más o menos bien. ¿Pero pudieran existir otras maneras de comunicarme con el mundo y de continuar aprendiendo cosas; incluso nuevas maneras de ganarme la vida? La increíble verdad de todo esto es: uno sigue cambiando. Me estoy preguntando lo mismo que cuando tenía veinte años: ¿Qué es lo que quiero ser? ¿Cómo puedo lograr eso? ¿Cuándo sabré si lo he logrado (si lo hago alguna vez)? ¿Dónde aterrizaré?\n",
      "Mientras pensaba acerca de estas cosas, la historia se convirtió en retratos de las distintas personas que nuestro héroe, Joseph Fulton, conoce y ama: su novia, Muriel, una famosa actriz de televisión que desea un compromiso artístico más profundo; su amigo Eric, un músico de rock entrado en años cuya preocupación es que su hija haga su posgrado; su sobrina Verónica, que va a la universidad; su ex-esposa Clara, quien es todavía su mejor amiga; su abogada, Laura; su amiga filósofa Elizabeth, quien tiene 100 años; entre otros…\n",
      "Creo que es lo mejor que he escrito.\n",
      "Pero no me tomes la palabra. Mi buen amigo y antiguo colaborador, Bill Sage, quien hace el papel de Joe Fulton, dice: “¡Vaya! Estoy completamente impresionado por este argumento. Es una brillante sinfonía de amor y amistad,  divertidísima y desgarradora.”\n",
      "No puedo añadir nada a eso, excepto que Robert Burke, quien hace de Leonard, el encargado principal del cementerio, me mandó un mensaje de texto diciendo “exquisito”, y ahí lo dejo.\n",
      "Elina Lowensohn, quien interpretará el papel de la bien conservada filósofa de 100 años, Elizabeth, escribió desde París: “¡Ay, Hal! Estoy tan admirada. Tan conmovedor, sabio, siempre extremadamente gracioso, positivo e ingenioso. Y lo que también me encanta es que está lleno de generosidad y humildad hacia aquellos que lo leen y que, más adelante, lo mirarán. Describe un retrato tan íntimo de quien, por ejemplo, Hal pudiera ser en estos momentos: el obrero, el artista trabajador. Tal vez sea un retrato de todos nosotros…”\n",

      "Bilbo Berg only ever needed three things in his life: his mother, his best friend, and, above all, his whole milk. He led a simple and happy life. Yet everything changed after the outbreak of the Moobola virus.\n",
      "A mass cow extinction began, causing the world’s temperature to increase severely, and dairy was wiped from the face of the earth almost instantly. When all he wanted was the support of his mother, she had vanished too, with no explanation. His world was completely lost. Until one day, when he discovered a hidden clue: there might be one cow left. With the help of his troublemaking, childhood best friend Alex, the two venture onto a road trip filled with trials, tribulations, and a rusty van. Through this journey, Bilbo must ask himself: what would he truly do for another glass of milk?\n",
      "We're filmmakers from all over the world with diverse backgrounds. Through the past few years, our team has been able to tell a range of stories from a multitude of different genres and characters. As we’ve continued to make films, we’ve developed a sense of comradery with each other and been able to tell bigger stories each time.\n",
      "As absurd as the title and plot are, it is an important story for me. I've been away from home, Vietnam, for the last 10 years of my life. Having this opportunity to live in different countries, as well as meet different people, has taught me many things. I've learned to adapt, to absorb cultures, languages, to treat people with respect, and to work hard. I spent 4 years of high school in Auckland, New Zealand, where I built my second family. I worked for half a year as a waiter in Vietnam post-graduation then backpacked around the country. I then lived in Boston for years studying business before I stumbled into this filmmaking journey, and it's been the best thing that's happened to me. I want to use this absurd story to tell a grounded human story, a journey of a person growing up.\n",
      "With Bilbo, we are venturing into a larger scale epic than ever before, yet we have the tools and the experience with each other to bring such an expansive story to live confidently. Furthermore, we are a group of passionate about telling a story with a social impact. While Bilbo is an absurdist adventure, it is also rooted in a discussion of how we impact the environment and animals around us.  We want to use this platform to engage in a conversation about being sustainable and responsible for how we live our lives. The story of Bilbo reflects the journey all of us must face: taking chances to make our dreams happen, except with a bit more milk. \n",
      "We're partnering with the absolutely wonderful folks at Cherry Hollow Farm. They embrace our slogan of 'Save The Cows'. They've been saving cows from being slaughtered and bring them back to their beautiful farm. We couldn't have asked for a better partner.\n",
      "Currently, we are in the midst of preproduction as we gear up to begin filming in January 2020. Our Bilbo and Alex have been chosen, and our cow has been found, but there are many tasks ahead of us, including casting our supporting cast, finalizing our many locations for Bilbo’s journey, and fleshing out the world through production design, props, and costumes.\n",

Finding these locations, as well as transforming them into what we fully envisioned, will take extensive research and time from our team. Furthermore, we will be taking on another challenge, working with our very first cow. From a story standpoint, when creating both Alex and Bilbo, we wanted to make characters that were odd but felt authentic and relatable to audiences. Bilbo, while essentially quirky, is not someone we strictly laugh at but laugh with.\n",

      "So I would just like to take a moment to say that I'm absolutely blown away and humbled by the fact that we've surpassed our goal in merely 4 days!  I couldn't even begin to adequately thank all of those who have supported this project, it means the world to me and I am forever grateful!  Being that we still have a fairly decent amount of time left on this campaign I've set up some Stretch Goals, further goals that can help us to cause an even bigger splash with this tour!  I hope you guys enjoy them and if you have any suggestions as to other goals or ideas I would love to hear them so write me a comment!\n",
      "$5,000 or more: we'll be able to hire a social media guru to help us really make this tour pop online! More exposure, more marketing, more people that we get to share our music and the music of all of these wonderfully talented artists with!\n",
      "$6,500 or more: I'll write a New EP on the road and be able to record it when I get home In April!\n",
      "And the ultimate reach goal (my personal favorite):\n",
      "$10,000 or more: If we reach this goal we will be able to donate a percentage of the overall amount pledged to the arts program of a local school in each city we visit!!! It's a way to spread the love of music and art beyond simply sharing the craft itself. What better way to inspire young people to pursue a life of art and expression??\n",
      "I genuinely thank all of you for being such a major part of this, there's no way I could have done any of it without you! We still have time left, that's time to keep sharing and spreading the word, time to really make an impact beyond just playing shows and making people want to dance. Time to inspire others at their very foundation!\n",
      "Love & Light, Chris Hayzel\n",
      "Hello to all and welcome to my Kickstarter page!  my name is Christopher Hayzel and I'm a loop based one-man-band from Los Angeles.  What exactly does that mean?  Well here, let me show you :).\n",
      "Having grown up in a very creatively inspired family I was immersed in the arts from a very young age.  Whether it was sitting in the vocal booth with my father Howard Hewett (shalamar) or on set with my mother Nia Peeples (fame/pretty little liars), I was constantly surrounded by abundantly creative energy and naturally, as a child does, soaked it all up like a sponge to water.  However, it was only when I picked up a guitar at the age of 5 that I began to discover my own personal language of expression and from there the wheels never ceased to move.\n",
      "As I dove head first into this new world of sonic landscapes I developed an immense desire for expansion, taking in a variety of influences from Dave Matthews Band to Stevie Wonder to Radiohead and far far beyond.  It was fascinating to hear and observe the ways that others expressed themselves, especially if they were different from my own.  As time went on my curiosity drew me to pick up whatever instruments I could get my hands on.  Drum Kit, Bass, Didjeridoo, Percussion, Keyboards and more began to work their way into my repertoire and through that I started to fill various roles in countless different projects.  Each new project brought new musical perspectives and experiences and allowed me to share art with many different parts of the world.\n",
      "A little over a year ago, however, after the disbandment of my last band Ellis., I sat down and began to really think, what if there was a way that I could take all of these beautiful experiences and all of the knowledge that I've acquired over the last 20 years and wrap them up in a nice little package complete with a bow?  And if there was, what would that look like?  The answer: Looping. \n",
      "Imagine one person sitting on a stage, surrounded by various instruments, and picking them up one by one to build an entire song right before your eyes.  Beats, guitar, bass, background vocals, all introduced to the song at precisely the right moment, keeping you on your toes and wondering what new sound might come next.  This is the essence of looping.\n",
      "Having only recently been introduced to the concept of the \"one-man-band\" I made my way down to the local Guitar Center, picked up a Boss RC-300 Loop Station and took it home to experiment.  Little did I know that I was opening the door to an entirely new corner of creating music and the process changed for me completely.  \n",
      "It was the first time I had ever struck out on my own as an artist without a band and I was confronted by apprehension, but quickly it became clear to me just how special this was and within the first month of looping the serendipity began.  I was approached by a director to film the performance video you see above, picked up an endorsement from Gorilla Ears (a custom in ear monitor company), and was asked to open for The Black Eyed Peas at the Greek Theatre.\n",
      "As I looked around I suddenly began to realize that my music was making people happy, making them want to move and dance and feel alive.  And even beyond that, they were interested and bewildered at the way that I was delivering it to them.  It was taking that wonderment and aw that I feel every time I discover new music and sparking it within the listeners, and when it really comes down to it, that's the most rewarding thing that I as an artist could ever hope for.  Now It's time to take that spark and share it with as many people as I can.\n",
      "This is where you come in.\n",
      "All of 2014 was devoted to honing my understanding of the loop pedal, writing new material, playing every show I could, and crafting my debut solo E.P. \"End Reticence\" all in preparation to take the next step and present this experience to the world.  \n",
      "I've teamed up with my good friend Shilo Gold and we are hitting the road with our instruments in hand and our eyes and ears wide open, seeking to share the stage with local indie groups from around the country and aiming to make the world of “Independent Artists” a little bit smaller. The Indigo Soul Tour will feature up and coming local Indie Artists, each lending their voices to a celebration of their own home town music scene. Backed by a blog complete with professional photos, video, and journal entries about our experiences with these groups, we’ll be spreading the bold, loud, and declarative nature of independent music around the globe!  \n",

      "With the total amounting to an even $4,000.\n",
      "To show my undying gratitude to you I've offered up some fun rewards for your pledges including digital and physical copies of my new E.P. \"End Reticence\" and my last full length album with my band Ellis. \"I Am\" as well as post cards and phone calls from the road, credits in the tour video, prints of my original artwork and handwritten lyrics, and much much more!  Just browse the column to the right and check out all of the packages!  Being that some of the rewards require the tour to be completed before they can be fulfilled (such as the tour video) I'm expecting to be able to fulfill them no later than May of 2015!\n",
      "REMEMBER, WE ARE THE MEDIA:  In today's culture the strongest media presence comes from us sharing with each other.  After you pledge please take a moment to share this campaign with your friends and family!  The more the merrier, as they say!\n",
      "Words can not express the amount of gratitude I feel toward each and every one of you for taking the time to check this page out and contribute to this very special project.  It's not too often that life presents us the opportunities to do something great, something we really believe in, and this is one of them. By pledging you're helping me to create an experience that will allow me to share love with the world in the best way that I know how and for that I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Also, with fulfillment, there is a specific timeline when rewards will become available so planning the actual fulfillment of these rewards in a timely manner could prove to be a challenge as well.  However, lucky for me, these are all fun challenges that will only inspire me to rise to the occasion.\n",

      "A note about noise:  The power hub is a simple daisy chain circuit.  In many cases this type of arrangement is low noise.  But in some circumstances, one or more devices in the chain can cause noise due to differential ground voltage.  There are many solutions to ground hum noise.  One simple solution is to resort to battery power.  Fortunately, the Vixen can power itself and all connected devices using its onboard AA batteries or an external battery pack.  This will allow your recordings to be as quiet and noise-free as possible.\n",
      "This project has been structured to be as lean as possible.  In the interest of moving development along quickly, initial circuit prototypes were constructed with readily available components and improvised sources for circuit board substrates.\n",

Manufacturing of the Vixen is being divided between carefully selected outside vendors and the internal KVgear workshop.  All of the outside vendors are well known to the members of the KVgear development team.  KVgear has been steadily growing for 4 years and is dedicated to providing useful accessories for synths and synthesists.  All of these things combine together into a very low risk project.  \n",

      "As someone who has lived her life at the intersection of the monstrous and the sacred, I write fiction, creative nonfiction, nonfiction, and poetry to express this. Darkness and monsters have been my friends for a very long time, but so has God in all of the different ways I have understood God. My favorite monstrous creature is the vampire and this is where it all started for me, mostly thanks to P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast for their House of Night series. The best description I can come up with for my work is perhaps psychological horror, along the lines of Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, although I do not claim to be as great of a writer as Jackson. I am not \"that kind of Christian writer\" as in my work is not your typical Christian fiction which I abhor with a burning hot passion, and it contains four letter words that upset sweet church ladies. \n",
      "As for interesting things about me personally that you might like to know as you consider my creative work is that I enjoy flaunting my gay lifestyle by reading, writing, and making prayer beads. I have a M.A. in English and Creative Writing from Southern New Hampshire University. I'm a disabled single mother to four amazing children, some of them with disabilities also. I live in Mississippi and am settled here, but my life started out in a beautiful tropical tourist city in Australia. I lived in my native country of Australia until I was 21. I was born into an abusive fundamentalist cult and managed to escape as an adult. If that's not very interesting, I'll tell you also that my patron saint is St. Mary Magdalene and she features quite a bit in my writing, I love the smell of books, and I'm an addict in recovery which I also write about especially as it relates to the monstrous. \n",
      "What I'm trying to create here is a website home for my work. I have a designer that I am working with, I need to pay for web hosting, and other apps and tools related to the creation of this website. This will showcase my work, as well as give updates on my works in progress and links to my published work. I also have a Facebook author page and a Twitter and Instagram for people to follow and I try to keep up with them fairly regularly. \n",

      "Theaters everywhere are struggling to get and keep people buying tickets and are constantly trying to bring in new subscribers to help them pay the costs of mounting a season's worth of shows. This project is designed to help theaters find new paying audience members by offering the hearing loss community access to theaters that they never had before.  \n",
      "I'm talking about Hearing Loops.  I'm talking about giving people who wear hearing aids (HA) or have cochlear implant sound processors (CI) the ability to walk into a theater and push a button on their hearing device to turn on its built- in telecoil to sit and listen AND hear a show, music and words, more clearly than they've ever been able to before.  IF they were able to hear it before. And it's completely anonymous.  No one has to stop at the theater manager's office and announce that they are hearing disabled to pick up a clunky receiver to wear around their neck coupled with a pair of headphones. \n",
      "A hearing loop sends a sound signal to a person wearing an HA or CI via that device's telecoil which is a small, wound piece of copper wire installed in the hearing device.  The sound is delivered via magnetic induction so the microphones on the HA or CI are bypassed and the end user hears sound that is much clearer and much more robust than what their microphones can deliver.  The actors on stage sound as if they are talking directly into the ears of the listener.  Music sounds full with depth and tone.  The microphones installed on HA's and CI's simply cannot produce sound this clear and this enjoyable.\n",
      "Hearing Loops give the hearing loss community access, much in the way wheelchair ramps give access to paraplegics.  So people who could not go to the theater because they could not hear the performance can go to a looped theater and enjoy performances there.  That's a new audience to market to and it's HUGE!  The Hearing Loss Association of America (The HLAA) estimates that approximately 36 million people in the U.S. alone are afflicted with some kind of hearing loss or hearing disability. That's a significant number of people who have been denied a theater experience.  Why not give them a chance to enjoy great theater while giving theaters an untapped audience to appeal to?   \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Hearing loops, though a relatively simple technology, can become difficult to install in large commercial settings such as theaters.  The design of the theater and its structure come into play,  A theater's sound system needs to be analyzed to determine if modifications have to be made. Interference of any kind (i.e. from electrical panels) needs to be identified and erradicated to enable the loop to work properly and to produce superior sound quality.  New microphones may need to be purchased and installed near and around the stage.  All of this needs to be done by experienced loop installation professionals.\n",
      "I have already succesfully coordinated the installation of a loop system into an approximately 300 seat theater in Albany, NY, called the Cap Rep.  Here is a link to a Fox News report that was done at the time of that installation : http://wnyt.tv/6h2g7.   \n",
      "Theaters need to find the funding to make such installations happen.  Costs for installations vary depending on the facilities being looped.  Estimates for looping range from a few thousand dollars to a few hundred thousand dollars depending on the venue.  I help the theater staff identify funding opportunities within their surrounding communities so such installations do not impede or interfere with their existing production budget.  And the amount of money I have requested will allow me to supplement the theater's loop funding as necessary (i.e. if a sufficient amount of money cannot be secured through grants or other subsidies) to ensure that projects that are started reach completion.\n",

      "Help! is a classic tale of good and evil set against the 1930's backdrop of a magicians workshop. It's an epic love story that follows a magician and his fiance as he shows her his workshop, all the illusions he's planned for his upcoming production, and introduces her to his fun quirky team of craftsmen.\n",
      "When an older and wiser conjurer of tricks comes to town, he begins to woo the fiance with his skills. But beware! He's more than he appears to be! When the conjurer kidnaps the fiance, the magician must devise his greatest illusion yet to get her back and he'll do so even if it costs him his own life. A battle of wits takes place between the magician and the conjurer as the workshop is transformed through time into a glitzy futuristic battle of good and evil.\n",
      "The stage is the platform where we engage communities and see lives transformed through evangelism and sharing the Gospel message.\n",
      "When Help! rolls into your city, it's like the circus coming to town. The only difference is, a circus is expensive and costs you the audience mega bucks! Help! the Musical is free to your community. \n",
      "Communities all over the world have called on Help! and their team of volunteers to provide tangible service when a need arises.  If we're 30 cast members strong - and we roll into your community and work a 4 hour day, that's 120 hours of free labor to your community, organization, or non-profit.  We generally stay in a town 2-3 weeks, so the opportunity to build in your community is huge!\n",
      "Someone once said,\n",
      "\"hurt people - hurt people, but healed people - heal people.\"\n",
      "Everywhere we go, we find lonely, hurting people who have lost hope. Our team comes along side these people and encourages them. We do this through friendship, and if the situation allows, we like praying for people too.  We find that if we just spend time encouraging people through conversation and prayer...they generally find something to be hopeful for, something to believe in. Why? Because someone took the time to listen.\n",
      "No staff or cast members are paid. From our technical team to dancers, actors and directors everyone pays to join our tour and be a part of changing the world! So we're a pretty motivated group of people who get our thrills out of traveling the world - pulling off some epic volunteer work and doing what we love most, performing.\n",
      "Help! is always looking for talented musicians, dancers, aerial acrobats, and theatrical designers to maintain our team as we take our production into neighborhoods all around the world.  Don't just make a pledge, join the tour!\n",
      "While in town we invite the community to come be a part of our setup. During the day you can watch the show come together, and in the evening join us for a time of s'mores, singing and story telling. From the Australian Outback to the Pacific Islands to the great Northwest, we love telling our story...but more importantly we love listening to yours!\n",
      "We desire our production to be as BIG as a Las Vegas show.  The difference is - our show is family friendly and includes some BIG illusions, special effects, dance routines and aerial acrobatics, and we're mobile - in your city - and it's FREE.\n",
      "How can we do all this for free?  We require the help of Kickstarter to purchase our initial stage pieces.  From lighting and sound to rigging, tents and vehicles, to increase the size of our current production to something epic.  Performing inside a tent makes it possible to perform year round.  \n",

Together with my co-creator Kayla (or Tulomne), Theurgy Book One has been an (almost) three-year long process in the making.

If you're new to Theurgy, you can read on below or check out the comic at theurgycomic.com!\n",
      " Gabriel Matthews and his friends decide to summon a demon. Or rather, to try to summon a demon. They've done the research (a questionable amount, really), gathered the supplies (the wrong ones, actually), and are ready to give it a go (some of them, anyway). What could go wrong? They get started and... nothing happens. Not that they expected much to happen, really - demons aren't real, after all. They go about their night and when Gabe's friends eventually leave, he discovers that the summoning actually worked -- it's just that Desideratus is pretty bad at his job and decided to show up several hours late. Gabe doesn't know how to handle this.\n",

      "A little over a year ago, co-producers/writers & actors Haley Bishop and Gemma Yates-Round planted the seed of this film around their kitchen table. It happened fairly organically during their usual morning banter, but the true inspiration sprouted from a desire to create the roles they so deeply desired to play. It has since blossomed into a piece of work they are immensely proud to put their names to.\n",
      "Over the last six months, Gemma & Haley assembled a powerhouse of talented filmmakers to pull off this ambitious short, culminating at the end of June with our major shoot where we captured the bulk of principal photography. \n",

We are yet to film a major scene that will be shot in the style of a 1960s commercial, which means kit fees, location and costume hire. We also have crucial post-production expenses to cover such as colour grade, music composition & the film festival circuit. \n",
      "This film needs to be told! It explores themes of gender role reversal in an era so limited for  women in the workplace, as well as presenting us with female empowerment in a hilariously original way. We are so proud of what we have achieved thus far and what is yet to come for this special short film.  \n",
      "And.... what is yet to come you might ask? Well....we want the spunky ladies of 1-800-D-DIRECT to hit the festival circuit and spread the D love. And that is exactly what we plan to do. A strong festival and marketing plan is being pieced together to give this film the exposure it not only deserves, but needs! We have high hopes for this bright, clever & sassy female driven comedy, so we will be putting a strong emphasis on festivals looking for these qualities. \n",

I'm apart of the bi-cultural paradox, searching for my roots and myself through the only thing that seems to remain true and honest...food.\n",

      "To do this book justice, we really felt like we needed to visit the motherland, Puerto Rico. There has to be more out there than the regular seven recipes on rotation in my grandmother's kitchen. Recently, through some research, I found a festival in Loiza dedicated to the Buren; a flat-top metal cooking surface heated by wood that was one of the original cooking methods of the Taino. It is essential that I go to Puerto Rico, see this method, learn this method and do my duty to preserve this method.\n",

      "Goal raised - and surpassed! We beat Volume 1's record ($3211), so every backer who ordered the book gets an extra mini-print.\n",
      " Leif & Thorn is an original fantasy webcomic, starring an LGBTQ ensemble cast and featuring storylines about time travelers, restless spirits, magical girls, cross-cultural misunderstandings, and unicorn frappes.\n",
      "Read Leif & Thorn online to get more updates, follow the latest strips, and stay on top of news about future books.\n",
      "Volume 1 was printed with Kickstarter last year -- now it's time to do Volume 2.\n",
      "(For those of you with simple needs: this is the one where they kiss.)\n",
      "Leif was exported (almost literally) from his native Sønheim, to weed the gardens at the country's Embassy in Ceannis. Thorn is a Ceannic knight (with PTSD and a magic sword) on duty at the gates.\n",
      "It's a hotbed of culture clashes, but they seem to be hitting it off.\n",
      "Only in a friendly way, of course. Thorn is happy to pay the Embassy's exorbitant rates to \"rent\" Leif for an afternoon out, but all for platonic reasons. That's also why Leif is so patient as Thorn fumbles with his language, willing to eat risky foreign food, and ready to fight anyone who insults Thorn's dragon-burn scars. Friendship!\n",
      ". . . no, seriously, they're both sitting on Feelings. But Leif has legal reasons for holding back -- and it's about time for Thorn to finally catch on.\n",
      "Also: high tide under two moons, support for the recently reincarnated, vampires complaining about history memes, magic duels over musical tickets, lost-in-time travelers, and karaoke.\n",
      "For teens and up. (Don't give this one to small children -- it includes mature topics like childhood abuse, PTSD flashbacks, international espionage, and health insurance.) \n",
      "Leif & Thorn Volume 2 picks up right where Volume 1 left off. It covers about a year's worth of daily strips -- including storylines from 2017 and 2018 -- plus a gallery of Alternate Universe adventures.\n",
      "Like the first book, it'll be 8.25\" by 10.5\", 180 pages of full-color strips, with wraparound covers and cool bonus features. They will look gorgeous next to each other on your shelf.\n",
      "Here's a taste of the layout:\n",
      "And here are some of the storylines inside!\n",
      "(In the dialogue, different fonts represent different languages. Most characters usually speak in their native language, but Thorn, in particular, spends a lot of time speaking in Leif's.)\n",
      "THE CALLING - A military installation gets put on the spot by a bunch of children, and has to pull off a holiday miracle.\n",
      "TIME & TIDES - Trying to figure out if you have no chill as a result of childhood trauma, or if some people really are Just That Annoying.\n",
      "SWEET SUMMER CHILDREN - The one where Thorn finds out Leif has a control microchip in his neck, and tries to tell himself it's just a \"harmless cultural difference.\"\n",
      "THE PERENNIALS - Orientation for \"long-runners\" -- people who, as kids, recover the adult memories of a past incarnation.\n",
      "SUMMER SUNSHINE - The one with carnival food, amateur pop songs, secret agents, lost time travelers, and some really awkward hallucinations.\n",
      "SUMMER SUNSHINE is also the one with the big confession, the attempted first kiss, and multilingual misunderstandings finally getting dragged out in the open.\n",
      "ONLY 900'S KIDS WILL GET THIS - Vampire problems: inaccurate history memes, human laws trying to limit who you can eat, and the struggle to find a good accountant.\n",
      " ALTERNATE UNIVERSES - Versions of the comic that take place in different settings and genres. Like the space opera, the urban fantasy, or one where they're all teenage superheroes, defeating monsters with the power of friendship.\n",

      "For instance, words like these:\n",
      " \"I have an insatiable need for content and there’s no other comic out  there that delivers on such an engaging and well-built story and world  AND updates every day. It’s the perfect comic!\" ~Strontium\n",
      "\"*slaps Leif & Thorn* This bad boy can fit so many LGBT+ characters  in it that audience members might discover actual words for themselves  in the ensuing discussions on the pages\" ~Shard\n",
      "\"You do amazing work and I am always impressed by the amount of detail  that goes into the worldbuilding and character depth. Thank you so much  for what you do.\" ~Kiwi\n",
      "\"I just found your comic and caught up after binge reading the archive in  a few days. What an awesome story! I really like how everyone comes  across as a person and isn’t just a cliche representation of a  marginalized group. [...] Now I get to wait in suspense like the rest of you. :p\" ~Willow\n",
      "\"This is so cute!! I’m slowly making my way through the archive and holy shit… everyone’s cute and I can’t handle it.\" ~Nicole\n",
      "\"I’ve always been interested in your webcomic but just never had time to  sit down and read through it. But a couple days ago I finally got too  curious, sat down to start, and blew through the archives in less than a  day. XD I just love…everyone. Especially Bramble.\" ~Solar\n",
      "\"One of the first comics I remember reading that made me feel truly seen.\" - @Super_fluence\n",
      "This is the section where I tell you about that LGBT+ representation!\n",
      "Thing is, I have strong opinions about visible rep. It's very easy to go \"here is a list of the characters' genders and sexualities\" on your cast page. It's much more important to make those things obvious in the story.\n",
      "So I'm just gonna show you the strips.\n",
      "Here's the main slow-burn mutual-pining same-sex couple!\n",
      "  Also has adorable happily-married same-sex couples!\n",
      " Casually-accepted young trans people!\n",
      " Casually-manhandled-by-a-sexy-vampire adult trans people!\n",
      " Both casual and cranky/pedantic adult nonbinary people!\n",
      " Inclusion as a regular feature of backgrounds and crowd scenes!\n",
      " By this point you can see other kinds of diversity in the cast, too. The main relationship is cross-cultural and interracial, which gives our heroes a lot of complications to work through -- the language barrier is just the start.\n",
      "Granted, it's a fantasy planet unrelated to Earth, so there's no exact 1:1 representation of real-world races and ethnicities...but you'd still need actors from around the world to play the cast in the big live-action Netflix adaptation.\n",
      "(Full disclosure: There are, currently, no plans for a big live-action Netflix adaptation. Hear that, Amazon Prime? You still have a chance!)\n",
      "The part you've all been waiting for!\n",
      "Exclusive bonus for people who back early:\n",
      "The first 15 backers who pledged at least $10 got to request a Leif & Thorn bonus sketch -- any characters, any scenario, canon or AU. They'll be used in the book to fill up extra spaces, at the bottom of pages or the end of chapters. \n",
      "Like this, only more so:\n",
      "If your pledge includes a paperback book, I'll slip the original lineart in the package with it. And you'll be thanked on the credits page as an early backer, no matter what tier you're in.\n",
      "The only limits on the sketches are (a) the content has to be safe-for-work, and (b) it can't spoil anything that happens in future storylines. (Hold on to those ideas for the Volume 3 campaign!)\n",
      "Open to everyone! Don't see the exact combination of swag you want? Scroll to the end for the add-ons menu.\n",
      "All tiers with paperback books include a Volume 2 campaign-exclusive mini-print, chosen by the results of this poll.\n",
      "If you missed the Volume 1 campaign, don't worry -- there are tiers to get both books together! (You did miss the print that was exclusive to that campaign, though. Sorry.)\n",
      "Want an extra book? Got a friend, family member, and/or local library who would appreciate a copy? Or maybe there's a whole combination of merch you want that just isn't covered by existing reward levels.\n",
      "Well, here's how to fix that.\n",
      "As we reached milestones on the way to the goal, we celebrated by revealing a never-before-seen full-cast portrait...one section at a time.\n",
      "The complete piece has 90+ characters, all at different scales corresponding to their popularity -- as determined by this massive reader poll. As of 60 backers, the whole thing has been unlocked!\n",
      "Some financial and technical details:\n",
      "Why Kickstarter? Because I can't pull a couple thousand dollars out-of-pocket to do a print run. (Even when I know readers would buy the book afterward.) A Kickstarter campaign lets me bring a bunch of people together for pre-orders, so I can fund the printing upfront.\n",
      "Plus, it's fun. And it worked beautifully for Volume 1.\n",
      "Where exactly is the money going? Here's a pie chart! \n",
      "The extra $10 is to buy myself a pizza once we're funded.\n",
      " What happens if we make more than the goal? Well, first of all, that means we have more backers than expected -- so some of the extra cash goes toward making all of their rewards.\n",
      "If we seriously overfund, I'll add stretch goals, unlocking extra merchandise and other goodies. Details are being kept secret until we pass the original goal.\n",
      " How long will it take me to get my book? Here's the planned timeline! \n",
      "This is the same as the Volume 1 timeline. It builds in plenty of time to handle unforeseen delays and mix-ups -- we had some of those on the first round, and because of this careful planning, we still ended up shipping right on schedule.\n",
      "If we're lucky, Volume 2 will come together even faster! Either way, I'll keep the backers up-to-date with every step.\n",
      "That's everything you need to know about Leif & Thorn Volume 2!\n",
      "Thank you so much for your interest and support. After the campaign deadline has passed, watch the comic's website for buying information, news about future volumes, and, as always, the latest strips.\n",
      "See you again in Volume 3!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I've already had one successful print run for this series, which let me get the hang of the process and iron out the kinks. If any new hurdles come up, I have some more Kickstarter-experienced artists on hand, who can offer advice and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main content for the book is completely drawn! All that's left is some of the bonus art and extra features, which I'll be creating for backers over the course of the campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The budget includes an emergency cushion for minor mistakes. As for the biggest expense, I plan to use the same well-established, reliable printer that did a great job with Volume 1.\n",

But is Will guilty of the despicable magical crime he's been accused of, or is he a single unwitting thread in a terribly tangled truth?\n",

This volume, the eighth in the series, can easily be enjoyed without having read the prior stories- but since it's always more fun to catch up, every physical copy will come with downloadable high-resolution copies of all eight volumes! That's nearly 900 pages of comic! There's also a Multi Book tier if you missed out on a previous volume or two, or even buy all eight at once with the Complete Collection tier!\n",
      " All of the Widdershins books are full-colour, A5 landscape softcovers packed with magical adventures and enjoyable yarns about bounty hunters, accidental thiefkings, food-based time travel, and much more. Hangman's Knot is approximately 100 pages in length, with a little room for extras, if we get past our funding goal! All of the artwork for the comic is completed, so as with previous projects, there should be very little delay in getting it to the printers.\n",
      "Multi Book Tier: We're going to try this one a little differently this year, in an attempt to simplify the reward tiers. If you've missed a few of the previous Widdershins books but don't require the complete collection, back the Multi Book tier, and use this helpful Multi Book Tier Calculator to work out exactly what your pledge should be, with shipping included. Adjust your pledge to the Grand Total which fits your shipping location, and when it comes time to ship the rewards, I'll send you a survey asking which particular books you want.\n",

If we're lucky enough to make any extra funds, it'll go toward keeping the webcomic running- website hosting, reprints of older books, extra merch, travel for conventions, keeping the artist in food and tea, etc. which lets me keep updating Widdershins twice a week every week! \n",

      "I founded my social enterprise Dyslexia Pathways CIC 12 years ago. This year we embarked on a new venture. This was our response to Corona and lock down.\n",
      "This year I passed and HND in Broadcasting. We founded two new accessible and inclusive podcasting and broadcasting social media pages called Unique Dyslexic Eye. My Steve Unique Dyslexic McCue blog has had over 270.000 views and our aim is to bring that success to our podcasting and broadcasting.\n",
      "Our overall goal is to support and nurture the mental health and well being of the dyslexic and neuro diverse communities. On our podcasts and broadcasts we play exclusively music and poetry written and performed by dyslexic and neuro diverse musicians. We also raise awareness of the positives of being dyslexic and neuro diverse and I give advice an guidance on how to succeed and overcome barriers to employment and education.\n",
      "When I founded Dyslexia Pathways CIC I wanted to offer a different vision. One that challenged the idea that dyslexia and neuro diversity is about disability and discrepancy. To do this we promote a social model of dyslexia which focuses on the idea that dyslexia and neuro diversity is about diversity and difference. We see our social model and social enterprise model as an innovative, inclusive and positive way forward. We do not see being dyslexic or neuro diverse as a problem. We believe it is society that disables us and this begins at school which are still dyslexia and neuro diverse unfriendly.\n",

I want to  build and develop this into a global community for dyslexic and neuro diverse communities. I want to try and tackle the isolation that many dyslexics and neuro diverse people face. This is already being done through social media where I have over 4,000 followers just on one social media site. The podcast and broadcasts will enable us to do this in a more accessible and effective manner.\n",

I plan to hold regular online meetings through Zoom or messenger etc with people who get involved with Unique Dyslexic Eye. Indeed I am already doing this. We already have the Unique Dyslexic Facebook but we need to make people more aware that its there. So far I have had zero budget for Unique Dyslexic Eye podcasts so it limits the footprint. Part of the funding raised will go towards building the footprint of Unique Dyslexic Eye I have put together a plan for an project for this that I plan to submit to the Lottery Fund etc. I plan to get more volunteers on board to help increasing this footprint. I already have had people volunteer with creating the logo and recently I have managed to find a person to help with re branding the Unique Dyslexic Get Creative web site to Unique Dyslexic Eye.\n",

      "The Echo Theatre has come a long way since its humble beginnings in 2012. We produce nine full-length plays (including musicals) every year, as well as Short Play Festival featuring the works of up-and-coming playwrights from all over America. Our goal is to provide the best independent theater in Utah County. We receive no government funding and are completely reliant upon our patrons and donors for support. \n",

      "\n",
      " “The moment I stepped into the Echo Theatre I was surprised, excited, and yet also unsure. While the Echo Theatre is unique for the fact that it is located on the upper level of a traditional brick building what really was surprising was the quite small space in which the production was held…. When I sat down I had two thoughts: 1) this production could be very poorly done since it’s such a small space, and 2) the charm of this small venue could allow for the audience to be pulled into this musical. I easily expected the first scenario to occur, but as the production progressed (really hitting its stride in act two) the cast and their performances grew on me. Their clear heartfelt delivery seemed to resonate with me as they sang the beautifully written songs about making hard choices, learning to grow, and facing their consequences.” — Peter Harrison, Utah Theatre Bloggers Association (UTBA), on the Echo Theatre Production of Into the Woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Echo Theatre Microbox’s Streetcar [Named Desire] was an intriguing and unusual sort of production. Despite the play’s colorful reputation and the nontraditional performance space, the Echo nailed it. After a bit of a slow start and some time to get used to the characters, I found myself feeling just the right amount of discomfort and rapture at the lives unfolding before me in that tiny space…. You won’t find many plays that get more personal or up close than this. Go see the show…!” — Paige Guthrie, Utah Theatre Bloggers Association (UTBA)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Echo’s production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, set in a post-apocalyptic world, breaks all the rules about what this Shakespeare comedy should be…. I have lost count of the number of times that I have seen A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Yet, the unique visual style and the dark setting revitalized the show. This isn’t a typical Midsummer, which make it an enjoyable evening for both newcomers to Shakespeare and veteran audience members [alike].” — Russell Warne, Utah Theatre Bloggers Association (UTBA)\n",

      "We hit our first stretch goal, so now all pre-ordered blu-rays will come with reversible cover art and all $50 and up backers will also get free 'Jessie' rolling papers with their orders!\n",
      "And now we have another stretch goal! If we can hit $27,420 ALL $50 AND UP PRE-ORDERS will include another blu-ray! That's right, the long out of print film 'Harvest Lake', starring Ellie Church, Tristan Risk, Jason Crowe, and Dan Nye will be back in print, and you'll be the first to get it FOR FREE! If we do not make this goal, we will not be able to replicate these region free, professionally replicated discs, and Harvest Lake will remain out of print, so PLEASE help spread the word, upgrade your pledge if you are able, and let's get Harvest Lake back in print!\n",
      "We hit our initial goal! Our initial goal was set as the bare minimum to cover the costs of disc replication, manufacturing all other perks, and shipping costs, minus Kickstarters fees. We would love to continue making films, but we need to reach much further for that to continue happening! Our first of hopefully many stretch goals has been announced, and the more orders we get, the more YOU get with your order, so please share the campaign far and wide to help us achieve our goals!\n",
      "Mostly Harmless Pictures is proud to announce the completion of Brian K. Williams' third film, 'JESSIE'S SUPER NORMAL REGULAR AVERAGE DAY'.  It stars Ellie Church, (High on the Hog, Frankenstein Created Bikers)  Allison Maier, (Space Babes from Outer Space, Spring Break Zombie Massacre) and Alyss Winkler (Plankface, Amazon Hot Box)\n",
      "This is NOT your super normal regular average stoner comedy! It is filled to the brim with science fiction, alternate universes, time travel, fight scenes, topless nuns wielding giant bladed soft pink chainsaws, a crazy tv preacher, explicit drug use, beautiful locations, an omnipotent snail, and all kinds of general weirdness. Imagine if Douglas Adams, writer of 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' wrote and directed 'Dude, Where's my Car?' It's that kind of weird. It also features a killer ska/punk soundtrack, a late 90's vibe, and was shot in beautiful 4k. It is by far my most beautiful, cinematic, and interesting film to date.\n",
      "This is NOT your super normal regular average Kickstarter campaign! I have been a part of multiple successful Kickstarter campaigns in the past, (Plank Face, Space Babes from Outer Space, Amazon Hot Box) and anyone who has been kind enough to have donated to any of them will tell you, we deliver quality products on time, every time. Making films is my biggest passion, and while it is difficult enough to make it in today's market, it is made even harder by fly by night 'filmmakers' ripping people off, and/or delivering late with over priced, sub par products, turning people away from crowdfunding all together. I  have a proven track record of success and delivering on all promises on time, and want you to feel safe and secure in your choice of backing this campaign.\n",
      "This is NOT a 'please give us money to help us make this movie' campaign! The movie is SHOT! The movie is EDITED! The movie is SCORED! The movie is DONE! It's ready to have it's booty smacked, and tossed out into the world kicking and screaming, and THAT'S where you come in. \n",
      "By pre-ordering, you will be helping to cover the costs of disc manufacturing, artwork, postage, shipping materials, promotional materials, deliverable costs, hard drives, and perhaps most importantly, allowing me to pay the bills and survive long enough to get a jump start on the NEXT movie. Making films in secret, and not announcing/promoting it until it is finished and ready to order has been the model I have followed for a few years now, and it truly is the support of people like you that keep this model going, and make it possible for me to continue doing what I do. Thank you so much for reading, please check out the trailer, please pre-order the film, and please tell your friends!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "While there is always risk in life, for example if a topless nun with a giant bladed soft pink chainsaw came in and stole my hard drive, then figured out where I have the back up drive located, went there, and stole that hard drive too, it would make things difficult. But the damn movie is finished, and there are back up plans in place, so the risk is pretty frickin low.\n",

      "Hi, we're Jonathan and Adrian.  We are the hosts of Wargaming Recon.  Wargaming Recon is the longest-running tabletop wargaming podcast in existence.  \n",
      "For over 14 years we've brought you informative, recreational, and educational podcast episodes covering all aspects of our hobby.  You've trusted Wargaming Recon to review everything from rules by Warlord Games to wet palettes, gaming mats by Cigar Box Battle to MDF buildings by Things from the Basement, and everything else in between. \n",
      "We've interviewed award winning filmmakers like Joseph Piddington about Miniature Wargaming The Movie and Steve Wollett about Word From a Gamer, best-selling authors like Henry Hyde, talented game designers like David Ensteness, Parsec finalist podcasters like Peter Bryant & Mike Kafes of the Mythwits, first-rate convention organizers like Steve & Angelia Parenteau of TotalCon, and internationally known minis painters like Tony Rieger & Dave Shuster of Iron Hammer Studio. \n",
      "The team also worked to normalize mental health and its importance among all people.  The show regularly features guests discussing how tabletop wargaming helps them in their struggle with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.  In 2019, I (Jonathan) frankly spoke of my battle against anxiety and depression.  That episode resonated with listeners to become one of the most downloaded and talked about in Wargaming Recon's history.  For 2020, we will have a licensed therapist and author with a doctorate from Oxford coming on the show to address these very issues.\n",
      "In the past, the show has been a top fundraising team with the Extra Life charity.  Extra Life raises money to pay for the medical help kids need when their families cannot afford to pay.  No child should go without essential medical care.  Wargaming Recon has hosted 24 hour game-a-thons, live stream, and social media blasts to promote this charity and raise funds for kids in need.  We're committed to the variety of ways we can give back to the communities around us.\n",
      "Now, Wargaming Recon needs your help.\n",
      "To complete a 2020 podcast season, we can't do it alone.  Wargaming Recon has grown into a multimedia organization featuring our popular podcast (sitting in the top 18-20% of podcasts globally), video content, and blog articles.  We have a variety of expenses from review products, convention fees, equipment purchases, hosting, and even staff.\n",
      "We've tried other funding methods. Even with those methods, we're still unable to cover our costs.  Many expenses come out of my (Jonathan's) pocket.  With two little girls at home, I can no longer afford to pay for these things on my own.\n",
      "Our goal of $1,200 will allow us to produce a shorter 2020 season.  Reaching the stretch goal makes a full season a reality.\n",
      "In 2020, we plan to have more guests discussing game design, rules design, art creation, and their Kickstarters.\n",
      "We will spend more time reviewing gaming products from rules to paints, from terrain to miniatures, and tools to board games.\n",
      "We will attend MORE gaming events to report on what actually happens in the gaming scene.\n",
      "We will diversify our collective voice by expanding our stable of co-hosts.\n",
      "We will expand our coverage through the addition of authors from across the globe to write for our website.\n",
      "We will have more video content, more social media interaction, and more time to bring YOU the content you love.\n",
      "None of this is cheap.  But, we do it because we care about this hobby that we all love.  We do it because we care about the tabletop wargaming community.  We do it because we want to give back.\n",

Our great-sounding, lithium battery-powered amplifier is perfect for people who enjoy the convenience of bluetooth music through their mobile devices, but want a better listening experience than what current bluetooth speakers can squeak out. \n",
      "http://www.ekkoamp.com/\n",
      "The Ekko was designed to play the best untethered Bluetooth music possible; in contrast most Bluetooth speakers today compromise for superficial high tech looks and portability, often at the expense of sound quality. We value the listening experience more so we created the Ekko to push the limits of Bluetooth music! With the Ekko, we give a powerful semi-audiophile system that provides unbeatable sound price-to-performance ratio. Even more expensive bluetooth speakers from top brands can't deliver the full spectrum of music that bookshelf speakers can when paired with the Ekko.\n",
      "The Ekko is perfect for music fans with discerning ears, whether you’re looking to hang out by the pool with your favorite playlist, or needing a convenient streaming music player worthy of your home entertainment system. The Ekko has a streamlined minimalist design that embodies simplicity because it's all about the sound; music lovers can finally have a sound-quality-first system with a sleek aesthetic. Its easy connectivity and long battery life combine to create a functional and versatile device for any set of speakers that can be played anywhere. \n",
      "Ekko works by bringing powered wireless capability to real speakers. This means you can connect Ekko to any type of speaker. With 5.25” bookshelf speakers, Ekko can easily last over 12 hours with the music cranked way up. With smaller speakers, playtime will last even longer! From top-rated bookshelf speakers to professional studio monitors, we guarantee you’ll hear the difference!\n",

      "- 3.5 mm line in jack for lossless audio\n",
      "- High capacity lithium batteries for long, continuous playtime\n",
      "- 2 USB ports to charge mobile devices for lots of backup power on the go\n",
      "- Digital Amplifier provides a loud and clear music experience every time!\n",
      "The Ekko is one of the most cost-effective ways to get the best Bluetooth music. We focused on delivering the best sound by bringing powered bluetooth capability to tried-and-tested speakers in the market. This allows music lovers to use their favorite speakers, or to research and buy the best speakers for their needs to get the best bang for their buck. \n",

Today, people have shifted to streaming music through their smartphones, often skipping home audio systems that remain tethered to wall outlets and unable to play well with mobile devices. Because of this, teens and young adults came of age with ear buds, laptop speakers, and Bluetooth speakers that fail to deliver the full spectrum of good music; many have forgotten or have never really experienced the pleasures of listening to real, good quality speakers.\n",
      "This is where Ekko comes in to help you enjoy great wireless music without overspending. If you already have a speaker setup, especially if it's stuck with an older audio system that doesn't get used much, we can make it better. Ekko is an ideal solution to stream Bluetooth music to your existing stereo speakers. Why not enjoy hifi music if you have a decent audio system just gathering dust at home.\n",
      "If you don’t have speakers of your own yet, we have included unbeatable packages, thanks to discounted bulk-purchase pricing through this kickstarter campaign. Featuring handpicked reference and bookshelf speakers from Klipsch and Polk Audio. These packages are perfect if you are just starting to explore beyond earbuds and portable Bluetooth speakers. These speakers are tested and guaranteed to work seamlessly with the Ekko to provide music clarity and quality sound every time. These speakers will also grow with you as you begin to explore the world of quality sound and music.\n",

We wanted to create a product that delivered bigger and better sound without holding listeners down to their living rooms. We wanted a product that enables Bluetooth connectivity and powers any speaker so everyone could benefit from better music. Ekko is the perfect wireless amplifier for music lovers. It doesn’t matter if you already have your favorite speakers you could take on the road, or if you are still looking for the perfect set of speakers to suit your taste and budget.

They play loud, quality Bluetooth music reliably, so there is minimal risk for developing Ekko for Kickstarter production. However, potential delays could still be encountered in scaling the prototype design to mass production because of differences in manufacturing methods. It could take a few iterations to resolve any potential issues in order to streamline the design and process for mass production, but we are committed to getting Ekko shipped into the market and we have the skills to do so. Our working prototype is proof of our skill and commitment to succeed. \n",

And most importantly, it doesn't degrade over time so no service is needed. \n",

The \"Sub Speaker\" output provides various low-pass filters, it is designed to connect to a bass cabinet, in order to provide a sub woofer to your guitar tone.

Of course, you can still connect the \"Sub Speaker\" output to another guitar cabinet, or another hifi speaker if you think 100 watts is not loud enough to disturb your neighbours... \n",

Since the clean guitar signal has more dynamics than the heavy distortion signal, it is extremely effective and more sensitive than most noise gate effect pedals.\n",

      " We're a married lesbian couple, we love making comics together, and we especially love telling stories about LGBT couples. Our comic Tripping Over You is about two young men who start a fumbling romantic relationship— and trip over each other's feet along the way.\n",
      "We post pages of TOY for free online at www.trippingoveryou.com, but sometimes we collect a bunch of chapters and put them in a graphic novel— and now we'd like to do that again! We're starting this campaign in order to self-publish Volume 5 of our comic and make it available in print. \n",
      " Here's a look at everything we've added to the campaign through stretch goals:\n",

      " Our goal of $8,000 will allow us to print 1000 copies of Volume 5, as well as to cover shipping costs for the minimum number of backers we would need to fund this campaign. It also helps us to do reprints of any of the previous four volumes if necessary for fulfillment of this project. Any potential funds we raise beyond that point will go toward unlocking bonus merchandise as stretch goals— or to adding freebies automatically to each tier that involves physical shipping. \n",

      "Due to the original Captain Strangebeard having an eye patch, a hook hand and a peg leg, Jenny now has a super-strong punch, a mighty kick, and super vision! But she also has both the loyalty of Strangebeard's surviving crew... and the hatred of the Pirate Masters who have now turned their attention to Jenny!\n",
      "Together with her not-entirely-trustworthy First Mate Sluggo Sealock and her loyal pupper Lemmy, Jenny must stay the course and face the five remaining Pirate Masters. \n",
      "Sluggo Sealock is the disgraced former First Mate of \"The Crashing Boar\", Jenny's inherited pirate ship. After the conclusion of \"The Ghost Pirate's Gift\", he is left injured and alone in the brig of the \"Boar\"... But Sealock is a crafty old pirate, and he has much information to trade for his freedom. But not his dignity!  \n",
      "Lemmy is a dog.\n",
      "Anyway, let's talk stretch goals.\n",
      "My primary goal is to get my beloved Strangebeards into print... but with every extra dollar I will be able to do more and more to make the campaign better. While the lion's share of my goal is to bring you a printed version of my beloved Strangebeard 2 (and return Volume 1 to the land of publish...ment), I still have a few tricks up my sleeve. But are there stretch goals?\n",
      "Yes, there are.\n",
      "14k: I will include an all-new Strangebeard print, a new sticker and a laminated Strangebeard fan club card with every physical order! Extra swag, guys. Awww yiss.\n",
      "15k: I will add foil stamping to the logo on the cover! The cover to Strangebeard: The Ghost Pirate's Gift had gold foil stamping and it looked terrific. I would love to do that again.... Gold for the first book, silver for the second.\n",
      "16k: This is the big one. I can now print 1000 copies of each book. Thanks so much, folks!\n",
      "This is my third crack at a Kickstarter, and I am 100% committed to its success. I want this book in your piratey hands (and hooks!). As it has always been with the webcomic itself, your assistance in spreading the word about this campaign via Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram or message in a bottle is much appreciated.\n",
      "Kelly on Instagram! On Twitter! On Facebook!\n",
      "I cannot tell you how excited I am to get these books made! I love writing and drawing the comic and I love the freedom of the web but my mitts are aching to flip through those pages. Let's do this again! Yo ho! \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The risks are mostly that I'll drag my butt and not get the books done quickly or sent out as quickly as possible. It happens! To circumvent this, I've nearly completed the book ahead of the launch of the campaign so that neither of us have to wait too long for me. The books will arrive before Christmas this year! Kapow!\n",

For those not in the know, these volumes will be the last volume for each series and are completing each series. If you've never participated in one of our Kickstarters before, here's your chance to get everything all at once! We don't plan on closing the door on these universes, so expect to see more from us, and more Kickstarters in the future for these new upcoming projects. :)\n",
      "Ménage à 3 & Co. is self-published under Pixie Trix Comix. All properties in the Pixie Trix universe are linked in some form or another to Gisèle Lagacé aka Giz (me!) or David Lumsdon aka Dave Zero1. I collaborate with many talented folks, whom you can read about in the \"about\" section of the Pixie Trix Comix website. My personal Kickstarter account for projects backed and whatnot is here.\n",

      "Ménage à 3 is a long-form online comic strip co-written by Gisèle Lagacé (me) and David Lumsdon, and drawn by me. It's a sexy, HBO-style romantic comedy set in Montreal. It follows the lives of Gary, a shy 30-year-old comic-book geek, and his way-sexier-than-he-is roommates—adventurous punk rock chick (and bisexual) Zii, and DiDi, a sweet, naïve woman with amazon-like strength. Once Zii becomes Gary’s “wing-girl,” all three of them are set to have wild adventures with a lot of sex appeal, a lot of laughs, and a little bit of heart.\n",
      "For our grand finale, we present a volume of endings... and those endings come through choices. \n",
      "\"How much am I willing to risk for my dream job? How much am I willing to sacrifice?\" \n",
      "\"Should I drift in a comfortable arrangement or risk what I have by admitting I want more?\" \n",
      "\"What do we do when sex doesn't work?\" \n",
      "\"Should I get out of this uncomfortable threesome with a guy I'm not into at all and a woman who's starting to look as crazy as she is hot?\" \n",
      "For most of us, the last of those decisions seems like the easiest. But most of us haven't lived Gary's life.\n",
      "Volume 10 of Ménage à 3 collects the 10th (and final) year of the webcomic. Strips included are #1351 (Sept. 28, 2017) to #1512 (Apr. 9, 2019). Each chapter break will feature a new illustration. The book, like all our previous books, will also include a 5-to-6 page print-exclusive bonus story (PDFs include the bonus stories too). This year, our bonus story will be part 3 of our reverse-gender take on Ma3. Did Geri (female Gary) find her man? Or woman? We'll also include the reverse-gender bonus story we funded during our volume 7 campaign: The Clams Before the Storm.  \n",
      "As some of you may know, we've had to restrain our art choices of late online due to advertisers not wanting us to show mild nudity. With that said, as we did with volume 8 & 9, we plan to fix that for this printed volume (and PDF). I'll go in and tweak a few pages where I feel we would've normally not hidden it.\n",
      "Here are sample comic strips (picked at random) from volume 10 of Ménage à 3. Note: Strips are printed 1st half on top of 2nd half in the books. \n",

Past volumes of these series are available as well as add-ons or included in some of the rewards.\n",
      "Unlikely friends Dillon and Ruby challenge each other a lot, but that helps them face other challenges, like Ruby's disinterested-seeming boyfriend and some men who seem interested in Dillon for all the wrong reasons. Though Ruby's sometimes not so much \"helping\" there as she is \"delightedly ogling.\" On his own, Dillon has to face his jealousy and career woes, while Ruby has to address her frosty family relations and whether her manga addiction can possibly be an asset in her business-minded life. Or they could just fail to face those problems forever, we suppose! Growth is optional.\n",

But sharks are circling: Eloise continues to play the long game in hopes of snatching away Sandra's boyfriend, while Eva manipulates the rest of Sandra's circle as revenge against her mentor. Before this is over, going with the flow will land Sandra on shores that seem inescapable. And what happens next will settle the question: is she model or mouse?\n",

Also involved are Heaven, Hell, and the angel of death-- not a crowd known for resolving differences over a game of Scrabble (the succubi object that there aren't enough X tiles to spell \"XXXRATED\"). Can Teddi and Chloe survive? Maybe so. But not without a price.\n",

Shipping is expensive, so pretty much half that amount will go to shipping & handling (and shipping supplies).\n",
      "We plan to send the 4 books to print by July so we can start shipping in September-October 2019 (once we've received everything from the printer). We're not a big business, so sometimes it can take us like a month or two to get all the packages out, and depending on your location, it can take from one week to two months to get to destination. If you check our previous Kickstarters, you'll see that we always end up delivering.\n",
      "We ship everywhere in the world. When you select a pledge, shipping cost will be added for the location you’re in. The shipping cost added is included in the goal amount, so it all adds up. Since we know some backers will be new to Pixie Trix Comix, all our books are available in this Kickstarter, either included in the reward you selected or as add-ons (read below on how to add stuff).\n",

      "Since we know many of you wait for our yearly Kickstarter to get some of the stuff found in our store, we're allowing you to get select items from our store via pledge increases. Since Kickstarter can't calculate the extra shipping cost these added items would incur, we've included the shipping cost to each item in the list below. What this means is that when you select a pledge, a shipping cost will be added, but that's only  for that pledge in question, and the items in that pledge. When you want more stuff than what's in your pledge, you have to remember that this doesn't work like a store where you can add items to your cart. You have to add up the cost of the extra items you want based off the list below, note it down, and at the end of the Kickstarter, we'll send you a survey for you to fill out. THAT'S where you'll tell us what this increased pledge amount was for (see the pledge increase as store credit). We plan on using Backerkit, so this should help make things easier if you did your math wrong or want to add more items after the fact.\n",

      "There aren't any occult mysteries behind the daily news on states and capital, are there? Economic and political issues can be engaging, upsetting, sometimes even boring. But mysterious? Yes, actually more than you think.\n",
      "In reality there is nothing more mystical than what we take for granted each day, in the routines and structures of so-called everyday life. Where do they come from? When did they arise? How are they kept alive? All of us help to sustain them. But do we know what we do? And why?\n",
      "To answer such questions you can study political and economic history. You can learn a lot about the monetary economy and the administration of states. That’s not unimportant. But also not the whole picture. There exist subterranean spaces and powers here that we seldom recognize and which never reach our everyday surfaces. This is what we will tease out and take a closer look at in this podcast series.\n",
      "Reality is not what it seems to be. We will talk about what this means for phenomena like state and capital. We’re not making anything up. We will find the actual mysteries behind money, state power, our insatiable desire and why almost everything turns into rubbish in the end.\n",
      "Support us in this endeavour of discovery! And experience, with us, that totally different ways of thinking about politics and economics than we’re used to.\n",

      "E: And we are behind the podcast series Myths & Mysteries. And now we sit here and plan the coming season, which will have the title State and Capital.\n",
      "P: Right. State and Capital at first hardly sounds neither mystical nor mysterious. But if you scratch the surface of such seemingly everyday concepts a little, you in fact quickly find incredibly mystical things.\n",
      "E: Isn’t it so, that despite that we have treated things like alchemy, reincarnation, astrology, this season actually could become the most heavily mysterious?\n",
      "P: Yes, what if you open the newspaper in the morning or check out the news on the web, and at the back of your mind knew that the history of capital is tied to alchemy, for example, or that money, especially today, is pure magic. Then I wonder if your very conception of reality won’t begin to wobble a bit. At least that it did for me when I had penetrated these mysteries.\n",
      "E: But for this season to become real, we as usual require your help.\n",

      "\"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today\" Malcolm X.\n",
      "Growing up I had a few issues with the way I was being taught at school, I never truly felt motivated to learn as much as I should have been and this is why after finishing my University studies and furthering my base knowledge of the education systems with-in Australia I have finally decided to figure out a way to help children with my local communities that are less advantaged.\n",
      "So I thought to myself, \"What did I, and a lot of other children struggle with?\" and it hit me! READING! It is such a basic building block of education and yet so many people struggle with it. Then I had to ask myself the next question, \"What would be the best way to motivate and encourage children to learn to read\" and this is when the idea for 'Reading with Heroes' was born. Most children have a favourite Hero, be it Superman, Spiderman, Batman or even Spongebob, so why not use these characters to encourage them to learn!\n",
      "So I got in touch with my districts local Libraries, schools, sporting stadiums and council halls and asked them if it would be possible to use their facilities to run 'Free' reading events weekly for children where a new hero will attend each week (me in a different costume) within the community to help increase the base literacy skill levels of the children attending. \n",
      "If all goes well I will be making a Youtube channel and website for this Program so that everyone involved in the creation can see and enjoy the progress we make.\n",
      "I believe that if you have the ability to help others then you should, that is why my vision is to increase the opportunity for children to learn to read in a supportive and encouraging environment. If you or someone you know struggled or still struggles and would have relished this opportunity when you were young please support my project. Without support I will still do my best to get this program up and running but I may have to skimp out a little on the quality of the costumes which might ruin the illusion for the children.\n",
      "The money you donate will go towards costumes, advertising, stationary, books, website production and possibly app production.\n",
      "\"with your help and my dedication we can truly make this something special\"\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "With all new programs the main challenge is getting people interested in attending, I feel that there will be a delay in this program being acknowledged but after a short period I feel with my ambition to help others and my attitude will allow it to become a valuable part of the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "another risk is that the program will gain to much attention and I will need to find other liked mind people to assist me with these events, but this will be easily overcome because I believe there are people out there that feel just as motivated to help others as I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my mind without a challenge the reward wouldn't be worth obtaining.\n",

This is our pinterest to give you a clear idea of what's in our heads. https://pin.it/h5agf35a2yn3yp We have already started collecting books for the library and have roughly 5-6 hundred books in our collection- some dating back to the mid 1800s.\n",

China’s favored dish, the dumpling (or jiaozi in Chinese), can be found on every street corner, in every restaurant, and in every kitchen in China, but they are all pretty much prepared the same way: a bit of meat, some garlic and ginger, and a bit of vegetables if you’re lucky.

      "Energy block is a perfect backup power supplier for you during outdoor activities to keep in touch, making all your electronic devices keep online when there’s no power supply outdoors. Charge cell phones, laptops, cameras, or drones and never stop step of the adventure.\n",
      "*Extreme durability tests all included in the above review.\n",
      "**Fireproof does not mean it can be thrown in the fire and still works. Once above certain temperature, it will be activated and force the system to shut down to prevent thermal overrun, then explosion. \n",
      " More review videos are coming...\n",
      "Energy Block is compatible with the vast majority of devices, gadgets, and portable appliances, including those powered by USB, or DC outlets. 300Wh is enough to power all kinds of beefy appliances, and the huge battery takes a very long time to run down.\n",
      "Besides that, with the help of a detachable modular design, Energy Block is convenient for you to use in various scenarios indoors and outdoors. Just lift the battery block and you can use it between home and office for example.\n",
      "The DC output allows a voltage range of 3~21V, which meets most of the portable appliances’ needs. Energy block is your sustain backup while an emergency of a power blackout or outdoor travel occurs.\n",
      " That's not enough? Energy Block is available in a version with an AC output mount with a wider range of interfaces and an additional international standard socket.\n",
      " With a more powerful version of the AC output mount, Energy Block can satisfy all your daily/outdoor needs. Equipped with an 80000mAh battery and 300W output (500W surge), it can help your appliances stay full of power for a whole day.\n",
      " What's more, the double Type-C ports on the DC output mount provide a total of 110W (65W& 45W) of output power, while the single type-C port on the AC output mount provides UP to 100W.\n",
      "This metal case enables waterproof and dust-resistant performance to reach the IP67 level. It resists immersion in water from 15cm to 1m for 30 minutes. For outdoor use, no worries about different situations.\n",
      " *The waterproof is only for freshwater, not for swimming pools and seawater.\n",
      "We believe that battery safety is the first thing to be considered. To make Energy Block more durable, we select and test. Finally, it comes with an aluminum casing designed to last for a lifetime while 100% of the hardware parts are industrial grade that can withstand up to 1000 pounds of force.\n",
      "Check out how Energy Block resists the hammer test:\n",
      "Lithium batteries can become more likely to be dangerous when charging as the life span decreases after 1-2 years of use, which is a leading cause of house fire nowadays. We treat this as the most serious matter and take measures to keep Energy Block surely safe for your family.\n",
      " Anzene always puts safety as the first priority and that's the basic principle of how we design Energy Block. There are 5-in-1 chip-controlled protections and will ensure you a safe charging experience when you use Energy Block.\n",
      "To make the battery more reliable and prevent it from firing, Anzene innovated hardware called, cell fire extinguisher (CFE). With this guarantee, make sure that your battery is 100% safe. \n",
      "*We offer an optional CFE installation service.\n",
      " In order to ensure the 100% absolute safety of the battery, we have done extensive tests on the explosion-proof tech. Compared to software protection approaches, hardware measures are more essential and reliable to protect battery security.\n",
      " For double insurance, an air valve at the bottom of Energy Block is designed to release air pressure internally if there was an accumulation of heat, or there would be a fire. The release of air pressure will prevent a big explosion if the fire was to happen.\n",
      "The portable power backup was redefined. Energy Block powers phones, drones, outdoor gears and much more, with only a 700ml cube weighing about 2kg. It’s the ultimate solution to the modern need for on-demand electricity wherever you go.\n",
      "Energy Block is compatible with the vast majority of devices, gadgets, and portable appliances, including those powered by USB, or AC/DC outlets. 300Wh is enough to power all kinds of beefy appliances, and the huge battery takes a very long time to run down.\n",
      "With the super-fast AC adapter charger coming along with Energy Block, it only takes you two hours to fully recharge Energy Block. And if you want to use a solar panel to recharge, it will take 5-9 hours depending on the sunlight!  \n",
      "Energy Block is a solution for energy storage, especially clean energy. You can generate 100% free green energy from cycling or portable solar panels. With solar panels, this metal cube can store solar power and power different devices and e-mobilities helping you live a green life. The old and aging batteries can be replaced by Energy Block to realize the renewal of your ebike instead of declaring it obsolete.\n",
      "What kind of bikes are Anzene Energy Block and Mobility Jig compatible with?\n",
      "Any personal micro-mobility vehicle with a 24V, 36V, or 48V motor hub that has an output power of no more than 350 watts for optimum power output.\n",
      "The retrofit simply replaces any existing battery and reconnects the battery's +/- cable to the Mobility Jig. \n",
      " *All the listed prices are in US Dollars ($). Please note that when you checkout, the total amount will be displayed in Singapore dollars (SGD, S $) and the platform will automatically convert to USD for payment.\n",
      "*Once the goal is unlocked, your color selection will also be collected in a post-campaign survey.\n",
      "The estimated shipping time is from July, and we will make sure the sequence of shipping will be followed by backer numbers. AC Set will be shipped a month later than DC Set due to different production schedules.\n",
      "Shipping costs will be calculated and paid before we send you the product. We estimate shipping costs to major areas, but your actual shipping costs may be lower. This is because, at the end of the campaign, we will know how many units we will send to each shipping zone, which will reduce costs.\n",
      "Also, if you would like to receive your rewards sooner, we offer additional worldwide air shipping options which will cost around US$130.\n",
      "After the campaign ends, you will receive an email to select your final order choices and pay the shipping costs. If you have chosen multiple add-ons, the final shipping costs might differ from the listed costs because of the excessive weight. The average additional shipping cost is approximately $9-13.\n",
      " Each order will ship to only one location. There will be no split orders even for the largest shipments including multiple sets. So if you pledge for friends you will need to pick one location that works for everyone.\n",
      "Due to the customs policy of different countries, we cannot guarantee if there is no tax for you. For EU countries, the tax and duties are included.\n",
      "Anzene was started in 2019 with just 4 of us. We have grown to 15 people, innovating a new paradigm of energy access, powering freedom to anyone in the world.\n",
      "ANZENE means “safe-secure-smart” in Japanese and was chosen as a reminder to maintain Japanese product quality standards with respect and love for nature behind our battery pack. \n",

      "This is our 7th Kickstarter campaign so we know enough to know that we face some risks and challenges. This same experience will be invaluable in overcoming any challenge we might face. Let's talk through some of the possible challenges.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Transitioning from prototype to full-scale manufacturing. Currently, we have fully functioning prototypes from the same factory that will make our full production run so we anticipate manufacturing to go smoothly. Furthermore, since there is no major tooling required, it mitigates many of the major unknowns. However, full-scale manufacturing is always different than making a small run of prototypes. We have a well-respected manufacturing partner, and they have been responsive to any feedback we've shared.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Global supply chains and logistics. This has been an ongoing issue facing many industries over the past year. During our most recent campaign, we experienced increased container shipping costs, slower shipping timelines, and continued risk of lockdowns in countries like China.  There is the risk of additional lock-downs in the countries we manufacture in.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. This is a project and we're using Kickstarter to create something new! That means that things such as design, features, accessories, and any/all aspects of the project are fluid and a work in progress! We've done our best to present our project transparently and honestly - and it's our full intention to deliver everything as shown on the campaign page and video. However, as creators, it's ultimately our job to bring the best version of the project to life - both for backers and for us. That means things can change throughout the campaign and after.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Lessons learned from past campaigns:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Keep it simple. This has probably been our #1 biggest lesson learned and one that really impacted our most recent campaign. As a creator, there is always a temptation to try to do everything - add more features, more accessories, more add-ons, more, more, more! This can make for an exciting campaign, but the fun quickly evaporates post-campaign. That's why we've made neon buffalo as minimalist as possible and kept the weight variations to three options. Simple.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Underpromise and overdeliver. We're optimists at heart - it's essential for us as creators to have a positive and hopeful attitude. However, we've learned the need to balance that mentality with realistic expectations. Especially when setting deadlines and communicating with backers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Communicate more than you think is necessary. We always strive to be transparent and keep our backers updated. However, in our most recent campaign backers seemed to want more communication. We'll communicate more frequently during this campaign.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We hope that sharing these risks and challenges gives you more confidence in us: to be honest, transparent, and ultimately bring this project to life in the best way possible. We are excited to get going!\n",

Throughout his life, he has moved about 18 times, around the east coast, and then finally to San Diego, where he resides currently. While they were living in Ashland, N.H, his mother’s abusive ex-boyfriend got them kicked them out of his house, making him, his mother and his younger brother, who was 10 at the time, homeless. They lived in and out of their car and eventually spent 7 months in a shelter. He was only 13. When asked how he stayed positive during this time in his life, he responded with “We had it pretty good. It could have been so much worse. Everyone has a right to complain, but it could have been worse”. He also talked about how music and singing really helped with everything.\n",
      "His love of music started when he was 2 when he got a bongo set, and then continued when he started singing at 3. Although he doesn’t have a musical family, music runs in his veins. He plays guitar, electric bass, drums, piano, sings, writes his own songs, and eventually wants to learn the saxophone. About a year ago, a friend of his told him about the Voices of our City choir, and he has been there ever since. Jehlad just wants to sing and produce music, taking any musical opportunity he can, including touring around the country. “Music pays the bills, and San Diego isn’t exactly inexpensive. The choir is such a good place to be, surrounding yourself with loving people.” The people there, according to him, are so supportive, and have been through so much, but will still love you with everything they have. “These people are lifetime friends, you know, we help each other”. Although he has a family in LA, the choir is like his family in San Diego.\n",
      "As you can tell, music is extremely important in Jehlad’s life. “Art and music is the last  true form of connection.” He then goes on to state that we use art to tell your story. We are all in the same place, but to tell your story is important, and music and art can help you with that. Art is for self-expression, and for those who want to excel. You got to show the world who you are,  and you have to use your power and keep going. Other than music, additional things that bring him joy are people (he loves people, and cares so much about other people. He has so much compassion and kindness in his soul), basketball, tennis, working out (get those endorphins), food, fashion, crocheting, and lasagna. He makes it very clear that you just have to stay positive, no matter what. As said before, things could be worse, so you just gotta remember that, and be thankful.\n",
      "When I asked him for advice for the “younger” generation, (he is only 10 years older than me), he gave an amazing answer  “The world changes so fast around you. Things can change in a heartbeat, so grow up using your heart. The world can be so dark, but stay positive about everything. Stay positive in the hardest times, and always keep a good mind.” This really resonated with me, just because we both have been through a lot, him definitely more than me, but it just goes to show as long as you keep an open mind and a good attitude things will get better.\n",
      "Now on to his future. He hopes to do well in music, but it’s not about the money, but that also wouldn’t hurt. He wants to work with as many people as possible and explore life. He went to college for both criminology and psychology, but now is getting his Masters in Business with a concentration in Digital entrepreneurship and macroeconomics, with a plan to graduate sometime in 2020. He knows he has made it when he can buy his mom a house. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The biggest risk would be putting my music out there. I have an incredible story to tell you all. The stories from past and my perspective on all the pain that I have been through from being the victim of domestic issues, from seeing and being the victim of violence, drug abuse, and homelessness. It will be all shared in my music, which will be translated through my soul.\n",
      "Budgeting will be my biggest challenge. I would have to cover costs for my band, my mixer, my producer, my PR manager, and even more people on my team, like my graphic design team, my marketing team, and my advertising. \n",
      "I would like to cover costs for time, for travel, and for special costs like studio equipment.\n",

      "We spent over a year filming a mockumentary series called Unpaid Spot, which follows a group of open mic comedians in rural Virginia.  All four episodes are available for free at UnpaidSpot.com, and we couldn't be more proud of how they turned out!\n",
      "We're really excited to do more, but we're totally broke. That's where you come in! \n",
      "We've started submitting to film festivals, and the main response we've been getting is that they love the writing, and the acting is great, but they production value is clearly low. Which is fair, considering all four episodes were shot on a budget of about $75. \n",
      "For the next season, we need money to buy props and costumes, and be able to pay our incredibly dedicated cast and crew. Most importantly, we want to pay a location to let us film there all day, instead of working around the bars location and shooting an hour or two every few weeks, like we did with season 1. \n",
      "With a real budget in place, we could finish season 2 in a fraction of the time it took us to make season 1, and have the whole thing look a thousand times better.\n",
      "We would also like to keep submitting to film festivals in hopes of generating some press, but most festivals have a $50-60 submission fee. The more funds we're able to raise, the more festivals we can enter, and the easier it will be to make contacts and pitch the series to networks.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We've already scripted and cast the next two seasons, so there is little risk that more episodes won't be released, but there could always be unforeseen challenges that prevent it from coming out as soon as we would like. \n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest difficultly we've run into is coordinating such a large cast; in the first season it was always a struggle finding a day when everyone was available to shoot. For season 2, we'll be scheduling and shooting far more efficiently, minimizing the number of shots that feature large groups of characters so that we can shoot most things without the full cast being present, and making the most out of it on the days that we do have everyone there.\n",

She has the unique experience of working in on a wide range of projects, from small backyard garden plots to multi-acre vegetable farms. She also works in her own garden every day after work.

The author of two books; Food Grown Right, In Your Backyard (Mountaineers Books, 2012) and High-Yield Vegetable Gardening (Storey Publishing, 2015); he believes that urban food production can help increase public awareness of environmental, health, and social issues. \n",

      "Annie and Auzeen have been dear friends since about 2007 when they lived together in Seattle and always knew their conversations and \"voices\" were destined for the air. Like most of the world, we've become podcast junkies, and feel it's the perfect medium for us to share our thoughts, spur productive conversations and hopefully spread some insightful information that can make a difference. We've finally recorded our first one, and it turned out amazing! We want to bring inspiration for gardening and making an impact locally and globally to the masses, and think we have a lot of valuable information to share to help people do that. We already bought some equipment, web hosting and other logistical elements to get us going, but want to get a copyright on the name before we stream it and buy some software so we can continually get better! Being the altruistic artists that we are with liberal arts degrees it's a little tough to get this side hustle going. So, won't you join us in spawning the revolution? We are doing this also to show that millennials aren't just these whiney entitled snowflakes that don't know how to grow a vegetable (we've grown plenty between the two of us). \n",

I'm calling it The Grandma Files, and I'll be producing much of it myself. Each episode will feature a narrative story between grandchild & grandma, alive or not, with potentially a short feature story tacked onto the end as well. I finally have the confidence, skill set and resources to make this show a reality, but I need your help too. Listen to the mini-episode above to hear more about the origin of this idea and my own grandma who inspired it. \n",

I am extremely gracious to be renting my equipment from Stony Brook University.\n",

I'm also passionate about this idea, and how it might translate to people. From selecting stories to editing and mixing, I'll be constantly considering my mission as it relates to you, the listener.

      "Short Stack is a series of small-format cookbooks about inspiring ingredients, authored by America’s top culinary talents. Each edition is a collectible, single-subject, 50-page booklet packed with recipes that offer ingenious new ways to cook our favorite ingredients. \n",
      "\n",
      "We know firsthand how hard it is to make a living creating recipes and writing about food, so we’ve organized Short Stack into a new publishing model that puts the author first. Our authors will be paid for each copy of their book that we ever print, guaranteeing that their hard work will pay off, again and again, as we sell more of their editions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re Kickstarting our first three editions—Eggs, Strawberries and Tomatoes—just in time for summer. \n",
      "\n",
      "In creating Short Stack we drew from our experience in the world of cookbooks and food magazines. \n",
      " Like the best cookbooks, Short Stack editions consist of original recipes created and rigorously tested by a single author with the home cook in mind. In addition to recipes, the books will contain original illustrations and countless sourcing and cooking tips. They are beautiful objects meant to be collected, gifted and, most importantly, cooked from. And, like the best food magazines, Short Stack editions are concise, affordable and built for function.\n",
      "Short Stack is also a contemporary offering of old-school craftsmanship: Each book will be printed locally on the highest-quality paper and card stock, and stitch-bound by hand using baker’s twine. Our production process is intimate and specialized, and we’re also inviting our readers to join in the fun at bookmaking gatherings that we’ll host for each edition. \n",
      "The artful assembly mirrors the series’ individualized, personal tone. We are building Short Stack as a platform for authors that we admire; each edition is a love letter from one cook to his or her favorite ingredient, with recipes that will have you reaching for your skillet before you’ve finished reading the title.\n",
      "For our first three volumes, we’re working with three excellent authors, each of whom is an industry veteran and a leader in the food-writing field. Between them they have worked on five cookbooks, five movies, two television shows and have bylines at Food & Wine, Bon Appétit, Gourmet, Martha Stewart Living, Wall Street Journal, Men’s Health and more. They are the best of the best, and we’re thrilled and honored to be working with them. (Read more about each author below.)\n",
      "Short Stack will be an ongoing publication; we plan to print new volumes on an increasingly frequent basis and eventually sell subscriptions. This Kickstarter project will benefit our first three volumes, enabling us to print our initial runs of 1,500 copies per edition (or more—it’s up to you!). We have more great authors waiting in the wings to tackle additional essential ingredients.  \n",
      "We realize that $50K is a mighty chunk of change. But it’s what we need to produce three editions without cutting corners. Our platform—paying authors for every book printer (forever), binding each book by hand, printing locally—is pricy, but we believe the final product will be worth it. That said, we have done lots of research to make sure that our costs are as low as possible, while still retaining our project’s high standards.\n",
      "Our goal also begs the question: Why launch three editions at once? Just as much as each edition is an individual work that captures its author’s voice and style, it is also meant to be collected. We felt it was important to establish the series as just that—a series. You can pre-order one volume or all three right now and have it delivered to you later this summer.\n",
      "Down the road, Short Stack editions will be on sale at select bookstores and gift shops, but we’ll initially be selling them via our website, shortstackeditions.com. \n",
      "We will begin printing our first three editions the moment we finish our Kickstarter campaign. The books will be printed by the end of July, bound by the end of August, and shipped in late August/ early September. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re underway with volumes 1-3. Our authors are busy developing and testing recipes; we’ve finished designs and made our initial mock-ups. All we need to do now is pull the trigger on printing our first full runs.   \n",
      "Eggs are the superheroes of our refrigerators, just as essential at breakfast as they are at dessert. The recipes in this collection offer creative takes on iconic egg dishes, as well as less familiar preparations that are poised to become favorites.  \n",
      "About the author: Ian was a food editor for Gourmet magazine for nearly a decade, and developed and tested innumerable recipes for the publication. His first cookbook, The Farm: Rustic Recipes for a Year of Incredible Food, was nominated for an IACP cookbook award, and Ian’s new PBS show, “The Farm,” brings education and teaching back to food TV by following locally sourced ingredients all the way to the dinner table. When he is not in a kitchen, Ian is hunting, fishing, and foraging his dinner. To learn about Ian, visit ianknauer.com.\n",
      "Few things are better-tasting (and easier to cook with) than a ripe tomato. These recipes get to the heart of this fruit’s popularity and its versatility, utilizing both peak-of-the-season summer fruit and high-quality canned tomatoes.\n",

      "About the author: Soa Davies began her culinary career working under David Walford at Splendido in Beaver Creek, Colorado, then moved to New York to take a position at Le Bernardin. There she became the Director of Operations, Culinary Producer and Head of Research and Development under Eric Ripert. She also managed the development and production of Ripert’s cookbook, On the Line, as well as the critically acclaimed television show, “Avec Eric,” and its companion cookbook. She currently runs Salt Hospitality, a culinary consultancy that counts HBO and The Standard hotel among its clients.\n",

She is a frequent contributor to national magazines such as Bon Appétit, Food & Wine, and More, where she is a contributing editor. Susan is the author of RECIPES: A Collection for the Modern Cook, and her latest book, What’s a Hostess to Do?, has just been released. Learn more about Susan at susanspungen.com.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Timing: The biggest challenge for this project will be keeping the production of our editions on schedule; we want to make sure that the editions reach our readers while the featured ingredients are still in season. This risk is mitigated by our past experience in the publishing world and keeping our first print run to a modest size. \n",
      "\n",
      "Assembly: Each Short Stack edition is stitch-bound by hand using a needle and baker’s twine. With thousands of books to bind, we’ll be enlisting the help of readers through a series of bookmaking gatherings, where the featured authors will serve some recipes from their editions and bookbinding guru Jordan McIntyre will teach attendees how to make a book. On top of that, we’ll be hiring a fleet of helping hands to ensure our books are stitched on time.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "cord 1 is a cable management object from artifactual, a product design studio based in Atlanta, Georgia. Precisely-machined from solid 6061-T6 aluminum, cord 1 provides a secure anchor point for the many wires, cables, and cords that power our modern lives.\n",
      "Designed to be a beautiful and functional addition to any desk, cord 1 features an inverted channel that ensures cables remain securely captured during use. Reusable micro-suction pads on its base enable it to attach to a wide range of surfaces, again and again.\n",
      "Design \n",
      "cord 1's geometry is simple; it was designed to be a functional object that seamlessly integrates into any setting. To properly retain cables, cord 1's channel had to be large enough to accommodate a wide variety of cables, but small enough that those cables' plugs could not pass through. After a number of iterations, cord 1's 4mm channel is compatible with all of the most popular cables that power our favorite devices, from Magsafe to Lightning to USB-C.\n",
      "Material\n",
      "cord 1 is machined from solid billets of 6061-T6 aluminum, an aerospace-grade alloy of aluminum that has excellent material properties. It is anodized to a beautiful grey finish, providing it with an aesthetic and protective coating. \n",
      "Attachment \n",
      "cord 1 is secured with 0.8mm-thick micro-suction pads, which feature millions of tiny cavities that function as suction cups, each forming partial vacuums when pressed against surfaces and producing a strong suction force.These micro-suction pads don't leave a sticky residue, and can be rinsed under water to restore their \"stickiness\". cord 1 has been tested on a variety of surfaces; sealed wood, metal, plastic, ceramic, glass.\n",
      "Manufacturing \n",
      "Our production partners are located in Shenzhen, China, the manufacturing center of the world, and we have been working closely with them over the past few months to prototype cord 1 and to ensure that it is optimized for full-scale production. \n",
      "Manufacturing is the main driver of cost for cord 1. In the CNC-machining production process, cost is directly tied to both the setup time and the cutting time required to machine each part out of metal. With larger production runs, the cost of the setup time can be distributed, bringing down the cost of each unit. Our funding goal reflects a production run of 100 units, bringing the unit cost down enough for cord 1 to be manufactured, shipped to artifactual HQ, packaged, and then delivered at a reasonable cost to our backers.\n",
      "Project Timeline\n",
      "About Us \n",
      "Hi, I'm John Kiernan-Lewis, a mechanical engineer with over six years of experience in product design and manufacturing. From camera tripods to child car seats, I have had the opportunity to guide products through all stages of development, from first sketch to mass-production. \n",
      "artifactual was founded in 2021 to foster the development of functional, thoughtfully-designed objects. We are so excited to launch our first product, cord 1, and to deliver it to desks, nightstands, and countertops all around the world!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The past few years have taught us that the global supply chain is fragile. We are confident in our manufacturer, and in the wide-spread availability of materials required to make cord 1. We look forward to tackling the unknown challenges that inevitably arise when making new things.\n",

      "In a world of disposability where everything has an end date, here at 43 North Leather we aim to change that. My name is Jason Trauzzi and this is 43 North Leather. Located on the 43rd parallel we aim to bring you quality hand made leather wallets made with the best possible materials and techniques available to ensure a long lasting and beautiful wallet. Everything we create is hand made, there are no machines involved! Each leather panel is cut by hand, stitched by hand and finished by hand, so you know you are getting the best possible product every time.\n",
      "Why wallets? Like most people I started off with a generic leather wallet that only lasted me a few months until is started to fall apart. The seams would fray and the stitching would fall apart. After going through multiple options I decided to go ahead a make my own.\n",
      "A wallet tells a story. As it patinas it develops character, gracefully aging, becoming more beautiful along the way, even though it may pick up a few scars here and there.\n",
      "At 43 North Leather we offer multiple styles to fit your specific needs, whether you carry only a few cards and some cash to full bifolds and passport wallets, we make something for everyone!\n",
      "Kelso\n",
      "The Kelso wallet is great for a night out or for someone who wants to minimize their everyday carry. Complete with 5 slots, the center slot is large enough for a few bills folded in half. Each slot can comfortably hold around 2 cards each with a total of 8-10 cards with some cash.\n",
      "Killbear\n",
      "The Killbear wallet is another perfect companion for those who want to minimize their carry even more. The perfect companion for a night out, Killbear offers 3 card slots holding 2-3 cards each comfortably and a stainless steel money clip for quick access.\n",
      "Muskoka\n",
      "The Muskoka is a minimalist bifold that is designed for those who seldom carry cash and prefer to carry cards. With a compact design it contains 6 card slots easily holding 2-3 cards with space for a folded bill or two, just in case.\n",
      "Algonquin\n",
      "The Algonquin is our traditional bifold wallet containing a spacious cash flap, 4 card slots capable of holding 2-3 cards each with an additional 2 hidden slots. If you are more of a traditionalist looking for something that not only looks amazing but will last for years to come then the Algonquin is perfect for you.\n",
      "Pearson\n",
      " The Pearson is a traveler's best friend. Comfortably holding multiple cards, cash and of course your passport safely and securely for those long trips and amazing adventures. When you are not travelling the Pearson can also double as a notebook cover, easily protecting your standard FieldNotes Notebook in style.\n",

      "Leather \n",
      "Sourced from Italy Badalassi Carlo Pueblo and Conceria Walpier Buttero are some of the finest leathers around prized for their smooth texture, colour and durability.  Our inaugural set of wallets comes in a combination of four colours:\n",
      "Thread\n",
      "After testing numerous thread options I chose a fellow Canadian Company Black Crown Garage thread.\n",
      "Polyamide 66 Threads are made up of macromolecules with repeating units liked together by much stronger amid bonds (Chemical Bonds), other threads are held together by polyester bonds.  This helps protect against: moisture, acid, sunlight, breaking, temperature and alkaline.\n",
      "Why stitch by hand wouldn't a machine be easier and faster?\n",
      "Yes a machine would be easier and faster but it is an inferior method of stitching.  Stitching by hand using the Saddle Stitching method creates a more secure and long lasting stitch when compared to machine stitching, although it does take longer.\n",
      "Production\n",
      "Everything is hand crafted by me so as soon as the funds are transferred I can immediately place an order with my supplier for the leather. Once the material is received I will begin crafting your one of a kind, hand made wallet. As soon as your wallet is done I will ship it directly to you using your preferred shipping option where a tracking number will be provided.\n",
      "Because each wallet is made by hand by a single craftsman it will take some time to complete all the orders, as a result I can not guarantee an exact time frame for delivery.  But rest assured you will receive your wallet and I will make myself available to answer any questions you might have\n",
      "Packaging\n",
      "All wallets will be sent to you in “Indestructible” cardboard boxes with craft paper filler. All of which is 100% recyclable. None of that wasteful packaging that just ends up sitting in a landfill for 100 years. Being named after Parks and Landmarks in Ontario Canada we here at 43 North Leather would like to keep our products as waste free as possible\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "In 2012 the Brushelle Beauty Stand was born of an idea that came from a need. Denise was working for a beauty company that hosted gatherings where techniques for applying makeup using cosmetic brushes were demonstrated and practiced by a number of people. After the meetings were over there were numerous brushes to be washed and dried. It soon became obvious that the typical process of washing and drying brushes could be improved upon, especially the drying and storing of brushes.\n",
      "The common method of drying brushes is to lay them on a towel on a countertop. Laying the brushes flat doesn't promote efficient drying since air can't circulate around the bristles, moisture can't drain from the ferrules, and shaped brushes become flattened. These factors all contribute to shortening the life of expensive brushes, take up space, and don't add to the aesthetics of your beauty space. \n",
      "The Brushelle Beauty Stand provides elegant solutions to all the issues surrounding drying your brushes. The design allows air to circulate around the bristles, uses gravity to promote drying the ferrules, makes economical use of your counter space, and looks great while doing it! Plus, when it comes time to use the brushes, the center support becomes a stylish cup that can be turned end for end to store either long or short handled brushes for use.\n",
      "The Brushelle Beauty Stand does all these useful, practical, and stylish things while being made of the most recyclable plastic there is, minimizing the impact on our environment. The product is super durable, not susceptible to breakage under normal use, requires no batteries, and can handle most brushes except for double ended ones. \n",
      "We're taking this unique opportunity to also donate 10% of our proceeds to the effort in Ukraine, maximizing our purpose and doing our part to give aid to people in need. \n",
      "Finally, a better way to dry and store your makeup brushes!\n",
      "Here’s the rub.  Fresh, clean brushes feel better when you apply your makeup!\n",
      "Your makeup brushes are expensive, personal tools that need care to extend their life.\n",
      "Your brushes need to be washed gently and often, and though some would view this as a chore, we prefer the tactile experience of hand washing a beautiful brush. But what do you do with your wet, freshly washed brushes?  Most would lay them on a countertop causing slow drying that flatten the bristles, not to mention taking up a lot of space. The Brushelle Beauty Stand addresses these problems by letting gravity and natural airflow dry your brushes.\n",
      "What else?\n",
      "The principals behind Brushelle Beauty have experience in patenting and bringing to market products in the marine, equine and hardware industries. In each case, their approach was to solve a problem or address a need in the most direct, least complicated and quality way possible. With Brushelle Beauty the goal is to develop a line of transformative beauty products, the first of which is the Patented, Made In America, makeup brush stand called Brushelle.  Other product ideas are under development and new ideas from our customer family are also welcomed.  All ideas, from product enhancements to joint product ventures and new patents are open for consideration.\n",
      "Our current goal is to deliver the highest quality Brushelle Beauty Makeup Stand in as timely a manner as possible. Our current target date for delivery is August 2022. COVID related supply chain issues are difficult to predict but making the product in Southern California with a manufacturer with many years of experience in manufacturing, packaging and order fulfillment gives us a greater degree of control over quality and delivery than products made elsewhere.\n",

      " As seen on\n",
      "If you ever came home with ringing in your ears after attending a loud event, that’s called tinnitus, and although that probably went away, you damaged a certain percentage of your hearing cells permanently. Tinnitus can be permanent (and extremely annoying), and together with NIHL (Noise Induced Hearing Loss), they are diseases worryingly growing among young people. \n",
      "The WHO (World Health Organization) did a study in middle and high-income countries, and they found that nearly 40% of all teenagers and young adults put themselves at risk for NIHL with damaging volumes at entertainment venues. That’s a lot of young people who might permanently damage their ears. Once lost, hearing cannot be restored. \n",
      "Experts agree that long exposure to levels of sound over 85 dB can cause hearing loss. Most clubs and concerts are over 100 dB. The maximum safe-time without protection at that level is around 15 minutes!\n",
      " \n",
      "If you enjoy attending clubs, concerts, or other loud events, you need to protect your hearing.\n",
      "The freebie foam ear plugs that you get in some venues, would protect your hearing, but they would also block some of the sound frequencies that we want to enjoy when listening music. Traditional “musician” ear plugs usually have some color and stick out of your ear which makes you “look funny”.\n",
      "That’s why we created EarDial. The comfortable and discreet hearing protection specially designed for loud music environments. \n",
      "EarDial is perfect for music-lovers, party-goers, DJs, musicians, bartenders, bouncers, and anyone that wants to hear clearly and safely in a loud music event. It’s also perfect for other loud social events, like sport events, or cinemas.\n",
      "EarDial has a high fidelity (Hi-Fi) noise filter, that will block the harmful decibels without sacrificing sound quality. You will be able to enjoy the music and chat with your friends while protecting your hearing. In fact, our earplugs will enhance the music experience to most people, because they remove the ear-pain factor from the loud music.\n",
      "Our design is as discreet as possible. We made it low-profile, so it doesn’t stick out of your ear, but it is still easy to put and remove.\n",
      " We use a high-transparency color for both the silicone and the filter, so when you put them in your ear, they take the tone of your skin and are almost invisible.\n",
      " This is how they look in your ear:\n",
      " This is how we compare to other transparent ear plugs for music:\n",
      "We made them out of hypoallergenic silicone, so it will be nice to your skin no matter how sensitive it is. Also the silicone is very soft, so you can wear them comfortably for long hours.\n",
      "The elasticity of the silicone make your earplugs very resistant and you will be able to reuse them for many years, most likely forever!\n",
      " Our exclusive earwax protection will protect the precision filter so you will have your ear plugs clean and with a clear sound for longer.\n",
      " You will also get a compact aluminium case with your earplugs. This case is small and with a strong lobster clasp, perfect to put in your keychain or pocket and carry with you comfortably at all times. You will have your earplugs ready to be used even in unexpected situations.\n",
      "The aluminium case has an easy to open and close cap, so you can use it, even if you had a few drinks, without the risk of stripping the thread. \n",
      "In the aluminium case there is also a plastic storage tray that let you store and take out your earplugs easy and safely, reducing the risk of losing them in the middle of the dance floor.\n",
      "By the way, all plastics we use are PET, which is a non-toxic, recyclable material, that won’t release any chemicals, which means they can be in contact with your earplugs and skin safely.\n",
      "Look how our compact case compare to others:\n",
      " We developed a companion mobile app that will tell you the approximate sound level pressure you are currently exposed to, and it will tell you how long you can stay at that level without risk of hearing loss.\n",
      "You can compare the results if you are wearing EarDial earplugs or not. \n",
      "When you activate the EarDial switch, it will adjust the calculations based on the EarDial attenuation levels. \n",
      "You have inside more information about the decibel (dB) scale, the noise dose formula, attenuation standards, and more. \n",
      "Here is a demo of the app in use:\n",
      "And here a demo of the results compared with a professional Sound Level Meter:\n",
      "It will be available for iOS and Android (it is not published yet). You will just need to search “eardial” in your app store. Totally free of charge. Useful even if you are not an owner of EarDial earplugs!\n",
      "We are on a mission to bring awareness and let people enjoy loud social events, while protecting their hearing against NIHL (Noise Induced Hearing Loss) and Tinnitus. We'll donate 5% of our profits to charities like Dangerous Decibels or Action on Hearing Loss.\n",
      "When you support EarDial, you are also supporting a good cause.\n",
      "We made a small run with a prototype, just to test our concept, and we already got some glowing reviews! We are looking forward to hear the reviews for the new improved version!\n",
      "That’s great! and you are in luck, because we designed EarDial to be distributor friendly. We want to see EarDial in venues, festivals, bars, shops, markets or kiosks, and we designed our packaging to make your job easier.\n",
      "Same size as a cigarette box: We made the EarDial box exactly the same dimensions as a standard cigarette box, which means it could be easily distributed via cigarette vending machines, cigarette racks, or any other vending machine.\n",
      "Removable hanger hole: It has a light-weight hanger hole so it can be put in display hooks. If not necessary, the hanger can hide inside the box.\n",
      "PDQ Box Pack: As a distributor you will receive a PDQ (Product Displayed Quickly) box with 20 EarDial boxes. You can simply open the box and put it in a table, counter, bar or rack ready to sell.\n",
      "To order multiple units, simply choose the Kickstarter Special reward but pledge the amount for the units that you want. We will send you as many units as you pledged for. For example, if you wanted 3 units you would multiply £19 x 3, so you would pledge £57. As 2 units is a very popular request, we created a reward with that (you know, for the people who don't read all the content).\n",

      "We have worked for months with our manufacturer to produce the injection mold needed to create the silicone part of the earplugs, and it's basically ready for mass production. We are now waiting for different filter samples to test in real live music environment and decide which one is best, and submit for testing and certification. We are working with one of the best testing laboratories in Germany, and they just need us to send them the final samples.\n",

      "The carrying case tray and packaging box for the earplugs has been already produced in mass when we did our proof of concept. We have a few improvements in our new design but we expect our printer to be able to execute without problems as they did last time.\n",
      "\n",
      "For distributors, we still need to design the distributor pack, but it's a standard box that our printer produced in the past for other clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app functions properly in both iOS and Android, but since we won't be able to test every model in the market, and every phone might receive slightly different sound signal depending on factors that we can't control, like how old or damaged is your microphone, we need to add a calibration section, so the users can adjust if needed. This is a quite simple implementation though. We have developed apps in the past and we are already approved as developers in both the Apple App Store and in Google Play.\n",

I cannot thank you all enough for the support you've given me.\n",

      "Vad är problemet?Ett av vår tids största problem är de ökade avstånden mellan människor och de missuppfattningar, konflikter och ökade nivåer av främlingskap som följer. Digitaliseringen har gjort det möjligt för oss att koppla ihop våra datorer men också att slippa prata med och umgås med människor som inte tänker, pratar eller känner som oss. Det uppstår grupperingar, filterbubblor och polarisering mellan landsbygd och stad, mellan rika och fattiga, mellan progressiva och konservativa, mellan kristna och muslimer, mellan unga och gamla. I en värld där alla har varsin världsbild är det svårt att förstå varandra. I en värld där alla pratar för att få rätt är det svårt att lyssna. I en värld där vi hela tiden ska dela upp oss i vi och dem är det svårt att skapa ett gemensamt samhälle. Jag tror att vi behöver förändra samtalet för att kunna förändra samhället. Därför är jag samtalsaktivist.\n",
      "Vad ska jag göra åt det?De senaste åren har jag spelat golf med meningsmotståndare, ätit lunch med kvinnliga imamer, intervjuat islamofober, blivit kompis med före detta nazister, lyssnat på poddar med vänsterextrema, högerextrema, mailat fram och tillbaka med några av de vassaste provokatörerna i landet och druckit kaffe med före detta buddhistiska skogsmunkar för att försöka hitta mitt lugn igen. Under mitt liv har jag som programledare, journalist och samtalsaktivist ägnat tiotusentals timmar åt att just prata med människor. Jag har ägnat otroligt mycket tid åt att samtala med människor som inte tänker, tycker eller känner som jag. Det vill jag fortsätta med men jag vill att du ska få höra de samtalen också.\n",
      "Under 2018 tänker jag bjuda in gäster till podden \"Hur kan vi?\" och fråga dem hur de tänker, vad de upplever är problemet, hur de ser på framtiden, vad de tycker är fel och hur de tycker att vi ska göra. Och du har möjlighet att vara med på resan,  backa mig och påverka innehållet och valet av både gäster och frågor.\n",
      "Hur ska jag göra det?Jag kommer att söka upp dessa personer, bjuda in dem till min studio i Malmö eller åka till dem. Jag kommer att göra poddavsnitten både i ljud och även med video när det är möjligt. Detta kommer att publiceras på tillgängliga poddplattformar, på Youtube och på en hemsida. Jag kommer att marknadsföra podden genom Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin men också hitta möjligheter att få genom vissa av intervjuerna och ibland delar av dem till traditionell radio, tidningar och Tv.Utifrån målet med den här kampanjen siktar jag på att göra 20 avsnitt med just fokus på Hur kan vi: prata med varandra. Om kampanjen går över målet finns det möjlighet till fler avsnitt och även att göra en bok.För att guida mig genom samtalen så har jag skapat ett manifest för bättre samtal.\n",
      "Manifestet:1. Lyssna för att förstå, inte för att alltid ha rätt.2. Ge och ta plats i samtalet3. Uppmuntra varandra att provprata 4. Tala från sanning så ofta du kan5. Våga vara dum ibland6. Öppna upp och var sårbar7. Lämna egot hemma8. Bejaka det som händer9. Utgå ifrån att alla gör så gott de kan10. Tänk på att allt är påhittat\n",
      "Varför just jag?För att ju mer olik en människa är mig desto mer nyfiken blir jag och vill verkligen förstå hur de tänker.För att det är det här jag har gjort de senaste åren och nu vill jag göra med fler och tillsammans med er.För att jag är så trött på alla ideologiska läger, grupperingar och idiotiska etiketter.För att jag känner att jag blir smartare av att prata med människor som inte är som jag och jag vill att vi ska bli smartare tillsammans.För att jag vill, kan, har erfarenhet, nätverk, tid och lust att göra det.\n",
      "Vad ska det leda till?Dessa tjugo avsnitt ska leda till ytterligare tjugo som i sin tur ska leda till ytterligare tjugo. Varje gäst får tipsa mig om en person som jag ska träffa. Varje samtal leder till nya frågor. Varje fråga leder till ett nytt samtal.I slutet av det här året ska jag samla alla tankar, samtal och frågor och sätta ihop till en bok. Boken ges ut nästa år och kan tillsammans med en föreläsning sprida sig till fler personer, grupper, kommuner, organisationer och nätverk. Med hjälp av den kan vi öka nyfikenheten till andra människor och hjälpa varandra att bli klokare genom samtal. Syftet med boken är dels att dela med sig av några bitar av samtalen men också ge verktyg, råd och tips och samtalsfrågor för att kunna skapa fler samtal mellan fler människor som annars inte hade pratat med varandra.\n",
      "Visionen:Jag tror att det tar tid att förändra ett samtalsklimat. Jag ser inte det här som något jag kan förändra själv på fem eller femtio år. Jag har en femhundraårsvision som jag börjar plantera för redan nu. Om jag börjar lyssna på främlingar, meningsmotståndare och samtalar med människor som jag är rädd för, inte har samma åsikter som, som jag tycker är jobbiga och utmanande, så kan fler göra det. Det blir ringar på vattnet, både över världen idag men också över tid. Det vi börjar odla idag kommer att kunna bli något om hundra år och om femhundra år kanske människor har börjat ändra sin ton gentemot varandra, ställa andra typer av frågor, prata på ett annat sätt. Jag tror det tar tid att förändra ett samtalsklimat men jag tror verkligen att det går.\n",
      "Vad kommer pengarna gå till?De 20 avsnitten kommer att ha en budget på ungefär 10.000 kronor per avsnitt och dessa pengar kommer att budgeteras noga för redigering och postproduktion av ljud och video samt kostnader för studio, webbhosting, formgivning, utrustning, eventuella resor för gäst och det lilla som sen blir kvar per avsnitt för den tid jag och de personer som hjälper mig med detta lägger ner. 20 avsnitt x 10.000 = 200.000\n",
      "Vad händer när vi når över målet?200.000 = 20 poddavsnitt i ljud och video250.000 = 30 poddavsnitt i ljud och video300.000 = 40 poddavsnitt i ljud och video samt BOKEN400.000 = 50 poddavsnitt i ljud och video samt BOKEN och vi arrangerar en helkväll LIVE i Stockholm dit vi bjuder in de mest uppskattade gästerna från podden och dit du som backare har möjlighet att få en biljett.\n",
      "( Alla belöningar uppdateras när de tilltänkta nivåerna klaras av. När vi kommer över 300.000 kommer det upp nya backningsmål där du te.x kan få bok eller bokpaket. )\n",
      "Tack:Och har du läst så här långt så har jag lyckats fånga ditt intresse och din uppmärksamhet. Jag gör det här för att jag verkligen tror på samtalet. Jag har brunnit för det här så länge och är redo att ta nästa steg och är tacksam för ditt engagemang, ditt stöd och att du är med på resan. Om vi tillsammans kan förändra samtalet kan vi också förändra samhället. \n",
      "Samtalet fortsätter.Med värme. Navid Modiri\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Med tanke på att valet av många av gästerna kommer att vara politiskt inkorrekta och kontroversiella kan det bli så att projektet får en hel del kritik och negativ kritik. Detta räknar jag med eftersom vi lever i en tid då olikheter i form av åsikter ofta leder till att människor hånas, kallas för idioter eller bränns på digitala bål. Detta är något som projektet i sin ton ska motverka och erbjuda ett alternativ till.\n",

      "Hello everyone, my name is Randy May. I'm the creator of Double Tap Audio. With your help we will be producing what we like to call, Double Tap R1 headphones. The idea behind this came to us after having countless sets of headphones break over the years. We wanted to fix this problem without sacrificing a quality listening experience.\n",
      "After months of research, testing and prototyping we made a set of headphones that we are proud to call our own. We wanted the appearance to reflect the durably and strength of the headphones. We used modified 40 Cal once fire brass along with mat black anodized aluminum housing for the earphone shells. We found this solid metal build greatly reduces sound leaking in and out of the earphones, along with being much more durable compared to plastic.\n",
      "One of the biggest problems causing most headphones to fail is strain on the wiring or poor quality wire. We feel we have fixed these problem on our headphones. We are using a multi-layer cord design that allows the strain to beheld by the outer layer. By doing this it allows the wires to float inside, taking little to no strain. Another problem is the wire will break do to kinking or being bent over and over. To help fix this problem we are using thick highly flexible wire. This wire along with the outer paracord help keep the wires from kinking or breaking.\n",
      "We didn't want this highly durable design to be lacking in sound, so we used the biggest dynamic coil drivers we could get into the house. We wanted a good balance of highs, mids and lows. That being said, we have used drivers that deliver crisp highs and mids and a deep bass note. The headphones are noise canceling and come with two styles of ear bud tips. One style can be used for sitting and walking around. The other style is for being more active.\n",
      "We a have every supplier lined up and ready to ship out. We are ready to start producing them, the only thing left is your help. With your funding we will be able to get everything we will need to start making these ideas and prototypes into a reality. We can't do this without you though, so with your support of $55 or more you will get a set of the Double Tap R1 headphones as a reward before anyone else.\n",

      "Alone Again is a short film that gives an intimate yet humorous look into a young woman's different relationships and dating over the span of a few years. This dark comedy of errors follows her evolution of naivety transforming into strength throughout various experiences.\n",
      "I've been a professional photographer for 5 years, predominately focusing on behind the scenes, street photography and musicians. \n",
      "I have always had a strong interest in human interactions especially regarding how two people interpret one situation in different ways. \n",
      "When I first wrote this short film, I wrote it with the intention of one friend reading it as an exercise for myself. It allowed me to be candid and probably more open in a way that felt therapeutic so I sent it around to about 20 friends to get feedback and notes. \n",
      "The more I worked on it the more I fell in love with the idea of creating it. I was very inspired that some of the people I sent it to felt understood and not \"alone\" while others felt like they were gaining a different perspective. \n",
      "I wanted to do a Kickstarter to get people involved who probably had no idea I wrote a short film and to ensure that I can cover expenses for crew, wardrobe, set decorating, camera, hair & make-up, etc. \n",

They have to accept their destiny, it's with this idea in mind and my love for the korean group Epik High that I created \"Amor Fati\".

Included in every cookbook is over 200 half page recipes with plans to add more in the future. These recipes range from delicious entrees to mouthwatering deserts that will mimick your favorite resturants taste.\n",

      "Our timeline for delivery of cookbooks to our backers should follow schedule unless any unforeseen circumstance occurs\n",
      "--------j----/nonstick-knowledge------\n",
      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "It places an emphasis on building up your kitchen over time, working with what you have, and learning about the interactions between ingredients rather than memorizing recipes.\n",
      "Most of the time...\n",
      "Googling for recipes can lead to some delicious food, but it often leaves you with leftover ingredients or an oddly specific piece of cookware (wheel of cheese anyone?).\n",
      "To compound this, putting emphasis on individual recipes often leaves you hanging when it comes to understanding what makes food good. When a video talks about how to make some killer tacos, you learn how to make those killer tacos. But what about other options? What about if I only have turkey, and not beef/pork/South American caiman meat like the recipe says? What if I don't have a sous vide machine? WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE CILANTRO?\n",
      "Frankly, it's hard to get into cooking. There's a lot of equipment involved, a lot of ingredients, and that means a lot of money. And nobody wants to drop a stack of cash on high tech hardware and fancy spices if it might not pan (hah!) out.\n",
      "I'm making a series with the goal of giving a step by step process for someone who wants to start cooking from square one. Each episode will focus on tips and tricks related to cooking that week's recipes, as well as actually showing them being cooked. There will also be a limited list of \"investment\" items, such as cookware, spices, utensils, or other items that have a high up front cost, as well as a shopping list for more standard ingredients. Recipes for a given period are planned assuming that the watcher has nothing more than the shopping list, and any previous investments. (For example, if week one would require purchasing a baking dish and some garlic powder, then week two recipes would also be able to use those things). There's also a goal of not leaving leftover ingredients where possible. If I tell you to buy a bag of potatoes, the schedule will have you eat them all sooner rather than later.\n",
      "Meanwhile, each episode would also discuss things such as cooking techniques, flavor profiles, and equipment maintenance. It is important to note that this will NOT be a universal source of cooking knowledge. I've worked hard and learned a lot, but I still can't teach you how to slice an onion as well as Alton Brown or how to cook a steak as perfectly as Gordon Ramsey.\n",
      "Although the idea was originally composed for people getting into cooking for the first time, the emphasis on learning flavors and the meal prepping aspect mean that this curriculum is a great asset to people who want to learn a little more, or who would like an easy weekly shopping list in the style of Hellofresh or Blue Apron.\n",
      "This series would have episodes every week or two, and would be complimented by published recipes (cooking along to a video leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion) written in a way that allows for preparing for a weekend shopping trip and adjusting ingredient counts for different numbers of people. The time frame to complete filming is still up in the air, because I haven't completed the entire schedule, but I will have the writing ready by the end of the year so that I can send out the E-Book by January 2021.\n",
      "This may not teach as many fancy recipes as a professional chef's class or a specialist cooking channel, but learning about components and interactions in your own meals allow you to take someone else's recipe and adapt it for yourself. You can work around your own eating style, whether that means addressing lactose intolerance, veganism, or just a simple hatred of a single ingredient. You aren't learning lessons from me, you're learning lessons from the food. I'm just the guy who plans it out.\n",
      "I've always been interested in cooking to some degree. I made casseroles, chili, and grilled cheese, and even had my own homemade pizza dough when I was younger. When I got to College I was able to largely avoid cooking by buying a lot of microwavable foods and eating a frankly disgusting amount of fast food. I was that one roommate who would never have food in the house, and who would make a trip to McDonald's at the drop of a hat. I finished four years of education with 2 plates, a set of silverware, and a baking sheet.\n",
      "I've recently been taking advantage of my post-graduation unemployed status to stress about money, but in my free time I've been getting back into cooking and finding that it's a new passion of mine. And because of my unique situation, (read: completely empty personal kitchen) I've been planning the order that I want to buy spices, cookware, and ingredients. I had the idea to write my plan up into a cohesive curriculum, and here I am!\n",
      "The funding goal is predominantly set to allow me to spend more money and time working on recipes and planning sets of meals. It also allows me to actually buy the cookware myself before I suggest it to you guys. Other expenditures include good video equipment (why do you think I only have pictures here?) as well as contracting help for things such as editing videos, editing text, and graphic work on the recipe book. I promise that I won't be blowing all the money on the nicest possible stuff, because I can't recommend that an absolute beginner gets a $300 dollar cast iron griddle.\n",
      "Stretch Goals:\n",
      "This additional material would include printed material, whether additions to the recipe book, or an entire separate document. At the same time, the more funding obtained for the campaign, the more content I can add to the standard videos, and the more esoteric recipes and techniques I can discuss. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "This is my first project, and I know that there are lots of unexpected challenges. Because of this, I have chosen not to offer any physical rewards to avoid issues with shipping charges, Covid-19 manufacturing, or print proofing. The tentative time frame is to start production of the series within 2 months, and create 2-4 episodes a week, but those dates could change somewhat.\n",

      "This is a space adventure on stage... With robots... What else do you need to know?!\n",
      "Well, probably a lot...\n",
      "Once upon a time in space, on the planet earth, in a strange desert landscape called Albuquerque, there was born an idea. The idea started out simple enough:\n",
      "\"Do you maybe want to write a science fiction play with me?\"\n",
      "The answer:\n",
      "\"Yes!\"\n",
      "We realized that there is indeed a shortage, perhaps even a lack, of science fiction in the world of theater. What we would like to do, what we would like your help to do, is create a one-act never-before-seen space adventure on stage, complete with remote controlled robot actors, holograms, airlock mishaps and deep space battles on a fully functional spaceship set!\n",
      "We discover a hapless protein portion chemist (ship's cook) floating through deep space after being blasted out of an airlock while unloading supplies on the exploration vessel he and his crew have been on for just 8 days. With no knowledge of what happened or where he is, all seems lost for the ill-fated fellow. Until he runs smack dab into the side of a mysterious space craft that has a convenient \"Push to Open Airlock\" button located on the outside of the ship. And so he does.\n",
      "The lights on his space suit sweep across a dark control room illuminated by small orange and blue lights,  keypads that shimmer with analog patterns and glowing cabinets full of strange containers.  Suddenly the lights go up and a hologram of a ship comes to life in the middle of the room.  The Astronaut stares with curiosity. His emergency ejection space suit is in stark contrast to the room around him. It is sleek and simple, cool and modern, and the craft he stands in is DEFINITELY ANYTHING BUT. In fact, it is reminiscent of a much much earlier time. Wood paneling runs along many of the control panels, a lounge fully decorated with a mid century chandelier!? Did he just step into some mixed up interior of a vintage space Cadillac?\n",
      "Astronaut soon discovers that this spaceship, which appeared to be abandoned, is in fact inhabited by a small, lonely robot named Edmund, who he has been waiting a very long time for someone to rescue him. \n",
      "We don't want to give away anything else because there are many twists and turns! But, through worm holes and hijinks, space invasions and existential conversations, they will try to defy the odds and make their way back home together.\n",
      "We will be working in collaboration with several outstanding people and organizations (hopefully some of you who may be reading this). We were recently awarded a Resiliency Residency grant from the City of Albuquerque Urban Enhancement Trust Fund. We were lucky enough to excite interest in our project from many of the people who sat on the awards committee. Hooray! Through this grant we were placed with Fusion Theater Company who will be both guide and advisor through our process. \n",
      "We are currently in the process of script revisions, set designs, and of course robot building! We have already gone through several design phases for Edmund and are about to begin the actual fabrication and build.\n",
      "Our robot is one of the most exciting things about this project, (and expensive about $7k). Never before (bold words, but true as far as our research has shown) has a full-sized remote controlled robot droid been the main character of a fully produced stage play. And actually, we have two! See below image for a sneak peak at SQU33N-CH (Squēēnch). Edmund's trusty Sub-quantum data storage rover buddy!\n",
      "We have teamed up with Fonco Studios, a wonderful and brilliant fabrication shop in Los Angeles, who will be building our Edmund robot. They are just as excited as we are to bring Edmund to life. This is a big cost for this project but, because they are as obsessed with robots as we are, they have agreed to do it at a fraction of the cost for what they do for the movies. Their website states that they specialize in \"creating the unusual and unbelievable\" which we feel is totally fitting for this project as that is what we hope to achieve with this performance.\n",
      "The set is another very exciting and expensive character in this play. Our goal with this set is to create a beautiful mash-up of mid century, art deco and the future! With airlock doors, windows to space, sliding hatches, holograms, computer screens, a laboratory, art deco lounge, captains chair, pilot stations and even a Meal-O-Matic food machine, this set will look and function like a legitimate spaceship movie set. \n",
      "We calculate that this set will cost us at least $10k to create and a full 2 months to construct and be the best and hardest time of our life!\n",
      "Astronaut will be a contrast from the set and our robots since he is from the future and the robots are from...well we can't give that away yet. But anyway, we have an amazing local costume designer on board to help create his look. Astronaut's form fitting future suit will incorporate an LED fiber optic material that can shift colors as well as a sleek gold visored white helmet.  We are very excited to create our very own never-before-seen space suit!\n",
      "There are a few other characters that appear either in person or on the holo monitor via video feed but we don't want to give them all away because some of them may not make the final script revision... but these three villains will definitely be there! George and the probes.\n",
      "First we want to mention, because it may be a question many have, why tickets are not part of most of the rewards for donations. Two reasons, one is that the non profit theater hosting us does have overhead costs we hope to recoup. And the second is a portion of all ticket sales regardless of profit or loss for JoyrKade, will be going straight to Global Giving for the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund. And any profit in ticket sales will be donated as well. We feel it. And trying to raise money for something like this when people across the world, not only Ukraine, are suffering, is not lost in our hearts and efforts.  We are doing this for the art, with all our expertise and heart. And if we can contribute to the efforts to help those in most need, that's what we will do!\n",
      "The grant amount ($2500) as helpful and motivating as it is, is a drop in the bucket for this project. Our goal of $10k will get us half way there so we really are hoping to exceed that goal by as much as possible and even take the production on tour. The actual budget reflected by everything our imagination has brought to this production would be close to $30k and we are already putting in much of our own money to do this. We begin building our set at The Cell Theater, this week!  When the calendar opened up and the grant was awarded, we committed to it. We've taken off 3 months of work to do it and every dollar will be going into the production, so we are all in! Performances are already scheduled the last 3 weeks of June into July at The Cell Performance space. Opening June 16th and closing on July 2nd. \n",
      "We are confident our community will help get us the $10k through Kickstarter which will get us close, but hoping to exceed that and get our robot arms! And all the other fantastic tech and toys we have planned for this show. Ultimately, if we can exceed our goal by enough, we'd love to take this show on the road to other cities, theater's and communities to experience as well!\n",

He has written, produced and directed award winning plays and won Clio Awards for commercial projects he has produced. It's been a while, but this project will be a return to the stage in all those roles while bringing his producing experience of the last decade to elevate this show! He will be playing Astronaut.\n",

She currently works as a production designer and art director and has designed sets for music videos, commercials, and feature films. She loves being involved in all the details from set construction to custom prop creation. Some of her favorite sets that she has designed include, a post apocalyptic sushi food truck, a science fiction machine that sends people to other dimensions, and a gloomy old castle tower where sleeping beauty pricks her finger on a spinning wheel. Sarah has also written and directed several short films and so far, has had one brief and successful stint as an actress. She loves good storytelling and shares a love of science fiction, vintage design, and robots with her co-creator Ross Kelly. She will be operating Edmund the Robot during the performances and possibly making a small guest appearance as a space scientist!\n",
      "Elijah Kelly is Ross' son and he will be voicing Edmund! Ross and Elijah wrote and shot a series of comedy shorts over the pandemic that partially inspired the casting and collaboration for this project. Simple low-fi iPhone movies to make us laugh but they made some other people laugh too. This we hope, will do the same!\n",
      "In addition to funding, we know we are going to need a team of both experienced and non-experienced stage folks for the run of the show. We are in the process of vetting a stage manager, board op/tech, prop master and 3 stage hands. We have budgeted to pay these roles and are open to anyone who is interested! Please feel free to contact us ASAP. Also looking for prosthetic make up artist, video editor, VFX artist, CGI, graphic artist and animators who might want to be involved! We have some of these folks but we have a long list!\n",
      "We have a short amount of time to accomplish quite a lot. We have put real life on hold for a few priceless months in order to create something we know will be very special. If anyone else feels a call to this adventure we want to know.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We think the risks and challenges are apparent in that we are trying to do something that we have never done before and maybe no one really has? There is so much that can go wrong! And that is exciting!\n",
      "We have a remote control robot with live audio PA that will need both an operator and an actor.\n",
      "We have a small rover droid that will need an operator.\n",
      "We have hologram projections, pre recorded video projection, double sliding airlock doors, sliding hatches, computer screens, alien plant terrariums, captains chairs, LED floor lights, overhead panel lights, zero gravity suspension cable, rotisserie chicken food generator and probably a few other elements we have yet to discover!\n",
      "We also have time.\n",
      "We know we said we have a lot to accomplish in a short period of time and indeed it will fly by but 100% of our time from now until we open on Thursday, June 16th will be committed to this project. We are giving ourselves a full month of rehearsal and 8 days of full tech rehearsals to experience any problems that might arise in live performance.\n",
      "How we plan to overcome anything that might risk the success of the project, is to be willing and ready to improvise and pivot creatively and technically.\n",

We have a wonderful script, a very supportive venue and a production team committed to telling this story in the best possible way. With your help, all this and more is possible.\n",
      "Our Boy by Helen Hammond is a one act play inspired by real events.\n",
      "Joe is a 14 year old autistic boy whose parents are separated and the play opens to find him shivering and alone after having been raped on his way home from school. The play follows Joe and his family on their journey into learning to cope, not only with the aftermath but with each other. As all three characters (Joe, his mother and his father) muddle through as best they can, they begin to rediscover how to connect as a family and look toward a brighter future.\n",
      "\"Before beginning a life of playwriting I spent 40 years as a Paediatrician so, although the story and characters are fictional, the story of Joe and his family is one I felt compelled to tell after so long working with many children and families who have faced the same traumas.\n",
      "The play, as it is now, began life as a monologue from Joe's mother where she struggles to come to terms with how Joe has grown through his trauma and feeling adrift from the son she thought she knew. I was studying directing when I wrote it and got together with some of the other students to develop the monologue into a full one act play. We entered the play into a festival where it was commended and we felt the next step for us was to take the play to the Edinburgh Fringe.\n",
      "By writing and staging the play, we hope to promote greater understanding and support for young people and families in our communities who are living with any kind of disability or suffering from abuse. We understand that these are serious issues and not everyone's stories end well but we have tried to tell this story with moments of humour and a final note of optimism.\" - Helen Hammond\n",
      "I came to writing and directing in theatre as a second career, having retired from a more than full time career as a Consultant Paediatrician where I specialised in early child development, neuro-disability, and child protection, and was awarded an OBE for services to medicine and health care. More recently, I've benefitted from the availability of online playwriting tuition from the Bishopsgate Institute as well as City Lit in London as well as having obtained an ATCL Diploma in Directing and Devising from Acting Out Drama School in Edinburgh, during which I met Chris and Steve who are now helping me bring Joe's story to life.\n",
      "I first dipped my toe into directing movement whilst at University, although it was mostly by accident. It started with taking a very active role in devising with guidance from visiting Choreographers and resulted in me begrudgingly becoming my flatmate's assistant Choreographer for his degree piece. My first professional opportunity as a director came soon after when I helmed a satirical piece of new writing at the 2018 Carlisle Fringe. At that point I was hooked and have since directed shows big and small with the likes of Some Kind of Theatre, Bard in the Botanics and Scottish Opera.\n",
      "I started writing songs 35 years ago and I've released studio albums and singles with Dogs of Autumn, Starfly69 and Einstein’s Wardrobe. I will also be releasing songs as a solo artist during 2022.  On top of that, I've written some TV themes including “How 2” on ITV and some music for Sky Sports. Some other highlights of my song writing career include a 2002 song for the Scottish Team at the Manchester Commonwealth Games, and songs written in support of charities such as Alzheimer’s Scotland, Winston’s Wish and lt’s Good to Give. I am currently collaborating on projects with recording artists and writers based in the UK, Ireland, USA, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Australia and Canada.\n",

The creative team will also not be taking a wage from this production until the above costs are met. Once we have covered all the listed costs then any profit will be divided between the creative team and the actors.\n",

      "What is Psychologia? Psychologia is a podcast exploring human psychology, with a focus on its dark side. The name is the root word for psychology, which is derived from the Greek psukhe meaning \"breath, spirit, soul,\" and logia, meaning the \"study of\" or \"research.\" Each episode of Psychologia examines a new facet of human behavior and the stories, laws, and research behind it.\n",
      "We've already self-produced one season with nine great episodes - and a budget of $0! We're very proud of the results, and if you haven't had a chance to check them out, here's a little run-down (you can find more details and listen to them all here):\n",
      "Who makes Psychologia? Your host, Amaia Perta, has a master's of science in forensic psychology and is a graduate of Bard College and a former student at UCLA. Psychologia was born last year as a culmination of her deep interest in the darker side of psychology and its history, as well as her undergraduate degree in theater and performing arts.\n",
      "In addition to the individualized focus of each topic, every episode has a completely original score and sound design composed by musician and engineer, Cambron Carter (whose first full-length album was just released on Spotify). This seamlessly-produced element brings a new soundscape to each show, creating a fresh atmosphere to underscore the material.\n",
      "We need your help. Our goal is to make the second season of Psychologia a bi-weekly ten-episode season, with a five-month run. All of season one was recorded in our homes with basic equipment and minimal technology, and we had no sponsorship or external support. \n",
      "We want to add some cool features to season two, like travel to site-specific locations and interviews with experts - plus better sound quality and variation - but that requires a budget. We need funding to upgrade our equipment and editing software, pay for the platforms we use to post and share the podcast, support the research that goes into each episode, and underwrite the exciting changes we want to make. If this campaign is successful, it will make all of that a reality!\n",

      "Rising Sand is a fantasy adventure webcomic that tells the story of Dal, a precocious runaway who learns that the sun itself is falling out of the sky, and that civilization has little time to prepare for—or perhaps avoid—the end. To make matters worse, Dal's zealous paladin sister Ro is hot on her tail, determined to drag her back to the life she left behind. Braving perilous ruins and murderous cultists, Dal will find her place in the world, even if it kills her. And everyone else.\n",
      "First launched online in 2016, Rising Sand is an award-winning, meticulously illustrated story that presents ubiquitous human anxieties such as finding our tribe, sacrificing our happiness for the ones we love, climate change, and the acceptance of death through the lens of a light-hearted—and sometimes gut-wrenching—pre-post-apocalyptic world on the edge of its own extinction. A blend of science fiction, high fantasy, and even slice of life makes Rising Sand a rich and rousing adventure for readers of all ages, provided they can squint through the occasional exploding head. \n",
      "RISING SAND Volume One is a ninety-page softcover tome collecting the first Act of the story, which introduces us to Dal, her friends, and the world of Erj, and builds to a brutal clash as Dal and her sister finally cross paths—again, for the first time. Remastered lettering and artwork, gorgeous 80lb matte paper, and exclusive extra pages featuring behind-the-sand production art, some of which has never been seen online, makes RISING SAND Volume One the most definitive version of the story to date! \n",
      "It sounds like we have everything under control—what do we need you for? Come on, this is Kickstarter. You know why you’re here. Printing books is very, very expensive. But not impossible! Not if we do it together. We’d love your help to make this project happen, and are willing to show you a very clever chart to get it.\n",
      "As you can see, printing books and shipping them to you dominates the funding goal. The plan is to print enough for the campaign and, in a perfect world, have a few left over for conventions and shops. Every dollar will be put back into the campaign—including towards stretch goals, which, for the time being, are under wraps. We don’t want to jinx anything. But forget about that for now; I see you eyeing that ‘rewards’ sliver, there…\n",
      "Our reward structure is pretty simple; frankly, our primary aim is little more than to have the book in everyone's hands without requiring a mountain of money to convert into trinkets. Nevertheless, we’ve the typical selection of stickers, pins, guest artwork, and even the Rising Sand soundtrack EP to slake your material thirst, available in the tiers to your right. Let’s take a closer look at them!\n",
      "Note: As indicated, all prices are in CAD, so in the statistical likelihood you're reading this from the US or Europe, these are probably going to be a bit less than the numbers would make it seem. Bonus!\n",

For the curious, it sounds a little like this:\n",

With the binding ritual complete, you'll receive a trophy in the form of a physical copy of RISING SAND Volume One, ready to mount on your favourite shelf, coffee table, or comic rack, and be bragged about to your friends and loved ones! You can also read it, if you want.\n",

      "It's dangerous to go alone, and we've found ourselves lucky enough to bring along some truly unique voices to help round out this vision of Erj. Your walls, your laptop, your YOU will have never looked so beautifully bleak! We'll also sign your copy of the book on request.\n",

      "The project\n",
      "When I was a teenager, I tried writing fiction with a disabled character, and then as I got older, I kept trying to write with disabled characters. I’ve also been drawing for many years, including trying to represent people with mental health problems and physical disabilities.\n",
      "Only now at 43 have I brought all this together to draw something loosely based on my experiences. The eureka moment came when I stopped trying to write it about a man and a woman, but I gave myself distance by making my character a bisexual man.\n",
      "Why a webcomic?\n",
      "I wish to create something which could help teenagers of many backgrounds and situations; gay teenagers, disabled teenagers, newly injured spinal patients, able bodied people hoping to gain better understanding, and hopefully one day a teenager wondering how to approach a relationship with another teenager who happens to be disabled.\n",
      "Webcomics as a medium are easy to read, access, and importantly can be found for free online. I publish monthly on Tapas a month after my patrons have seen chapters.\n",
      "Why ‘Incomplete’?\n",
      "The comic’s name refers to a few different aspects of the story; firstly, and most obviously, Pip and Matt complete each other in their relationship. Secondly, the story will never be ‘complete’ because I will write it as long as I can and continue to base it on our life.\n",
      "Thirdly, and the reason I chose the word, is that an incomplete injury is a type of spinal injury where the spinal column is not completely severed, and some feeling remains below the level of injury.\n",
      "What is available in rewards?\n",
      "I am offering a range of items with ‘Pip’s Prints’ on them, as well as special tiers where you will appear in the comic! Even if you can only pledge £1, I appreciate the support, and every single pledge will get a postcard sent to you, and a thank you in the finished book once it’s published.\n",
      "What are ‘Pip’s Prints’?\n",
      "Pip, the main character through which the story is mainly told, wears patterned shirts a lot, so I had to start drawing the patterns for them.

From the start, we decided to take things slowly and intentionally, choosing to give more than we ask. But now, with an established platform and an experienced editorial team, we are ready to grow.\n",
      "Our goals for this fundraising campaign are more ambitious than in the past.\n",
      "We have prioritized paying fair rates to leftist writers and artists while keeping our operational expenses at a bare minimum. This has meant that our editorial board has worked for two years in an entirely voluntary capacity. Now that we've become more established, we hope to reach our stretch goals, which would support an increased publishing tempo and provide our editors and designers with small stipends to allow us to dedicate more time to our work and help ensure the long-term sustainability of the organization.

      "Patent Pending\n",
      "Noise-isolating earbuds are far from novel, but the Plugfones Liberate flips a common equation on its proverbial ear: we’ve engineered a product that’s earplug first, earbud second. Building on what we’ve learned for the past 6 years producing WIRED Plugfones, we’ve SEVERED the cable with Plugfones Liberate. \n",
      "These Bluetooth 4.0 earplugs offer the same top-notch aural quality as our wired Plugfones, but without the hassle of a 3.5mm connector.\n",
      "Each Liberate headset has a Bluetooth 4.0 antenna, a fully sweatproof design, a noise-reducing inline microphone for voice calls, ruggedized play/pause, volume up, and volume down buttons, song progression buttons, and a water resistant USB charging connector. You can expect the battery to last 8 hours on a full charge, enabling you to easily get through extended shifts without having to source power. \n",
      " Specifications\n",
      "Yellow Model for music only.\n",
      "Black Model for music and calls.\n",
      "Plugfones were initially dreamed up after Shaun, our co-founder, found himself too preoccupied with his own thoughts while working tirelessly in a glass factory. After searching in futility for a set of earplugs that would also play music, he began scraping together funds to assemble prototypes in his garage. By testing them himself and on colleagues, he made the requisite changes to produce a product that perfectly straddled the line between earplug and earphone. \n",
      "We’ve been doing this for nearly six years, and count the likes of Goodyear, La-Z-Boy Manufacturing, and Tyson Foods as customers.\n",
      "Conventional earbuds, even those designed to cancel noise and costing hundreds of dollars, aren’t comfortable for all-day use. Plugfones were engineered as earplugs first, which means that your ears won’t fatigue after wearing these on a 12 hour shift or while shooting your AR-15.\n",
      "Even if you aren’t working in the field or in a factory, having a set of earplugs makes everyday scenarios far more tolerable: riding the subway, sleeping alongside a snoring partner, maintaining focus in the gym, mowing the lawn, or keeping outside distractions at bay while gaming. Or, for the crazy ones, skydiving!\n",
      "The issue, of course, is that typical earplugs are boring. Really boring. Plugfones Liberate enables you to enjoy the spoils of an earplug without going insane. While your ears are being protected, you’ll be treated to top-notch aural excitement. Beyond streaming music, you’ll also be able to take incoming calls without having to expose your ears to unsafe levels of loudness even for a moment. \n",
      "The Liberate, just like our existing wired Plugfones, have been tested by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL). A third-party firm, Michael & Associates, Inc., was employed to rigorously test our products according to U.S., E.U., and Australian standards. Our new Liberate headset received an ANSI certified NRR (Noise Reduction Rating) of 26.\n",
      "As you’d expect, we’re big advocates of protecting your hearing. It’s an element of our lives that we often take for granted, and it’s difficult to recognize small but meaningful diminishment to how acutely we’re able to hear. \n",
      "If you commute daily on a subway, are exposed to loud machinery, or routinely find yourself in noisy environments, it’s not enough to simply drown out the external world with loud music. Liberate works to reduce your ear’s exposure to loudness, enabling you to enjoy music at lower volumes while protecting one of the most important senses you have: the ability to hear.\n",
      "\"I was able to head out onto the busy CES show floor and hear nothing except for the sweet sounds of U2.\" - Reviewed\n",
      "“I could have used a pair of these when I lived in the Lower East Side of Manhattan and drunken NYU students were screaming at each other at 3 in the morning.” -David Goldman, CNN Money\n",
      "Because Liberate is designed to be worn for extended periods of time, we’ve designed the earplug tips to be user-replaceable. We recommend silicon tips be swapped out every four weeks, and foam tips every one to two weeks. We toss in four total sets of tips (two silicon and two foam sets) with each Liberate. Replacement sets in quantities of ten are available on our website for $7.99.\n",
      "Seating a Plugfone in one’s ear canal is fundamentally different than seating a conventional earbud. If you’re an avid earbud wearer, remember to seat the Plugfone Liberate more deeply than you normally would -- it’s an earplug, after all! \n",
      "We generally recommend to seat the Liberate without music already playing. Once you seal out external noise, then turn on your music. If you can hear the low-end resonate, you’ve successfully seated your Liberate! \n",
      "Designing a product like the Liberate requires months of planning, tooling, re-tooling, and if we're honest, another round of re-tooling. We're big fans of exploring prototypes and getting behind the scenes tours of our favorite gadgets, so we wanted to share a few initial drafts, drawings, and renditions that we generated en route to a finalized product.\n",

      "We’re eager to get Plugfones Liberate into as many ears as possible, but shipping outside of the United States and Canada may bring additional duties, taxes, or fees to the user. Backers ordering for shipment outside of these countries will be responsible for paying those fees. In the event that we cannot ship to a certain country, your pledge will be fully refunded.\n",

      "We’ve been doing this product manufacturing thing for a long while, and we’re well-versed in how it all operates. Since 2009, we’ve manufactured wired versions of Plugfones and have shipped them all over the globe. We have a full-time employee that lives in Hong Kong, speaks fluent Mandarin, and works one-on-one with our partners to make sure every granular aspect of our products match our standards before they’re shipped out. \n",
      "\n",
      "We showcased a near-final Plugfones Liberate unit at CES 2016 and received positive feedback from the likes of CNNMoney and Reviewed. We are finalizing the Liberate right now, and will have units out to our initial backers in June 2016. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re beyond thrilled to cut the cord on Plugfones and bring this product to a sector that’s producing a staggering amount of innovation year in and year out. We can’t wait to see the Liberate in use all over the globe!\n",

      "Scraggs O'Possum and The Penultimate Hitch is a journey - 7 years and 35,000km in the making. \n",
      "It all started in the Summer of 2016, with a decision by then, 23-year old Anna Persson, to hitchhike halfway across Canada in the name of adventure. What followed was a revelation and a declaration - hitchhiking had to be the best way to travel! \n",
      "The accumulation of stories, adventures, mishaps, and encounters, alongside a passion for performance, theatre, and the arts is what led to the script for Scraggs O'Possum and The Penultimate Hitch being born in the Winter of 2021. \n",
      "Fast forward six months, and the production is well off the ground and preparing for our debut at the New Zealand Fringe Festival with performances at BATS Theatre on February 27th, March 1st, and March 2nd. \n",

      "The arts, and especially theatre is not cheap to produce and we're grateful to have received a small amount of funding from Creative New Zealand, alongside funds raised from a fundraiser party, which are helping to cover some of the costs of our set, props, and marketing.\n",
      "One thing hitchhiking taught me is the importance of being vulnerable and asking for help. In trusting and being trusted. In stepping into the discomfort of asking for help and doing so with gratitude and humility. Bringing this production to the Fringe has meant much of the same. This is me, standing on the edge of the highway of the internet, once again, asking for help. \n",

      " Performance date will be via Zoom on February 13th 2022.\n",
      "The company is based in the heart of the West Midlands, and the region has links with some of the greatest Victorian and Edwardian genre writers. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle began his career as a writer while practicing medicine in Birmingham and Fu Manchu's creator, Sax Rohmer, was born there, too. Washington Irving penned his classic horror tale, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" whilst living in Birmingham,  and Charles Dickens performed often at the second city's Town Hall, giving the very first public reading of \"A Christmas Carol\" there in 1853.The famous humourist Jerome K. Jerome, author of \"Three Men in a Boat\" was born in nearby Walsall. Both he and Dickens were marvellous exponents of the macabre tale when the mood took them, and the spirits of all these nineteenth-century greats haunt our stage-work.\n",
      "Artistic Director Jonathan Goodwin has been fascinated with the Victorian and Edwardian eras since childhood, and especially the works of Conan Doyle, Stoker, Stevenson, M R James and their ilk. Indeed, the first novel he can recall reading is The Hound of the Baskervilles, when he was six or so. Jonathan was an avid viewer of the black and white Sherlock Holmes films, the Bela Lugosi and the Boris Karloff films, and the early Hammer Horrors back in the days when they were still screened on TV. Little could he have known that all of that would one day lead to his following in their footsteps on stage! Indeed, he even corresponded several times with Peter Cushing on the topic of acting, when Goodwin was still a teenager. Of course, Peter Cushing was one of the first actors a young Goodwin watched playing Sherlock Holmes, in fact, along with Basil Rathbone.\n",
      "They remain his favourites to this day, along with Jeremy Brett, naturally. Jonathan is an omnivorous reader and a bit of a bookworm. On his bookshelves are innumerable titles on Victorian and Edwardian crime, plus works by all the late nineteenth century's greats of popular fiction. But he always allows his imagination free rein when writing scripts, and thinks a degree of artistic licence is allowed when crafting a piece of entertainment – however macabre the subject matter!\n",

      "We love making magazines but hate having to rely on advertising. We love giving writers freedom but hate wasting money on distribution. We love working with photographers and illustrators and want to have control over who we commission. We love the smell of paper and seeing it all come together but hate having to publish something when it’s not totally ready. We love the collaboration, the sense of the new, and the unfound, unseen and unpublished.\n",

      "Having worked extensively in publishing we have seen how magazines have become editorially constricted over the past 25 years. We’ve seen advertising commitments and excessive distribution costs become the norm, and sales dwindle — not because the audience has disappeared, but because authentic publications have.\n",
      "It got us thinking: what if we removed these problems? What would it take to have complete creative control of a magazine?

This is the magazine we have always wanted to make: large format (280mm x 350mm), with extraordinary writers and artists; unusual, opinionated and inspiring editorial, all wrapped up in stunning design. Delivered straight to you from the people who made it. \n",
      "The acclaimed American author Jonathan Lethem (The Fortress of Solitude; Motherless Brooklyn; Dissident Gardens) will write a new novel over the course of the ten issues of INQUE, one chapter per issue. This will be the first time a major writer has done this (the idea in itself is not new, but when, for example, Charles Dickens published in serial format, it was over a matter of months, not years). This work, from one of America’s most exciting and innovative writers, will only be available to read in INQUE, and illustrates the nature of this venture: a ten-year creative document, a hybrid magazine set to the rhythm of its time, showcasing new talent and commenting on what will be an extraordinary decade.\n",
      "We will also be translating international writers into English, and commissioning long-form fiction from new writers—something that is rarely seen these days. In addition, the preeminent author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie will be selecting new African writers for each issue, and we have an editorial board with some of the world’s most exciting and respected writers, publishers and editors helping to create each issue. Lastly, we will be working with outstanding artists and photographers to create exclusive limited-edition authenticated art prints.\n",
      "Placing a limit on the issues will allow it to become a contained project, with a beginning, middle and end. We love the idea of INQUE being a finite set—magazines tend to go on and on—housing creative projects across the whole series which will, in 2030, conclude and create a whole.\n",
      "There won’t be a digital version because we feel the Internet is oversaturated. Being print only will ensure a slower experience, allowing the reader to take time to savour the high production values and unique content.\n",
      "In 2003 we launched Zembla, a literary magazine with the tagline “Fun With Words”. It fused incredible writing with great design and featured, amongst other things, living authors interviewing dead writers, and inspiring new fiction. It was exciting to make. It lasted for nine issues. A large part of the title’s revenue stream was advertising.\n",
      "After that, in 2011, we launched Port, a magazine which combines all the things we love about print titles: quality writing, photography and editorial design with wide-ranging interests in architecture, science, literature, food and fashion. It was, and still is, a homage to the great magazines of the 20th century. Port is largely supported by advertising. We still make Port together.\n",
      "We took a detour in 2015 and launched an adventure magazine, Avaunt, which was about exploration, in the broadest possible sense: we explored language, science, the mind, social sciences and, yes, some of the kit used to climb tall things. We worked on this magazine together for five issues.\n",
      "INQUE is the logical next step, not just for our personal collaborative relationship, but, we feel, for magazines as a whole. It's time to take back some control. It's time for change...\n",
      "We have already confirmed a great list of contributors, and are expecting more to join:\n",

      "We have created—in partnership with iconic British brand Sunspel—a limited-edition long-staple cotton T-shirt with a two-colour screen print. Text by author Max Porter and design by Matt Willey.\n",
      "We’re launching INQUE’s premier issue on Kickstarter because of the collaborative element and sense of community. Magazines are nothing if not communities. Having a group of like-minded people coming together to create the premier issue is, for us, very important and what makes a magazine launch the exciting event it is. Having a single investor is more complicated to find and difficult to work with.\n",
      "Investing in the first issue as part of the Kickstarter campaign, rather than after we launch, means we can make sure we can pay the contributors and the printers up front. Following the initial campaign, each of the following nine issues will be released annually and become self-sustaining.\n",
      "INQUE will then be available as a direct-to-your-door subscription via our website, as well as from select magazine and gallery stores in Los Angeles, New York, London, Berlin, Milan, Paris, Hong Kong and Sydney.\n",

      "His books include The Secret Lives of Authors (Rizzoli), Writing on the Edge (Rizzoli) and Dead Interviews (Granta).\n",

      "As well as being a co-founder of Port and Avaunt magazines, he has helped launch the arts magazine Elephant, the Scottish contemporary art magazine MAP, and has redesigned the RIBA Journal, The Royal Academy Magazine and The Independent newspaper. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "For anyone investing in more than one issue at a reduced rate, we would want to make clear that we can only honestly deliver the full set, over the decade, if we sell enough of issues one, then two, three etc., to get us to the next issue, creating a domino effect to the conclusion of the final issue, number 10. If we create something that is compelling and significantly different to anything else out there, which is exciting and fresh (which is our aim!) this won’t, we feel, be a problem. But it’s a risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "With the pandemic we are aware this horrible virus might linger or return in a different manifestation. If it did, it would of course be tragic. For INQUE, like everyone else, there could be delays. There is not a strict print deadline for each issue, as long as it’s in its designated year (2021, 2022 etc.), so this isn't a major problem, but could consequently pose a challenge if we ran out of time in any given year. We are however working with printers who have the ability to stay open whilst maintaining safe social distancing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, a challenge is figuring out how we package a valuable art print in each issue by our guest artist, without it falling out or into the wrong hands (i.e. someone who has not bought the magazine). We don’t want to have each issue shrink-wrapped, so need to resolve this. Also, deciding against having a digital edition, we need to work out how to ensure people know about the magazine online and have the access to pre-order issues. This balance between digital and traditional print marketing is a real challenge which we need to fully manage.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Apex Magazine is seeking funding to relaunch the zine and resume the publication of award-winning, entertaining, diverse short fiction.\n",
      "Apex Magazine is an online zine of fantastical fiction. For ten years we published works filled with marrow and passion, stories that are twisted, strange, and beautiful. Creations where secret places and dreams are put on display. After taking a year hiatus, we're ready to bring more such stories into the world.\n",
      "We will publish in two forms: an every-other-month eBook edition and a free serialization of the issue's content over a two month period on our website. Additionally, we will continue to produce a monthly podcast of narrated original short fiction.\n",
      "In May, 2019 the magazine went on a hiatus due to our editor-in-chief's health misadventures (that he wrote about here on the Apex Book Company blog). A year later, he's back to his old self (plus one titanium jaw) and is ready to restart the Apex engine!\n",
      "However, before we relaunch, the zine will need an injection of financial support. Enter this Kickstarter campaign! The baseline goal of the Kickstarter will be to raise enough money to fund the first two issues. Our dream would be that we end up funding the whole 2021 publication year via stretch goals. After this Kickstarter campaign, we hope to return to our self-sustaining business model.\n",
      "We do have some planned changes/improvements for the relaunch. But one thing will remain the same--the quality of our groundbreaking genre fiction.\n",
      "The last few years of Apex Magazine, prior to our hiatus, we produced an incredible run of transformative and diverse fiction. We published both the 2018 and 2019 Hugo Award winners in the category of Best Short Fiction (“Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience™” by Rebecca Roanhorse and “A Witch’s Guide to Escape: A Practical Compendium of Portal Fantasies” by Alix E. Harrow, respectively) and the 2017 Hugo Award winner in the category of Best Novelette (“The Tomato Thief” by Ursula Vernon). Fiction from Apex Magazine has also won the Nebula Award, Locus Award, and numerous others.\n",
      "In addition to our phenomenal fiction, every issue of Apex Magazine offered evocative cover art, thought-provoking nonfiction, author and artist interviews, and a professional-quality podcast produced by KT Bryski.\n",
      "All these wonderful things would not have existed if it wasn’t for the community of readers, creators, and staff—the extended Apex family. Thank you so much for your love and continued support!\n",
      "Despite being self-sustaining for the three straight years before its hiatus, we need your help to make this relaunch a reality until our usual funding streams of subscriptions, advertising, and donations come back online. \n",
      "tl;dr: We’re halving the yearly issue count but doubling the content included in each issue. \n",
      "Since we last published, the following pay increases are being implemented to begin with the 2021 publication year:\n",
      "The baseline goal of $7,500 raised via this Kickstarter will go towards issues 121 and 122 to cement the relaunch. In addition to our Kickstarter efforts, we plan to use additional revenue streams, such as sprucing up our Patreon offerings, subscription drives, advertising, and donations to make the publication self-sustaining once again.\n",

      "Send a VoiceMailer and the kids can hear you!\n",
      "Choose the 2-way VoiceMailer and you can send your camper a message and they will send their voices back to you.  Love it!\n",
      "VoiceMailers all travel First Class through the US Mail.   And they are always pre-stamped!  All you do is Press the Button!\n",
      "Letters with voices are way better than plain old letters.  No computer required.\n",
      "INSPIRATION\n",
      "Our story began with inspiration in early summer of last year.  My brilliant wife, Beth, was putting together a birthday care package for our son at camp.  Our camp allows only one package a summer so gifts, forgotten clothes, and getting the things all the other kids have has to be put in the one package.  One of the gifts he received was a sports bauble that allowed us to record a 10 second birthday message.  It had low quality sound, it was bulky, and it was $10.  But Beth was so happy to wish Isaac Happy Birthday in her own voice.  It made her happy and she thought it would make him happy.  She wished she had bought several of the baubles to send throughout the summer.  But since it would have to be sent in a package, this would be the only one.\n",
      "SOLUTION\n",
      "So why couldn't the bauble be smaller?  Thinner?  Lighter?  If it could go in an envelope it would be a letter and Beth could send a voice message as often as she wanted.  That's good.  And if the kids could send their voices home, that would be great!  Maybe they'll sing, laugh, include a friend -- heck, maybe they would just write more often!  So we did our research and made our first prototypes last summer.  We created the concept, an initial design, and tested their performance.  Results were good and enthusiasm ran high.  One-way and two-way mailers made their way through the US post office from home to camp and camp to home.  Camp letters would never be the same.\n",
      "DEDICATION\n",
      "What have we made since last summer?  Improvements!  We found a better recording mechanism and increased reliability by engineering and design.  We worked with the factory to create high quality sound, increased record time to 20 seconds and beyond, tweaked the original graphics and created a new icon, and we sent dozens and dozens of samples through the US Mail to confirm performance.  We have come a long way from last summer's prototype but we still hand assemble all the VoiceMailers you are about to receive.  And we make it easy to use - it's one button, there is no computer required, the packaging is protected against accidental re-recording, and the envelopes are pre-stamped.  You just record, seal, and mail.\n",
      "What do you get?  You get to hear your camper's voice this summer.  You hear about the games, the friends, and the fun.  And they can hear you.  Yes, there is still a space to write.  But don't you want to listen?\n",

We know and honor that at Women Writing for (a) Change Jacksonville.  We exist for one purpose: to help women live more conscious lives through the art of writing and the practices of community.  We lift the expression of the feminine in all its forms: words, art, music, and use them to help create more conscious, connected communities.\n",
      " Our goal is to provide safe spaces for women to come together and share the truth about their lives.  The somber fact is that, even today, women's voices are silenced, their roles stereotyped, their truths denied.  Truth: Historians estimate that out of all documented history, only 0.5 percent represents women’s voices.  Women in all forms of media are greatly underrepresented. And in today’s art world, groups like the Guerilla Girls have pointed out that representation in our national museums is at a shockingly low level: less than 10 percent in many of them. This is beginning to change: entire museums are closing down to rectify this situation, and reopening with a new, broader perspective. \n",
      "We are a part of that growing movement, starting in our own backyard. With the publication of (a) river rising, we are a tributary in a river of powerful feminine voices rising and creating waves of change around the world.  This publication of women’s stories, words, and art is part of the solution, a missing component of what the world needs. It’s a beautiful gift of truth-telling that we hope will inspire others to share their truth and help rewrite the story of the world.  By supporting us, you are taking action to support this movement.\n",
      "These stories—of love and pain, loss and joy, regret and longing—are universal to people everywhere, and capture our very human experience.  Everyone, of all ages, genders, life experiences, can benefit from reading these stories and relating them to their own lives.  We hope they will! \n",
      "We've already gone to print! (We had a deadline!) After six months of intense editing and design work (plus five years of writing in this community!) the book is at the printer—and the bill will be due shortly! We had a deadline: an invitation to launch the book at the Jax By Jax Literary Arts Festival on Nov. 16  in downtown Jacksonville. It’s been all hands on deck to get it printed so we could deliver in time, but now we’ve got a finished product and the world at our fingertips. We hope that with the public’s support, this project will be sustainable not only today but annually. (Next edition planned: BIRDS and BLOOMS!)\n",
      "We are so proud of what we have created! Beginning with the cover art by Lana Shuttleworth, this beautiful velvet-touch soft-cover book is filled with the art and words of 57 writers and 29 artists. To give you an idea, here’s the cover:\n",
      "Beyond the cover, this book includes words that will touch your heart. We want to share these words with the world, and we hope you’ll help make that possible!\n",
      "Maybe you're wondering, how did all this happen? How did we get to NOW? Here's a five-year countdown, with words and art from the Anthology interspersed.\n",
      "January 2014: Our first writing circle as a newly licensed affiliate of Women Writing for (a) Change.  We started with seven women around a dining room table and grew to hundreds of women (and a few others) over the next five years.  \n",
      "September 2014: Our first writing circles with incarcerated women in Jacksonville. Since then, we've served hundreds of justice-involved women in Jacksonville and produced several (private) anthologies for them, which they find powerful.  It amazing them to see their words in print—and inspires them.\n",
      "June 2015: We moved to our new location in historic Riverside and began holding  community events, featuring women's art, and investing in local community issues, using words and writing to bring our mission to life in our community, like writing circles with the UNF Women's Center, the Women's Center of Jacksonville, Mayo Clinic, Rethreaded, Generation W, the Jacksonville Public Library, the Historic Preservation Society, the Dolores Barr Weaver Policy Institute for Girls, and many, many more.\n",
      "Fall 2016: We began our formal women's art program with the Art of Memoir Exhibition, followed by Truthtellers in the spring.  \n",
      "Fall 2018: We formed a 501(c)(3) non-profit to better support our outreach programs and began producing art-inspired journals to support our programs. We wanted to ensure that our programs would be widely accessible to a more diverse audience.  We affirmed our mission to serve women primarily, but not exclusively, and not just cis-gendered women. We launched our Fall art show, RISE, followed by SHINE in the spring.\n",
      "Spring 2019: We held our first editorial team writing circle with a diverse group of women of various ages, life experiences, and ethnic backgrounds, striving for a more inclusive approach to our selection process. Given the traditional barriers to publishing for many women, we decided upon the radically inclusive idea that any writer or artist who had participated in our programs could submit up to three pieces for consideration, and that at least one would be chosen, based on its application to the theme.  \n",
      "Summer 2019: We began an intense selection and editing process, using our writing practices to guide our meetings and keeping our writers in charge of their own voices as we edited.\n",
      "Fall 2019: Starting in September, we began the enormous task of creating a start-up publication from scratch, selecting the cover art and using an inclusive, interactive feedback process to gather input from the team on font and style choices.\n",
      "Nov. 11, 2019: Final approval of the print master for production at our local printers. General collapse. Cheers. Standing ovations. Much-needed sleep.  And then...the Kickstarter launch!  How will we pay for this damn thing? We crossed our fingers and turned toward the community. \n",
      "We think you'll like our rewards because they fit with our theme of sharing these words with others in the community and, in effect, helping to create more community.  We focused more on experiences  than \"stuff\" and considered the needs of others who might need to hear these voices. Donor gifts include giving a blank writing journal to a woman currently incarcerated or gifting an outreach writing circle to an organization or group of your choice.  We also cannot wait to treat qualifying donors to a VIP reading event!\n",
      "We are immensely grateful for any and all support levels!\n",

      "Um, yeah.  This was a gamble because we've already gone to print!  We had to in order to deliver the anthologies to our writers, artists, and community members at the once-a-year JAxByJax Literary and Arts Festival!  We didn't want to start our Kickstarter either until we KNEW we could make the deadline. So, here we are.  We need $4000+ to pay the printer, $2,500 to pay the professionals on our team and another $2,500 to pay for our website and other infrastructure. Nail-biting is ongoing!\n",

      "Our project has received the honor of being selected for a BRIClab residency this November, Native American Heritage Month, to develop and present a work-in-progress showing of Morgaine Gooding-Silverwood's newest play, sleeper, featuring movement direction by Raquel Chavez alongside traditional Chickasaw stomp dance. Together, Raquel and Mo will be enlisting a team of queer and BIPOC artists to bring this exhausted tale to life.\n",
      "Our play follows Sleeper, a millennial archetype of an every-person, who from a self-imposed, bedridden exile ponders the imperative of a lived existence. Why wake up? What, or who, do we rise for? Throughout what should be a nap, sleeper debates a shape-shifting cast of characters, both familiar and foreign, as they grapple with trauma, loneliness, identity and self doubt. Will our Sleeper ever escape (or accept) their somnolence? Can they draw back the curtains and let in the light? Ultimately, the key to Sleeper’s liberation hinges on a phone call from their mother and a return to their indigenous roots, where dreams have the power to unlock the relationship between parent and child, descendant and ancestor, body and earth.  From the moment of birth until our last waking breath — and beyond — humanity’s relationship to sleep is eternal. It is a phenomenon full of complex contradictions; familiar and mysterious, active and passive, protracted and ephemeral. There are those who want to “hack” sleep and those who claim to need none at all. Those who embrace, or allow themselves to be embraced by sleep are perceived as indulgent. Others approach their nightly recharge with apathy; some feel outright disdain. And through it all sleep carries on, misunderstood and maligned, the unlimited resource we always want more of, but wish we needed less. sleeper is a play that seeks to engage our entrenched personal, political and historical beliefs around rest. Unfolding from a desire to quiet this discursive static, the play instead amplifies this noise and wraps itself inside it, like a warm blanket.\n",
      "With a generous award of $2500 from BRIC, we plan to be able cover half the cost of development. However, as theatre makers who are deeply invested in fair and equitable pay for artists, especially artists from marginalized backgrounds, we are asking for your help in raising a further $2500 in order to pay our actors and crew what their hard work is worth.\n",

      "Because this is a work-in-progress, it can be hard to understand how or why we are adamant about paying our artists.  Why can't we work for free if we are not actually producing a full-length show? As theater artists ourselves, we understand what it feels like to constantly be asked to work for free, or for less than we are worth. We are part of an industry that has a vested interest in paying creatives little to nothing, an exploitative practice that has gone on for far too long, making theater, both the creation and practice, accessible only to those with the right resources, funds, and connections.  This financial gatekeeping keeps artists from historically marginalized backgrounds out of the theater, and without a diverse theater community, whats the point of making theater at all? We, as artists, want to take part in widening access wherever possible.\n",

      "We launched This Week in Drugs in July 2015, thinking it would be a fun way to stay involved with the drug policy reform movement as alumni of Students for Sensible Drug Policy. While we knew there was an audience of drug nerds like ourselves out there, we weren't sure how big it was or if the show would ever take off.\n",
      "One year later, episodes of our podcast have been downloaded over 16,000 times. We've released 50 episodes featuring luminaries in the drug policy movement like Neill Franklin and Betty Aldworth, government officials, scientists, and student activists. Our team has grown to four, and we've had dozens of others contribute music, graphics, and other content. \n",
      "Released every Sunday, our weekly episodes now have an average of over 700 listeners, and our most-listened-to episode has 962 downloads (so far!). We're thrilled with the success of the show, and humbled by the warmth and dedication of our fans. \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "I took EVERYTHING I have learned from building thousands of pedals, from circuit design and tone to quality components, assembly methods, as well as the hidden costs in inventory management and distribution, and distilled it all into a new pedalboard friendly format I am calling the “Live Series”.\n",
      "I had three primary goals when designing the Live Series:\n",
      "QUALITY - The Live Series takes VFE Pedals already high standard for quality from our standard lineup and kicks it up a level by using a glass-reinforced substrate in the potentiometers and hand-wired Switchcraft audio jacks. Read more about the component and construction quality of the Live Series in the “Components & Construction” section below.\n",
      "USABILITY - From the large, solid metal knobs to the simple, clean layout, the Live Series was designed to be as intuitive as possible. The goal is make each pedal easy enough to operate and dial in without the need for a manual (though one is included). Top-mounted jacks were chosen for quick & compact setup on a pedalboard, while the control layout and tapers were designed to make finding the perfect tone as easy as the twelve-bar blues.\n",
      "AFFORDABILITY - By using a direct-only model that is built in limited, unique runs, the Live Series cuts out all extra costs that are not related to product quality or tone. By using this method you, the player, save 25-40% (yes, you read that right) off what the standard distribution and inventory cost model would dictate.\n",
      "4 pedals will be available in the first run, but an additional pedal will become available at each of the $5K, $10K, and $15K backing levels. New paint colors will also be available at these backing levels.\n",
      "Looking for something different? I plan to develop many new Live Series pedals in 2016, but for the sake of this Kickstarter, I can convert most standard series VFE pedals into the Live Series format. Email me at peter@vfecustom.com to see if there is another pedal in the standard VFE lineup that you'd like to have made in the simpler, more affordable Live Series format.\n",
      "Please note that the shipment date will likely be in March/April for any conversion requests, and DIY requests will likely not include full documentation (just an unpolished schematic & parts list). All conversion requests must be approved by Peter via email.\n",
      "All Live Series pedals are built with the following components, construction methods, and unique features. All Live Series pedals are powered by the industry standard, 2.1mm pin, center-negative power supply (voltage range varies by pedal, but all will work on 9V). NO BATTERY POWER!\n",
      "Backers will get to choose from 6 enclosure colors and 6 knob colors...at first. 3 additional enclosure colors will be available at each of the $5K, $10K, and $15K backing levels.\n",
      "For the first time ever, I am offering both circuit boards and barebone DIY kits to Kickstarter backers. This is a test run to gauge interest in a regular DIY option for Live Series pedals when regular production begins.\n",
      "CIRCUIT BOARD ($15 level) - Your choice of one Live Series circuit board. Includes switching system micro controller (with DualMode switching), and downloadable .pdf document with detailed parts list, schematic and more.\n",
      "BAREBONE DIY KIT ($49 level) - Your choice of one Live Series barebone DIY pedal kit. Barebone DIY kits do Include the enclosure (your choice of color), circuit board, Carling footswitch, pots, knobs (your choice of color), jacks, LED (your choice of color), LED bezel, switching system micro controller (with DualMode switching), and downloadable .pdf document with detailed parts list, schematic and more. These pedal kits DO NOT INCLUDE the small, inexpensive circuit components or a graphic print. \n",
      "BTDR-3H REVERB BRICK ($17 extra) - Add a BTDR-3H reverb brick to your Ravine delay + reverb barebone kit or PCB at the $32 or $66 levels.\n",
      "Technical support is not offered beyond the documents provided for DIY builders. If you have never built a DIY kit before, I recommend purchasing the pedal fully assembled. If you are unable to successfully build the pedal, I won't be able to help! \n",
      "All DIY kits can be returned for a $25 credit towards a purchase of any VFE product - even if the kit is returned partially or fully assembled.\n",
      "While there are no demo videos out yet for the new Live Series pedals, there are many demos of the standard series pedals that the first set of Live Series pedals is derived from. For this Kickstarter campaign, all pedals available will be derived from a standard series pedal - so you can have a reference point for the tone of each Live Series pedal offered here.\n",

      "RISE & FALL - Derived from the Old School vintage tremolo\n",

      "The primary goal of this campaign is expand the Live Series pedal lineup  through a crowdfunding campaign. Once we reach the initial $2500 level, I will give more specific information about the stretch goals to expand and improve the Live Series.\n",
      "Here are is a summary of the stretch goals:\n",
      "In the video below, I answer these 5 questions...unscripted...so it's kinda long (15 minutes). Enjoy!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Because the pedals in this project are derived from previously established products, the biggest design challenges have already been addressed, and key parts are already on order. So the only real challenge is to meet the promised deadlines for shipping backer rewards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is are some possible scenarios that could delay the shipment of your reward:\n",
      "#1 - Parts do not arrive on time. In particular, the Vimex pots are not scheduled to arrive until early January. If this order is delayed, which is possible due to the high demand on the manufacturer leading up to the Chinese New Year, production will be delayed accordingly. If this happens, backers will have a choice on whether to receive their rewards on time with Alpha pots or wait for the glass-reinforced Vimex pots.\n",
      "#2 - Orders of my other products exceed my production capacity, which may slow down overall production. My production schedule priority will go to filling backer rewards, so even if this does happen, it should not cause a lengthy delay.\n",
      "#3 - January is the first month that my wife returns to work after a few months of maternity leave. The adjustment to a new daily rhythm and schedule may reduce my time in the shop, slowing down production.\n",

      "The age of human segregation has been long forgotten. Living in a system that is one in the same, humans have bred into becoming one race. Countries no longer oppose one another, everything being mingled into one unit. Not having warfare to focus on, humans mindlessly feed all of their focus into the media, giving society a false perception of life. Society's view of self-worth is only defined by how a human can serve the entertainment industry. Those that are not considered genetically gifted are labeled as useless & invaluable. Invaluable enough that they are forced to sacrifice their body parts to creatures (who have lost arms and legs due to chemical testing) for they can replace their roles within the entertainment industry. \n",
      "In one of the most important settings in the story, characters must compete in a strategic competition that involves them being in vehicles. The competition does not involve racing, the vehicles just enable the drivers to maneuver on the playing field. Each character has their own signature vehicle. Whenever ONE of the Character Illustration rewards is purchased, the backer will automatically get their own signature car for their character(s). I will retrieve the information from you of how you would want the vehicle to look.\n",
      " \"Insidious Bliss\" is in the beginning stages of being turned into an online comic series. It will be a comic drawn in the style of manga...non-colored, heavy detailed shading, and the whole nine yards. The story is already completed on paper, as I can promise its filled with powerful messaging, conflicting characters, and a story that never fails to deliver suspense. However, time and money are one in the same, leaving me to need a few backup artists to help me complete the first volume in a timely manner. Although this comic is extremely important to me, college and working to keep the lights on can take up a lot of time. I'm mainly launching this campaign to hire a back up artist, where the two of us can work on chapters simultaneously, releasing content on a consistent basis. The co-author will receive $15.00 for each page drawn. Any donation would be much appreciated, as I thank anyone who would even consider helping out.  \n",

If your character speaks a certain way, or has certain weaknesses you would want me to incorporate in the comic, make sure to send me an email regarding those matters.

Not only was I working in the very same studio as so many of my influences growing up, but I was using the same equipment and players that created the music that sculpted me into the musician that I am today. I received so much encouragement and validation from the people I worked with down there, that I cannot pass on the idea of furthering the experience!

African-Americans fight for their rights, as do women, and we’ve had both good and bad presidents. But what is America? America is an expanding place that is always innovating and changing, aims for equal opportunities for people, and is an overall safe place to be.

      "At the Astral Waters Review, we seek to amplify the voices of those who have been marginalized in genre writing. Historically, the realms of science fiction and fantasy have been dominated by a single overwhelming categorization of people.\n",
      "But now is the time for change.  \n",
      "In genres that seek to create new worlds, new voices must be heard. Female voices, nonbinary voices, voices of color, and LGBTQ+ voices. The voices of the underrepresented, the discriminated, the marginalized, the oppressed: here they will find a haven to dream, to create, and to inspire in realms of creativity that know no limits.\n",
      "Be bold. Be powerful. Be fantastic. \n",

      "WHAT WE'RE PLANNING:\n",
      "- 5-7 creative writing pieces per genre (10-14 total, including short stories, novel excerpts, and poetry) \n",
      "- 3-4 art pieces per genre (6-8 total) \n",
      "- 3-4 book reviews per genre (6-8 total)\n",
      "- 3-4 pages of related advertisements (publishers, author readings, agents, art galleries/shows, book releases, etc.)\n",
      "- Full color, high-quality digital display\n",
      "- Between 80 and 120 pages, depending on the length of our submissions\n",

My name is Lisamarie and I created Scatterbrain in 2011, after a life changing cancer diagnosis, that led me to discover my love for sewing as therapy through my chemo treatments. I have a whole line of silly characters named 'octopals', a super snuggly sloth named Sully, and a whole family of bat buddies that double as finger puppets & wristlets! I have a full line of products with my illustrations and an ever growing character base to share with all of you!\n",

      "We have successfully ran one kickstarter already, 2 years ago, to manufacture our very first trio of octopals! Since then, we have found a brand new manufacturing company that has made our toys even BETTER but plush toy manufacturing is quite expensive, and we desperately need to restock our octopals, so Kickstarter is the perfect platform to help us reach our manufacturing goals without going completely bankrupt! And it allows us to share our excitement with all of YOU & to gauge what characters you want to see more of! \n",

      "However, I overestimated HOW much LOVE she would receive and I quickly realized that I cannot hand make 200+ toys in this line in the future, so AMELIA will be my 1st Manufactured Women Empowerment Line Octopal, and a PERMANENT character!

For the second part of the podcast they are joined by a comedian or TV insider/lover to discuss the pilot episode of a brand new series. Pilot Co-Pilots! is not only relevant and timely, but also gives insight into the making of some of our favorite TV shows.\n",

OJ Simpson (FX), Animals and Vinyl (HBO), Shondaland's newest show The Catch (ABC), and of course Fuller House (Netflix)...we're excited.\n",

On TV she has been seen as a recurring character on Crisis and Chicago Fire on NBC, and commercials for McDonald’s, Dairy Queen, Auto-Owner’s Insurance, NFL Women’s Apparel, Ohio Lottery and Busch Gardens. Maya also does voiceover work and teaches acting and audition technique for kids and teens.\n",

      "We came up with the idea for the podcast in May of 2015 and so far we've been very lucky contacting potential guests, though scheduling is always an issue.  Being based in Chicago while many of our guests are in NYC or LA we will have to travel a bit and interviewing in other cities will require us to rent some spaces for recording as opposed to doing it at home, which costs money. Ultimately this will produce nice sound quality, though, which is important to us!  Our goal is to continue to get interesting, entertaining guests while being convenient for them! We're also willing to accept airline miles as donations...\n",

The only ones who can save the place from itself are daring bounty hunter Harriet Barber, her friends, and Jack O'Malley: the town's uncertain, untrained, and utterly unwilling new guardian. \n",
      "They may have everything they need to save the day, but when you're fighting monsters of your own making, your own worst enemy may be yourself...\n",
      "Widdershins is a series of light-hearted Victorian-era adventure stories set in West Yorkshire, England. It's been running as a webcomic for nearly seven years, and you can read the whole comic online, for free, starting here! Volume seven wraps up a long-running arc, bringing many of the comic's main plots to a satisfying close as the casts from previous volumes finally come together to take on all seven deadly sins at once.\n",
      "This project is to fund Widdershins Volume Seven: Curtain Call, which will be a full-colour, A5 landscape softcover, completing the Deadly Sins arc. This story is much longer than the others, around 234 pages in total, packed with resolutions for stories and characters from previous books. All of the art is already finished, I just need the money to send it to the printer!\n",
      "\n",

      "If you're new to the series, or just have a few volumes missing from your Widdershins collection, there are several reward tiers that include any of the six previous books.

      "Can't see a tier that includes everything you'd like? Just message me and we'll arrange it!\n",
      "All of the money raised will go towards printing the book, packaging it up and shipping it out! Any leftover funds will go directly into the comic, such as keeping previous volumes in print, or helping me to bring Widdershins to new conventions. \n",
      "We already met the goal for spot gloss on the cover! Hooray! At £15k, I'll be able to reprint Widdershins Vol 4 and include spot gloss on the cover of that for the first time! This means folks getting the full set will get a full shiny version, which would be pretty neat, and the reprint would just help me immensely in general!\n",

      "At £20k I'll add 4 pages of book-exclusive extras to Vol 7- A Tourist's Guide to Widdershins! This would be included in the PDF version.\n",

You can follow me on Twitter for any project updates, notifications of new webcomic pages, and pictures of aforementioned fat cats. \n",

On the other hand, it would require a significant increase in our existing readership to pull it off.\n",

Your pledges will ensure that we can pay our designers, Regular Practice, for their original work, and cover the costs of printing and shipping. As well as this, with Tinted Window, we are hoping to produce a journal we would like to write for ourselves.

As such, with your contributions we will pay our contributors for their unique work. \n",

Het boek staat daarnaast boordevol wetenschappelijk onderbouwde weetjes en prachtige foto’s, waardoor het boek niet alleen informatief, maar ook visueel gezien, een prachtig plaatje wordt.\n",

A band on tour trying to make it big. \n",
      "This is a show about being a part of something larger than yourself. Welcome aboard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Season 1 will explore a bandwagon that has taken the nation by storm – The Bernie Sanders campaign. Bernie’s a longtime senator from Vermont. He’s always been known to be a progressive voice. But he’s from a state with the most cows per capita. So nationally he’s had a somewhat limited reach. But after announcing a presidential bid he transformed rapidly from huffy Vermont Senator to the leader of a political revolution. And now he’s overfilling arenas coast-to-coast. \n",
      " Bernie might not win the nomination. Or maybe he will. You might agree with his politics. Or maybe you don’t. Disclaimer: I do agree with most of his politics. But this show is not about those things. That’s not the point. The point is that he’s gone from unknown to everywhere. He’s created a bandwagon and struck a major chord with the American people. So I want to know – who are these people? What are their stories?\n",
      " It doesn’t matter our age, we all define ourselves by how we choose to associate – from being a deadhead or a Red Sox fan to being an environmentalist – these things mean something about who we are as people. Participating in these communities, these bandwagons, satisfies a craving: the need to feel like we’re a part of something – like we belong. I’m fascinated by this phenomenon. And being a radio producer, the next logical step was to make a podcast about it. So...here we are.\n",
      "The season will continue until March 1st, 2016 - that's Super Tuesday, the day on which the most states hold their primary elections. I have no idea where Bernie will stand at this point – and it doesn't matter. The idea is to follow the trajectory of his campaign through stories about his followers. I will release 1 episode each month. \n",
      "Good question. Here's a breakdown of my budget:\n",
      "Important: Most of these are one-time costs. If funded, Bandwagon will be in great shape to move forward not just with season 1 but with more seasons down the road.\n",

      "We're a group of graduate students at the University of Toronto trying to revitalize the English Department's creative writing journal. With our proposed funding, we'll create a new and improved physical journal after taking last year off. We're open to as many different and diverse voices as possible, as well as being committed to guaranteeing fair representation. Every bit of support for our Kickstarter will go directly into Echolocation - first in covering and guaranteeing the print run for the journal, and then further increasing what we can pay our artists, writers, and creators. We want to adequately pay for creative labour, and this project is a first step in that direction. We know how difficult it is to create, and want to thank all the artists who take a chance with our journal. \n",
      "Conversely, we want to thank you! Even if you only read through our project, or stop by and offer kind words of support, we know readers are the second pillar in a successful journal. We want to build an inclusive and wide-ranging literary community behind Echolocation - presenting our project in this forum is the best way to attract eyes (and possibly contributors) that otherwise wouldn't see the work we do in our corner of the literary sandbox. \n",
      "Regardless of whether you can give 5$ or 500$, know that we are grateful for any and all contributions and promise to use an funds past our goal to better compensate artists and writers. Again, thanks for considering and supporting Echolocation! \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Our major challenges will stem from the actual production of physical copy of the journal. We have already solicited several submissions for this edition of Echolocation, and have a healthy pile of submissions to read. The actual literary material will, luckily, not be hard to find. Where we may be slowed down are in the design aspects of journal - hence, we've posted a tentative production deadline of April 2018. Depending on how we reach our fundraising goals, we may be able to release in early April.\n",

      "THE SHADOW BOOTH: VOL. 1 is now fully funded! This means that is will be released this December, as a mass market paperback. If you haven't already done so, pre-order your copy now for December delivery!\n",
      "Also, we've reached our first stretch goal! VOL. 1 now includes a brand new story by Alison Moore, 'The Stone Dead'. We've added it to the Table of Contents below - making it a round 13 stories for our first issue!\n",
      "A QUICK NOTE REGARDING THE EBOOK: We added this at a late stage, so we weren't able to add details to all the reward levels. However, EVERYONE who orders a copy of the paperback will receive an option of an ebook as well, free of charge, in the questionnaire once funding is finished. We don't believe in making you pay twice!\n",
      "When Eliot first spies the booth at the end of the pier, he wonders what it is. The canvas is faded, the striped pattern barely visible beneath years of dirt. The wooden boards are stained and scratched. It’s the crude, handwritten sign that draws him closer, makes him reach out to pull the curtain aside. Enter the Shadow Booth, it says, and you will never be the same again.\n",
      "The Shadow Booth is a new journal of weird and eerie fiction, edited by Dan Coxon (Winner: Best Anthology – Saboteur Awards 2016) and published as a 200-page mass market paperback. Drawing its inspiration from the likes of Thomas Ligotti and Robert Aickman, as well as H. P. Lovecraft and Arthur Machen, The Shadow Booth explores that dark, murky territory between mainstream horror and literary fiction. From folk horror to alien gods, the journal aims to give voice to the strange and the unsettling in all its forms.\n",
      "We've reached full funding with over a week to spare! Because of this, we're aiming higher. \n",
      "If we raise £3,000 - we'll add a new story by Alison Moore to Volume 1 - ADDED!If we raise £3,500 - we add another story by a mystery author!\n",
      "We're working on exact details of the second story to be added, and will update you as soon as we have the details. For now, rest assured that more money means more fiction!\n",
      "We've also added a new reward (on the right) so that you can pre-order Volumes 1 & 2 together. Volume 1 will be mailed out in December, Volume 2 is expected summer 2018. Remember: if you've already backed us, you can always increase your pledge!\n",
      "One of the aims of the journal is to reward the people who really deserve it - the writers. Yes, there are other costs involved in producing and distributing any book or magazine, but it's our belief that these should be outweighed by the authors' right to get paid for their work. It's one of the reasons we're crowdfunding - to ensure that the authors of these wonderful stories receive reasonable payment. Paid markets are becoming increasingly rare and it's a trend that we'd like to see reversed.\n",
      "We have factored in the costs involved in printing, layout, proofreading, distribution and the production of the other rewards, and approximately half the £2500 target will be going direct to the writers. That means that if you buy a copy for £10, somewhere in the region of £5 will go to the writers to reward them for their work. Now, doesn't that sound fair?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully you've already read the work of some of the writers involved, but in case you haven't, here's some of the talent we have lined up:\n",
      "Paul Tremblay is the author of Disappearance at Devil’s Rock, the Bram Stoker Award winning A Head Full of Ghosts, The Little Sleep, and the forthcoming The Cabin at the End of the World. He is currently a member of the board of directors of the Shirley Jackson Awards, and his essays and short fiction have appeared in the Los Angeles Times and numerous “year’s best” anthologies.\n",
      "Richard Thomas is the award-winning author of three novels, three short story collections, 135+\n",
      "stories in print, and the editor of four anthologies.\n",
      "Gary Budden's work has appeared in Black Static, Unthology, Year’s Best Weird Fiction, The Lonely Crowd and many more. He was shortlisted for the 2015 London Short Story Award, and his story ‘Greenteeth’ was nominated for a 2017 British Fantasy Award and adapted into a short film by the filmmaker Adam Scovell. \n",
      "Malcolm Devlin's stories have appeared in Black Static, Interzone, Nightscript and Shadows and Tall Trees. His collection, You Will Grow Into Them, is published by Unsung Stories. \n",
      "Annie Neugebauer has work appearing and forthcoming in more than a hundred publications, including magazines such as Cemetery Dance, Apex and Black Static, as well as anthologies such as Bram Stoker Award finalist The Beauty of Death and #1 Amazon bestseller Killing It Softly. \n",
      "Richard V. Hirst is the co-author of The Night Visitors (with Jenn Ashworth), a novella told entirely via an exchange of emails, and Bus Station: Unbound, a choose-your-own-adventure-style novel set in Preston Bus Station. His work has been published in the Big Issue, Time Out and the Guardian amongst others.\n",
      "...and that's just scraping the surface. Having read the stories, we can confirm that they're all amazing. \n",
      "Dan Coxon is an award-winning editor, author, copy-editor and proofreader. In 2016 he won Best Anthology at the Saboteur Awards, for Being Dad: Short Stories About Fatherhood. He runs his own editorial company, Momus Editorial, and has worked for numerous publishers and authors in the past, including Urbane Publications, Unsung Stories, Influx Press and Dodo Ink. He is also a Contributing Editor at The Lonely Crowd, and has previously edited Litro magazine.\n",
      "His own writing has appeared under his own name and under a pen name, in publications that include Black Static, Unthology, Unsung Stories, The Lonely Crowd, Popshot, STORGY and The Year's Best Body Horror.\n",

      " \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "There shouldn't be many risks still associated with this project. The stories are already selected, and have all been handed in - so that lineup is final. The printing company is on standby. The design/layout team are ready to go. We just need the money to make it work.\n",
      "\n",
      "As has already been said, around half the target money will go to the authors, so you know that you're helping support the people who deserve it most. The rest of the money will cover layout, proofreading, printing, postage, as well as all the other goodies we're offering - the postcards, T-shirts, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Delivery is expected to be December 2017. We see no reason why we can't achieve that - barring an act of God, the rewards should be with you before Christmas.\n",

Av tävlingens bästa bidrag vill vi skapa en kokbok under samma namn för att kunna inspirera till grön matlagning samt ge allmänheten möjlighet till att ta del av de berättelser som kommer att skapas via Plantable Cooking Contest i höst. \n",
      "Vi vill att vår kokbok ska handla om mer än bara recept. Bakom varje recept finns det historier, känslor & upplevelser som tävlingens kockar vill dela med sig  av.\n",
      "Kokboken kommer att innehålla de bästa recepten från tävlingen. Vi räknar med att kunna samla ca 50 recept där vi presenterar både maträtter och personerna bakom recepten. \n",
      "Vi vill också att ni får inblick i arbetet bakom tävlingen. Finalen kommer att få ett eget kapitel i boken där ni får träffa finalisterna och följa kampen om att bli Sveriges bästa vegokock. \n",
      "Arbetet med boken påbörjas efter att finalisterna till tävlingen presenteras den 1:a augusti 2018. En panel från Vegetariska Kockars Förening kommer att välja de bästa recepten som har inkommit till tävlingen. \n",
      "Under finalen tar vi hjälp av en fotograf för att dokumentera hela förloppet. Efter finalen, under november 2018, jobbar vi med för att färdigställa recepten från finalen samt ingresserna & texterna. En matfotograf som plåtar maträtterna i studiomiljö kommer att ske parallellt under denna period. \n",
      "Materialet kommer sedan att bearbetas av en professionell formgivare för att skapa en vacker och tidlös kokbok. Arbetet med formgivningen påbörjas under november 2018. \n",
      "Boken ska printas i Sverige för att uppnå ett så klimatneutralt tryck som möjligt. Boken planeras vara klar för leverans i januari 2019.\n",
      "Det lider ingen brist i Sverige idag på mattävlingar professionella kockar såväl som för hemmakockar. Under tävlingen bedöms oftast kockarna, tävlingsmomenten och maten som presenteras. När tävlingen sedan är över får dock oftast kocken all uppmärksamhet. Själva maten under tävlingen faller dock lätt i glömska.\n",
      "En av de viktigaste målen med Plantable Cooking Contest är att driva på utvecklingen av det växtbaserade köket. Vi strävar efter att skapa ett forum för matlagare som vill skapa modern innovativ växtbaserad mat. Vi vill att maten som tillagas under tävlingen ska inspirera både kockar och allmänheten till nya idéer som i sin tur driver utvecklingen framåt. Vi hoppas att Plantable Cooking Contest ska vara mer än bara ett evenemang under en dag på året. Målet är att tävlingen erbjuder en plattform för diskussion, inspiration och utveckling året om. \n",
      "Som en del i detta arbete vill vi tillsammans med er publicera en kokbok som samlar de bästa recepten från Plantable Cooking Contest. Vi tror att det är det bästa sättet att sätta maten i centrum, bevara resultaten av tävlingen och uppfylla vårt syfte med att sprida inspiration och skapa nya idéer. \n",
      "Bakom Plantable Cooking Contest står Vegetariska Kockars Förening. Föreningen stiftades i slutet av 2015 med syfte att hjälpa restaurangbranschen att bli bättre på att erbjuda växtbaserad mat till sina gäster.

      "AxiomAir represents a revolution in wireless audio reproduction!  It has all the features of Bluetooth and WiFi combined in one sound system without the problems of either:\n",
      "Because the AxiomAir is manufactured in our factory in Canada, we can create an almost endless variety of finishes to suit your decor. The body of the AxiomAir comes in two stock finishes: black on black, or white on white. Then customize the lid in wood grain, a solid color, or even a picture of your favourite person, place or thing – the choice really is yours! You can even have the entire speaker painted to match your favourite colour or room decor. The lids are also all interchangeable later so you can update your look anytime you like.\n",
      "We've literally spent over 35 years researching sound and how to get the highest possible output from the smallest possible footprint. This research infuses every aspect of the AxiomAir.\n",
      "What does 150 watts of continuous output really mean?  Continuous power is how much power is available to the speaker all the time.  A lot of companies only list their peak power output – the level that can be attained for only fractions of a second.  The peak power rating is generally 5 times the continuous power rating.  So 150 watts of continuous output means the power to listen loud without distortion, the power to have an outdoor party, and the power to let the full dynamics of the music reach your soul.\n",
      "Bluetooth® is made to transmit voice from your headset to your phone - not to carry full-spectrum high-resolution sound. Using a Wi-Fi® network instead means you've got three times the usable range of Bluetooth®, you can play high resolution audio without compression, you can have more than one user at a time, and you can have them all over your home controlled from any device on your network (together or individually).\n",
      " \n",
      "AxiomAir can be added to your home network so that it's always available to play music in the house. What if you want to take out on the lawn though, and your network doesn't reach? No problem. AxiomAir broadcasts its own network for you to connect to, giving you the freedom of Bluetooth® without any of the compromises. Just join the AxiomAir hotspot and your phone or tablet can access the user interface. It's a mobile music hotspot.\n",
      "If you've got a separate hard drive on your network with your high-resolution music files, you can easily access that hard drive from your AxiomAir with just a few clicks. Use the interface to easily add more devices to your AxiomAir network.\n",
      "Drag and drop different songs onto your playlists – and drag and drop speakers into different groups that can all play the same music at the same time. Keep the party going from room to room.\n",
      "The user interface was designed to be a convenient way to play any song in your user library, across as many AxiomAirs as you have in your home. Play in just one room or across all the AxiomAir-enabled rooms in your home.\n",
      "We chose the Raspberry Pi – a micro-computer about the size of a credit card – as the 'brains' behind the speaker, and we chose to make the Linux-based operating system open source. What that means is that any developer can write an app for the Raspberry Pi. If we create new features from our end, you can easily update your AxiomAir by clicking the 'Update' button on the user interface.\n",
      "Add the optional Karaoke module with our proprietary feedback-killing circuitry and two microphone inputs. AxiomAir becomes your Karaoke machine, with music volume, microphone volume, and echo level all controlled from the user interface. \n",
      "Give presentations that sound better than anyone else's. No really – the Karaoke module also works for presentations, so your AxiomAir becomes a portable sound system that will broadcast your voice with crystal clarity and no feedback even in rooms with hundreds of people.\n",
      "If high-end audio can be portable, why not high-end video too? Create a movie-theater-to-go by attaching a mini projector to AxiomAir (sold separately.) You can share movies in the backyard, in the bedroom or at the beach. Use a ChromeCast® or Apple TV® to send movies wirelessly to the projector.\n",
      "If you were to purchase a high-quality Digital-to-Analog-Converter (DAC), a 150-watt amplifier, the Axiom M3 speakers, a raspberry pi, and the power supply it would cost more than $1,400!  By backing the AxiomAir you can have it for just $475 when you are one of the first 200 contributors.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Portable devices have improved practically in every way except one – sound quality. It’s a question of as to how the listener hears the sound of their music or audio books through their headphones. The multinational companies are as decisive as to how perfect their processors are, or the high definition provided by the screen. Further they talk about how powerful the OS is accompanying which is the Lightweight and Sleek Dimensions.\n",
      " It doesn’t matter if you purchase a top-of-the-line headset, if the sound entering into those headphones is poor in the first place. \n",
      " \n",
      "Why is sound from your mobile device so poor (at least from the standard of an audiophile)? \n",
      "Audio files on your computer are like any other files – they are binary, 1s and 0s. It requires a “digital to analog/audio” converter (otherwise known as DAC) to turn those files into sound that you can hear.\n",
      "Portable device manufacturers (smartphones, tablets, laptops) use the most basic, internal DACs possible, because DACs drain the device’s battery. \n",
      "So, while headphones have improved, that improvement does you no good if you use them through the headphone jack/DAC of your device. That’s why OnBlink has created the OnBlink Mini Amplifier and the OnBlink Plus Digital to Analog (DAC) Converter and Amplifier. \n",
      "The OnBlink Mini Amplifier and the OnBlink Plus has to be plugged into the headphone jack of your device. The Amplifier will amp up the sound to a great extent. The OnBlink Plus Digital to Analog (DAC) converter will deliver amazing sound quality that you just don’t hear from the device’s internal DAC.\n",
      " The size of your headphones dictates, to some extent, whether an amp may be needed. Most earbuds and in-ear headphones are typically very efficient and are less likely to have any benefits from an amp. Larger headphones, on the other hand, will benefit, or even require, a headphone amp to reach audible volume levels with portable players.\n",
      " We have created a supply unit which can split output power far more stably in headphones. Other amplifier divide the power when connected with 2 headphones, but we designed 2 power lines to both the output jack which helps OnBlink mini and OnBlink plus to achieve incredible level of performance even when both the headphones are connected. Large size amp which are used for concerts have been using such technology from years, but this is the first time such a technology is introduced in such a portable size. This technology helps to run both the headphones of their maximum ohm.\n",
      " Onblink plus uses the same outer body like many other amplifier in the market and there is a reason for that. That uni-body design helps to completely seal the chip of the DAC+AMP which does not interferes with portable device antenna. We noticed a sound interferance and disturbance in headphone before every incoming calls, that sound was the DAC getting affected by the portable device antenna. Hence we decide to use a uni-body design which completely isolates the chips from the reductions of the antenna. Few other reason pushed us to use the design was its compactness, durability and elegancy. This design also fits in our size of Advanced circuit and has ample of space to fit in a huge Lithium-ion batteries. This outer body which is readily available also brings down the cost exceedingly thus reducing the production delay altogether.\n",
      "Other companies only have AMP in such a small and compact size. As we used Advanced circuit design using the latest IC technology, we could fit both the DAC and AMP in Onblink Plus. This has completely changed the Audio industry and has exceedingly enhanced your hearing experience. We have invested 2 years just to refine Onblink plus.\n",
      "Onblink is the world’s smallest AMP + splitter, we have created a custom circuit for maximum performance, this changes the complete audio output circuits. We have successfully placed an audio chip TI OPA 1612 in such a small chamber. This technology would be hard for counterfeiter to even try. This took us a lot of time and resources to produce the Onblink mini which is a completely new design.\n",

Diego agrees to be her coach and manager, and as June rises up through the underground filing ranks, the two begin to fall for each other. But do they really have a shot, or are they just fooling themselves?\n",

We had so much fun making the first one, Cement Suitcase, in and around Tri-Cities and Yakima, that I knew we had to come back to film the next one. And we were lucky - a lot of our cast and crew from the first film came back this past February and March to film for 18 days and make it all happen! \n",

      "Our biggest challenge now is getting the movie completed and seen by as many people as possible. This can be overcome by clever and persistent promotion, generating buzz via social media, building a fan base, and getting the movie out on the festival circuit. We have already enjoyed a lot of early press and social recognition during filming in WA state, and have fed the momentum by sharing clips, stills and behind the scenes interviews on our website and social media platforms. This Kickstarter campaign will help us move All Sorts onward and upward!\n",

      "After two years of preparation we are finally ready to move forward and begin shooting our latest project, \"Outside the Box\". All we need now is your help to raise the money needed to launch our production! \n",
      "Outside the Box is a dramatic comedy about a group of homeless characters who are trying to find their place in the world. We are setting out to capture a thirty minute block of content which we can then use as either a television pilot, or as four webisodes in a web series.\n",
      "Gabriel Auffant (left) is a highly accomplished director, having worked on a variety of projects such as short films, commercials, comedy sketches, and feature films. He has a heart for comedy and loves to bring others joy through his work. Gabriel also has a background in theatrical acting.\n",
      "Colton Bostick (right) is a dedicated cinematographer with a wide range of video production experience. He has been filming, and editing videos for over ten years. Fun fact: While Colton loves video work, he does not like salads.\n",
      "Christopher T. Lovett (center) is a talented and adept writer, having placed in four contests over the past ten years. His work includes (but is not limited to) screenplays, television pilots, monologues, multiple short films, and flash fiction. He is currently working on a novel.\n",
      "First, you can take a few minutes to share our kickstarter page with your friends and family. You can even share this page with people you don't know so well, everyone matters! \n",
      "Next, taking the time to share this link through email and on social media would help a lot. Spreading the word about our project to as many people as possible will greatly increase the chances of reaching our goal. \n",
      "Lastly (and perhaps most importantly!) every dollar you are willing to contribute will be greatly appreciated by our team. We are really excited about our list of rewards that we are offering in return for your contribution. Be sure to check out all of our different reward tiers to find out what looks best to you!\n",
      "No, everyone who contributes will only be charged after the kickstarter is complete and if we've reached our minimum goal.\n",
      "A background element to the premise of \"Outside the Box\" is that a research group has started a study on the homeless community. As part of their research, they provided each of our homeless characters with a camera so that they could record their thoughts at the end of each day. These video logs allow us to insert the inner thoughts of our main cast in the midst of any scene. In many cases, we use this technique to add a well-timed comedic element in the midst of whatever is going on at the time they are, \"Outside the Box\".  \n",
      "We want it to be clear: our goal is never to make fun of the homeless. We reviewed our script with beta readers and people connected with multiple homeless organizations to ensure that none of our humor comes across as insensitive or rude. Each person who has read our script says that it does not come across as disrespectful or demeaning to the homeless community, but rather, makes them relatable as real people with real thoughts, feelings, and inside jokes just like anyone else.\n",
      "In fact, one of our heart goals is to raise a positive awareness of the homeless. In future episodes, if we are blessed with the opportunity and the funding to make more, we plan to connect with more homeless organizations and even list them in the credits so that people have a place to go to give money and find volunteer opportunities to help the homeless. \n",

      "The biggest risk for any comedy is for people to actually find it funny. We all know that terrible feeling you get when you try to make a joke and no one laughs. That is why we've taken time over the last few years to make a vast number of comedy sketches. These projects taught us the many pitfalls and challenges that come with comedy. \n",
      "\n",
      "We've learned that the writing, an actor's performance, and comedic timing are all major influences on whether or not a joke is well received. That's why we've spent over a year working on our script, going through multiple re-writes and beta readers to ensure our script is full of both humor and depth. We fully believe that each actor that has joined our team will be able to deliver an outstanding performance for their character, and we will work hard, both on location and in the editing room, to best showcase their performances visually and through comedic timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge we face is going to be standing out amidst all of the other video content that can be found out there today. We know that we can settle for nothing less than complete excellence in every aspect of the show. A few things we feel we have in our favor is a very unique concept, a good script, and an outstanding cast.\n",

      "If successfully funded on Kickstarter, Anarchy Dreamers Volume 2 will be 144 full color pages long, containing issues 5, 6 and 7, ranging in length from 32 to 44 pages each. The book also includes 30 pages of exclusive bonus content including cast pages, fan art, world building, and a character Q&A. There will be 4 pages of guest comics staring Miho, Mateo, and Dimitri by Mandy Robertson!\n",

      "Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales was the publication that launched Atomic Overmind Press. Now, a decade later, Kenneth Hite and Atomic Overmind are ready to take you on a whole new tour through the world and works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. \n",
      "“Searchers after horror,” wrote H.P. Lovecraft, “haunt strange, far places.” Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations gives you a guidebook to those places, and to places still stranger and farther yet … places shudderingly close to home.\n",
      "Kenneth Hite guided readers through Lovecraft’s plots and themes in his earlier book Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales. Now, expanding on his “Lost in Lovecraft” essay series in Weird Tales magazine, he takes you on a sight-seeing tour of Lovecraft’s settings: from Arkham to Antarctica, and from New York City to Hyperspace. For Lovecraft the setting was everything, and his legendary locations still hold meanings and secrets for today’s readers. Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations drives the hidden routes connecting seemingly unrelated tales. It follows the tracks of Lovecraft’s predecessors and models, stops to get its bearings in the real world, then plunges back into mystery, deciphering and explaining the symbols and signs on the Master’s map.\n",
      "Kenneth Hite climbs the crags of Kingsport with you, and shines a light under the shadows over Innsmouth. Don’t stray far from the group in the Dreamlands, and while in Vermont, please keep your head and hands inside the bus. With Hite as your guide and Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations as your guidebook, you can’t get lost in Lovecraft even in the loneliest parts of the planet … unless you want to …\n",
      "So that's what Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations is all about. Now let's talk about the content. \n",
      "Modern Cthulhu Mythos master Nick Mamatas provides a Foreword to start the tour. As part of his \"Lost in Lovecraft\" series for Weird Tales magazine, Ken has already written 14 of the 19 essays that will comprise the basic version of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations. Those are: \n",
      "A further 5 essays are still to be written, but Ken already has them plotted out. They are: \n",
      "All of those essays together comprise the basic edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations. \n",
      "Just for backing, we'll give you the current text of Tour de Lovecraft: the Destinations, incorporating all fourteen of the currently-existing Kenneth Hite's \"Lost in Lovecraft\" essays from Weird Tales magazine — AND the digital first edition of Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales. You can find a link to both PDFs in the first backer-only update under the Updates tab on this page.\n",
      "After doing some thinking on the issue, Ken and I have decided on an addition to the reward tiers. If you are backing at Ward/Dexter or above, you will automatically receive the Digital Editions of both Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales and Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations. This applies to Ward, Dexter, Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, and, of course, Azathoth. \n",
      "Now on to the presentation formats. We're looking at four formats for the book to be delivered in, all of them featuring cover artwork by the esteemed artist Ivan Dixon. They are as follows. \n",
      "The Digital Editions of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations and Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales comprise a PDF version of the book's text, as well as epub and mobi formats. \n",
      "The standard, or Tourist, edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations will be an (at-least) 144 page hardcover book measuring approximately 5.25\" in width by 8.25\"in height. It will be cloth-bound, and feature a sewn binding and dust jacket. \n",
      "The Tourist Edition of Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales will feature the same dimensions and specifications. \n",

Additionally, each copy will be signed and numbered by Kenneth Hite. This edition will be limited to 75 copies. \n",
      "The Traveler Edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales will feature a green leatherette binding, and will also be limited to 75 copies. \n",
      "Now that we've unlocked Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales, we're adding a new edition to the campaign, the Twin Travellers edition. As with the Traveller Edition, this set of both Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations and Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales will feature an leatherette binding, this time in an edition-exclusive blue-green, and foil-stamping on the cover,   along with a dust jacket. Each set will be signed and numbered by Kenneth Hite. This edition will be limited to 75 sets. \n",
      "The extremely limited Globetrotter Edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations will be hand-bound in leather by Sara Hindmarch of Chicago, IL. Also signed and numbered by Kenneth Hite, this edition will be limited to five copies. \n",
      "Since this edition is hand-assembled, it's possible there may be a few custom extras included in the final product. If we unlock the new edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales, there will be an accompanying five-copy edition of that book, and a further five copies of both books available only as a set, featuring a hand-made slipcase by Ms. Hindmarch.  \n",
      "Additional copies of the Tourist Editions of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations and Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales are available as add-ons to your backer level. Just add $15.00 to your pledge for each copy you'd like to add on. You'll be able to apply that to those copies in Backerkit. You don't have to decide now, of course. You can simply wait for Backerkit and add additional copies then.  \n",

      "Our plan is to have the additional material for the book written, and the book printed and delivered into the hands of backers by Halloween of next year (2018). Please note that, due to the hand work involved, delivery of the Globetrotter Edition may take 2-3 months longer than the Tourist and Traveller editions. Note that if you're backing a level including the Globetrotter Edition, we're including normally-delivered copies of the Tourist Editions of the Tour de Lovecraft books, as well as the Digital Edition. \n",
      "\"Ken’s always had a great combination of wit, knowledge and geekery. All of that comes to fruition with Tour de Lovecraft, an immensely readable trip through the works of everyone’s favorite dark fantasist, H.P. Lovecraft, which combines a deep love of the work with a clear-eyed view of quality of the same. If you’re a Lovecraft fan, you’ll find lots to enjoy, and to argue with.\" \n",
      "— John Scalzi, author of Old Man's War and Lock In\n",
      "“Kenneth Hite’s Tour de Lovecraft is indispensable. Thorough, insightful, and compellingly readable, it’s a perfect introduction for newcomers to Lovecraft and an endlessly fascinating review for long-time Lovecraft addicts. This is the companion-book to Lovecraft’s fiction—I read it entirely in one sitting, and I know I’m going to read it again many times over the coming years.” \n",
      "—  Tim Powers, author of Declare and Last Call\n",
      "“Lovecraft can be terrifying for all the wrong reasons. Kenneth Hite’s charming and accessible Tour makes it much, much simpler. This is a sharp, engaging survey of Lovecraft’s most important stories, sure to bring inspiration to new fans and fresh epiphanies to longtime devotees. And I’d recommend it to any teacher looking for an introductory critical companion to the fiction itself.” \n",
      "—  Stephen H. Segal, editorial director, Weird Tales magazine\n",

      "Here's an overview of our funding strategy, with a couple of initial stretch goals assuming we hit our goal for Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations. \n",
      "FUNDED! This is our basic funding level. If we hit this, we'll produce the digital and hardcover print versions of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations, with a completion and delivery date target of Halloween 2018.\n",
      "FUNDED! If we hit this funding goal, we will not only produce the digital and physical versions of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations, we will also revise and reproduce the digital and physical versions of Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales. The format of both books will be the same, and pledge tiers will be added to allow backers to get both books in standard and special formats.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! At this point, with the basics fully funded, we can move on to adding new content to the Tour de Lovecraft Books. \n",
      "Lovecraft set three stories in Washington Irving's old stomping ground of Upstate New York, and his allusions to the Plateau of Leng tie that blasphemous country to Antarctica, nightmares, and Tibet. Ken adds two new essays to Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations: one on that eerie undiscovered country, and another on Leng.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! Ken turns his eye to Lovecraft’s collaborations, beginning with Hazel Heald (“Out of the Aeons”, “The Horror in the Museum”, “Winged Death”), Adolphe de Castro (“The Last Test,” “The Electric Executioner”), and Anna Helen Crofts (“Poetry and the Gods”), and winding up on Venus with Kenneth Sterling (“In the Walls of Eryx”). With this goal achieved, Ken adds individual articles on those seven Tales.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! Like Charles Dexter Ward, Ken returns home -- to Oklahoma, to examine the setting of “The Curse of Yig” and “The Mound.” And why venture back into the past if not to examine the primordial, paleontological past with our eyestalks as well? If we power past this stretch goal, Ken adds two new Destinations: Oklahoma and Deep Time.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! Ken drives the bus deeper into the collaborations, where we meet Zealia Bishop (“The Curse of Yig”, “Medusa’s Coil”, “The Mound”), HPL’s then-girlfriend Sonia Haft Greene (“The Horror at Martin’s Beach”), Duane Rimel (“The Tree on the Hill”), and Frank Barlow (“The Night Ocean”). With this goal unlocked, Ken adds individual responses to those six Tales.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! Lovecraft visited the American South several times in his life, and at least four times in his fiction. And while he strangely never set a story in a jungle, the swamp seemed to hold just as much horror for HPL as the forest or the icy wastes. With this goal reached, Ken adds two hot, wet new Destinations, the South and the Swamp.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! We’re out of worthy collaborations, but what about the stories Lovecraft just left unfinished? Like Lovecraft, Ken isn’t sure exactly what to do with the fragments -- “Azathoth,” “The Descendant,” “The Very Old Folk,” “Memory,” “The Thing in the Moonlight,” and “The Book” -- but if you follow him past this stretch goal, he’ll do something with them: one overlong essay, perhaps, or six little short ones. Speaking of overlong, Ken will also analyze Lovecraft’s round-robin tale “The Challenge From Beyond”, written with C.L. Moore, A. Merritt, Frank Belknap Long, and Robert E. Howard.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! Lovecraft turned horror into science fiction and vice versa, even while calling back to ancient archaeological terrors. With this goal met, Ken adds two new Destinations, taking us into Outer Space and under the pyramids to Egypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNLOCKED! What rhymes with “reached another stretch goal?” Lovecraft would have known, and perhaps we’ll find out when Ken adds two new pieces to Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales: one on Lovecraft’s sonnet cycle Fungi From Yuggoth, and one covering the rest of Lovecraft’s poetry.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! Miskatonic University may prefer the South Pole, but Lovecraft doesn’t neglect the icy north, from Lomar to Greenland to his pal Clark Ashton Smith’s Hyperborea. When we melt this stretch goal, Ken adds two cool new Destinations, taking us up to the Arctic and onto the campus at Miskatonic University.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNLOCKED! Fiction done, poetry done, what’s next? Our Tour becomes recursive with essays about Lovecraft’s essays, of course! If we hit this stretch goal, Ken writes a response to Supernatural Horror in Literature and an essay on Lovecraft’s “History of the Necronomicon.”\n",
      "UNLOCKED! What fun is a tour without a map? If you help drive us past this stretch goal, acclaimed cartographer Mark Richardson of Green Hat Designs prepares a map of Lovecraft Country—the Miskatonic and Manuxet valleys—in the style of a 1930s road map, and we print it in Tour de Lovecraft: the Destinations as interior art.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! You’ve waited patiently throughout the Tour, and finally you can pet a kitty! Ken (and possibly his cat Virgil) responds to Lovecraft’s essay “Something About Cats” (also published as “Cats and Dogs”). Passing this stretch goal also gets Ken to add an essay on Lovecraft’s writing advice, specifically on HPL’s “Notes on Interplanetary Fiction” and “Notes on Writing Weird Fiction”.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! This is it! We’ve gone everywhere, and now we’re giving you the Master’s master itinerary! When we reach this stretch goal, Ken compiles The Lovecraftian Gazetteer: Every location mentioned in Lovecraft’s fiction, listed and keyed for your convenience. This stretch goal includes an (interior art) world map, by Ken or possibly by an even better cartographer! Both the Gazetteer and the world map will be included in Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations.\n",
      "Often requested of Ken, and just as often put off by Ken, adding brief synopses of all the stories to Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales would be undeniably handy and undeniably a pain in the tuchus to write. But if you’ve come with us this far, hitting this stretch goal means Hal will hit Ken until he buckles down and does it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to pledging for reward tiers, you can help us spread the word about Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations through social media. The more backers we get, the better we can make the whole project! \n",
      "UNLOCKED! At 250 backers, we'll go beyond just a PDF presentation of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations, and add full-featured .epub and .mobi editions to the Digital Edition. This also applies to Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales if it is funded. \n",
      "UNLOCKED! If we hit 300 backers, we will create an illustrated Kickstarter-exclusive bookplate. These will be sent to all backers receiving physical rewards. Any backers getting both Tour de Lovecraft books (funding of both pending) will receive 2 book plates. \n",
      "UNLOCKED! At 350 backers, we'll add color endsheets to the binding of the books, and add a spot gloss to the book's dustjacket. \n",
      "UNLOCKED! At 400 backers, we'll add a second ink to the interior printing of both Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations and Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales.\n",
      "UNLOCKED! Once we hit 450 backers, we'll add an appropriately-colored ribbon bookmark to both Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations, and The Tales.  \n",
      "UNLOCKED! While Ken's words are the star of Tour de Lovecraft, we're keen to fancy up the way they're presented. What better to do that than some artwork? When we hit 500 backers, we'll add black and white chapter headers, spot illustrations, and so on to the interior of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations. \n",
      "UNLOCKED! The first edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales was graced with spot illustrations by the excellent artist (and Darkest of the Hillside Thickets band member) Toren \"Macbin\" Atkinson. If we hit 550 backers, we'll expand the interior art inside Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales with even more art! \n",
      "UNLOCKED! Identifying your bag when on a journey can be difficult, but we can help! At 600 backers, we'll create a set of 3 vinyl luggage labels for the more outré stops on the Tour. All backers at tiers with physical rewards will receive these for free!\n",
      "UNLOCKED! Sure, set one covered Kadath, the Dreamlands, and Hyperspace....but what about Leng, Arkham, and Innsmouth? 3 labels just isn't enough to cover all the esoteric locations on our Tour... so at 650 backers, we'll double the size of the set to 6 labels.

      "Atomic Overmind Press is committed to supporting brick and mortar book and hobby retailers. We fully understand how Kickstarter and other crowdfunding platforms create new challenges for traditional retail stores, so we’re taking steps to encourage retailer support of our products. Here are a few things we are doing. \n",
      "1. We know cash flow can be an issue, and most retailers don’t want to tie up capital while you wait for fulfillment. With that in mind, you can become a retail backer of Tour de Lovecraft at the \"Pickman\" level to let us know you’re interested in carrying the book, and during the BackerKit process you can adjust your order to fit what you need at that time. \n",
      "2. You’ll get Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations copies early, and you’ll be able to sell for at least 30 days before it hits distribution.\n",
      "3. In-store, freight-free pickup option for backers local to you: You’ll have the option to add your store’s name to our Retailer Backer List for in-store pickup (US stores only). If you do, any of our backers can save the cost of shipping their books by picking their Tour de Lovecraft rewards up at your store. Yes, we need their support pledge to make Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations happen, but you will have the opportunity to expose a potential new customer to other products and accessories your store has to offer. Both you and the backers local to you will need to coordinate with each other ahead of shipment. We’ll provide the list of participating stores in an update as we get closer to the release.\n",
      "Shipping. It's the biggest wildcard and largest misunderstood cost of any crowdfunding project.\n",
      "We've chosen not to fold shipping costs into the reward tiers for this campaign, and have reduced the pricing on those tiers accordingly. Shipping will be charged using Backerkit when we are finally ready to get the project physically into your hands. Our shipping partners, Studio 2 Publishing, have extensive experience with Kickstarter fulfillment and will be able to provide us with the most economical methods to get your rewards delivered to you in proper shape.\n",
      "For overseas backers, costs will naturally be higher, but we are committed to finding the best-cost solution possible for you. This includes finding and working with localization partners to ship the final rewards if possible. We cannot offer guarantees on what those prices will be. But if you trust us, we promise do the absolute best we can for you.\n",
      "And well you should ask!\n",

      "WHO ARE YOU? WHAT IS HAPPENING?\n",
      "Hi Kickstarter! My name is Cat Harris-White and I create, sing, perform and produce under the name SassyBlack. You may know my work from my (now defunct) group THEESatisfaction or my appearances on Black Up & Lese Majesty by Shabazz Palaces. Last year I released my first solo album and 5th release No More Weak Dates to a fantastically warm reception. \n",
      "Since then so much has happened including my first solo tour to Europe last fall, speaking at SXSW & Pop Kultur Berlin, performing at several festivals (Capitol Hill Block Party, Treefort Music Fest, Linecheck Music Festival (Milan), Barcelona Acciò Musical (Barcelona), Daytrotter Fest etc.) as well as my music being featured on the Adult Swim compilation LUXE. \n",
      "On June 23rd, I released my sophomore album \"New Black Swing\" independently. It's my 7th release in the past 3 years, can you believe it?! Like all my projects, this album was written, produced and performed by me. And so far this has been my most successful record yet gaining praise not only from major publications like i-d, NYLON & the FADER, but also from YOU, my family, friends & supporters! \n",
      " \n",
      "OH COOL, WHAT'S GOOD SASSY? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?\n",
      "As I mentioned, people have responded so well to New Black Swing that it is definitely time for a full fledge North American & European tour! I manage & book myself & have been in contact with promoters and venues all over the world preparing routing while strategizing how I can share my music through live performances. So far I have some great dates lined up including Seattle, Portland, Brooklyn, LA, London, Salt Lake City, Zürich and more to be announced. \n",
      "WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS KICKSTARTER? \n",
      "I rarely ask for help. This is something that I have been trying to work through. As a Black Queer woman, society and my own communities expect me to be strong while emotional and able to handle and figure out anything. While parts of that are true, there is no shame in asking for help and finding better ways to accomplish things. \n",
      "With that said, this is what I like to call a \"vulnerability moment\". It's an opportunity for me to share myself in a different way and admit that I don't have all the answers and that I do in fact need help at times. Going from being a DIY musician to a signed artist back to a DIY musician is quite the journey and I wouldn't change a thing! However I have learned a lot over this time and asking for help is an opportunity to better myself and learn more about my community and where that support resides. All in all I am very excited to get to know my supporters better and to continue to learn and share knowledge as a result.\n",
      "WHAT'S THE PLAN MA'AM? \n",
      "The tour kicks off August 31st and goes until mid November. Promoters and venues have been contacted and so far 15 dates have been confirmed with more confirming every day! \n",
      "- All Service Incentives will be scheduled in September and set in motion beginning in November when I return from tour. \n",
      "- Merchandise Delivery has a few more steps involved which is below:\n",
      "WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\n",
      "My expenses consist of travel by air or land or water (ferry), tour publicity & radio promotions, music videos, accommodations (need somewhere to sleep and practice!) & of course food (need to eat!). These are all things that are necessary to have a successful tour. \n",
      "WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO YOU SASS?\n",
      "It’s important to love yourself and try new things! My solo career is still a new thing for me and it is scary everyday, but that’s why I love it. I push myself further and learn more about myself and how I can help others and that is one of the best feelings in the world. Outside of making music!\n",
      "\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "My biggest risks are financial. My listeners have been requesting that I make my way to their city to perform live. With the support of you, radio & print publicists, I can make this a reality. I have allotted myself cushion in terms of the time it takes to get things done. If for for some reason the timeline changes I will notify you. \n",

They are made in the USA from lead-free pewter and are then plated in rhodium to give high strength and a high-luster shine. These bar accessories make great gifts and are guaranteed to be a conversation starter at your next get together!\n",

      "Our process begins with digital scans of real animal skulls, which we scale down and then optimize for 3D printing. This digital miniaturization process is designed to retain an unprecedented amount of detail from the original specimen.\n",
      "To make the final pieces, we reproduce the miniature model in wax with a professional level high-resolution 3D printer. With our wax model we make a primary mold which allows us to cast the skulls in any metal using traditional lost-wax casting.

With nothing more than a few dollars to his name and a bootleg Walkman, Sam began his career by selling electronics door to door in New York. What began as a humble career in electronics laid the foundation for Axel Audio years later.\n",
      "After working in electronics for almost 30 years, Sam saw an opportunity to change the way high quality audio products are made. He enlisted his son and daughter, Kevin and Samantha, to help him actualize his dream.

We wanted to ensure reliability before bringing our project to you, not only as an idea, but as a rigorously researched, tested, and now near production ready product. We’re on track to ship your headphones to you in just a little over 2 months.\n",
      "Our tooling cost is generally more expensive than that of a typical headphone manufacturer. Here's why:\n",
      "1. The nature of our fully collapsible and interchangeable design, requires us to create completely original tooling molds for all of their smaller components. \n",
      "2. Each of our six unique drivers requires its own tooling, while other parts like the silicon inserts, involve a more specialized process. \n",
      "3. Together with our manufacturer, we are working around the clock to insure the highest level of tooling quality, quality control, manufacturing workmanship, and above all else, audio engineering.\n",

Devenez à votre tour coproducteur !\n",
      "L'histoire : Paul s'occupe seul et à plein temps de son bébé, Lou. Il ne sort pas de son quartier et refuse de répondre aux appels. Son entourage s'inquiète.\n",
      "Après cinq courts-métrages, c'est ma première incursion dans un registre plus léger et cocasse. Je suis très curieux d’expérimenter, de chercher le bon ton, avec un dispositif où les personnages sont au centre.\n",
      "J'ai souhaité tourner très vite, dans mon immeuble, avec ma fille, Lily, cinq mois. Je ne souhaitais pas passer par un financement classique, trop long, afin de ne pas rater cet âge. \n",
      "La mise en scène est axée essentiellement sur elle, ses réactions, et sur le personnage de Paul, leur alchimie, leur monde à eux ; quitte à avoir par moment les dialogues des personnages secondaires en off. Dans cette optique, nous avons tourné en équipe légère : en lumière naturelle, un cadreur, un ingénieur du son et un perchman, quelques heures par jour, sur une semaine, au rythme du bébé.\n",
      "J'ai confié le rôle de Paul à Sébastien Chassagne, rôle qu'il m'a fait l'honneur d'accepter. Sébastien a une grande sensibilité et un sens inné du rythme, de la répartie. Il m’épate par son intelligence, sa créativité, son aisance. Il parvient à créer des moments de complicité avec le bébé, tout en passant facilement vers un registre plus dramatique.\n",
      "Nous avons la chance de rassembler autour de lui un très beau casting, Sabrina Seyvecou est Agathe, la compagne de Paul ; Audrey Giacomini est Camille, sa meilleure amie ; Isa Mercure est Marie-France, sa belle-mère ; Didier Niverd est Pascal, son beau-père ; Odile Grandchamps est Mme Vivien, une dame de la PMI et Jean-François Jaquin est M. Brunel, le voisin.\n",

      "People often ask us whether we make money off our participation in “The Room.” And the answer is NO. (I mean, it’s yes, but not like you’re thinking. We each made a few hundred dollars shooting The Room back in 2002 and that was it. We’ve spent it. It’s gone.) \n",
      "Unlike big name Hollywood actors, we are basically regular Joes and Josephinas. We don’t have a reserve of cash set aside for making films and we don't have easy access to financiers with gobs of money! (If you do, please let us know, though -- we LOVE having Executive Producers!)\n",

      "We knew when we filmed THE ROOM 15 years ago, it wouldn’t win any awards. But we had no idea that it would eventually be known as “the Citizen Kane of bad movies,” and ultimately spawn an Oscar nominated film! But when the world is laughing at you, what do you do?\n",
      "You laugh right along with them. Otherwise, you find yourself crying into your goblet of wine at night and no one wants that. \n",
      "That’s why we created this series for YOU, the fans! We, the Room actors, absolutely LOVE the fans. The jokes and Easter eggs in the series are designed especially for YOU! I guess we realized that we really like making you laugh.\n",
      "Sure, Juliette beats Room fan zero Michael Rousselet on a regular basis... \n",
      "BUUUUUT we’ve been to numerous Room screenings in Los Angeles, and we’ve never met a funnier, wittier, more intellectual group of film fanatics. From SPOOOOONS to the football gags to the way you’ve made “oh hai” an inside joke for the ages, Room fans are awesome. So we made something to celebrate that...AND we need your help to finish it!\n",
      "Awww, we love you for that! Thanks so much for being a part of our Roomie family, because we can’t make the remaining episodes a reality without your help. But we want to make sure it’s good for you too, so we’ve got a lot of fun rewards planned out. Take a look at what YOU can get!\n",

      "As student filmmakers, finding the most cost-efficient and effective resources to implement in our film is not an easy task to come by and can be quite difficult when dealing with certain filmmaking elements such as budgeting, casting, and set designing.

      "Hello! My name is Kati Skelton and I am a filmmaker living in Brooklyn, NY. I have made a handful of comedic shorts, a couple of which you can check out below! One is called DOOR ON THE LEFT, which premiered at the Maryland Film Festival in 2016, and another is called BUSINESS, which premiered at Slamdance Film Festival in 2017. Vimeo was nice enough to give them both Staff Picks, and Business was recently featured on Short of the Week! Last year I also made an infomercial for Adult Swim called WET SHAPES, which you can check out on their website. \n",
      "Most everything I've made I've worked on with a very close group of friends in Brooklyn, who are a bunch of beautiful geniuses. So when I started talking about a new script I wrote, they all banded together and knew what they had to do: kidnap me, hold me hostage, and force me to make the movie for their own sick pleasure.\n",
      "They've been keeping me in a basement, depriving me of food and water, and forcing me to work endlessly on preproduction efforts, all so that they can get their horrible rocks off collaborating on the movie. They hover above me as I type this. And while I am truly passionate about the movie and am so excited to make it, I also crave the daylight and fresh air, to which I haven't been exposed for several weeks. By donating to this campaign, you will not only help us make the film, but you will also help me get out of this basement--in one piece, I hope!\n",
      "Pots N' Tots is a short film about two ceramicists, Margot and Billy, who are collaborators and lovers. They work at a studio called Pots N' Tots, which is a kind of pottery studio slash daycare center with a laissez faire attitude towards childcare. But one day, they find out that the board of the studio wants to split them up. Margot suddenly must confront her artistic jealousies of her partner, but the question is: does the studio really have their best interests in mind, or is something sinister bubbling beneath the surface?\n",
      "It's a tale of jealousy, competition, and artistic sabotage. But it's also a story of redemption and forgiveness. It's very silly and serious at the same time, and if we don't raise enough money to make the movie, they may not let me out of here alive. \n",
      "Pots N' Tots will star Ruby McCollister (Neighborhood Food Drive) and Andrew Ryder (Lace Crater). We are still in the midst of casting several other starring roles! Debbie Fong, Chris Osborn, and Breanne Thomas are producing, Daniel Johnson is behind the camera, and Allistair Johnson will be doing production sound. Debbie Fong and Brad Johnson will be doing art! The gang is truly all here, down in this basement, where they punish me for not having raised the funds yet.\n",
      "Your donations will be used to secure locations, pay for production design, camera and lighting equipment, production insurance, transportation, food, and postproduction services like a sound mix, color, and VFX. The shoot will take place over six days, two of which we've somehow already shot! But we still have the most complicated scenes ahead, which include 12 actors, an awards ceremony, a Rapscallion, and a dream sequence involving Three Strange Guys. We've only just begun, and we need your help to make it a reality! \n",
      "We're shooting the movie in bits in pieces in order to accommodate everyone's schedules on such a low budget. We shot the first two days in April, and then will shoot the rest of the movie between May and June, with post production taking place through the rest of the summer. Our hope is that the movie will be finished by the end of September!\n",

We have oral histories with pilots, beekeepers, street artists, articles about zeppelin disasters and urban wildlife projects, poetry and even...storigami!\n",

      "“Blue: In My Feelings” is a project that really just started out with me venting and expressing my thoughts through spoken word, and it eventually took on a life of its own. For me, writing serves as a creative and therapeutic outlet for my frustrations, my worries, my aspirations, and my goals. I love the freedom that writing and spoken word offers, and I love music, itself; so it only made sense to somehow find a way to combine the two. I have dealt with a lot in the past and in the present. Being diagnosed with depression and moving through life gets difficult. There are days when I question if there is even a reason to live. Over the past few years, I have tried to immerse myself with school and with clubs that focused on things that I thought that I cared about and conversed with people whom I thought shared my same interests and passions. Realizing that I was doing nothing more than going through the motions left me at a point where I was more lost than ever. Writing and music have helped me in ways that a doctor’s medication never could, and it inspires me to move forward and get the most out of life. “In my feelings” is the first project in which I have truly made not only out of the interests of others but for myself, as well. I hope you will enjoy this project as much as I've enjoyed the process of getting to this step in its creation.\n",

      "As this is my first mixtape, I expect there to be bumps in the road as I go through the learning curve. The biggest challenge I foresee with this project is promoting and marketing. I plan to utilize all social media outlets to promote the mixtape and I hope to do interviews with local podcasts or YouTube music reviewers. As I began to record songs for the mixtape, I'll be thinking about ideas for promotional videos and cover art for individual songs. I will have to find someone with the talent and resources to help make this possible. Currently, I am looking for a female R&B vocalist to help me record my more soulful tracks.\n",

My dream is to be able to make a living doing what I do best which is make music. I been actively pursuing a career for many years but yet to achieve the break I need to become a professional musician. What I have accomplished over the years is vast amount of knowledge about composition, songwriting, producing. I have written many songs in my makeshift recording studio when I was located in Brooklyn then in 2005 I re-located to Connecticut. Over the years I amassed a catalogue of songs which is presented on my Bandcamp page. My music is released under my record label Lighthouse Music Grp. Although I released a steady stream of music the ability to promote and market has hindered its success because of lack of funding.  In 2017 my home in Stratford Connecticut was foreclosed forcing me to put my equipment in storage therefore currently I do not have facilities to record the way I would like to. I do have my guitar and laptop so I sketch out my pre-production demos. I have a new collection of acoustic guitar demoed songs that will be produced into the new album. \n",

(Experiments don't count as cheating, you see). Check us out on  www.heritagecookies.net!\n",
      "My husband's passion for heritage cookies goes back to when I was nineteen and brought him home for the first time. My mother followed the Czech tradition and made 8 or 10 different cookies each Christmas.

And then he proceeded to broaden our baking repertoire with 30 years of constant research and testing.\n",

I am a first generation immigrant to America, and one of the things you miss are the special treats of your culture and childhood. Those are the ones we wanted: the cookies that immigrants from whatever culture would swoon for when the old flavors showed up. And the emigres from America too. North America has cookie traditions of its own, and we wanted to find those as well. National cookies like Chocolate Chips, and American regional favorites like Snickerdoodles and Buckeyes too!\n",
      "Thirty-[mumble] years later we have a pattern. We make our 2-3 dozen cookies each Christmas. We keep a tithe of each for the family.

As we write this we are planning on 150 recipes or so, the vast majority of which we've already tested and written up. For the rest we are still baking, testing and re-baking.

      "When her unborn child is diagnosed with Spina Bifida and given a low chance for a healthy birth, Alex decides to have an abortion. What should be a routine procedure becomes infinitely more complex in the state of Texas where by law a funeral must be held for the fetus.\n",
      "The story grew out of a string of articles involving women choosing to undergo abortions after their children were diagnosed with developmental diseases. Spina Bfida came up several times because of how late it is detected, and how uncertain the effects can be (ranging from still birth to mental handicaps to no lasting effect at all). I found an often ignored topic in the abortion conversation which are mothers who expect and are excited to have their babies but do to unforeseen circumstances choose to give them up. \n",
      "I then thought of the laws which were new at the time I wrote the play that required women to hold ceremonies for their remains. I imaged mothers who were recently expecting and are now grieving. I thought of how they were forced to publicly relitigate their choices and buy coffins and write speeches for someone they never met but had really really hoped for. \n",
      "At its core the play is about someone saying goodbye to a loved one. Through the political and medical detail I found I was able to write about the experience because I could write about loss. I think in the discussion of abortion and the discussion of these laws it's important to consider the human aspect, the personal grieving involved, and the emotional toll it takes on the women. With the most recent fetal remains bill being passed only a few months ago in Pennsylvania by male state senator whose wife had passed away, it seemed important for a man to consider another perspective on a less intrusive platform. \n",

First, my goal ;) I want to make pedals for a living , eventually. So I decided to start this project a few years back by modifying pedals, that eventually turned to designing pedals.\n",
      "We started the whole Vintage EFX venture with pen and paper.\n",
      "From there it was a while before we had all the parts we needed to finish the prototyper, but with time and well planned purchases we had a working unit.\n",
      "This unit was developed to help ease the creative process without having loose component everywhere. Now we can swap out components without having to inhale flux or solder in extremely tight spots. \n",
      "We were not a big fan of the generic aluminum box so we thought really hard about how we wanted it to look. After much time and consideration, we went with an old school army theme.\n",
      "We have designed and built functional and finished products, just in limited numbers.\n",
      " All our models are soldered by hand and are wired together on stripboard. Hand assembly is a must with us! The paint is also all done here by hand at Vintage EFX.\n",
      "Why are these pedals different then the thousands of others out there. Well first, the goal is to make a great original product. We do our best to put a Vintage EFX touch to everything we do and try to give you some \"Swiss army knife\" type pedals.\n",

      "The saying around here is K.I.S.S.! but give me a few extra knobs or switches to play with.\n",

It is 99% done, just need some parts to assemble the magnificent beast.\n",
      "(Update!!! The MK4 is available in a very limited quantity as a reward. Only 4 up for grabs at the moment.)\n",
      " Now for why you should back vintage EFX. I have years of experience as a guitarist, over 20 years playing.  After earning a Diploma in Audio Engineering in 2006 I have worked from the bar shows, conferences, festivals and many studios. I have applied my training and years of experience into the builds I created. I am completely obsessed  about anything related to audio, so you know you will get a great product that is sure to last an eternity. \n",

      "There have been many challenges in the past when it came to designing pedals and getting from idea to a physical working model. From finding the right parts to the hundreds hours of R and D, But there is always a way to overcome these challenges. Sometimes it was spending hours online looking for that one rare part or spending days and nights swapping parts and analyzing signals to get the desired outcome from the effect box. My biggest challenge has been raising money on my own to make a large order to suppliers to get the parts I need at a cost that wont kill the project before it can take off. I have overcome this by doing it in small steps, one week, purchase one part the next week get a few parts and eventually it all my designs came to life. Now that I have a few functional models it would be great to make a production run a get these great pedals out to musicians. This is why I am here at kickstarter. As for the \"if\" we are funded factor. I believe that most changes i will face from the \"funded\" point will plainly be time. I do work a full time job working audio for an event company. But so far this had not really slowed the process. When i am not working for the man, I am working on Vintage Efx. I put a lot of time into this project because i believe my years of experience in the field of audio has provided me with the skill set needed to deliver a unique and long lasting product. We honestly feel that our biggest challenges have already been overcome, its simply time to make these products, we just need a little financial push to really get of the ground and get our product to hundreds of players out there.\n",

      "Leo is a mini headphone amplifier that emulates the warm tone of vintage audio equipment. Connect Leo to any smartphone or music player to your favorite headphones to experience the sound that vinyl lovers have been raving about without the expense and hassle.\n",
      " How Does it Sound?\n",
      "Leo brings a presence to music, as if listening to a live performance. The tonal quality provides warmth and power while preserving delicate high frequencies. Leo brings out the best performance from any pair of headphones. \n",
      "Leo looks as clean as it sounds. Constructed with a rugged extruded aluminum body, CNC carved aluminum knobs, and precision laser cut faceplates available in a choice of black acrylic, walnut veneer, or smooth black leather. Units come standard with soft yellow LED backlighting. Premium units come with UV LED backlighting. \n",
      "Modern audio equipment only delivers audio within a flat and narrow range of tones. Leo delivers a much larger range of frequencies while recreating the exact tonal quality of premium vintage amplifiers. While we can’t hear tones below a certain range - we can feel them. The unique tonal curves correct for psychoacoustic phenomena leading to a sound quality full of warmth, feeling, and presence.\n",
      "Audio\n",
      "Physical\n",
      "We spent the last year designing Leo from the ground up to deliver you the best audio experience. We started our journey measuring many vintage amplifiers and turntables to discover how they deliver so much character. From there, we engineered equations that modeled the vintage equipment and coded simulations to find the optimal circuit for the sound. The final electronics of Leo are a work of precise calculation optimization and design iteration. We designed an intuitive interface and rugged enclosure to stand the test of time while remaining true to the equipment it emulates.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have several full functioning prototypes and are ready to mass produce Leo but need your help to kickstart production! We completed the design phase of our project and started working closely with a US based factory to manufacture Leo. Once funded, we'll kick into high gear with parts acquisition and assisting the fabrication process.\n",

      "Hello! I'm Kathleen Jacques, and since 2010 I've been creating a webcomic called Band Vs Band. You can read it here! I'm raising funds to make its second book happen, and cover the cost of printing and shipping.\n",
      "Band Vs Band is about two clashing musicians: wholesome do-gooder Honey Hart with her band The Candy Hearts, and bad-girl troublemaker Turpentine with her dirty noisy band The Sourballs. The gals start as enemies and rivals with a secret attraction to each other, but gradually fall in love. It's fun, queer, and retro-inspired, with a distinctive visual style. \n",
      "The Volume 1 book collecting the comic's first three years was a 2015 Lambda Literary Award finalist for LGBT Graphic Novels, and Band Vs Band has also been a finalist in online comics categories for an Autostraddle comics award (2016) and a National Cartoonists Society Reuben award (2017). I've had so much fun sharing these characters and their world with readers, and I've been blown away by the amazing response it's gotten from folks who enjoy it.\n",
      " \n",
      "The comic itself is free to read online, but there's just something special about a physical book. The Volume 1 print book was funded thanks to the generous support of my Kickstarter backers, and now I need your help to print Volume 2! It'll be a 162 page perfect-bound softcover book, professional full-colour offset printing, 7x10 inches (and the format matches Vol. 1, so they'll look nice together on a shelf.) I'm a graphic designer when I'm not making comics, and a huge nerd about making sure these are beautiful books in terms of print quality, layout, and feel.\n",
      "Volume 2 will collect all the Band Vs Band pages from 2014–early 2018. In these comics, Honey and Turpentine struggle to balance their band dreams with job & money problems, persevere through mishaps and injuries, and start to realize what they mean to each other. Plus, there'll be several pages of book-exclusive bonus material & art that won't appear in the web version! \n",
      "It is the second book in an ongoing series with continuity – but if you like the premise, I think you'll find lots to enjoy here even if you haven't read Volume 1 or the online version of the comic yet.\n",
      "The book is almost complete - the vast majority of it is finished, and I'm currently working hard at finalizing the rest.  I'm incredibly excited for this book, and the prospect of seeing it in print – a lot of work and a lot of love went into it, and I want to share it with all of you.\n",
      "So, what's in it for you, besides a sweet copy of the new book itself for your very own?\n",
      "Guest artists! I am so thrilled to be able to offer a set of art cards with Band Vs Band illustrations by three of my absolute favorite comics artists: Megan Rose \"Rosalarian\" Gedris (Meaty Yogurt, Spectacle), Nina \"Space Coyote\" Matsumoto (Sparks!, Simpsons Comics), and Sfé R. Monster (Eth's Skin, Beyond Anthology). These are going to be gorgeous 5x7\" prints – and they're Kickstarter exclusives, so this is your one chance to grab them!\n",

There are two different sticker sheets available in various reward tiers, and they'll both be 4x6\" vinyl with multiple kiss-cut designs to peel off.\n",
      "Meet the band! Heck yeah! I'll draw you hanging out with up to 2 Band Vs Band characters in an in-universe photo that'll appear in the Volume 2 book. These are super limited, and I'm going to make a few available right away, and a few more later in the campaign. \n",
      "If you snag one of these, you'll need to send me a reference photo as soon as possible! You get to pick which characters you meet, and any other requests about this image and how you're portrayed just need to be consistent with the universe/tone/canon of the comic (ie: you need to appear as a human, and my characters all act in-character here)    \n",
      "There are more cool items included in the reward tiers, including comic page prints, my limited edition risograph mini comics, and having me sign your book and do a sketch on the title page (up to 2 BVB characters of your choice). Check it out!\n",
      "If you'd really like a particular combination of items that isn't specified, please send me a message and I'll confirm how much to add to your pledge to add any non-limited reward onto another tier.\n",
      "All tiers that include a print copy of Volume 2 also get your name on the book's special thank-you page. You'll be immortalized forever!\n",
      "PDF ebook versions of both Band Vs Band volumes are available as digital-only rewards, plus any tier with a print copy of the Volume 2 book also gets you a download of the digital edition.\n",
      " Oh wow - the limited tiers are all currently sold out! But if you missed something you wanted, mark your calendar: more spots for some of them are opening on February 28 (tiers with Volume 1) and March 5 (Meet The Band)\n",
      "I want to mostly focus on the Volume 2 book itself; however, If this project exceeds its initial target, I do have one big additional goal: at $20,000, we reprint Band Vs Band Volume 1!\n",
      "There are reward tiers that include both books, but they're limited...and that's because my stock of Volume 1 is pretty low. The first printing was a relatively small quantity – and I'm delighted that the comic's audience is bigger than I expected, but it also means I'm running out!\n",
      "If we fund Volume 2, but don't make that additional goal, it means reprinting Volume 1 will probably be its own separate campaign at some point in the future, and that book will become scarce and unavailable to buy for a while. (If we DO unlock reprinting Volume 1 this time, it'll become available in unlimited reward tiers)\n",
      "Besides the big reprint, more funding above the initial target also means that I'll be able to print a higher quantity of Volume 2, and that I may be able to add some cool upgrades to certain rewards – but the first priority is reaching that first goal to make Volume 2 happen. \n",

      "I've put a lot of thought into planning out a tight production/fulfillment timeline, but there's always the possibility of unexpected issues with book production or shipping, or unforseen circumstances that could delay me finishing my work on the book files. If problems arise, I'll do my best to keep all the backers updated on the situation, and what I'm doing to get everyone's rewards delivered as soon as possible.\n",

If I had to categorize myself I'd label myself R&B/Hip-Hop. However realistically I love to infuse many different genres in my music. However, rather it be R&B, Hip-Hop, Rock, Pop; one thing that remains a huge priority in my book musically is lyrical content. Music is a universal language, a inspiration, a mental investment. Music is more than just a sound. That's why if nothing else lyricism is a major factor in my music. So by investing in me you're investing in more than just a nice beat and a catchy punchline.\n",

      "It’s Christmas Eve in Swansea A&E and Amy has just vomited all over a hot doctor’s shoes. Amy is not a patient at the hospital. She’s a junior doctor.\n",
      "Hoping to secure a transfer to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, Amy can handle the long hours, the overtime, and even the shame of vomiting on her colleague, but when assigned to the case of a boy with cancer, Amy is confronted with childhood memories she thought she’d forgotten and the pressure begins to take its toll.\n",
      "When helping others is at the heart of your career, what happens when you are suddenly the one that needs help? \n",
      "In 2016 I read a survey by Mind in which nearly 90% of NHS primary care workers surveyed found their work life stressful, with 1 in 5 saying it has led them to develop a mental health problem.\n",
      "The figures stunned me, as I'm sure it does you, and was one of the reasons I felt compelled to write Blood Orange.\n",
      "Since then I have done more research into NHS and mental health, in particular Junior Doctors and the pressure of a job where you’re giving 100% of yourself, rescuing sick people who are at their most vulnerable, emotionally and physically.\n",
      "All that ‘giving’ coupled with the negative stories in the press, takes its toll on medical staff which is what’s highlighted in Blood Orange.\n",
      "The other important topic in the play is cancer and I wanted to emphasise the longer term effect a serious illness can have on loved ones and family.\n",
      "That’s absolutely not to say this a play is without humour and laugh out loud moments because, as in life, the darker times intertwine with the funny, silly moments which in a strange way makes us feel more alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The NHS will last as long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it’.\n",
      "I wanted to write a story from the perspective of one person, Amy, as an example of the thousands working in the NHS. By making it personal and relatable, the audience join in Amy’s journey exploring her past which is inextricably linked to her stressful life in a hospital A&E department and what the future may look like.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The idea of Amy’s story has actually been with me for much longer: a strong sister bond and losing someone very dear; that’s a good start for a heartfelt story, added to this a below the radar struggle with my own mental health and the compulsion to write this play in this way was inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I hope Amy will convey the feistiness she feels yet her vulnerability is what makes her strong to do her job and live her life with all its highs and lows.\n",
      "Our aim is to make an amazing memorable play that speaks to the senses:\n",
      "\n",
      "To HEAR not only Amy’s words but also a soundscape of hospital confusion, London madness, and get a glimpse inside Amy’s head where there’s love, guilt, grief and relief followed by big Christmas fun!\n",

      "To SEE the visual effects that create an atmosphere both in the hospital, in London and also inside Amy’s head.\n",

Snarlbear tells the journey of Daisy, a young girl pulled from Earth into the Rainbow Dimension, where she learns the value of friendship and monster punching. The webcomic can be read online here and is part of Hiveworks.\n",
      "Snarlbear is a dark fantasy adventure following the exploits of Daisy Snarlbear, a girl exploring a brightly colored, monster-infested otherworldly land called the Rainbow Dimension. \n",
      "Daisy finds her place in this unforgiving polychrome hellscape as a monster fighter for hire, but soon becomes embroiled in a royal unicorn coup, a quest for a magical eyeball, and a journey that reveals that the most dangerous monsters may have been the ones inside her all along.\n",
      "Volume one includes chapters one through six, outlining Daisy’s introduction to the Rainbow Dimension and rise to fame (or infamy) as a monster hunter. Volume two includes chapters seven through ten, in which Daisy and friends deal with a mysterious crystal menace and the consequences of helping an exiled unicorn prince.\n",
      "Traditionally inked and digitally painted, Snarlbear is heavy on dreamlike, fantastic imagery with searing experimental color palettes, creature designs and action sequences with a dash of friendship and fantasy drama. \n",
      "The webcomic ran online for 5 years (2012-2017).\n",
      " \n",
      "The Complete Comic collection of Snarlbear is a matching set of books covering all 10 chapters of the comic, plus all the watercolor chapter covers, an epilogue, and bonus content! The books are standard graphic novel size (6”x9”) and are both around 190 pages.\n",
      "Pages have been reformatted from their original web RGB to CMYK for print. A few pages have been redrawn and corrected. A decorative page border has been added for additional magical flair and to give the collection a sense of unity.\n",
      "The books will also feature bonus content such as Rainbow Dimension Map endpapers, concept art, sketches, world building appendixes, illustrations and more!\n",
      "The collection is ideal for both fans of the webcomic and new readers. It can be enjoyed by teens and older readers, especially those who like unicorns!\n",

      "Snarlbear is a very weird and beautiful project that I'm really proud of. I started it as a student to learn how to make comics, and over the years it snowballed and blossomed into a sprawling, ambitious project that's become very personal and close to my heart...you can't work on something for 5 years and not have it take a piece of you with it.\n",
      "Not only did I grow as a creator over the course of this project, but I also made a lot of amazing friends (the real treasure...) along the way...I want to thank my family and friends for their support, Hiveworks for their resources, hard work and advice, and a whole lot of cool strangers on the internet for paying attention to my weird unicorn story and encouraging me to keep it going.\n",

For one, you get to read something that would dispel the notion of POC-penned science fiction as somewhat inferior science fiction. We will work very hard to come up with a lineup that will counter this assumption, and we will succeed in doing so.\n",

People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! will exist, with your kind help, of course, to relieve a brokenness we’ve enabled time and time again by favoring certain voices and portrayals of particular characters. We won’t harangue you with guilt trips involving the importance of openly listening to the assimilated, the colonized, the misappropriated. That’s just not how we roll. What we aim to do, instead, is to challenge you: Join us because it is fun to do so. We don’t mean fun as a vehicle for trivializing centuries of injustice that resulted in the lack of representation for certain groups of people because power structures were skewed heavily in favor of a chosen few. We mean fun as the satisfaction we get in those light-bulb-in-the-head moments of our lives, the satisfaction we get from meaningful conversations that lend clarity, the satisfaction we get when we move past those feel-good-driven acts of tokenism, the satisfaction we get when we read stories that have palpable artistic and intellectual values that speak of our present time and most of all, our future.\n",

      "\n",
      "My style of cooking talks to everyone, not only those who are intolerant to gluten. It offers a variety of cooking styles for anyone who likes to eat healthy and delicious foods. Whether you are vegan, vegetarian or like to incorporate a healthy, eclectic diet of meat, poultry and fish, my recipes have something for everyone to enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please feel free to check out my website to see the kinds of things I like to cook!\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I got into the field of recipe developing and cooking was a result of my own battles with food in my earlier years. After seeing the response I have had from my first cookbook, it has proven to me that opening up and expressing my story about battling with weight issues shows others that you can turn things around and make your relationship with food a positive one, as I have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so grateful for my audience who have come together and follow my recipes with admiration and passion to create easy and nutritious meals for themselves and their friends and families. \n",

      "Even to this day it excites me when my followers share a creation they have made from my cookbook; it is amazing to see people coming together through a shared love of food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since launching My Relationship with Food, my knowledge and understanding of cooking and designing recipes has greatly expanded. I have been working hard in the kitchen, experimenting with new ideas and I am really hoping to share them.\n",

      "I am an author, chef and teacher with a strong passion for nutritional, wholesome and delicious foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was through my own challenging journey that I developed a wealth of knowledge and experience that has led me to become an expert in all things gluten-free as well as an industry leader in healthy eating. I have now devoted my life to sharing my passion and encouraging, supporting and inspiring people to change their dietary habits for the better.\n",
      "Two years ago I self-published my debut cookery book, My Relationship with Food, which features 100 delicious, nourishing and seasonal recipes, all gluten-free with minimal use of dairy and no refined sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spend much of my time teaching. This begins with educating children to understand the importance of good nutrition and instilling good habits from an early age by teaching them to cook within their own homes and to gain confidence in the kitchen which is a skill they will have for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also provide cookery lessons to private clients in their homes and regularly visit employees of leading blue chip companies, including Google, Facebook, KPMG and Nomura, amongst others.I run interactive cookery workshops and demonstrations to advise on the benefits of mindful eating, particularly at various charity fundraising events such as Reverse Rett, Heart Cells Foundation and One Family UK. \n",

This is a silicone, fibreglass baking mat which is a product that every household could benefit from. They are reusable alternatives to aluminium foil or parchment paper. They are BPA free, non stick and extremely easy to clean, saving you time, money and introducing you to a healthier way of cooking. Please visit my website for more information.\n",

      "Most casual sports fans are aware of Duke’s run of dominance in men’s basketball under the leadership of Mike Krzyzewski, who has announced the 2021-22 season will be his last. Some even know about the “Cameron Crazies” – the group of Duke students who paint their entire bodies, wear outrageous outfits, and yell and chant and sing during Blue Devils home games at cozy Cameron Indoor Stadium.\n",
      "Most fans, however, would have no idea of the level of detail or the intricacies involved in “tenting,” the process(es) by which Duke students prove themselves worthy of access to the most important games played between the walls of Cameron Indoor Stadium.\n",
      "As with most things associated with Duke men’s basketball, the entity of the Crazies runs a parallel line of progress with that of Coach K’s. With the team’s success since Krzyzewski was hired over 40 years ago, the most elaborate and passionate student section in all of college sports evolved.\n",
      "Centered on an exclusive interview with Krzyzewski, “K & the Crazies” will feature dozens of other interviews to look back on a historic career, as well as how that success built up unique traditions and institutions adjacent to the Duke men’s basketball program.\n",
      "To be sure, this narrative podcast is not about recounting Krzyzewski’s accolades or accomplishments as the head coach of Duke men’s basketball, nor will it present a timeline of the program’s achievements. It will instead highlight the relationship between Coach K and the Cameron Crazies, and how the student fan base has become one with the basketball program.\n",
      "“K & the Crazies” will take listeners on a journey through the origins of Krzyzewskiville (K-Ville), as told by one of the tent city’s founders. It will introduce you to more recent tenters, who pushed boundaries within K-Ville’s guidelines, drawing national media attention for their exploits.\n",
      "The podcast explores the extraordinary relationship between Coach K and the Crazies through the eyes of former players, administrators, students, and members of the media — writers, broadcasters, and radio hosts.\n",
      "Listeners will also hear from opposing players, who chronicle their personal experiences inside historic Cameron Indoor Stadium. There is also the rare opportunity to gain insight from referees, who often draw the ire of the raucous student section.\n",
      "And, of course, there is the exclusive interview with Krzyzewski, where he talks in-depth about the Cameron Crazies and what they mean to him, Duke basketball, and the University as a whole.\n",
      "With that, it is important to note, “K & the Crazies” is not simply a collection of interviews. It is a story of people and how one man helped inspire the most distinctive student fan base in college sports.\n",
      "“K & the Crazies” is tentatively set to release as a six episode series with a bonus follow-up, though the final output number is subject to change. The podcast will release in late January during the ACC regular season and conclude the week of Coach K’s final game at Cameron Indoor Stadium when the Blue Devils face-off with North Carolina.\n",
      "We have been engaged in conversation over the last few months with a half dozen major sports media entities for possible distribution. These discussions are ongoing. Should we not secure a distributor, we will self-release the podcast, which will ultimately have no impact on how you as a listener can gain access to the production.\n",
      "Brian McLawhorn is a sports journalist and documentary filmmaker. He has covered the Duke men’s basketball program since 2007, and is currently co-publisher and managing editor of Bull City Hoops. Additionally, he produced ACC Network’s “All ACCess: Louisville Football” (2019) and worked as a field producer for “The Hall of Fame Knocks” (2021), which was distributed by NFL Media Group and aired on CBS and NFL Network. Brian has worked on various other film projects that have been distributed by ESPN, ABC Sports, Sony Music Nashville, and Fox Sports, as well as numerous independent documentary features and shorts.\n",

He often hosts local sports talk radio shows throughout his home state of North Carolina, as well as fills in on Durham Bulls radio and television broadcasts.\n",
      "People often ask us why we are the right people to tell this story. As described, together we have covered Duke men’s basketball and the ACC for a combined 25+ years. Having sat center court inside Cameron Indoor Stadium for throughout this time, we have developed a unique and intimate insight into the relationship between Coach K and the Cameron Crazies. We have spent hours filming and recording inside K-Ville and at the foot of the wooden bleachers where students transform into one of the most iconic fan bases in sports today. Experience as storytellers, time spent studying the phenomenon that is Coach K & the Crazies, and our passion to share this unique experience with listeners is what drives us and qualifies us to bring this story to Duke and sports fans everywhere.\n",
      "Why do we need your help? Unfortunately, creative projects are not free to produce. While we have self-funded the project to date, we are working to raise $75,460 by our projected launch date of late January to cover: producer, host, and editor pay, production overhead and travel, legal and E&O insurance, promotion costs, and equipment.\n",
      "The $6,700 we are raising here will cover technical costs of tape syncs, music and archival licensing, hosting fees, software, travel, and costs of printing and shipping rewards.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "“K & the Crazies” is a passion project in which we will release regardless of our fundraising outcomes. We have come this far and will continue to see the project through to its release. Though we are seeking partnerships for the project with hopes of reaching our full budget of $75,460, the reality is we cannot presume such relationships will be acquired. In the event we do not secure full funding, our resourcefulness of skill-swapping, gathering in-kind donations, volunteer help, and scraping between couch cushions will ensure the successful completion of this podcast.

      "The Next Sentence is a podcast series in which host Ed Tirado interviews formerly incarcerated individuals. The goal of the show will be to give these individuals a platform to tell their stories, their hardships, and to share how the American justice system has worked for- or against- them. \n",
      "In addition to the podcast, The Next Sentence will also provide online courses, written by Ed Tirado, designed to give formerly incarcerated individuals tools to help them on their path to success. Other courses will provide guidance for friends and/or family members of the formerly incarcerated individual to assist in their experience as well.  \n",
      "The Next Sentence is inspired by the following facts:\n",
      "For an accomplished nation like this one, this is not smart justice.\n",
      "In much of Tirado’s training, experts have spoken about best practices and best interventions, yet the rates of incarceration remain unacceptable.\n",

For the past 25 years, he has worked as a parole & probation officer, a diversion counselor, and a court administrator. He has dedicated his career to helping formerly incarcerated individuals attain success after their release from prison.\n",

      "This project anticipates formerly incarcerated individuals wanting to share their success stories and the impact they are having on their communities. However, some of these individuals may wish to conceal their identity. This would present a challenge to this project if it happens too often because the entire premise is based on filming captivating interviews for people to watch. Watching the back of someone’s head on camera would not produce the objective of this project.\n",
      "The number of successful formerly incarcerated individuals out there should be a sufficiently high enough number to mitigate this risk.\n",

      "Another challenge we will face is ensuring the authenticity of the stories we hear from our guests. We are developing a system that we intend to use to verify that our guests are being forthright and honest about having been incarcerated and the length of their incarceration. However, many of the finer, more personal details of their stories will be harder to verify, and we will have to take our guests at their word that they are being honest.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      " Life is much more enjoyable and carefree when your feet feel the love. Your feet could be compared to tree roots. Healthy roots are the key to healthy and structurally sound trees.  Hence we believe your feet deserve the same kind of tender, loving care as the rest of your body. \n",
      "It is time to introduce Yesfettle, a foot massage platform with a variety of fitness functions. Fitness and massage are combined in a single compact unit in a groundbreaking design. Your feet will be stimulated and rejuvenated by its reflexology-based massage surfaces, while the well-matched accessories let you complete a full-body workout without leaving your house. BIG GAINS IN LESS COST.\n",
      "The design is inspired by the diverse living forms seen in nature and strives to strike a balance between a vibrant aesthetic and ergonomic characteristics. It is made of high-quality TPR materials and features a long-lasting structure and elasticity resilience to maintain its shape and integrity during regular use. If you have sore or fatigued feet, do yourself a favor and spend only a few minutes each day utilizing Yesfettle to deliver the greatest relief for your feet!\n",
      "The positive influence of foot massage and heating has been scientifically proven for years. When you stand on Yesfettle:\n",
      "🌵 The application of gentle pressure from Yesfettle’s uneven surfaces releases tension that tends to store up in the feet.\n",
      "🌵 It helps wake up tired feet.\n",
      "🌵 It promotes healthy blood circulation.\n",
      "🌵 It enhances physical and mental relaxation.\n",
      "Your lives have become structured in a way that makes it easy to not move; you sit in cars, you sit at desks, you sit on the sofa at night to unwind. You take elevators to avoid a flight or two of stairs. It's TOOOO bad!  During prolonged sitting, your metabolism slows by 90%, blood pools in your legs, and the muscles of your lower body are paralyzed. Many health problems can result from long periods of sitting at work. Your body was built for movement!\n",
      "You really can start making changes by performing these gentle, non-sweaty exercises on the massage surface, such as standing, pacing, stretching... to increase your range of motion and strength for lifelong health and vitality. No matter what movement you choose, the more you move, the better your body will function and the better you will feel.\n",
      "Balance gets worse with age.No matter your fitness lever, adding balance training to your daily or weekly fitness routine will be hugely beneficial.  For those looking for maximum benefit, these massage&balance beams can be used barefoot to really get your feet working. Exercises on these beams can increase the range of motion. Strengthening and stimulating your feet might help mitigate injury risk.\n",
      "The Rock Garden kit satisfies the majority of people’s daily foot care requirements. It is softer and more comfortable to stand on due to its high tensile strength and elasticity resilience.\n",
      "The massage surfaces on The Ocean Floor are sharply carved with 3D texture. Walking on it can improve the microcirculation of the feet, resulting in a more irritative effect on the nerve ends and a more propitiatory effect on the spirit.\n",
      "The most difficult terrain is The Live Desert. Standing on the cactus may result in a painful sensation similar to that of standing on a shiatsu board. This pain, however, will eventually fade as your tolerance grows. These robust cacti have enough natural strength to stimulate your muscles and revitalize your feet.\n",
      "Each Yesfettle purchased includes two individually designed massage balls that serve a variety of purposes. Playing with this smooth ball can help you achieve greater flexibility in your toes while rolling another spiky ball under your foot will immediately stimulate the sole of your foot and help you release muscle tension in a matter of minutes. They both promote leg movement and assist users in developing good focus habits on the task at hand.\n",
      "We are doing our part to protect the environment and the health and well-being of your loved ones by developing a product with a low environmental impact. This means a long lifespan and good recyclability to reduce waste.\n",
      "We tested a variety of materials during the development phase, including PU, but our beta testers were concerned about its wear resistance and a slight odor. We eventually settled on TPR for the soft massage mat and high-density ABS for the workout platform, both of which are recyclable and reusable. It does not affect the quality, but it makes Yesfettle more environmentally friendly.\n",
      "Heat is yet another advantage that Yesfettle has that other massage devices do not. Heat has been shown to hasten natural recovery and alleviate pain. The Yesfettle platform includes a foot warmer to meet the physiological requirements of heating comfort. When graphene heats up, it emits far-infrared rays, which transfer heat energy to deeper parts of the human body. As a result, it helps to alleviate pain and sore muscles, improve blood circulation, reduce muscle spasms, and contribute to your holistic health.\n",
      " ⚠️ The weighing and counting functions require four AAA batteries to operate.\n",
      "A weight scale is a must-have item in any modern home. Yesfettle’s built-in digital scale（free to choose lb or kg mode） makes it easy to keep track of your daily weight. The scale is manually operated, you have complete control over whether it is turned on or off.\n",
      "The platform can support up to 400 lbs/180 kg. Available in two colors matte black and platinum grey. Choose your preferred color in the survey we send to you after the campaign ends.\n",
      "The three-in-one workout base is the pinnacle of practicability. It was thoughtfully designed to simulate all of the bulky gym equipment and machines and combine them into a single comprehensive workout concept. It includes a variety of functions such as push-ups, sit-ups, squats, Pilates, and more that can help you burn calories and stay in shape without leaving your house.\n",
      "With 20+ combo positions, the color-coded push-up base targets specific muscles (chest, shoulders, back, triceps) and promotes proper form, which can develop your major and minor muscle groups with the perfect fitness solution. It also enables fitness practitioners to create more training combinations.\n",
      "Whether you are a man or a woman, whether you are just starting on your fitness journey or a seasoned pro, this easy-to-follow mode will suit you perfectly and encourage you to stick to the end. \n",
      "Using digital counting, you can easily keep track of how many push-ups you have done and for how long, which can serve as motivation to help you meet daily goals.\n",
      "The back is non-slip design and resistant to wear. The sit-up bar is constructed of durable material, and the soft foam material wrapped around the handle enhances your grip. The entire device is really simple to install and operate. Now you can work out wherever you want, any time you please, and in any outfit you want.\n",
      " * The resistance bands are gifts but the pilates bar is not included in any reward tier. We are trying our best to make the base snap hook compatible with most of your bands at hand. \n",
      "Boost Your Fitness With Yesfettle app\n",
      "App for training guidance shown are not final, more changes will be made.\n",
      " The shipping costs will be collected separately before our fulfillment. The taxes are handled by our end.\n",
      "One of the most notable upfront production costs involves molding. We were unwilling to make concessions and settle on our prototypes. So, before launching our project, we purchased custom-made molds from an established, industry-leading manufacturer and conducted a trial manufacturing run to ensure a smooth transition from prototype to finished product.  \n",
      "I used to clean my grandmother’s house once a week when I was a kid. Nonetheless, she would have cleaned the living room by the time I arrived. I always told her she did not have to do that, but she was adamant. I had no idea why she felt compelled to do this every week at the time, but one day I found myself stuck at a desk for more than ten hours, my legs swelled up, my spin began to ache, As I jerked up, I felt a wave of vertigo. What's worse was that I had grown accustomed to this negative routine and had even accepted the negative effects of being sedentary. I finally realized why my grandmother insisted on cleaning by herself. It was something she could do to keep herself busy.  Every day, it is critical to move more.\n",
      "I didn't want to interrupt what I was doing to exercise, but I also didn't want to put my health at risk. I desired to achieve the best of both worlds. While looking for solutions, I came across a foot massage mat. This fantastic product piqued my interest to the point where I could not wait to tell my friends about it. To my surprise, everyone had a never-ending supply of ideas and imagination for improving and optimizing it. Since that day, we have had one goal in mind: to create an easy-to-use foot care product that can incorporate more movement into our hectic workday.  It took a full year of work, hundreds of designs, and numerous prototypes to get to where we are now. \n",
      "We are obsessed with creating quality products that lead to amazing results. Let us work for you while you work hard. So much love and gratitude to everyone who has been part of this journey!\n",
      "Our team members are placing the massage surfaces beneath their desks to benefit from the convenience of working and relaxing at the same time 🥰 .\n",
      "This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.\n",
      "This project is boosted by BackerCrew\n",

      "Stacy Has A Thing For Black Guys is an independent, feature film to be filmed in Dallas, Texas in March 2018.\n",
      "Think Get Out meets Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?\n",
      "The film is an adaptation of Ruben Carrazana's stage play by the same name. The play was produced by the theater collective known as The Tribe in Dallas in the summer of 2016 where it had a successful run and was named an Outstanding New Play or Musical by the Dallas-Fort Worth Theater Critics Forum, Best New Play By A Local Writer by TheaterJones, and was recommended for the American Theatre Critics Association/Harold and Mimi Steinberg New Play Award.\n",
      "The outpouring of love and support from the community was inspiring for everyone involved, and the play was entirely funded by the City of Dallas, which is unheard of. And now, we're turning it into a movie!\n",
      "We've got our cast, our crew, and we've already raised a significant portion of our budget due to a grant from the City of Dallas Office of Cultural Affairs as well as a number of individual investors. All we need now is a little bit of extra dough, mainly for post-production.\n",
      "Three people sit in a living room. A white married couple. And a black man. Drinking lemonade. And making small talk. However, as the night goes on, what started off as a seemingly safe and silly sex farce suddenly becomes slightly darker and more violent as hidden prejudices bubble up to the surface. In most contemporary films, the insecurities and anxieties that control our daily lives remain invisible, but Stacy Has A Thing For Black Guys operates with a heightened sense of awareness of the historical and social context in which we now live, offering a sharp and fiercely funny commentary on how we all choose to avoid honest conversations with others and ourselves about sex, gender, and race in America. TheaterJones called the script \"a smart, funny, and layered look at marriage\" that is \"fiercely funny in unexpected ways\" with \"twists [that] are always surprising\".\n",
      "Click here for TheaterJones review:\n",
      "“This play is fiercely funny in unexpected ways, and both the title and the substance have layers. All the more impressive considering that it is Carrazana’s first playwriting venture.” \n",
      "- Mark Lowry, TheaterJones\n",
      "Click here for D Magazine feature:\n",
      "“The play is a comedy, but Carrazana still wants the audience to hold up the mirror he feels all good theater should provide. In this case it might be more of a funhouse mirror.” \n",
      "- Katy Lemieux, D Magazine\n",
      "Here is a video interview with the playwright and director of the 2016 stage production:\n",
      " \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The major challenge facing any independent film is distribution. How do you get your movie out there for people to see? With the proliferation of streaming services and video-on-demand options, the opportunities are endless, but the goal for most filmmakers is still to get their film into theaters. \n",
      "\n",
      "The most obvious way to do that is by submitting the film to film festivals and hoping someone picks it up for distribution. Many film festivals receive thousands and thousands of submissions, but can only screen a hundred or so (if that), which makes this route of seeking distribution very difficult. In order to better your chances of succeeding on the film festival circuit, filmmakers need to develop a film festival plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of our plan we have factored film festival submission fees into our budget. 20% of our festival submission budget will go towards major festivals (Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, etc.), 50% will go towards mid-range festivals (South by Southwest, Slamdance, etc.), and 30% will go towards smaller/local festivals (Oak Cliff Film Festival, Dallas VideoFest, Dallas International Film Festival, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also created a festival submission timeline where we have researched each festival in-depth (their eligibility criteria, programming from previous years, etc.) and prioritized the festivals that a) our film has a better chance of getting into, and b) actually screen films versus those festivals that merely accept your submission money but don't do anything to promote it or get it in front of people.\n",

      "Moss is an online journal of Northwest writing. We started Moss in the summer of 2014 as a venue for showcasing and supporting the talented and imaginative voices of the Pacific Northwest, with a special focus on emerging writers and a mission of celebrating and preserving the Northwest’s robust literary culture. Moss is a community-first project; every issue of Moss is made available online for free, we don’t charge submission fees, and we pay every writer we publish.\n",
      "Now in its second volume, Moss has been covered by The Stranger, City Arts, The Portland Mercury, and The LA Review of Books’ new site The Offing, among other publications, and has helped bring the work of Northwest writers to more than 10,000 unique online visitors. The writers we’ve published and interviewed include Rebecca Brown, Peter Mountford, Matt Briggs, Corinne Manning, Charles Finn, Janie Miller, Ryan Boudinot, and many more.\n",
      "The money raised from this Kickstarter will be used to publish a print edition of the first three issues of Moss, compiling our entire first volume of fiction, non-fiction, and interviews into a beautiful, accessible, and tangible print book. The books will be printed by BookMobile, an independent typesetting and production house based in Minneapolis that prints books for Graywolf, Coffee House Press, and number of other esteemed publishers. The funds from this Kickstarter will allow us to do a small print run of 300 copies while still insuring the highest possible printing quality. \n",
      "The web has been an amazingly effective platform for us, and has enabled us to release a lot of great writing into the world without undue overhead. But, we also recognize that not everyone wants to read fiction and essays on a computer screen. For some, paper and ink simply offer a more comfortable or convenient reading experience. The permanency of a physical book also means people will be able to share this writing in a more meaningful way than they can with a link to a website. Our hope is that copies of this book will be passed around, checked out of libraries, and re-discovered on family shelves 20 or 50 years from now. We’ve earmarked copies from the print run for donation to libraries and schools, to help us reach an audience outside of our online sphere, and are making the books available at-cost for individuals with limited financial resources.\n",
      "In short, our decision to make a print book is about creating a new way to read Moss that will help us share this great writing with as many potential readers as possible. And as an added bonus, we’ll be including a few surprises beyond the content that’s already been published in our online issues.\n",
      "For a contribution of only $10.00, you can get an at-cost copy of Moss: Volume One. By contributing more, you can get a bunch of great rewards, including stickers, shirts, totes, photo prints, and more—plus the knowledge that you are helping us to spread the work of hardworking Northwest writers to as broad an audience as possible. Any proceeds beyond the costs needed to produce our backer rewards and print our initial run of books will go directly towards paying the writers we’ll publish in future issues of Moss.\n",
      "Not to worry! While we only publish writing by current residents of the Northwest and those with a substantial connection to the region, we’re not an exclusive club. A big part of our mission is to bring Northwest writing to readers in other parts of the country and around the world—that’s you!\n",
      "For Canadian backers, we ask for a $5 supplement to your pledge to cover extra shipping costs. For all other international backers, we require a $10 supplement.\n",
      "Though we pay every writer we publish, make our online issues available for free, and have no advertising revenue or submission fees, our online issues have been self-funded up to this point, and will continue to be self-funded unless we significantly surpass our Kickstarter goal. However, the upfront costs of even a small print-run are substantial—well above the funding we’re able to personally cover for our online content. Kickstarter allows us to offer a diversity of purchase options and special rewards without risking these upfront costs, and without sacrificing the quality of our product or reader experience by incorporating advertising into our site.\n",
      "Most importantly, Kickstarter offers an exciting way for Moss to engage directly with our community of readers and writers as we embark on this new stage of the project. We truly believe that a print edition of Moss offers a chance for the broadest possible audience to support, discover, and read the work of these incredible Northwest writers.\n",

Growing a meal: tending the plant, harvesting your labors and a recipe to prepare what you've grown, start to finish! Beautifully illustrated educational pages of botanicals and appetizing photographs of plated foods. It feels like the time for such a book to be born. A grown up plant science book mixed with home economics kitchen skills, something Bill Nye and Julia Child could both give a thumbs up to. \n",
      "  After years of cooking for loved ones and having some pretty high praise, I am being bold. This is my dream. Offering tutorials for those who think they can't grow or cook food. This is my homesteaders start to getting back to our roots. Great skills are not lost. Simple can be delicious. All concepts that I want to prove within a few hundred instructional pages. I truly believe in growing your own food. Not just for the sake of saving money, knowing exactly where your food comes from, or choosing exactly what you like to eat. All of those things are of course healthy goals, but what about the joy of cultivating something naturally amazing with your own two hands? And then combine that with the joy of creating beauty in a meal you saw from seed to feast. Absolutely soul fulfilling. There's something rebellious about being able to just do it all for yourself. Feels damn good. \n",
      "  This book is for anyone. I know it sounds corny but I mean that. Anyone who can cook but thinks the have a black thumb. Avid gardeners who tend to flowers and shrubs without giving vegetables a thought because they feel inadequate in the kitchen. Even the curious who have always dabbled in food and gardening but just want to learn more and link the two. I am excited to share the fun facts and debunk some of the difficulties. I hope home growing what you cook will become your hobby and your habit too!\n",
      "  Over the last two years I have mapped out and perfected my layout. The foods prepared for the creation of the book have been selected specifically featuring items grown by me or by local farmers I am glad to call my friends. Meats are from families I know and support. Dairy from animals I have hugged. Produce harvested by hands I shake at the Farmers Market every weekend. The illustrated portions of this book are done by my sister who is an extremely talented artist. The photography is masterfully done by a brilliant up and coming local photographer. Self publishing, which will save over 40%, is set and ready to go to press. The last step has been funding. That's where you, my fellow foodies come in. Please take a moment to look at the rewards created to thoroughly show my appreciation for your much needed help. If you are unfamiliar with Kicksarter I will summarize the scoop. If I reach my goal this becomes a real tangible thing! If I miss the mark, nothing happens and you are refunded. It's all or nothing here. I am confident in this project and I feel really good about crowdfunding this way! The printing and distribution process is slated in my mind for arrival Spring 2018 I have the support of local book stores and several shops that will carry this book. \n",

      "Jane Ayeko-Kümmeth and Ulli Schauen are asking you to help deliver investigative journalism to the Africans about the ongoing male circumcision campaign which has been pushed into the continent with massive public relations campaigns. \n",
      "\n",
      " Our goal is challenging, but we also promise a lot: At least ten episodes in two languages - Swahili and Englisch - to be broadcast for free by African radio stations.\n",
      "It was mainly US organisations which have been organizing  the \"medical circumcision\" of African boys and men in 15 subsaharan countries* in the name of combatting AIDS. \n",
      "Between 2007 and 2020, around 23 million males were circumcised due to this massive campaign (source: WHO). The so-called VMMC** drive  was started after three clinical studies had shown in 2007 that the chance for a man of being infected with the AIDS virus by intercourse with a woman was reduced by around 60 percent, while critiques say they showed that this clinical trials had no effect - or even an adverse effect in real life.\n",
      " Es waren vor allem US-Organisationen, die dafür gesorgt haben, dass im Namen der AIDS-Bekämpfung bisher 23 Millionen Jungen und Männer in 15 Ländern Afrikas beschnitten wurden. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO hatte das 2007 empfohlen, nachdem drei klinische Studien gezeigt hatten dass das Ansteckungsrisiko von Männern, beim Verkehr mit einer Frau infiziert zu werden, um 60 Prozent sinkt. Kritiker sagen sie haben gezeigt, dass das im richtigen Leben nichts besagt, ja sogar das Gegenteil bewirkt: höhere AIDS-Quoten.\n",
      " This project will bring the results of Ulli Schauen's extensive journalistic research about the topic to Africa via a series of at least ten radio episodes in English, Suahili and - depending on the result of the funding  - even more African languages. In German language, you find the radio documentary online here. \n",
      "Für ein Deutschlandfunk-Radiofeature (es steht hier online) hat Ulli Schauen in Kenia und darüber hinaus intensiv recherchiert. Dieses Kickstarter-Projekt wird die Ergebnisse als Serie für afrikanische Radiostationen in mindestens zwei Sprachen verfügbar machen, in Englisch und Kisuaheli, bei höheren Einnahmen auch in mehr Sprachen. \n",
      "From the beginning, the effect of mass circumcision for combatting AIDS has been highly controversial. In 2020, the main donor of the campaign, the US Presidential Fund PEPFAR stopped funding medical circumcision of the group in which they had been most successful: the under-15-year olds. They wrote that almost all \"adverse events\" like infections, fistula and even mutilation had happened to young boys and newborns. Another study showed that the number of \"adverse events\" was grossly underreported by the circumcizing organizations. The stop is widely unkowny by the time of writing, circumcision teams attributed the moratorium to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n",
      "Die meisten Beschneidungen wurden bei den unter-15-Jährigen und Neugeborenen durchgeführt. Genau diese aber wurden im Jahr 2020 vom US-Fonds PEPFAR gestoppt. Man hatte festgestellt, dass fast alle Komplikationen bei den Jüngeren geschahen - und besonders viele bei den Babies: Fisteln, Infektionen und sogar Verstümmelungen. Und es gibt offenbar eine hohe Dunkelziffer. Der Stopp ist nicht kommuniziert worden. Manche Zirkumzisions-Teams schreiben ihn der COVID-19 Pandemie zu.  \n",
      "Ulli has extensively researched the topic, recorded sound and conducted interviews about the topic in January / February in Western Kenya and Nyanza. He has also talked to experts in Uganda, USA, France and Germany. This resulted in a 51-minute radio documentary in German language that you can tune into here on the webpage of the national public radio Deutschlandfunk. \n",
      "Note: even though his investigations have made Ulli highly critical of the campaign, we consider his work as balanced journalism, not as \"intactivist\" campaign material.\n",
      "He really did not like the fact that he could not convince any radio station to fund a radio production in English and that, so far, the results of his work about the African topic have been presented only in Germany and not to those who are affected most: the African citizens in the 15 target countries. \n",
      "Ugandan journalist Jane Ayeko-Kümmeth and Ulli Schauen are teaming up to make the many aspects of the circumcision campaign also heard in African radio through a series of shorter reports (of 5 to ten minutes in average). In addition, they will ask international experts to avail themselves for long-distance interviews in the radio programmes.\n",
      "This way, the Africans themselves will be able to discuss it among them and in their media. The series will also include new material that did not make it into the German radio documentary. \n",
      "Zusammen mit der uganisch-deutschen Journalistin Jane Ayeko-Kümmeth produziert Ulli nach erfolgreichem Crowdfunding die afrikanische Radioserie. Sie wird auch neues Material enthalten, das es nicht in die deutsche Radioversion geschafft hat. \n",
      "The high-quality production in a professional studio will be financed through crowdfunding in the Northern Hemisphere and produced in English and Swahili. In further steps, other vernacular African languages may follow, depending on demand.\n",
      "Radio stations in Africa will be allowed to broadcast the series for free whereas media in other parts of the world  will have to pay royalty fees if they want to have it. Each episode will be accompanied by a web page where the public and the radio presenters can find authentic and verified information about the topic - easy to be used. \n",
      "In case of funding above the kickstarter-minimum, we will not just keep the money but instead produce more episodes  plus in additional languages. New languages may include Dholuo, Ateso, Zulu or French, for example - depending on demand by African radio stations. \n",
      "We estimate  that for each additional 2,000 Euros we may cover producing the whole  series in an additional language, whereas each additional 1,000 Euros  would allow the research, recording and production of two additional  episodes.\n",
      "So wird das Geld verwendet: \n",
      "Wenn mehr Geld zusammenkommt, können auf Nachfrage andere afrikanische Sprachen produziert werden, wie z.B. Dholuo, Ateso, Zulu oder Französisch.  Wir schätzen, dass je 2.000 Euro zusätzlich uns eine weitere Sprachproduktion ermöglicht und je 1.000 Euro zwei weitere Folgen der Serie. \n",
      "This is the concept for the episodes at the moment. In the process, African radio stations will have their say in it: \n",
      "Die Titel der Episoden auf Deutsch findet Ihr am Fuß dieser Seite.\n",
      "What is the foreskin good for? The international medical community has been more interested in finding out how it can be safely cut and what the benefits of cutting could be. After several thousand years of male circumcision practice, finally some results emerge.\n",
      "The WHO process that endorsed male circumcision for combatting AIDS was and is still highly controversial. Critiques say the technical conference in Geneva, March 2007, was extremely biased, and opponents in the science community had no say at all.\n",
      "With or without? This is the question that bothers most men as well as women in Africa.  While men that have been circumcised at infant stage cannot compare, many African men can – if they have been cut at a sexually active age. They do talk about it, but everybody has his own truth to it.\n",
      "The US Presidential Fund against AIDS, PEPFAR, has stopped financing and organizing the circumcision of young boys under 15 years and of babies. Their own records say it had too many adverse effects like infections, fistula and “miscuts”. Up to 2019 the majority of cut foreskins belonged to the young boys. Were they robbed of their right to decide in an informed way?\n",
      "“We changed the culture” says Prof. Robert Bailey of the University of Illinois, one of the chief proponents for male circumcision. This is and was done by well-orchestrated PR campaigns in all the 15 African target countries. Road Shows, pop songs, sponsored radio shows and the participation of African state agencies and foremost endorsement by ethnic leaders created a consensus that cutting the foreskin is good for many reasons.\n",
      "Even critiques acknowledge the results of scientific studies. It was shown that men have 60 percent lower risk of being infected when having sex with an HIV-positive woman. What exactly does it mean? And what is the effect in the long run?  For years now, the VMMC proponents at the WHO have been mathematically calculating high numbers of prevented infections through the VMMC campaign. But critiques say this is totally unrealistic because a vaccine that works only in 60 percent of the cases is worthless, and other factors will still cause a spread of the virus.\n",
      "Among the African Ethnies, circumcision is a hot topic. Among the Turkana in Northern Kenya, a man is a man only with a foreskin, but in the neighboring Samburu a real man must be cut.  So, tribal jokes and tribal violence have been using the topic of circumcision. And now, for 13 years, the VMMC campaign has been cutting through all this giving an upper hand to the traditionally circumcising communities, but to what effect? In some cases, it has increased violence and forced circumcisions by the traditionally circumcising ethnic communities.\n",
      "At least in Uganda and Kenya, the same scientists whose research findings showed that circumcision reduced the infection risk by 60 percent are now part of the circumcision organizations. Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University keeps promoting circumcision through its video channel and other means alongside with Makerere University in Kampala. But if science is part of the implementation of its results, are they still independent? Prof. Michel Garenne says no.\n",
      "Largely unnoticed by Africans, pediatricians mainly (but not exclusively) in the Northern hemisphere have fought over the question if routinely circumcising babies for non-religious reasons is ethically okay. On the pro-side were mainly US doctors, on the contra side pediatricians from other countries like Germany. We inform about that discussion and ask why it was not taking place in Africa as well. Everybody can find the pro- and con groups on facebook fiercely fighting each other, and most are based in the United States.\n",
      "Their names are PEPFAR, CDC, KEMRI, FACES, UNICEF, UNAIDS or the WHO. On the example of Kenya, we explore and explain who is doing what and who is deciding what. For the circumcision clients it looks like the Kenyan state was acting, but most of the times it is the United States behind it. And it may well be that staff in the health sector is lacking because they have moved to better paid jobs in the NGOs who work for male circumcision.  \n",
      "At one point the success statistics were so good - they “showed” that in some parts of Kenya 180 percent of the males were already circumcised. Excuse me, 180 percent? The numbers were corrected downward by a rough estimation. But are they now correct? “We changed the culture”, says one scientist concerning the Luo community which is traditionally a non- circumcising community. By now, peer pressure left no choice for a young Luo boy other than having circumcision.\n",
      "In theory, it must be an “informed consent” that leads to circumcision – consent by a male who has been fully and impartially informed about advantages and disadvantages. But this is often not the case.  Promoters have been pushing males to circumcise with incorrect or inappropriate arguments as if the foreskin was evil and as if leaving it intact was irresponsible behavior towards the girlfriend. They had too much pressure to reach the target numbers, they started working sloppily and gave out money even to young boys for bringing their friends into the operation theatre. \n",
      "Critiques like Professor Garenne say that the circumcision campaign leads to more risky behaviour by men: Frequent sex without condomes. And thereby the message raises the infection rate of AIDS. \n",
      "This is what  happened to Steven Ochieng who had himself circumcised because all his friends were circumcised and did not even want to walk along with him. After his foreskin was gone he thought he could be the champion with girls and felt free to have sex with many. From what he understood, his friends had told him he was protected even without a condom. Now he is suffering from AIDS, the disease with no cure.\n",
      "\"We have promoted condom use in Africa for millions of dollars. But they do not use them,\" says one scientist promoting circumcision.  He claims that a young American has as many different sex partners as an African - but one after another and with a pause, not at the same time. The circumcisers claim that these are the reasons why they have to resort to removing foreskins in the most affected regions. In this episode, we put the arguments to test - and open them for discussion among the African audience. Some even say that the whole campaign could be racist.\n",
      "Some women want their partner to be definietly circumcised. Others love to have him with foreskin. Apart from the different individual female views, there are scientific findings about the effect of being circumcised or not on the female partner. We report about both too and let the people discuss.\n",
      "Programmes driven by foreign donors attract  qualified personal from the public agencies to NGOs. What is the effect of the VMMC campaign (\"Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision\") on the medical sector in Africa?  Is there a brain drain? Does it pull people away from curative positions to foreskin-cutting?  These are some of the questions we asked and bring you details through our report.\n",
      "This is just a call-in program with a short intro, a teaser to get the listeners to share their thoughts and experience.\n",
      "Depending on ideas shared and demand raised, there may be even more episodes.\n",
      "You find Ulli Schauen's profile on the project founder page - click on the pic on top. \n",

      "Hello! My name is Samantha Whitten and I'm the artist of The GaMERCaT, a webcomic that mixes gaming humor with mischievous felines. It started in 2011 as a fun little side project and quickly gained popularity from both gamers and cat lovers alike, and now has a steady once-a-week update schedule (every Monday!)\n",
      "The slice-of-life comic features an appropriately-named cat with access to a large library of games and an over-active imagination, who literally dives into popular franchises and tackles topics in gamer life from a cat's perspective. He's haunted by a materialistic fairy and preoccupied with raising a gamer kitten protege, all while he and his friends fly under the radar of blissfully ignorant humans.\n",
      "The comic is free to read online at TheGaMERCaT.com, but readers have long been asking for a printed version, so I'm finally here to deliver the first volume! The book will include the first 100 comics, plus a bit of extra bonus content if we can hit some stretch goals ;) How exciting!\n",
      " \n",
      "The book will be a perfect bound paperback with a 12pt gloss cover, sized at 9\" x 6\" and roughly 130 pages long. The art and layouts of some comics will be tweaked, mostly to be more suitable for print or to convert animated panels to static images.\n",
      "The book will also include concept art, as well as pet profiles of my cats, who serve as inspiration for the personalities of the characters and influence their antics.\n",
      " \n",
      " As a special bonus sale for this Kickstarter I have exclusive enamel pins available! This pixel Gamercat pin is unique to this project and will not be sold in the online store, so if you like it this is your chance to grab it.\n",
      "The standard pin is unlimited, but the shiny gold metal version is limited to only 200 pieces and reserved for the special shiny bundle pledge tier.\n",
      "During the first Kickstarter I offered over-sized vinyl stickers of Gamercat and Glitch. They were super popular, so I decided to add Pixel and Sweet and offer all four as an add-on in this project. Who doesn't love stickers?\n",
      "If funding exceeds the main goal I have some bonuses planned! This time I would prefer to enhance the main focus of the project rather than doing a bunch of extra products, so I've kept the stretch goals focused on and around the book.\n",

If we reach these bonuses early I will get started on them while the project is still running in the hopes of getting the book submitted as soon as the Kickstarter is done.\n",
      "File approval and sample production can take 2-4 weeks, and if everything is good on the first go, the book can go into production and will likely take 4-6 weeks. Shipping will add another 4-6 weeks, so the best case scenario for receiving the books is possibly in December, but I'm estimating delivery in January to add a little safety buffer. Please do not count on these for Christmas gifts!\n",
      "The funds from this project will go towards producing the books, the bonus items, and shipping all rewards. Kickstarter takes 5% in fees, and Stripe (the payment processor) takes another 3%-5%. I also need to reserve a percentage for US taxes at the end of the year.\n",

      "There's nothing like the thrill of playing a real musical instrument. Unfortunately for most, learning can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience. That's why we built the gTar.\n",
      "The gTar is a fully digital guitar that\n",
      "makes it easy for anybody to play music, regardless of experience. All you have\n",
      "to do is dock your iPhone in the body, load up the gTar app, and an array of\n",
      "interactive LEDs along the fretboard will show you how to play. \n",
      "You may be asking yourself what it means for a guitar to be \"digital.\" While most guitars have pickups to amplify the sound of vibrating strings, the gTar has none - instead, we've designed the gTar with sensors that detect exactly what you're playing in real-time and relay each note to your iPhone, which then produces the actual sound. This makes it possible for us to do all kinds of exciting things, so let's get into it!\n",
      "Start With Songs You Already Love\n",
      "The free gTar app comes bundled with a library of songs that you can start playing right away. We're adding more every week and we'd love to hear your suggestions.  Also, if you've been itching to play a specific song check out the Song Selection reward tier where we will work with you to get a song of your choosing on to the platform.  One of the things that's so exciting about the gTar is the ability to incorporate different sounds outside of the guitar. So if you want to play a song with a big, warm synth or a booming grand piano, it's all possible with the gTar.\n",
      "Stop Learning, Just Play\n",
      "We think that everybody should be able to have fun playing music, regardless of how long they've been playing or how much time they have to practice. That's why we built an intuitive feature called SmartPlay, which mutes out incorrect notes as you play and nudges you along as you play through difficult songs.\n",
      "Most Guitars Only Have One Level of Difficulty. We Have Three.\n",
      "If you've never played the guitar before, start with Easy, where you only need to play the open strings. This gives you the chance to start playing your favorite songs right away while getting a hands on feel for the strings. SmartPlay is in effect here, so if you accidentally hit the wrong string, you won't hear anything. \n",
      "When you've graduated from Easy, you can move up to Medium and start playing the frets and strings at the same time. Don't worry though, Smart Play is still in effect, so you can continue to play without the fear of messing up.\n",
      "When you've mastered a song and want to take it to the next level, try playing in Hard. Here, the gTar will continue to display the correct notes, but allows you to play whatever you want. SmartPlay stops working here, so every note you play will ring out.\n",
      "Go Further\n",
      "Since the gTar is powered by the iPhone, it can sound however you want. Try playing around in Free Play, where you can choose from a variety of guitar models, keyboards, synths, or even drums. Free Play also provides an expression pad for tweaking sound effects (chorus, echo, reverb, and distortion) and a panel that gives you full control of the LEDs.\n",
      "Where Does the Money Go?\n",
      "Over the last year, we've taken our completed hardware design to China where we've been working with an amazing manufacturing team in Shenzhen that have helped us take the gTar from a schematic to a finished product. The gTars in the photos/video you see are all working, fully functional prototypes.\n",
      "We've already invested in the tooling and have lined up our supply chain.  We now need your help to fund the initial batch of production units. After the campaign ends, we expect it to take 2-3 months to produce, assemble, and ship your finished gTars.\n",
      "More specifically your contribution will help us fund the following:\n",
      "- Custom Guitar Body Manufacturing- Volume Component Ordering (sensors, processors)- Production Assembly- Production Quality Assurance and Testing\n",
      "Here's our team assembling the first pilot units. Due to the complexity of the gTar's assembly, we've had to iterate through more than 10 prototypes - these pilot units were built to ensure that our manufacturing processes would work at scale.\n",
      "The Story of the gTar\n",
      "Incident began out of a personal need for a guitar that could plug into the computer to compose music digitally. When the first functional prototypes started coming together, we were inspired by innovative musical instruments like the Monome and decided to try adding LEDs to the fretboard. We started to see how fun and easy it was for someone with no musical background to interact with the bright, colorful lights and we knew we had something worth pursuing. \n",

We plan to offer an SDK in the future, so if you're interested in building apps for the gTar, shoot us an e-mail (dev@incidenttech.com).

      "Does the gTar need to be tuned? Since the gTar is entirely digital, it doesn't care whether the strings are in tune or not. Keeping reasonable tension on the strings will improve the performance and sensitivity of the gTar.\n",
      "Where does the gTar get power from? The gTar has an internal battery that lasts between 6 to 8 hours on a full charge.  To both power and charge the gTar, you can use the included USB charger or plug the gTar into any standard USB dock on a computer or charger of equivalent power. \n",
      "What phones will be supported? Currently we plan to support the iPhone 4/4S. We hope to support other devices in the future.\n",
      "How do I get the gTar app? The gTar app will be available for free in the App Store before we ship the gTar. It is already been built and approved.\n",
      "Will this teach me how to play on a \"normal\" guitar? The strings and fret layout of the gTar has been designed to be virtually identical to that of a traditional guitar, playing it will teach you the same fundamentals that you would need to play on a traditional guitar.\n",
      "How do Song Selections work? If you've selected any of the reward tiers that offer you a Song Selection, we will work with you to integrate a song of your choosing into the app. Since some things (like licensing restrictions) are out of our hands, we can't guarantee that we'll be able to include your first choice. However, we'll work with you to find something you like and will enjoy playing on the gTar.Can I integrate the gTar into an existing guitar?The gTar is a completely redesigned solution that cannot be retrofitted onto a traditional guitar.  If you are a guitar manufacturer that is interested in integrating our technology into your designs, please contact us directly.  \n",

Our special Little Kids Rock reward tier allows you to purchase two gTars - one for you and one to be donated to LKR as part of a pilot program we're launching. To learn more, check out LittleKidsRock.org!\n",
      "What about international shipping?\n",
      "Shipping a guitar around the world is no easy task, but we wanted to make the gTar as accessible as possible for international backers. For backers in Canada, shipping is a flat fee of $10. For everywhere else in the world, shipping is $60. You can add this to an existing pledge by selecting \"Manage My Pledge\" and adjusting it appropriately.\n",

      "\"How remarkable is it, that in the year 2015 we can still hear the voices of those who’ve experienced World War 2? 90 year old Hal O’Leary, a West Virginia native and veteran of the Allied campaign against the Nazis in Western Europe, wrote an enduring and reflective memoir piece that we have the honor of sharing with you in this issue. Other highlights from veterans in this issue: Cold War era Army vet Alex Marshall imagines the view of an ancient Chinese soldier from his Meditation Tao series of poems, Iraq War vet Alecc Costanzi emits a pungent warning in his poetry, Jon Turner, another veteran of the war in Iraq, shows us a glimpse of the “enemy’s” perspective, Doug D’Elia, who was a medic in Vietnam, shares with us the difficulty of reassuring a dying soldier,  Lisa Van Wormer, an Iraq War veteran, accomplishes the near-impossible task of expressing the sorrow and bonding that occurs after a fellow soldier’s death, in second person mind you, Jay Dardes, a Vietnam era vet, describes an encounter between a vet with ptsd and a therapist, and James Smith, a veteran of the 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam, gives us an outstanding and at times humorous look at the hypocrisy of those who say they support our troops, yet are not sincere.\"\n",
      "The date for our magazine release party and poetry reading is May 17th at the Pen and Pencil Club on Latimer Street in Philadelphia. We will be keeping this page up to date with news about the event.\n",

      "Depending on how much money we raise, we will be printing a minimum of 50 copies for this issue through Moonstone publishing. Thanks to Larry Robin and all the wonderful workers at Moonstone Arts Center, we are certain that the magazines will look just as gorgeous as they did for the third issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only significant challenge we faced for our third issue was the awful ice storm that happened to coincide with our launch party. Even though the weather was so treacherous, we still had over two dozen supporters show up to our reading. Let's just hope for good weather on May 17th!\n",

      "Abort Mission is a 15-minute comedy about a high school English teacher, Danielle, whose lax attitude toward teaching backfires when one of her students, Jasmine, tries to coerce her into paying for their abortion. Danielle must decide whether or not she wants to risk losing her job to help Jasmine, or to leave her to face the wrath of her mother alone.\n",

      "Brianna Byrdsong (Director): Brianna is absolutely wearing pants in the above image—it's just that her fall ‘17 aesthetic is looking like she ISN’T wearing any pants. Her desire to play make-believe is what got her into filmmaking in the first place; she’ll be graduating with a BFA in Directing from Temple University in Spring 2018. What's happening after college? She'll be living in sweet, sweet debt in Los Angeles, California, where she studied away this summer, interning at Women In Film and Fenty Corp. She hopes to work in development and write and direct comedies for both television and film. She's been on the writing team for Temple Smash, Temple’s student-run sketch comedy show, since her junior year. Next semester, she'll be co-head writer, meaning there's going to be an influx of sketches about talking animals. Fun fact! With the money she (hopes to) make from filmmaking, she wants to open up a Montessori school in her home state of Maryland where Uggs will be banned and puka shell necklaces will be mandatory. \n",
      "Ryan Kuna (Director of Photography): Ryan is a junior at Temple University where he's majoring in film with a concentration in cinematography and minoring in art history. He’s famous for being super passionate about lighting, so much so that we're convinced Sean Paul’s 2002 hit, “Gimme The Light”, was written specifically for him. On top of being an amazing DP, Ryan is also a lover of cashews, a stand-up guy, and a hard worker. He's currently working on a feature called Chuck Lawson and the Night of the Invaders with director and frequent collaborator, Tyler Bonner, who will also be acting in Abort Mission!\n",
      "Deanna Crawford (Producer): Deanna is a current senior at Temple University finishing her degree in Film and Media Arts with a minor in Psychology. She is currently the production office intern for Lavelle Productions where she assists with transcripts, organization and research for a feature length documentary they're producing. She's previously worked as a producer and unit production manager on films such as True Grit LIVE!, Fleshing Out, and The Shepherd. Her pastimes include writing, playing the piano, and hanging out with her cats. In the future, she hopes to continue to produce content that features the voices of women and people of color.\n",
      " \n",
      "Ian Mansberger (Editor): Ian is a senior at Temple where he is majoring in film with a concentration in post-production. He took part in Temple's LA study away program last spring where he interned at The Hollywood Reporter. He did SUCH an amazing job that they extended his internship all the way through July! Dude is GOOD. Ian's ultimate dream? Editing for television as well as for world-renowned acapella group, Pentatonix’s, music videos. Ian loves Pentatonix. Seriously, Ian, geez. But, I get it they're incredible.\n",
      "Devin O’Brien (Co-Producer): Devin is a sophomore film major at Temple University who has worked alongside Brianna since the beginning of his freshman year. He is a writer for TUTV’s Temple Smash, and this semester he will be joining Brianna as co-head writer. They aim to flood the show with sketches about Lucas Grabeel of High School Musical and Foodboy fame, Lucas if you’re out there please donate, we might even have a cameo spot for you. Devin is also Vice President of Temple’s Improv Club, is a founding member of improv team The Parliament, and piloted the role of Johnny in the world premiere of Green Day’s American Idiot on a high school stage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Claudia Hoffman (Line Producer): Claudia is a sophomore film student at Temple. She hopes to take part in the Producing concentration, which will ultimately aid her in journey toward meeting and working with her favorite artist, Frank Ocean. Claudia LOVES film, it’s usually all she’s ever thinking about. She wants to graduate and move to New York to pursue her producing career and hopefully along the way make some very ~cool~ films and a lot of great memes. If you know of any good food places in the Philly or NYC area, she will gladly take suggestions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiona Tagliente (Line Producer): Fiona is a writer, comedian and overall jazzy person born and raised in South Philly (sad). She’s a sophomore at Temple where she majors in film and will eventually concentrate in Screenwriting. She enjoys doing stand-up and writing sketches but when she's not doing the funnies, she likes to watch lots of trashy reality shows and read conspiracy theories. After college she wants to work in the world of television and one day, write and produce her own television show. Fiona also notes that she hopes to eventually stop catfishing her brother and get really good at cursive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaclyn Silvestri (Location Consultant): Jaclyn Silvestri is a junior Media Studies and Production major with a concentration in Media Production. Currently, she serves as Lighting Director/Producer/Social Media Coordinator for the TUTV program, Temple SMASH, which is Temple University’s student-run live sketch comedy show much like Saturday Night Live. Jaclyn is super stoked to be a part of this project because she loves comedy, women’s rights, equal representation in media, Brianna’s comedic wit and Ryan’s sick lights. Jaclyn hopes to move up in her producing experience, both in television and film, and loves having the ability to do both because of these super dope creative funny people!\n",
      "Udochi Ekwerike (Production Designer): Udochi, a Philadelphia native, is in her third year at Temple University studying Film and Media Arts with a BFA concentration in Screenwriting. In her three years at Temple, Udochi has been developing herself into a writer-director, producer and art director. Her current work has been featured in Temple University's Diamond Screen Film Festival as well as The Blackstar Film Festival. Udochi is also a top tier human being and deserves all the Fenty Beauty her heart desires. \n",

      "Bryn Antaran (Assistant Director): Brynn Antaran is an undergraduate film student in her third year at Temple University. She's recently been accepted into the Directing BFA program and is using her new knowledge to create stories that explore feminist issues and American regionalism. She also makes a mean chocolate chip cookie. Catch her on the next episode of TLC's 'My Strange Addiction' obsessing over organizing spreadsheets into the wee hours of the morn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the ten of us, there are a number of current and past Temple students signed on to make the film the best and weirdest it can be! \n",
      "I love high school movies. It's my favorite genre of movie—sorry not sorry to anyone who thinks I'm garbage for that (Apocalypse Now SUCKS. Just kidding, I haven't seen it but I know in my heart of hearts that Ferris Bueller's Day Off is light years better). My infatuation with these comedies inspired me to make something slightly more mature, and with slightly more people of color than we're used to seeing in those films...and by slightly I mean that unlike most films in general, this one stars two women of color.\n",
      "What's important to note about this film is that the story is not specific to women of color, and that's kind of the point; majority of the films and TV shows that come out of Hollywood star mostly white people for no reason at all. There's nothing about the characters' lifestyles that makes it pertinent for them to be white, so why continue to disregard the lack or representation that's industry-wide? Even when there is representation, the characters of color can often be stereotypical or white-washed. I acknowledge the progress Hollywood has made over the years, but for a show like Game of Thrones (which is FANTASY) to have as little diversity as it does, makes absolutely no sense.\n",
      "On top of my want to prioritize diversity, it is also important to me to normalize women's health issues by showing Jasmine's want for an abortion without going into depth into her justification for it, or talking about the morality at all. I believe it is a woman's right to choose what they want to do with their bodies, and our various health issues and needs should not be politicized or shamed. This is not a comedy about abortion, but abortion is an aspect of the story. Seriously, there aren't even any abortion jokes in it however, the first drafts of the script are a different story...\n",
      "Unfortunately, Ryan won't agree to shoot the film on an LG Chocolate, so majority of our budget will be allotted to camera equipment. We're trying to achieve a very specific, vintage-y, camera-movement heavy look with this film. Anamorphic lenses allow us to shoot in a widescreen format and fill our compositions with a lot of detail so that we can best convey visually the story and all of it's weird quirks. \n",
      "Additional equipment funds will be spent on car rigs for our car scenes in which we have to put the camera on the hood of the car (No, unfortunately there won't be any car chase scenes featuring Vin Diesel. He's unavailable). We need the proper gear to ensure that the lighting and camera setups are done safely. \n",
      "Also, we need to feed our crew so that everybody stays happy and nobody walks off because of a limited number of granola bars. \n",
      "Below is a breakdown of our needs in the form of an aesthetically pleasing chart:\n",
      " \n",
      "  \n",
      "In addition to the rewards pictured below (Abort Mission condom, notebook, T-shirt, and poster), we are also offering special thank you videos in which Brianna and Ryan will dance to the Beyoncé song of your choice! Or, if you want to get REAL fancy, we could make a music video of us dancing to any song of your choice. If you feel like pledging our entire budget, Brianna will tattoo Michael Cera's knees on her. Seem random? We actually mention his knees in the script, so it's pretty relevant. She's willing to live with the illustration of the knees of a stranger on her forever if it means this film will get made, and it will only get made with your support! We're going all or nothing, dude!!! \n",
      " \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "There are a ton of things that could pose a threat to our production: locations could fall through, actors could be no-shows, winter weather could put safety at risk, Missy Elliot could stop by and do a private concert for us--how are we expected to work if Missy Elliot does a private concert for us? We can't turn down Missy Elliot, you understand that, right?  \n",
      "\n",
      "But listen up, baby, we're film school undergraduates, which means we have a butt-load of anxiety (because we still have a lot to learn), but also if we're crazy enough to pay thousands of dollars so that we can be stressed out 24/7, then we're certainly crazy and passionate enough to finish this film and make it look better than we could have imagined. We want it to exceed the expectations of what a student film is assumed to be. Even if it kills us. Or at least Brianna. Hi, this is Brianna speaking and this film could literally kill me and I'll allow it because that's how much it means to me. Michael Cera also means a lot to me. Hi, Michael Cera. I might get your knees tattooed on me.\n",

      "💕Les pin’s seront de tailles différentes, vous pourrez retrouver 3 catègories de pin's, les \"Jumbo\" qui feront environ 10cm de hauteur, les \"Medium\" qui feront entre 5 et 6cm  et enfin les \"Tiny\" qui seront des ensembles de petits pin's de 2cm de haut.\n",
      "💕Les prix varieront donc en fonction de la taille des pin's. Pour rappel, le prix des pin's est calculé en prenant en compte beaucoup d'éléments, les tailles des pin's, le nombre de couleurs, s'il y a des couleurs spéciales ou non (paillettes, glow in the dark...), le print, mais également les frais annexes comme les frais de livraisons, les emballages, les frais kickstarter, les cotisations ainsi que le temps de travail.\n",

      "💕The pins will be of different sizes, you will be able to find 3 categories of pins, the \"Jumbo\" which will be about 10cm high, the \"Medium\" which will be between 5 and 6cm and finally the \"Tiny\" which will be sets of small pins of 2cm high.\n",
      "💕Prices will therefore vary depending on the size of the pins. As a reminder, the price of the pins is calculated by taking into account many elements, the sizes of the pins, the number of colors, if there are special colors or not (glitter, glow in the dark...), the print, but also the additional costs such as delivery costs, packaging, kickstarter fees, contributions as well as the working time.\n",
      "💕You can find the designs individually below and the practical info below them.❤️\n",
      "✨Si le Kickstarter atteint son objectif de financement , alors Kickstarter versera les fonds sur mon compte deux semaines après la fin de la campagne.\n",
      "✨Suite à cela, les pin’s partiront en production. La livraison des pin´s est prévue pour Novembre 2022 (à noter qu’il peut y avoir de l’avance ce qui serait top ! J'ai préféré vous donner une date de livraison lointaine afin d'éviter les problèmes de retards conséquents rencontrés avec les usines)\n",
      "✨De très légères modifications de couleurs peuvent éventuellement être effectuées également, mais pas de Panique ! Cela sera presque semblable et je vous montrera tout l’avancement durant le projet ❤️\n",
      "✨À noter également qu'il est important de savoir qu'aucun pin's n'est parfait! ce sont des objets fait à la main et il se peut donc que de micro défauts soient présents sur vos pin's. \n",
      "Questions récurantes:\n",
      "Des early Birds  ce sont tout simplement des pin’s (récompenses) à prix réduits, ils sont en quantités très limités et ce sont donc les premiers contributeurs qui pourront en bénéficier 🥰\n",
      "Tout d’abord il y a un avantage en ce qui concerne le prix , les pin’s seront proposés à des tarifs avantageux sur le kickstarter (et encore plus avantageux pour les early birds), et seront par la suite vendus plus chers sur la boutique en ligne.\n",
      "En participant au kickstarter, vous vous assurez également d’obtenir les pin’s que vous souhaitez. En effet , la commande de pin’s auprès de l’usine se fait en fonction de vos choix ! Il y aura ensuite un stock sur la boutique mais assez réduit , ce qui ne garanti pas que vous puissiez les avoir par la suite .\n",
      "Si le financement n’est pas atteint , alors les contributeurs ne seront pas prélevés et les pin’s ne seront pas produits.\n",
      "Vous serez prélevés une fois le kickstarter terminé (uniquement si le financement est atteint).\n",
      "OUI , une fois la campagne de financement terminée , vous recevrez un questionnaire dans lequel vous pourrez notifier vos coordonnées ainsi que les pin’s désirés.\n",
      "Cependant, ce kickstarter est prévu sous forme de paliers. C’est à dire que vous pourrez choisir uniquement parmi les pin’s débloqués. Si tous les pin’s sont débloqués (4800€) alors la question ne se pose plus 😘.\n",
      "OUI, vous pouvez modifier à n’importe quel moment de la campagne votre contribution tout simplement en vous connectant sur votre compte.  Néanmoins, soyez sûrs avant de participer , les annulations ou reductions de contributions créent de faux espoirs .\n",
      "Je vous remercie tous par avance , encore une fois, que la force soit avec nous et n’oubliez pas ...\n",
      "YOU ARE THE BEST 💪💕\n",
      "🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸\n",
      "✨If the Kickstarter reaches its funding goal , then Kickstarter will release the funds to my account two weeks after the campaign ends.\n",
      "✨Following that, the pins will go into production. Delivery of the pins is scheduled for November 2022 (note that there may be some advance notice which would be great! I preferred to give a long delivery date to avoid the problems of delays encountered with the factories for the Mythical Scenes project part 2)\n",
      "Some very slight color changes may be made as well, but don't panic! This will be almost similar and I will show you all the progress during the project ❤️\n",
      "✨Also note that it's important to know that no pin is perfect! These are handmade items so there may be micro flaws on your pins.\n",
      "Early Birds are simply pins (rewards) at reduced prices, they are in very limited quantities and it is therefore the first contributors who will benefit from them 🥰\n",
      "First of all there is an advantage regarding the price , the pins will be proposed at a chipper price on the kickstarter (and more cheaper for early birds), and will be thereafter at a more expensive price on the online store.\n",
      "By participating in the kickstarter, you also ensure to get the pins you want. Indeed, the order of pins from the factory is made according to your choices! There will then be a stock on the store but quite reduced, which does not guarantee that you can have them thereafter.\n",
      "If the funding is not reached, then the contributors will not be charged and the pins will not be produced.\n",
      "You will be charged once the kickstarter ends (only if the funding is reached).\n",
      "YES, once the funding campaign is over, you will receive a questionnaire in which you will be able to notify your contact information as well as the pins you want.\n",
      "However, this kickstarter is planned in stages. This means that you will only be able to choose from the unlocked pins. If all the pins are unlocked (5800€) then the question no longer arises 😘.\n",
      "YES, you can change your contribution at any time during the campaign simply by logging into your account.  Nevertheless, be sure before participating , cancellations or reductions of contributions create false hopes .\n",

We’ve done all this while housed at Capilano University, but we are soon to be cut adrift from Cap U—a loss of $85,000 per year to our operating budget. Despite this drastic cut, we are determined to continue! We plan to move into Vancouver as an independent magazine with an unchanged commitment to the avant-garde in the contemporary arts. We need your help launching our new office and our first independent issues!\n",

Luke (Bayney) Bayne, the other current doubles National MPO Champion will be at the European Open with the IceBerg in July this year. Every MPO champion in Australia will have an IceBerg this year, will you?? Don't miss out on this game changing disc golf backpack as they will sell out. \n",

In the last couple years our team of professionals have risen to the challenge of doing what many deemed impossible, by manufacturing and delivering all shipments on time in an uncertain world. If history is a precursor to the future, we can't be more confident in fulfilling our commitment to you. This is the greatest disc golf bag ever designed, and nothing will deter our amazing team from bringing this incredible disc golf bag to our disc golf family.\n",

The bottom of the bag sits atop two full length rails for maximum stability. They have been strategically placed just far enough from the edges as to make it impossible to come into contact with the lower back, and provide maximum stability. These rails are set atop a thick very tough waterproof tarpaulin bottom panel. The rails also function to keep the base of the bag from shifting or moving. This design has been proven to be the best for stability, and for durability. The result is a very stable bag on uneven or sloped surfaces. \n",
      "The next step was to create a bag that can be worn all day in comfort. The double reinforced 1cm thick shoulder straps are to be connected at the top on the third prototype version. Having the shoulder strap fall across the entire upper back provides an even distribution of weight instead of directing all the weight onto two points on the shoulders. The IceBerg is equipped with two large upper back pads, and a full length lumbar pad which provides an airflow channel to keep your back dry.  \n",
      " Prototype Version 2 Has unconnected Straps   \n",
      "Prototype version 3 is slated to have a connected upper shoulder strap configuration with full length double reinforced straps(No D Rings) \n",
      "The vertical stature design of the IceBerg disc golf backpack keeps the centre of gravity when directly over the centre of the base rails. This makes the IceBerg extremely stable under all conditions. This is demonstrated in the IceBerg video above. Having a well balanced bag increases it's comfort as well. \n",
      "Well organized storage has been engineered in the IceBerg starting with a large divided top pocket, with room for up to eight discs. \n",
      "The IceBerg has a dedicated full length pocket for your stool, umbrella, or retriever.   \n",
      "Two large expandable full length side pockets flank the IceBerg with the right side having a phone/small item pocket inside.   \n",
      "Inside the full length side pocket on the left, there is tall item strap, a marker pocket, and an extra large marker pocket that will hold writing instruments of any size. \n",
      "The IceBerg Version 3 will have slightly larger side pockets measuring 80mm wide, which will accommodate 4 putters or mid-range drivers.   \n",
      "The left 80mm side pocket has a removable divider which will easily accommodate two extremely large drink bottles for those hot summer days.\n",
      "At the top of each side of the IceBerg there is another small zippered pocket that will accommodate a mini or other small item, and we have equipped the IceBerg with the latest waterproof zippers to keep your gear and discs dry .\n",
      "The final detail that we are most excited about is the 5 zippered-in removable supports which allow the IceBerg to fold flat so that it can fit into a suitcase or small car for travel.  \n",
      "Our whole team have tested two prototypes of the IceBerg in the last few months. In the first Prototype V1 we tested the the overall design shape, accessibility of discs, storage of gear, and its stability on uneven ground. A bag that falls over, or has inaccessible discs and accessories is just not functional or fun. The second Prototype V2 was a much closer representation of the final bag with the all the pockets and dividers in their final place. The outer shell of the bag is made from the highest quality water and dirt resistant 600D denier, and the inner liners are made from heavy duty 420D, not the standard 210D of many bag producers. \n",
      "Version three is in the process of being made with the new connected shoulder strap configuration. The current double 1cm thick strap design is pretty comfortable, but we are always pushing to see if we could make it even better in terms of comfort and strength. There will be also be dedicated putter pocket built into the front flap. \n",
      "This is the moment you can join the Berg's family. The Berg's team have designed the best disc golf backpack on the market, and this is your chance to get one. \n",

It will also be a publication which featuring work by emerging artists and students alike, giving opportunities for new voices and talents to be heard. \n",
      "It will take the format of a rather diminutive newspaper; an ironic reference to traditional publications of yesteryear. Most of the money raised through this campaign will be used to cover the cost of printing, though as this is a student project we have almost zero overheads (we're not getting paid!), so every single donation makes its way straight to either printing or possibly planning a launch event.\n",

      "What we have heard over and over and over again from friends, popular queer writers, book reviews, and people on the internet is that the queer community wants to see stories about people like themselves that don't fixate on how \"alternative\" our lifestyle is, or the various \"issues\" we face, like coming out, transitioning, understanding their sexuality, etc. We want to enjoy the same awesome books, movies, video games, etc. that we have always enjoyed. We just want our protagonists to be queer.\n",
      " Vitality is a literary magazine filled with entertaining stories of all genres that feature queer protagonists. We include short stories, poetry, comics, art, and anything else you can fit in a magazine. The possibilities are absolutely limitless. And every single one centers around queer people. \n",
      "We have already released a short mini zine to show off the kind of thing we're about. You can download it for free at our website - click here! But we need you to take these stories to the next level. \n",
      "Your donations will go directly towards making Vitality happen. Our first issue is slated for early 2015, and we hope to make it about 60 pages long, filled cover to cover with short stories, flash fiction, poetry, comics, and art all centered around a positive portrayal of queerness.\n",
      "With your support, we will be able to pay our writers and artists a fair, industry-standard price for their work. This will encourage quality writers to submit to the magazine, and support queer artists, enabling them to produce even more great work. \n",
      "We will be able to create a beautiful, vibrant magazine without cluttering it up with ads. The only ads we will be printing will be minimal, and go in a special \"Thank you\" section at the back of the magazine, leaving the rest of the pages to be 100% content.\n",
      "We will be able to do a full-color print run of the magazine, as well as publish digital copies. Color printing costs a ton, and with your help we'll be able to print Vitality in all its glory without skimping on quality.\n",

      "Here is a handy chart to help you figure out the reward levels:\n",
      "To download our sample mini-zine, go to ReadVitality.com/minizine! Our first issue will be along similar lines, but with loads more content. .\n",
      "Ads : We will work with you to create your ad to the best of our ability. We have the right to refuse offensive or rude ads, or ads that violate the spirit of our magazine. \n",
      "The t-shirts will be screen-printed, cotton charcoal grey unisex t-shirts, and come in adult sizes from S-4XL. We are offering TWO OPTIONS for t-shirt designs.\n",
      "On the front, they will say \"I'm a ______\" and on the back \"and my story is vital\" with Vitality's url on the back. We will write in your custom identifier on the front in permanent, high-quality Vitality-blue t-shirt paint. We're going to use professional-grade t-shirt paint and heat cure it so it will not come off in the wash.\n",
      "The idea behind the shirts is to say \"I'm a [queer character] and my story is vital!\" so your shirt can say \"I'm an asexual astronaut\" or \"I'm a gay unicorn\" or \"I'm a transgender sorcerer,\" or anything you like! However, we will refuse to write rude or offensive things on the shirts, so keep it clean.\n",
      "This is an EXAMPLE of our idea for the t-shirt. Sizes and placement are not FINAL. Text, text color, shirt color, etc. are final, however. \n",
      "And when we handwrite it, it will look something like this. Again, note, we are actually going to hand-write these, so this digital image is just an example. ((for identities beginning with a vowel, we will add an n to make it \"I'm an.\"))\n",

By offering a competitive rate of pay for those who submit to our magazine, we can prove that it is worthwhile to write queer content, and encourage writers to submit to us. By running this kickstarter and gaining publicity and funding, we are proving there is a need, and there are people out there willing to pay for stories that represent who they are. All of this goes toward getting the writers and artists to create the work we want, and to give them an outlet to share those stories with the world. \n",

We don't have a publishing company backing us up or a long list of connections in the writing world. What we do have is a strong social media presence, especially across tumblr, where we have all been active for years.

      "Hi! We are Don, Pat & Tom, an all-female theatre collective based in New York City and named after our founding members' fathers. We tell original stories and make our own work. This summer, we are premiering our inaugural production, leaves, at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe Festival at Greenside Studios with a New York preview at 59E59 Theaters' East to Edinburgh. \n",
      "Don, Pat & Tom is comprised of Alex Highsmith, Amanda Lea Mason, Eryn O'Sullivan, Kate Bancroft, Naomi Lindh, and Elizabeth May. \n",
      "Introducing leaves\n",
      "A brand new play with original music, unique puppetry and a bit of magic, leaves tells the story of three women grappling with their own myths. Mot, Rue, and Niamh live in “Outside Time,” where there is no death - only leaving. Friends and family come and go, messages appear in various shapes, the poetry of Walt Whitman lives and breathes, yet things stay perfectly, monotonously the same. When a family crisis rocks the three women, they must band together to step outside of what they know, to a place inside time, where their ideas about the world must shift. \n",
      "leaves is directed by Elizabeth May and co-written/performed by founding members Alex Highsmith, Amanda Lea Mason, and Eryn O'Sullivan with production design by Kate Bancroft and production management by Naomi Lindh. \n",
      "leaves is our first production as a company! The show was born out of love and a need to tell women's stories. What began as a search for a three person, all-female play turned into developing a theater company focused on new, original work with a basis in personal mythology. \n",
      "Beginnings\n",
      "In August of 2018, our fledgling company flew to Edinburgh, Scotland - the site of the annual Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the largest of its kind in the world. We worked our little buns off all year to save for what was to be an educational journey; our goal was simply to check. it. out. \n",
      "Our eyes glimmered at the prospect of bringing our own work to an international stage. But we were ignorant in the ways of this mysterious foreign beast. What would we take? How would we get it there? Was this really possible?\n",
      "All we knew for sure was that we needed to get our hands dirty. So, on our own dime, we took a working-pleasure tour to Scotland- seeing as many shows as we could and learning so much our heads came real close to exploding for all the joy and art. This was where we wanted to introduce our new company to the world. Ed Fringe was perfect for us. \n",
      "Now, armed with information and buckets of ecstatic memories, our second journey to Scotland is underway. This time, we’re bringing a show of our own. And we're doing it right.\n",
      "What is the Edinburgh Fringe?\n",
      "The Edinburgh International Fringe Festival is a theatre festival in Scotland that runs throughout the month of August. It is the largest of its kind with performers, theatre companies, and tourists alike flocking to Edinburgh from all over the world. There are hundreds of shows every hour of every day, the streets are filled with music, food and  performers, and it seems as if the entirety of the UK and surrounding area shows up to partake. \n",
      " A silent disco, 200 deep, skips down a main drag in Edinburgh during lunch time.\n",
      "What drew us to the Edinburgh Fringe specifically is that it is renowned for catapulting the careers of theatre artists on an international stage. Cool actors who've gotten their start at the Fringe include Steve Coogan, Trevor Noah, Tilda Swinton, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. We are over the moon to be included and to partner with Greenside Studios for our performances. They have created an incredible following and nurtured a sterling reputation with the festival over their 14 years in existence. \n",

      "What is Dumbing of Age? It's a webcomic you can find on the Internet, and it's about freshmen entering college. It stars Joyce, a fundamentalist Christian who was previously homeschooled, and her unlikely new friend Dorothy, an atheist who wants to be President. They're surrounded by a varied cast of fully-realized characters, such as Billie, the alcoholic ex-cheerleader with a Resident Assistant problem(?), and Amber, the Internet shut-in who solves her rage issues by dressing up like a superhero and fighting crime.  Oh, right, and Joyce's childhood best friend, that unflappable smartass Becky, is hiding out from her jerkbutt dad 'cuz she was caught smooching her roommate!\n",
      "This book would collect \"Year Six,\" spanning the four storylines that start on August 31, 2015 and complete on September 3, 2016. This includes new commentary, behind-the-scenes artwork, and new character designs into an 228-page tome with luxurious glossy paper all bound up into a sturdy presentation.  Seriously, these books are gorgeous. Sometimes when we get solicitors I whip out a book to show them how pretty it is.\n",
      "And there will be a foreword by Jeph Jacques!  \n",
      "In addition to the year of comics from the DumbingOfAge.com website, the book also includes 24 bonus comics that were originally created exclusively for the Dumbing of Age Patreon!  \n",
      "There are also a few pages of bonus material including unused strips and alternate punchlines!\n",
      "To print 2000 copies of this first book at over $8 apiece, I'll need to raise approximately $17,000 to afford the printing costs. Add Kickstarter fees and taxes (oof) and the like, and that means I'll have to raise approximately $24,000 total. So that's the number on the board!\n",
      "Four years ago I did stretch goals to unlock website updates for Saturday and Sunday. Some of you thought updating 365 days a year would destroy me. Well, it did not!  IT ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER. And so let's keep that going. Stretch goals are in place to elongate those Saturday and Sunday updates for another year. Otherwise Saturday updates end on May 10 and Sunday updates end on May 30.\n",
      "More about stretch goals: Last two years I did die-cut character magnets, and that was pretty popular!  And so I'm gonna do more, right?  Obviously.  We're going to do them similarly to last time, as well, by unlocking some pledges for additional characters as we rise in pledges.  Ultimately, we will unlock a magnet that everyone who orders physical goods will receive if we reach a certain point!\n",
      " So, at $50k, I will send 2\"x4\" Becky die-cut character magnets to everybody who ordered snail-mailable goods. If you ordered any number of real made-of-paper books, you'll get a Becky character magnet with your order! (Sorry, folks who pledge only for the PDF, but there are not envelopes for PDFs in which to put magnets!)\n",
      "But in the meantime, we'll start off with some pledge tiers of character magnets that you can choose from!  We got Jocelyne, we got Carla, and we've got both Jocelyne and Carla together!  Plus, we have a pledge level where you'll get every single magnet unlocked by the end of this Kickstarter.  \n",

Each is at least 6\" long in some dimension, and will be sent to you in TIF and a smaller PNG form, the former of which you can get printed and framed if you like.

Nonetheless, we have recorded, mixed, mastered and released an album within the deadline we set (that album can be downloaded for free at www.caryhays.com).

We simply need funding for the vast number of things needed to put together a project of this magnitude. Travel, securing locations to shoot, recording in an analogue realm, mastering, manufacturing, promotion, etc. We plan to complete the project we've envisioned in a timely fashion, and the amount we're seeking will be all we need to keep things moving.\n",

I love baking cakes and during my Chemistry degree, I took an experimental approach to baking and noticed that in slightly changing certain quantities i could improve the end product. \n",
      "I would squiggle these changes into a lab style book and it got me thinking, why not create a similar book so that people can bake like a chemist.\n",
      "Your help is needed to fund an initial print run of the book (not yet completed). This will help me to continue with the rest of the master-plan.\n",
      "Stage 1 - Cooking Book - This is the starting block for Dave's Delights. This will help me to establish a brand and create a platform to launch future ideas/projects detailed below. \n",
      "Stage 2 - Merchandise - This will be using the Dave's Delights logo. Current ideas include aprons, T-Shirts, Sauces, Hats.\n",
      "Stage 3 - Cafe - The idea is to start a cafe, possibly in the center of Manchester to help feed homeless people. Customers would purchase cakes/coffee and eat/drink. they would then put a postit note on a wall. If someone couldn't afford food, they would then take a note from the wall as the previous person had already covered it. I would also like to use this idea to offer employment to people who would otherwise be overlooked by society. This is the long term goal.\n",
      "Realistically funding for this would probably need £50k+ which is why I am starting with building a brand via the cook book and merchandise.  \n",
      "Thank you for taking the time to read my project. Any support you can provide will be massively appreciated. \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "An introduction of what we are about\n",
      "Hello everyone, name is Marshall Long, and I am proud to launch this kickstarter campaign to get the \"Sunday Before Monday Podcast\" off the ground.  The whole idea for the podcast came because of a tradition my best friend Anthony and I have of meeting up every Sunday to catch up with each other and vent about the week, tell stories, and most importantly laugh.  It helps us get away from all of the noise of life, we cherish these Sundays, (hence the name Sunday Before Monday) and every time we meet we say to ourselves, \"We need to let people hear our conversations\", and now it has become our dream to put microphones in front of us while we talk so that we can let people hear our stories, and relate to our typical struggles and triumphs. Most of these stories are flat our hilarious, and we want to provide our audience with a bit of laughter before that Monday morning alarm clock goes off.  Our conversations lead down one rabbit hole to another, and the journey that our conversations take is amazing.  With Sunday Before Monday, you will get insight into intriguing topics, gut busting laugher, and unbelievable stories.\n",
      "We will cover any and all topics that you can think of.  There will be episodes about sports where we will have ex-proffesional athletes come on the show and give a backstage look at the life of a professional athlete.  Some of the episodes will cover the expanses of science, we'll have on guest such as medical surgeons, and astronomers.  Where we will then pick their brain about the wonders of their fields.  We also have 6 local stand up comedians who are scheduled to come on the show, and trust me, those episodes will be impossible not to laugh at.  So from sports, to science, to comedy, and so much more.  We will cover it all.\n",
      "The main focus of the \"Sunday Before Monday Podcast\" is to lighten up the \"Sunday Scaries\" and provide everyone with a 2-3 hour break from the stress of having to go back to work the next day, or the dreadful task of waking up early, or even the boring job you may be stuck at.  We want to relieve the stress of all of those things with insight, laughter, and wonder.\n",
      "So crack open a cold one, sit on down, and listen with us.\n",
      "Long Term Goal \n",
      "Our long term goal is to become a staple on the apple podcast charts for years to come.  We want to make the \"SBMP\" acronym synonymous with great stories, laughs and good times.  We want to turn it into a nation wide brand that benefits both our sponsors as well as ourselves.  In two years we want to consistently have hundreds of thousands of listeners tune in to each show, and hopefully from there, grow that number into the millions.  It will be a long hard road, but we could not be more excited to get started.\n",
      " Reward Breakdown\n",
      "\"The Sunday Before Monday Podcast\" Bottle Opener Keychain ($15): Bottle opener keychain with our logo and slogan engraved on the top.  It will read, \"The Sunday Before Monday Podcast, Relatable Laughs\"\n",
      " \"The Sunday Before Monday Podcast\" drink koozie ($25): Drink koozie with one of our original design logos printed on the front and back. It has our classic microphone design along with our SBMP acronym.\n",
      " \"The Sunday Before Monday Podcast\" Baseball T-shirt ($50): Baseball Style T-shirt with a red, white and blue color scheme. It has our classic microphone design along with our \"SBMP\" acronym on the front of the shirt.  Both comfy and warm.  Can't go wrong here.\n",
      " We appreciate all of the support that we hope to get from the bottom of our hearts, and we look forward to bringing you a rocking' podcast every single Sunday for years to come.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "1) We have never produced a full podcast: This will not be an issue because we have extensive experience in audio production and editing due to our experiences at both of our jobs.  It should take us about 1-2 weeks once we have the studio set up to produce a high grade podcast show.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Purchasing the equipment: We have done extensive research on the equipment that we will need in order to produce a professional level show.  So this was a challenge, but if/when we get funded, we know exactly what to purchase, and how to set it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The final and biggest challenge we have to deal with is gaining sponsorship.  This has more to do with the longevity of the show.  The $7,500 that we need to start will sustain the show for a solid year.  But in order to keep this wonderful thing going, we will need sponsorship.  We have a couple of local companies and restaurants on the hook for paid sponsorship, but they want to see our studio and product before they sponsor the show.  But if that happens, then long live the \"Sunday Before Monday Podcast\".  Hooray!!\n",
      "--------annaraedesign/the-caravan-and-camping-adventure-journal------\n",
      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "I came up with the idea for The Adventure Journal after getting our own family caravan. I wanted to be able to keep track of my family's camping holidays and record those precious moments, but all the travel journals I came across were aimed more at international travel or bullet journaling. I wanted something that was simple and fun to fill in.\n",
      "I originally released this journal last year on my Etsy store and while I was happy with the design, it was difficult to create by myself and the handmade factor made the journal too expensive so I removed it from my store and saved the design for a later date!\n",
      "The journal was designed with a combination of prompts to help you to get more unforgettable memories down on paper. Don’t worry though, I’ve made sure to leave plenty of space for those that have their own style of journaling. There’s something for all journalers out there!\n",
      "The pages are designed to capture 12 adventures throughout the year. Each adventure starts with a planning section to help you get ready for your trip and plan some things to do while you’re there. After all, planning it out is one of the most exciting parts, right? I have kept the style straightforward and fun throughout – just like camping itself! For me, camping outside is all about enjoying the simpler things in life, being in nature, and spending quality time with family and friends. The Adventure Journal is purpose-designed to capture all of that!\n",
      "The journal itself will be A5 and consist of up to 160 double-sided pages. I have designed 104 of these and I welcome suggestions for other must-have journal sections. Alternatively, the rest could be a combination of graph and lined paper for those that like to record their adventure in their own way.\n",
      "The cover will be laminated in soft velvet while the internal pages will be printed on a high-quality 250gsm matte paper, which should be super smooth for writing on with your favourite journaling pen!\n",
      "I personally love the Trip Highlights page that provides a space to record the favourite parts of your trip, including the best food eaten and your most peaceful moment!\n",
      "The Adventure Journal offers lots of different ways of recording your trip with pre-made sections for remembering the details of your pitch, what you loved and didn’t love so much, what the weather was like, and some of the activities you did. There’s even space to proudly display your favourite snaps too – us campers are usually pretty nifty with a camera too!\n",
      "The Adventure Journal provides so much more than a place to record your trip! There’s a bucket list of traditional camping activities that we all need to try once and some suggestions for what to do on those days when the weather isn’t so kind. Your journal will help shape your journey as well as record it!\n",
      "It was a challenge, but even the Health & Safety section is whimiscal and lists some of the key safety points to remember to make sure your trip is not only fun, but safe too!\n",
      "There’s lots to enjoy when flicking through the journal. As well as prompts, free writing space, and activity suggestions, there’s also a miniature hand-illustrated map and a playful poem. This playful journal is not only fun to fill in but will continue to make you smile when looking back on your trips.\n",
      "The playful, hand-drawn design on every page makes the journal appealing for everyone and offers plenty of space for you to make it your own. We all know that camping adventures throw you lots of surprises along the way, some good and some not-so-good that make for great stories, and there’s room to capture it all!\n",
      "The rewards available include a copy of my illustrated map of the UK, my adventure print, and a large adventure sticker. They are all printed on quality, smooth matte photo paper or sticker paper. There will also be an additional page at the back of the journal to list the names of everyone that backs the project as a special thank you from me!\n",
      "Keeping a record of our trips has become more popular than ever and The Adventure Journal is a one-of-a-kind, purpose-designed journal for all the campers out there! It fills an existing gap in the market and funding would allow this product to be affordable so that there will be even more happy campers!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Obviously, with any project, there may be challenges involved especially when you're self-employed but I will update you every step of the way!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already found a printer I am hoping to use to create the journal, any issues with this I will obviously let you know about ASAP.\n",

      "All Cyberpunk MiniAlley backers will get a Free optional upgrade from the Octopus Sign to the Ramen Sign. \n",
      "The Cyberpunk MiniAlley has over 300 unique and intricate details. Our design team spent two years studying hundreds of Cyberpunk reference images to develop this hyper-realistic world. This is the perfect feature piece to draw attention to your bookshelf and start those exciting Cyberpunk conversations.\n",
      "The Cyberpunk MiniAlley uses sophisticated illusions to make the alley appear a lot deeper than it actually is. This creates the feeling of a complex and busy world in a small space. What’s more, it will look and feel like your Cyberpunk world extends far beyond the walls of your home!\n",
      "The MiniAlley is proudly designed and made in the USA. We pride ourselves on the quality of each piece we produce.\n",
      "We use advanced laser engraving technology to achieve high-resolution (up to 1000 dpi), precise, and consistent art details.\n",

During the first campaign, the pandemic forced our main workshop to shut down for several months and caused up to 2 months delay in our delivery schedule. However, we were able to make necessary changes and worked diligently to get back to schedule quickly. In the end, we actually started shipping early for many backers.  For our second campaign, we completed and shipped everything on time without any delay. Any issues or concerns from backers were addressed within 24hr.

It also marks the fifth collaboration between the powerhouse team of director Amy Poisson and playwright Maggie Lee, whose previous productions include the successful New Providence trilogy of steampunk plays: The Clockwork Professor, The Tumbleweed Zephyr, and A Hand of Talons.\n",
      "Sheathed is set in a new fantastical realm, combining genre influences from Japanese samurai epics, classic Old Westerns, heroic medieval legends, and buddy-cop oddball friendships. But in true Macha Theatre Works style, our strong female characters lead the way in this tale, carving out their own destinies with their swords, but also learning the true price of violence. We have built an amazing team for our show, including an incredible multicultural cast and a legion of talented designers, and we can't wait to share this new play with you!\n",
      "While Macha currently has a budget in place to cover all basic production costs, we have some big dreams in creating the sights and sound of Sheathed. We are combining live music, movement, fight choreography, and puppetry into a one-of-a-kind theatrical event, and every extra dollar can help make our grand vision become a reality. This is where you come in!\n",

This is especially true when the play isn’t something easily recognizable to mainstream audiences or an adaptation of a well-known intellectual property. However, our playwright Maggie and director Amy are long-time collaborators who have gained a dedicated theatrical fan base in Seattle over the last 5 years. In addition, Macha Theatre Works has a proven track record of producing successful new plays, and has gathered a passionate, talented group of actors, designers, and staff for this project. We are committed not only to making the best art that we can, but also making it the best experience possible for everyone involved, from the start of rehearsal to the last curtain call. Theatre is only as strong as the team behind it, both on and off stage; we know we are strong and can overcome any risk that might arise along the way.\n",

      "Background: In 2016, I met American playwright Tom Coash, and he told me about his play CRY HAVOC. It sounded like a gripping and very current play, and - after reading it - I made the decision to bring this to the UK for its European premiere. No matter how long it would take to make this happen! What followed was a long search for the right venue, and in summer 2018, the Park Theatre - one of London's leading Off-West-End venues - shared my passion for this play, and agreed to programme it as part of their Spring 2019 season. This is a hugely exciting opportunity to introduce Tom's play to the London theatre audience, industry professionals, and arts critics. Your donation will help us to make it happen! \n",

      "The European premiere of Cry Havoc by Tom Coash, starring Marc Antolin (West End, National Theatre, RSC, Young Vic), James El-Sharawy (Clywd Theatr Cymru, Southwark Playhouse) and Karren Winchester (National Theatre, West End) is a passionate love story about two men who are worlds apart.\n",
      "Set in present-day Cairo, Cry Havoc is a passionate love story between a spirited Egyptian and an idealistic British writer. In times of turmoil, Mohammed questions his responsibility towards society when he contemplates leaving Egypt for a life in the UK with his partner, Nicholas. The two men are forced to confront their cultural identities, traditions and a repressive government in a gripping search for love and faith.\n",
      "Tom Coash’s poignant, intimate play explores the relationship between the Western world and the Islamic Middle East through the eyes of two people asking if love can bridge even the widest cultural divide.\n",
      "The play will be performed from 27 March - 20 April 2019 at Park Theatre in London, UK: https://www.parktheatre.co.uk/whats-on/cry-havoc\n",

      "Hello. I go by the songwriter name of HeartOfThePen. I am a songwriter out of Tennessee. Just to specify I am not a singer/songwriter. I do not sing. I'm a songwriter only. With that being said I need your help. I would like to start up my independent record label/ production company entitled Hits Songwriting Production. My overall goal for the company is to create great, soulful, inspiring, entertaining, and heart provoking music for aspiring artists as well as for the die hard fans of music. My personal mission musically is to re-event R&B music and to bring it back to it's glory like once before. Now days R&B music is not as appreciated and celebrated as it once were. As a songwriter and a lover of R&B music I want to change that. People say that R&B music in this generation is dead but i don't believe that. So as a songwriter i want to start a movement within my small company to bring back that soulful, sexy, and feel good R&B that people like myself are craving for today that is not influence by Hip-Hop music or any other genere. I just wanna write and create really good music to the world.I love music and I love to write. I just wanna share my gift to the world and i would love to do this full time so that i can leave something special behind for my 4 year daughter who goes by the name of Lauren. With the overall funding of your generous donations of any amount I plan on starting up the company and immediately begin working on my first project which will be a free project to everyone who loves R&B music and to everyone who supported this project from day one through donations etc. As i'm sure alot of you know being your own boss takes a lot of sacrifice  and cost a lot of money when starting your own record label. The funds will also be going toward funding the R&B Is Back musical project( to be release in February 2016), studio time, artists to provide vocals to my songs, music producers, copyrights, business license, marketing, songwriting projects with artists, etc. As i just stated i am working on a project entitled \"R&B Is Back\" which i plan on releasing in February of 2016. It will be a free musical mixtape with ten to twelve R&B records all written and arranged by me, produced by up and coming producers, and sung by talented up and coming artists. The project will feature some of the best R&B music that a songwriter like me has to offer. I'm asking you to please support the bringing back of real R&B music as well as music in general. Uploaded above is a video of a song that i wrote for a very talented artist by the name of Mykel entitled \"Slip Away\". That song is just a taste of what i have enstore for the fans of real, creative, and authentic music.

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "“Now, here in Britain we’ve just an election where everybody argued about who won. Nothing much happened: Gordon Brown looked bewildered for a few days, and then we got a coalition. But in Iran, there were riots,  and lots of people died.\n",
      "It was a unique moment. I was there to see it. Not many British people got to be there at that time. Actually, not a lot of British people get to be there ever”\n",
      "Part theatre, part drag cabaret, Lipstick: A Fairy Tale of Iran is a 2 hander play with songs, which fuses storytelling, vaudeville, theatre, lipsynch and boylesque, in a story of rage, redemption and weaponised whimsy which straddles Tehran, Derry and London.\n",
      "Lipstick premieres at Omnibus Theatre on 28th Feb 2019, (previews from 26th Feb) and runs to 24th March. \n",
      "In  early 2010, just  after the  contested  2009 Iranian  election,  during riots  urging  the  removal  of President Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad  from office, I went to Iran on a theatre residency. The experience changed my life.\n",
      "Lipstick: a fairy tale of modern Iran was inspired by this.\n",
      "At that time, Iran was part of a collection of Middle Eastern territories the US Government still titled \"the Axis of Evil\". Prior to visiting, the  title  had  coloured my assumptions  of  what  I  would  find  there. My assumptions  were  challenged,  on  a  daily  basis, throughout my stay. \n",
      "In a curious way, that constant and intense challenging of assumptions felt in some way similar to the more straightforwardly joyful discombobulation I found in the drag and cabaret world I had started to work in at home. \n",
      "Lipstick was borne out of a desire to interrogate and celebrate the challenging of assumptions, the challenging of my own beliefs around feminism, ethnicity, ethics, faith and gender, which I experienced at that time. \n",
      "I started writing Lipstick four years ago, when Britain felt a safer place than it does now. Iran's almost impenetrable diplomatic and cultural borders felt a world away from my experience at home.  \n",
      "Sadly,  four years later, we  now don't  have  to  look  too  far  outside  the  edges  of  our  own  nation  to  see  borders  that threaten  our  capacity  to  engage  with  people  we  see as  different  to  ourselves. \n",
      "As  Brexit  looms  ever  closer, what  is  it  doing to  our  perceptions  of  people  we  see  as  Other?  What  does  the  threat  of  a  hard  border  in Ireland do to our already heightened fear of terrorism? What role does tightened immigration here, and our Government's tacit acceptance of Trump's travel bans and sanctions to Iran,  play  in  this?  \n",
      "How  do  we  fight  to  keep  our  personal,  emotional  borders  open,  while  all  around  us, governments build physical and ideological walls?\n",
      "And  what  does  our  Foreign  Office's  apparent  abandonment  of  British Iranian  Nazanin  Zaghari Ratcliffe, currently  imprisoned  without  fair  trial  in  Tehran's  notorious  Evin Women's  Prison,  say  about  our  national attitudes to those on the wrong side of a difficult border? What power do we have to say: \n",
      "To present this work so close to the date Britain leaves the European Union is my assertion of that power.\n",
      "To premiere Lipstick at this time creates a space to discuss and to protest the closing of borders, be they physical, intellectual, legal or emotional, and to celebrate diversity, fierceness and community.\n",
      "Lipstick is performed by Siobhan O'Kelly as Orla and Nathan Kiley (also known as drag alter ego Topsie Redfern) as Mark. \n",
      "Siobhan won Best Actress at the European Independent Film Festival in Paris for her role in Sophie At The Races. She was also nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role Film at the IFTAs this year for her role in Klondike.\n",
      " Nathan has performed extensively in the West End, including playing Mary Sunshine in Chicago. Topsie was the first runner up in Drag Idol UK 2013, and won Best Drag Newcomer in the 2014 Boyz Scene Awards. \n",
      "Lipstick is produced by Olivier nominee Paul Virides, and choreographed by Vault Festival award winner Molly Beth Morossa. \n",
      "Lipstick will be presented alongside \n",
      "We will be creating an environment around the show which encourages discussion, dissent and vigorous interaction.\n",
      "Maybe unexpectedly for an appeal about an arts project, I am going to talk to you about maths. \n",
      "If you are not a practitioner, theatre economics may surprise you.\n",
      "Because of the Arts Council, other foundations, and brilliant schemes like Travellex, you can often go to see big shows in big theatres for £10 - £15. This is not a reflection of what they cost to put on, just that we are lucky enough to live in a culture that understands the value of using subsidy to make art accessible. \n",
      "However, this means that ticket revenue for fringe theatre in no way reflects costs. Lipstick's projected ticket income represents about 1/3 of the actual costs of putting on the show\n",
      "For this show we will be charging £13-£16 for tickets, because we and Omnibus Theatre want the show to be economically accessible to as many people as possible. (We are also offering 50 free tickets across the run to two charities who will share them among people for whom £13 is still prohibitive).  \n",
      "We could put the ticket price up to £39-£48, but that would exclude many people who would like to see it (and who we would like to see it). \n",
      "We could expect artists to work unpaid, but this is a horrible precedent to set, it devalues the work, training and skill of artists, and creates an ironic situation where you might not have to be rich in order to sit in the audience, but you do have to be rich in order to appear on the stage. 7 weeks full time work unpaid is not a thing many of us can afford to do.\n",
      "Or we could ask you reading this, are you in a position to help us keep prices low while ensuring our artists can live, eat, travel, stay warm and stay healthy while making and performing the show?\n",
      "If you are only in a position to contribute the cost of a ticket, please, save your pennies on here and just book for the show! \n",
      "If you are in a position to make a substantial donation, please don't let us stop you!! People like you are our life blood and we are very very grateful. \n",
      "But if you are somewhere in the middle - if you could, without discomfort, pay the actual value of a ticket - please would you consider booking a ticket but also popping the difference in the kitty here. By doing so, you are helping ensure that we can sustain keeping our work available to people who cannot afford to pay more, and that the artists whose work you will see are there on the basis of their artistic excellence not their financial privilege.  \n",
      "Above and beyond the economic reasons stated above, your support would mean the world to me and all the team creatively. \n",
      "This is a piece of work we all care deeply about: on a political level we are all very invested in its message; on a creative and professional level, it allows us to develop our artistic practice, present a high level piece of work, and collaborate with people we love. \n",
      "I personally have directed extensively, and have written three plays, but this is my debut full length work as both writer and director. You will be helping all of us develop our work, our profiles and our commitment to the causes we care about. \n",
      "I am so excited to present Lipstick at a genuinely inclusive, female-led theatre which has already supported the show's development. \n",
      "Omnibus a multi-award winning theatre in Clapham, offering a vibrant artistic programme inspired by the legacy of the old Clapham Library building.\n",
      "The venue is home to a 90-seat studio theatre (where Lipstick will be performed), a café/bar and two performance and rehearsal spaces. \n",
      "Omnibus Theatre was founded in 2013, following a seven-year campaign to save the old Clapham Library building.\n",
      "The theatre's patrons are Dame Judi Dench, Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Richard Eyre, Matthew Warchus and Maggi Hambling CBE. The theatre won the Open Space Award in 2015 and has just been nominated as The Stage's Fringe Theatre of the Year.\n",
      "Omnibus Theatre is a home of storytelling – a small place to encounter big ideas. We are driven by the legacy of our former library building to tell stories, familiar and unknown, in South London and beyond. The theatre's mission is to create performance that has the power to inspire audiences, to change minds, to bring us together.\n",
      "Omnibus Theatre nurtures emerging artists and new voices, presenting work that is ambitious and relevant. We are committed to making our work affordable and introducing it to new audiences. You can expect a warm welcome when you step through our doors.\n",
      "We have reached our target with three days to go - thankyou all so so so much - so we have added a stretch goal. \n",
      "With deepest thanks to a match funder, if we can get this to £3800 by the end, we will receive £800 match funding, to create a Trainee Assistant Director role, paid £400 p/w, so an emerging artist can work full time on a full professional production without having to worry about earning a living at the same time. \n",
      "If you would still like to contribute, this is where your money would go. \n",
      "Many thanks for all your amazing support xxx\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We have had to resubmit our Arts Council application for funds towards this show; if they turn us down a second and final time we will be very short of funds indeed. We have drawn up an emergency budget to deal with this eventuality - which will still make sure people get paid - but it will be tighter than we would like. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course the London theatre market is hugely competitive, but we have honed Lipstick through two rounds of Arts Council funded workshops. We are confident it is a strong and timely piece of work, and that we have the best PR and marketing team possible.\n",

      "EXPLOITATION\n",
      "      \"Exploitation\" is usually a bad word, but when it describes a movie genre, it's actually a relished by fans of that style.  Well, it's not really a genre by itself.  Horror, comedy, and thriller genres can fall into the (positive) category of \"exploitation.\" \n",
      "   But this is not a documentary that teaches you about movie styles.  Rather, \"Exploitation\"uses the movie-making setting as the environment for this tragi-comedy.\n",
      "   Bill Zebub is not a genre purist.  He likes to mix things that aren't normally together.  His bizarre associations between seemingly unrelated concepts is what drives his stories.\n",
      "   Bill Zebub does not have the budget of Hollywood, but he has independence.  He can explore subjects that are not considered good for mainstream stories, and he can depict situations that go far beyond mainstream sensibilities.  This doesn't mean that he is better than the mainstream - it means that he uses his freedom instead of being ashamed of his indie status.\n",
      "   He only has his own money to lose, which makes him answer only to himself, not investors.  \n",
      "The Movie\n",
      "   Perhaps you consider comedy to be a social mirror.  Perhaps you prefer a more slap-stick approach.  Maybe you like sarcasm.  Comedy has several forms.  \n",
      "   Bill Zebub noticed that some comedy makes you laugh at failure.  This might seem cruel, but in such cases, laughter is a harmless release of negative energy.  Some evolutionary psychologists say that laughter was our pre-language way of communicating to other humans that the situation is not serious.  When a person slips and falls, you laugh because there is no injury.  But if there is an injury then there would be no laughter, unless you are sociopathic.\n",
      "   This movie is about a director's failure.  It's not about the movie world, even though movie-making is the setting for the story.  Although the primary stimulus for laughter is the director's failure and total misery, there is enough sarcasm, dry wit, slap-stick, and other forms of comedy for you to at least smile once.\n",
      "   Judgmental people may look upon the images or descriptions with condemnation, but knee-jerk reactions are immature.  Bill Zebub has spent his career fighting such prejudice. You keep hearing \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" -  Hopefully you are the kind of person who might read a few pages before deciding.\n",
      "   Bill Zebub writes ugly scripts, and he challenges you to find the hidden beauty.\n",
      "Supporting this movie.\n",
      "   This movie is getting made no matter what.  In fact, a few scenes have already been shot.\n",
      "   Why would you support this if it's going to be made even if no one contributes?  It is because every dollar that is raised goes toward making the movie BETTER.  Even if the just the minimum of $500 is raised, that means that more expenses can be afforded.  If $40,000 is raised, it still goes toward the making of the movie.  It's not going toward a luxurious car that will be written off as a company vehicle.\n",
      "   Again, this movie is being made no matter how much money is raised, because the director has already set his own money aside to make the movie at the bare-minimum costs.  He has prepared for the worst-case scenario, and the movie has guaranteed distribution.\n",
      "   What this means is that there is no guilt-trip being placed on you.  It also means that the director can stand on his own feet.  He does not rely on hand-outs.  \n",
      "   If you participate, you get something real for your money.  A limited edition cover that will never be available outside of this crowdfunding campaign, available for the cost of a regular movie - that is something real.  If you want to re-sell it at a later date for an inflated price, they YOU will be the one who will befit from the investment.  \n",
      "   Bill Zebub is You also get a chance to obtain some movie props from previous Bill Zebub titles.\n",
      "   As for he credits that are available, they are not  fake :producer\" credits which some campaigns offer.   \"Associate Producer\" or \"Executive Producer\" credits are bogus in such campaigns.  Go to the Producer's Guild website to learn that those are positions that do NOT mean \"someone who gave money to the movie-maker.\" Those credits  mark you as a fool.  \n",
      "   Actually, there is a part in the script that mentions this practice of hoodwinking people into getting \"producer\" credits.\n",
      "Your help\n",
      "   Whether you contribute in exchange of a DVD or something larger, every bit helps the movie.  You cna also help by spreading the world about this crowdfunding campaign.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "This is a low-risk project because the director has already invested the minimum amount of money to get this movie finished.  This crowdfunding campaign is to make the movie better than the bare-minimum budget version.  If a low amount is raised, it goes toward a few more crew members for the difficult shots.  Fund beyond that go toward renting better locations, hiring more help, getting more lenses and even a B camera.  Contributions go toward any number of production costs.  But again, the bare-minimum has been covered.\n",
      "This is the first kickstarter campaign, but the sixth crowdfunder for the director.  There were five previous crowdfunding campaigns on a different site (not sure if a competitor should be named).  Each was successful and the movies were completed.\n",

      "\"Introducing Dallas' next big star: Liv Free\n",
      "Raw. Captivating. Honest. Focused. Transparent. Uninhibited. Fearless. Undeniable. Even these adjectives wouldn't do Liv Free enough justice. Admired for her ability to become the focal point in a room without saying a word, she is the embodiment of a star, possessing an uninhibitedness with an uncanny reticent that tends to intrigue everyone she meets. Talented, fearless, and extremely proud of where she's from, Liv Free is poised to be the next big thing to come from the great city of Dallas.\"\n",
      "To many, this seems like a lot to live up to but for me this truly is an honest description of who I am and how my life is. I have the passion and the desire to entertain the world and use every blessing that God has given me in a way that inspires, equips and helps others. I don't pretend to be someone that I am not. I strive to promote self confidence and fearlessness in my music and my image. I don't believe in boxing myself in or stepping on eggshells to express myself and I think that is what sets me apart from other singers: the fact that I will sing and say and act in ways that most people wish they could but don't. \n",

      "Having released two introductory singles ('OD' and 'Hold Me Back') in April 2015, I got my confirmation that I have a platform to be the type of singer that I strive to be and really begin to pursue music as a career. I received so much love, support and attention in such a short amount of time and I can't be more grateful for the opportunity to work even harder to show more of the world who I am and my talents. '1 Hunnid' (produced by Campion Bond) is a song I made about confidence in oneself and knowing that you are amazing regardless of whatever obstacles that try to keep you from what you dream or pursue. Its about being fed up with the views and regulations of anything that keeps you from being who you want to be. With a dedicated team behind me, I am looking to exceed all expectations and push further with this single, but I need YOUR help! \n",
      "In order to cover video and promotions cost, I am setting up this Kickstarter in hopes that everyone who has heard of me and believes in me, my team and our spirit (and even those that haven't), can help to be apart of this single. My team consists of gifted and hardworking supporters who dedicate their time, skills and efforts to me without pay and this is just as much for them as it is for me. The donations made will all go towards the filming and production costs of the music video (Directed by LaReign Storm), and if donations exceed our goal, funds will be dedicated to putting together a video release party in which we hope every person who donates and supports can attend to see this dream as a reality. \n",
      "I know that everyone may not be able to donate monetarily but please know what I am thankful regardless. If you can't but you still took the time out to read this and share, THANK YOU SO MUCH. To everyone that can donate, there is no way I can thank you enough but I plan to try by giving my all in this project and providing as many opportunities now and in the future as I can to show you that you are appreciated and your time, efforts and money are not wasted.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      " We have revolutionized amplifier safety upgrades through our simple to install and cost-effective Amp Defenders.  Amp Defenders save time by allowing musicians and/or technicians to enhance amplifier reliability with our plug and play technology. Amp Defenders prevent amplifiers from 'going up in smoke' by stabilizing the rectifier and power tube circuits, preventing spiking, and isolating tube shorts without any modifications to the amplifier.\n",
      "Help us take this product from a working prototype to a more finished product, enabling us to buy components in bulk and helping with incorporation costs.\n",
      "Vintage tube prices are higher every year, as the number in circulation dwindles. There are some new manufacturers, with the new popularity of analog audio equipment. However, newer tubes are not made to the same specifications as vintage tubes. Many prized vintage tubes were produced during a time of war. Tubes used in military equipment had to be made to a higher standard. Manufacturers became adept at making rugged tubes and utilized increased quality control.\n",
      "While analog equipment is making a come-back, demand is still much lower. Today, many tubes are produced in China and Russia for the consumer market. These tubes have different requirements and different profit margins. For instance, the internal components are often crimped together instead of welded, making them more vulnerable to shorts caused by thermal cycling (heating and cooling from turning them on and off).\n",
      "These new tubes have become known for higher rates of premature failure known as “infant mortality.” Many factors affect this depending on the equipment being used and how, as well as the tube itself. Vintage amplifiers in the US were designed for two-prong cables using 110V; while today, we use three-prong 120V power. This almost ten percent increase can be enough to push a tube past its maximum safe operating voltage.\n",
      "Some problems are not caused by the tubes themselves. Many people are buying kits to replace their rectifier tubes with solid-state for various reasons. These solid-state rectifiers are often ten to fifteen percent more efficient than the tubes they replace. This sounds good on paper, but the increase can cause problems with the electrolytic capacitors and requires the amp to be re-biased or risk damage. Solid state rectifiers also do not allow the tubes in the amplifier time to warm-up, without a standby switch. This can eventually cause the power tubes to short due to the deformation of the cathode.\n",
      "When tubes are the issue, they have two failure modes. Normally, a tube can die, much like a burned-out lightbulb. In this instance, you can easily swap in a new one, bias the amp, and you’re good to go. Sometimes, a tube will short. In this instance, the tube will usually take multiple components with it, causing a cascading failure that results in a high repair bill or a new amplifier.\n",
      "Amp Defenders isolate your amplifier’s components, preventing such failures from spreading. They are inexpensive, easy to install, and do not affect your amplifier’s function, sound, or feel.\n",
      "Rectifier Tube Amp Defender\n",
      "The Rectifier Tube Amp Defender prevents a rectifier tube short from causing other amplifier components to fail, and the only thing lost would be the rectifier tube itself. In the event of tube rectifier failure, we will replace your Rectifier Tube Amp Defender for the cost of postage. Typically, the Rectifier Tube Amp Defender is fine, but it should be inspected to ensure the continued protection of your equipment. We feel it is simply better for you to replace it, which is why we offer such replacements.\n",
      "Power Tube Amp Defender\n",
      "The Power Tube Amp Defender protects the power tubes, the output transformer, and the speaker. Depending on the design of the amplifier, it may also protect the power transformer and filter capacitors. The Power Tube Amp Defender protects against power surges, stabilizes the output section, isolates the power tube from other components in the event of a short, and protects the power tube and output transformer from spiking by diverting them to ground.\n",

      "In the backer survey you will need to specify the following:\n",
      "Retainer Clips\n",

      "Retainer Extension Springs\n",
      "Many amplifiers use spring style retainers to keep tubes secure. The added height of the Amp Defender may be past the limit of the springs. We will offer extension springs to compensate for the added height, to be added to the current spring for a better fit. They are available as an add-on to your Amp Defender for $1 per set (2 springs).\n",

      "Decide the way you sound with your very own custom single coil within 5 minutes and under 20 dollars. You can easily create a humbucker pickup too, this in 10 minutes and under 40 dollars.\n",
      "Getting a pickup made the way you want it will cost you $102/€90 approximately for a single coil. A humbucker is even more expensive with a price of $145/€125 for A-brands quality pickups. The dragon makes the production of custom pickups about 5 times less expensive, while keeping the quality high (when using good quality materials).\n",
      "The Dragon is produced in house which means every little part gets a personal quality check by the founder Steven. He is responsible for the production, functionality, and design of the machine. It’s handmade with an Ultimaker S5 and after many tests, we found the perfect filament for this: The Colorfabb N-Gen Lux in Black Diamond. The material uses diffuse reflection to scatter light in all directions which hide individual print lines and creates a smoother finish.\n",
      "Following the great maker movement that has happened in the last decade with desktop 3d printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, waterjets,… it is pretty clear that there is a need for manufactural independence. People don’t want to shop and look for something that might soothe their need, they want to make the very thing they imagined. And with all this beautiful technology it’s all possible in a matter of hours. \n",
      "Here at Nebula, we follow this line of thought, because why settle for something that everyone owns and uses? Instead, we want you to create your own identity, the sound and feel you hear when you imagine yourself playing the guitar. \n",
      "By using 3D printing and all of its advantages we aim for a Belgian, high-quality brand that delivers beautiful, high-end musical freedom. By manufacturing in house we are constantly hands-on with the manufacturing process. If there is a flaw that our costumers report, it can immediately be fixed. \n",

El libro radica en, aproximadamente, un 75% de mi propia historia y de mis experiencias vividas. Todo enfocado a relaciones amorosas fallidas, amores platónicos, errores ajenos y propios que he ido desarrollando. Al final se observa como va cambiando mi punto de vista de las cosas, como pago con unas personas lo sufrido por otras, como me lo hacen a mi.

I successfully Kickstarted Year One and now I’m back to print Year Two and reprint Year One!\n",
      "Check, Please! follows Eric “Bitty” Bittle, a former Georgia junior figure skating champion, vlogger extraordinaire, and master baker who gets a scholarship playing hockey at Samwell University. Not only is Bitty bite-sized for a hockey player, he is not at all a bro and has one great fear: getting checked—or hit—while on the ice.\n",

Over the course of the school year at Samwell, Bitty manages to befriend his bro-y teammates and find a home, all while dealing with the brooding Jack Zimmermann, captain of the Samwell men’s hockey team and former hockey prodigy.  \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Littlebrain Theatre is raising money to fund our devised stage adaptation of Vittorio De Sica's 1948 masterpiece Bicycle Thieves. This is a 60-minute, 9-actor adaptation of the film that will be developed during Fall 2018, for performances in Winter 2019 in Chicago. \n",
      "WHAT IS \"BICYCLE THIEVES?\"\n",
      "Consistently ranked among the greatest works of world cinema, Ladri Di Biciclette (1948) is a hallmark of the Italian neorealism movement. Directed by Vittorio De Sica (Umberto D, La Ciociara), the film is notable for its sweeping camera shots of post-WWII Rome, juxtaposing the poor working conditions of the city with the natural beauty of the city's architecture. The story – about a man named Ricci and his son Bruno, and their quest to track down a bicycle once it is stolen from them – asks powerful questions about the relationship between class and ethics, and what people are willing to do for their families when pushed to the edge. The film was awarded a Special Academy Award in 1950, and claimed the #1 spot on the first Sight & Sound Critic's Poll, being named the best film ever made only four years after its release. As of the 2012 Sight & Sound poll, Bicycle Thieves remains listed at #33 on the Critic's Poll, and #10 on the Director's Poll. \n",
      "WHO ARE LITTLEBRAIN THEATRE?\n",
      "Littlebrain Theatre consists of producer Clare Brennan and director Zach Barr. Both are Chicago-based theatre artists, who have joined forces to collaborate on this initial piece of work. The term \"little brain\" serves a double meaning: as the nickname for the cerebellum, the part of the brain that plays a role in both motor control and language comprehension, and as a description of the kind of work we produce – art that requires just \"a little brain\" to understand. We are committed to telling stories that are easily understood and accessible to as wide an audience as possible. Theatre is for everyone, and Bicycle Thieves is a story that all audiences can gain from hearing nowadays.\n",
      "WHY NOW? WHY \"BICYCLE THIEVES?\"\n",
      "Italy in the late 1940s was just coming out of the Second World War. The economy was weak but just beginning to grow again, the country was divided into political factions, the working class found it difficult to get well-paying jobs, and the overall atmosphere was a sense of foreboding dread that the world wouldn't get better in the future. Sound familiar? While not a perfect parallel to our current climate, Bicycle Thieves' setting provides the perfect opportunity to have a conversation about the link between class and ethics: how the two affect each other, and how easily one person's ethical failings can be easily explained by a society by scapegoating their class. Naturally, every case is more complex than that – and Bicycle Thieves proves this, by allowing an audience to watch as the backstory behind one person's lapse in morality is given the necessary context to identify and understand it, without condoning it. It's a story that's honest, yet uplifting, in a way that makes it necessary in a divided time in history.\n",
      "WHY SHOULDN'T I JUST WATCH THE MOVIE?\n",
      "Bicycle Thieves celebrates its 70th anniversary in 2018, and a modern audience's reading of the film changes dramatically from how it affected audiences upon release. With a new stage adaptation comes the opportunity to double-down on the aspects of the story that are most impactful for a modern audience: the ethical questions it asks, the picture it paints of life in an urban environment, the pressure to find a job that supports your family. At the same time, the adaptation allows us to revisit and revise certain aspects of the film. We plan to cast the adaptation with a diverse group of performers, varying in gender, age, race, ability, and experience. De Sica made it a priority that his movies employ non-professional actors, and not simply film stars. We hope to do the same, inviting in a mixture of actors of different experience levels to bring fresh thoughts and opinions on the source material into our rehearsal room. A stage adaptation also brings a unique challenge to capture the emotional impact of De Sica's brilliant shot compositions. The ensemble-based method of devising keeps our focus on the emotional weight of each moment of the film, rather than simply transcribing the script and performing it verbatim. The stage imagery will compliment the film, rather than replicate it. \n",
      "YOU MENTION \"PERFORMANCES IN WINTER 2019.\" WHEN, EXACTLY?\n",
      "We are currently applying to take Bicycle Thieves to a festival in Chicago that performs in Winter 2019. While we will formally know if we've been selected for the festival in mid-October, we are planning for either option. If we are selected, we will perform with the festival. If not, we fully intend to rent a performance venue and move forward with the project nonetheless. As more information becomes available, we will keep you in the loop. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "MARKETING: We are a small group of theatre artists in a very busy city. We hope to dedicate a portion of our fundraising to ensuring we have a strong enough marketing push to bring an audience out to see this important play. This includes investing in physical posters, targeted audience outreach, and online marketing content. This makes up $400 of the budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "STIPENDS: While not every independent project in the city can afford to pay their actors and designers, we at Littlebrain Theatre are committed to compensating our artists for the work they do. More than $2000 of our $5000 budget goes exclusively to stipends for the artists. If we manage to fundraise beyond our budget, all overflow will go towards increasing actor and designer wages.\n",
      "\n",
      "SIMPLE TECH: We do not currently have the resources to build massive sets or sew intricate period costumes for this play. We will be working with the resources we have to make the best possible adaptation of \"Bicycle Thieves\" we can. Your donations and support go towards helping us to hire the best designers for his project, who can work within the parameters of our simple production to create something impactful. Not to mention, each designer will receive a budget to make sure they can afford to create what they need to for the production.\n",

      "Nothing to be Done opens with a woman called Frankie waking up in bed, incredibly hungover, while someone bashes her door down. Or at least tries to. When she eventually makes it to her door, she discovers it's her best friend Jones.\n",
      " Jones is... a friend. Jones is Frankie's best friend. Jones is at least as mentally unstable as Frankie is in a whole different way.\n",
      "Jones has decided the world isn't real.\n",

      "Well, personally I think it's pretty good. But I'm not the only one, apparently.\n",
      " Besides various folks who've told me they enjoy the comic, Richard Bruton gave it a very nice review over at the Forbidden Planet International Blog, where he not only called me 'older and wiser' (the fool) but also said lovely things such as this:\n",
      "\"And over the 60+ pages Johnson (pretty much) absolutely nails it, giving us page after page of Frankie and Jones talking, the back and forth between the two characters naturalistic and real, his conversational tone spot on, you can hear the post breakup misery in Frankie’s voice, feel every bit of regretful hangover headache as she shakes off last night so slowly, barely processing what Jones has to say for the first twenty or so pages. And once she does realise what he’s saying, her anger kicks in, anger at him for coming to her, today of all days, with another one of his idiot ideas, anger at her girlfriend for the break up, anger at the bottle of gin for being drunk last night, but most of all an anger at herself for fucking it up, fucking it all up once again.\n",
      "So much of the joy of Nothing To Be Done for me is the sheer energy of the artwork on each page, with Johnson’s style switching from earlier work, developing into something of far thicker line, utilising a really fabulously limited palette of colours, rarely switching from what you see here on the page, the exception being a carefully considered flashback sequence or two. I’ve enjoyed his work from the very start, and oh, it’s such a pleasure to be able to point you at something very new and very, very good from him.\"\n",

      "“The Cloned Orphan: A Tragedie Most Black” is a dramatization about a woman named Sarah who sees someone who looks just like her, but as she uncovers the mystery she learns there are even more of them. She may be a clone, one of many, but she will do all she can to live life her own way. With scenes and highlights from the story, this trailer-of-a-play will get you intrigued and caught up on Clone Club- but with a Shakespearean twist.\n",
      "This will be a slightly different style than what we've done before. Our previous projects have been mostly music video parodies and original sketches featuring popular characters, but this one will be more like a trailer than anything else. We will recreate a variety of scenes from the first four seasons of Orphan Black, but rephrased as if they were written by Shakespeare himself. It will also be performed on a stage to help give a more theatrical feel, which is something new and exciting for us!\n",
      "Our script was written by the lovely Aurora Culver, who has a plethora of experience producing and directing stage plays. She is the founder of On The Edge Theater Productions, which has put on several full Shakespeare performances including Macbeth and Twelfth Night. We are thrilled to embark on this journey with her!\n",

      "We found a theater that will accommodate us during this busy season of play productions (L.A. Fringe Festival!), but it is going to cost us for the full 10-12 hours that we need to shoot our video. Not to mention use of their lights and equipment!\n",
      "You've probably noticed that every clone has her own unique style, so we of course need to represent that in this video. While many of our costumes will be provided by friends and crew members, we still have to pay for those pieces we don't yet have. Our goal is to have a mixture of Shakespeare's Elizabethan style and a more modern look (like in the actual show). \n",
      "Wigs! Obviously our main actress won't have the right hair for every clone, so we'll need to have some convincing wigs for her to change into in each scene. Each clone (and Felix!) also has very different makeup styles. We may also need to do special effects makeup for such things as blood on Helena (because let's face it-- when isn't Helena covered in blood?), scars on one of the Castor clone's faces, etc. \n",
      "We already have our camera but we'll need to rent some lighting equipment to help emphasize or diffuse the theater lights. \n",
      "Craft services is important for a full functioning, hard working crew. After that 10th hour, a pick me up can really go a long way! Plus, our cast and crew will need a hot meal to keep them fueled for the second half of shooting. And since it will be the beginning of summer in southern CA, tons of water is a MUST. \n",

      "The biggest risk we're taking on this project is shooting in a method we've never done before. Although we are excited to showcase this more theatrical style through the camera lens, we are aware that things may take longer that expected and that not every line from our script might make it into the final product. In preparation for that, we will be consulting with a few Shakespeare and theater experts before the shooting date, even setting up rehearsals as if we were really putting on a play. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge is shooting on location rather than one of our own homes where we might have more control. This means that we have to be extremely wary of what we touch, where we put things, and making sure the area looks exactly as it did when we first got there. Think of it as being a guest in someone else's home, but having a group of 10-15 other people with you!\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "The idea came about as I was trying to enjoy some music at the hot tub and the pool with my family.  It was very inconvenient to have the device outside of the tub or pool to keep it safe. So I thought of a way to keep all devices together, while floating, be able to skip a song, search or turn the volume up or down without getting out of the water.... that sounds like a good idea.\n",
      "I am a product developer, and I had many ideas of possible products that people may like or find useful, but this is a very simple idea that just made it very easy to pursue. Its a product that made sense to me, and it will make sense to others; plus its very affordable.  You really get the bang for your buck.  its technically three products in one.  1. Water proof speaker, 2. a water proof floating phone case, and the innovating part of the product, 3. the inflatable base.\n",
      "Stage 1 - The concept:  A little background on the origin of the initial concepts; We started thinking on the inflatable as the main base, and how to bring all the elements in the same environment.  Our first design was an attempt to keep an easy and accessible interface to the user at the same time keeping the devices safe.  That's how we came up with our 3 core design goals: \n",
      "1. Easy to set up and use,  2. Portable, and 3. keep the devices safe.\n",
      "Stage 2 - proof of concept:  At this stage we started documenting all design parameters for each one of the elements. we received our first prototypes of the inflatable body, phone case, and samples of speakers, batteries and drivers.\n",
      "Stage 3 - Design clean up:  We finalized gathering all product requirements and started modifying more of the aesthetic part of the project to make it more appealing.  When we introduced the product industrial design to the project, we discovered a whole spectrum of possibilities to make our product great. \n",
      "During stage 3, we tested the new design features, received revised prototypes of the inflatable, and with all audio specifications from stage 1, we teamed up with a speaker  manufacturer that will design and manufacture our IPX7 speaker.\n",
      "Stage 4 - Design challenges and troubleshooting: After testing the new design, there were minor and major challenges that came about.  Starting with minor challenges, the inflatable body was too small for the total weight of the upper portion.  The design of the inflatable itself was a challenge from the manufacturing perspective.  But we ran into a major challenge, the cellphone overheated in 30 minutes of use on direct sun heat.  This was a show stopper, we could not risk peoples devices.  So, we went back to the drawing board.\n",
      "By recognizing the major challenge, and trying to keep the our core design features, we found a way to keep the devices protected from heat.\n",
      "Also keeping the versatility and convenience of the product, we solved for the main challenge and kept our core design goals: \n",
      "1. Easy to set up and use,  2. Portable, and 3. keep the devices safe.\n",
      "Stage 5 - Final design, ready for manufacturing: During the design stages of this project, we have established a great relationship with those who will be making our product come true. Our vendors are key to the success of this project, and we are now working on a small batch of marketing samples to push our product.  We will be heading all our marketing initiatives in Miami, FL.  And during those events, we will be raffling 15 - 20 products per event.  As we work on the final stage of this project, we can share the final product renders.  We cannot wait to launch our product and bring the fun to any environment.  Specially water.\n",

      "We will try to be proactive, and if we see that the project is funded within the first week or two, we will start producing in advance trying to beat the production timeline and get it to our supporters in the time promised.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a couple of product \"to be aware of\" - The charging port will have to be secured, so water cannot travel to the inside of the electronic components.  The speaker its IPX7, so it is water proof,  and it can sit in water for a good period of time, but it is not designed to be submerged, as the water pressure will break the IPX7 seals.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "We present you an innovative stand to greatly comfort your headphone experience. Our headphone stand gives your headphones a sturdy place to rest on. But that's not all, it also brings you an unique switching ability between multiple input devices. The input devices connect through the stand to your headphones. The two knobs on the device make it easy to adjust to your preferred sound or input device.\n",
      "Headphones shouldn’t suffer on your desk or some cheap plastic. Our stand is made from an authentic combination of wood and aluminum. These natural yet durable materials ensure your headset to rest conveniently. Our handcrafted Dutch design fits right in place when deployed.\n",
      "The Kubuni Headphonestand originated from a couple of problems. A lot of people spend long hours behind a desk, be it for work or entertainment. Headphones are an important part of that place. This created the need for a product that could hold our headphones for us, which enables a clean working space. The product is making the life of the user much more convenient, since the product is tackling many problems. Plus it's all put in a durable casing, with zero environmental impact. Seeing the branch doesn't have such a similar product, we have decided to take action.\n",
      "When we started developing the stand, we found some other needs and implemented these into the product. The first need was to control the volume of your headphones with one physical knob, so we placed one on the product. The second need was to have the possibility to wirelessly connect with your pair of wired headphones. This makes that you can easily enjoy some high-quality music via Bluetooth from your smartphone. And when you want to switch back to your wired source, a desktop, laptop, record player or anything else, you just switch back in one click. This is all done by using the second knob put on the product. And since we appreciate good music, we strive for a super clean sound. We therefore integrated some ingenious solutions and deliver an external ground-loop. This results in a very clean listening experience without any unwanted noises.\n",
      "The Headphonestand is a unique product which will be sold in limited numbers. We especially grant crowdfunding backers the option to choose from four different kinds of wood for their stand. Backers who choose a special edition are granted with a personal engraving on the stand. You can choose your engraving and the kind of wood in the survey at the end of the campaign.\n",
      "The whole package of components is wrapped in a durable and handcrafted casing. We've used high-quality aluminum, together with a few very beautiful wood veneers. All the materials were selected with quality and environment in mind, and are crafted with ultra-precision. The beauty of the product is a combination of techniques used to produce. The wood parts are fabricated using pure craftsmanship and traditional methods. The steel parts are laser cut and bent by using more modern techniques. And finally the assembly is done by hand, so we can guarantee qualitative products, put together with care and passion.\n",
      "We carefully select our material suppliers for quality and environmental friendliness. Although this comes at a price, it does make a difference. The same goes for our components, when possible we select the more reliable suppliers. This is sadly not the case on almost all products on the market today. The product is designed so it can be easily repaired and disassembled for recycling. This is how we make a circular economical product. The remaining environmental costs are invested in projects helping the earth. This will be made possible by multiple charities. In the end you will enjoy a beautiful product, and the earth isn't negatively affected.\n",
      "The quality of the product is of significant importance. We regularly check on the production process and make sure every stand is checked on damage before shipment. If your stand is not as it should be, we will gladly hear from you.\n",
      " Inside of the product are several components, all with the aim to improve audio quality and provide you ease of use. We use high-grade Qualcomm chips to realize precise wireless sound, with full bass. To make sure there are no unwanted noises whatsoever, we also implemented an isolated converter to guarantee there’s no interference noise. Should there be any noise from your own device, no problem: you can connect the delivered ground loop with your cables for optimal sound. The volume control and switching system we use are high-grade analog parts, what also applies to the aux-ports.\n",
      "Why Kickstarter\n",
      "We turned to Kickstarter because we saw ourselves on the leading edge of a new way to create sustainable products to the market. Most of the products on the market nowadays are not environmental friendly. Our vision is to make a change to the consumer electronics market by creating an environmental friendly trend. The funds raised during this campaign will assist us to place initial orders with our manufacturer.\n",
      "International Backers\n",
      "While our shipping partners ship worldwide, it's still possible that in a rare case your country is not available for shipping. If that is the case, we will contact you to discuss further options. Please also note that you will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region. Please contact your local customs office if you are unsure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimated Delivery\n",
      "Shipment can vary for backers depending on your order and the destined address. While we do not expect these to change, it is possible that the estimated shipment month may shift. We will provide updates when/if the estimated shipment date changes.\n",
      "Warranty \n",
      "We stand firmly behind our products. Each Headphonestand has a 1-year limited warranty. Contact us if you think you apply for the warranty, our warranty terms can be found in the general terms.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "As seen earlier, we make the products ourselves. It goes without saying that regular quality checks are evident. There are still risks in successfully tooling, assembling, and producing these products. Especially since almost everything is handmade. In addition to the challenges that present themselves in manufacturing, other unforeseen problems may occur throughout our primary process.\n",
      "If there are any problems regarding production, shipping etcetera, we’ll communicate it as soon as possible.\n",
      "In addition to this heavy talk, we welcome any questions you might have that are not answered yet on: Kickstarter@Kubuni.nl\n",

      "After the successful launch of our Tom Rice A-11 in 2019, we have continued our mission of working with veterans to share their legendary stories. This led us to Vince Speranza, a WW2 veteran of the 101st Airborne Division. Since then, we’ve been working on developing a watch fit for the hero: the A-11 Vince Speranza Edition.\n",
      "Vince made a name for himself at the Battle of the Bulge as a machine-gunner, manning an M1919. He was part of the heroic defense of the Belgium city of Bastogne.\n",
      "Created in honor of the fallen heroes and veterans who fought and resisted against all odds at the Battle of the Bulge, we are proud to present our A-11 Vince Speranza Edition.  Assembled in the USA\n",
      "The A-11 Vince Speranza Edition is a watch that we’ve been on for months to provide you with the best possible value. Featuring American Assembly, a choice of Swiss or Japanese Automatic Movement, and a double domed sapphire, we’ve built a quality watch made to withstand tough everyday use.\n",
      "Our A-11 is powered by a choice of either a Swiss or Japanese Automatic Movement. These types of movements feature a self-powering mechanism forgoing the use of batteries to keep track of time. The watch will recharge itself with the movement of your wrist as long as you use it daily. For the more nostalgic, both movements will also feature manual wind-up - just like the original A-11’s did. \n",
      "A neat feature included in both packages is the ability for movement hacking - another key component of original A-11s for coordination between different groups.\n",
      "Original A-11s featured a domed acrylic glass which was cheap to manufacture and easy to scratch. We’ve modernized our A-11 by using the strongest glass available to the industry today: Sapphire. \n",
      "Extremely scratch resistant with a 9/10 on the MOS hardness scale you won’t need to worry about going rough on this watch.\n",
      "In addition, we’ve kept the original double dome shape of the crystal in order to stay as authentic as possible giving a unique side profile and personality to our A-11 VS edition.\n",
      "All our A-11 Vince Speranza Edition watches will be using high-quality Italian Leather to ensure comfortable wear and solid resistance to tear. We’ve gone into a custom design for both versions of our straps to include references to Vince's trusted M1919 30.cal Machine gun. \n",
      "Our M1919 Strap reproduces directly the barrel of Vince’s Machine Gun whereas the Machine Gunner strap features an embossed M1919 drawing on the front and, an engraving on the back referencing Vince’s Battle of the Bulge experience. \n",
      "The caseback is probably the most unique piece on our A-11 Vince Speranza Edition. First off, we’ve got many questions about the bullet and its impact on comfort. Rest assured, we’ve tested it out over multiple weeks with no issues whatsoever to our wrists.  Also, a diverse panel of Bloggers and YouTubers have received samples and highlighted that the watch was comfortable on their wrists.\n",
      "Indeed, we went for an original design featuring a down-sized 30.cal bullet on the case-back at Vince’s request. We’ve also added markings that tell the story behind the A-11 watch and, make sure that the sacrifices made by our veterans are never forgotten.\n",
      "Army Veteran Vince Speranza served in the 101st Airborne Division, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment. He survived the brutal winter of ’44/’45 and the Battle of the Bulge, one of the deadliest battles in World War II.\n",
      "Speranza tells many stories of his time in World War II in his book, Nuts! A 101st Airborne Division Machine Gunner at Bastogne. He fought in combat as a machine gunner, freed Holocaust survivors and became a local legend for his selflessness.\n",
      "A-11 wristwatches were manufactured during WWII according to a U.S. military standard. American watch companies like Elgin, Waltham, and Bulova produced these watches. Most of them had white hands and Arabic numerals, as well as 60-minute graduations on their plain black dials. These watches were mission-critical as they allowed for troops to coordinate their attacks and effectively communicate to each other.\n",
      "The Vince Speranza A-11, in many ways, is an upgraded version of the original A-11 watches produced in WWII.  The reinterpretation doesn’t have a diameter of 32mm anymore, but it’s available in two larger sizes of 38 and 42mm. \n",

      "WHY ARE WE FUNDRAISING?\n",
      "We really need your help to meet the basic costs of bringing our critically acclaimed new solo show to the Baillie Room at Assembly Hall, one of the top venues at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival. REALLY WANT TO HURT ME is written and directed by Ben SantaMaria, and performed by Ryan Price, under the company name of Flaming Theatre.\n",
      "WHAT'S THE PROJECT?\n",
      "UK charity Stonewall’s 2017 School Report study found that nearly half of all LGBTQ pupils still face bullying and half regularly hear homophobic insults, with frequent experiences of low self-worth, self-harm and attempted suicide.\n",
      "REALLY WANT TO HURT ME gives audiences an intimate, first-hand experience of what it's like to survive these traumatic experiences through the personal history of one boy.\n",
      "This funny and painfully honest play is about growing up gay in Exeter in the '80s, with only the magic force field of your favourite pop songs to protect you. It's about how the rigid social rules of the real 1984 often felt closer to Orwell's version of it. It's about the all-consuming shame and fear that gay and gender-nonconforming kids battled with then – and still do now. It's about the innocent joy of loving Culture Club's \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?\" like your life depends on it. Because in a way it actually does. And it's about the pain of wanting to run away from the place that's shaped your whole life, and celebrating that lost time for all the things you couldn't appreciate about it back then. So it speaks directly to younger and older audiences alike.\n",
      "We started out with London performances of a 20-minute version last year, which was longlisted from 1136 entries for Heretic Voices, a national monologue writing award at the Arcola Theatre.\n",
      "We then managed to secure funding from Arts Council England, together with generous support from Kickstarter donors, to develop a full-length production. Our first previews at Exeter's Bike Shed Theatre were selected for their Judges' Pick of the Festival industry showcase. Our sold-out London previews at the Old Red Lion received seven 4-star reviews. West End and Broadway director Sean Mathias saw the show there and said: “Ben SantaMaria’s rites of passage play REALLY WANT TO HURT ME is funny, touching and beautifully showcases the talents of the charming Ryan Price.”\n",
      "On the strength of these reviews, we secured a booking with Assembly, one of the most prestigious Edinburgh festival venues. This is a huge opportunity for us to build on those previews and share our story more widely, with a full run at the biggest theatre festival in the world from 2-27 August.\n",
      "These Edinburgh dates will be a crucial next step for Ben's company Flaming Theatre, which he's relaunching for this run. We hope to tour the play across the UK after this.\n",
      "Ben has been selected for this year's Edinburgh Lab at Soho Theatre, to continue preparing the show for August with their guidance.\n",
      "Opening Doors London, the biggest UK charity for older LGBT people, has also invited us to perform the short version of our play at their summer party for 200 guests at NBC Universal's Skyline Bar. Following on from our successful post-show discussions with Amnesty UK's LGBTI Network, LGBT History Month and School's Out UK, we will continue to organise events that reach out to the wider LGBTQ community and their allies when we tour the show later in the year.\n",
      "WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?\n",
      "Arts Council England doesn't fund tours to Scotland, so we need to raise the money for our rehearsal room bookings, travel to Edinburgh, accommodation, venue fees, flyers, posters and also keep ourselves afloat for that month. \n",
      "Ben is committed to continue paying Ryan an Equity-approved actor's fee for the Edinburgh run, so he can afford to keep performing the show so brilliantly.\n",
      "Ben's own wages and living expenses won't be covered by the goal we've set for this campaign. If we manage to reach our target, any amount raised above that would help him to be paid for his work as well.\n",
      "Either way, we won't make a profit - we're doing this for the project. So any amount you can spare would be hugely appreciated, and we promise it will only be spent on essential production costs.\n",
      "Thank you so much for supporting our work! You're helping to bring vital, three-dimensional stories of LGBTQ life experiences to new audiences.\n",
      "WHO ARE WE?\n",
      "Ben grew up in Exeter. He was selected for the National Theatre Studio Directors' Course and has directed a wide range of classic, devised and new plays in London and Cambridge, including JARMAN GARDEN, a critically praised multimedia production about the late artist Derek Jarman at Riverside Studios, which was a finalist for the Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust Award. Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys called it “a beautifully choreographed tour through Derek’s life and world.” Ben assistant directed at Shakespeare's Globe and co-directed AFTER ORLANDO for Chaskis Theatre Company at Theatre Royal Stratford East and The Vaults, Waterloo.  His latest play LULLA reached the top 100 list from 1060 entries for the 2017 Verity Bargate Award at Soho Theatre. His other plays have been staged at venues including Theatre503, Southwark Playhouse and ARC Stockton.\n",
      "Ryan trained at East 15 Acting School and The Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. He was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Bursary and chosen to represent the Conservatoire for the Stephen Sondheim Student Performer of the Year Award. He performed with Action to The Word in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM at Latitude Festival and on the National Theatre's River Stage. He toured Austria with Vienna's English Theatre in THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES and performed in new musical THE MASTERS OF MYSTERY at the Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Venues don't offer any financial support to companies when they book them for Edinburgh. We have to pay them for the performance space, technical support, being listed in their festival brochures, and so on. Even on our tight budget, the costs quickly pile up. \n",
      "\n",
      "So no money will make things very financially tough for us - it's as simple as that!\n",
      "\n",
      "Our previous development project budget was carefully planned, came in on target and had the Arts Council's seal of approval. We've been a strong team together so far and believe our plans are pretty solid. With your help, we can take this important story to the next level!\n",

      "Way back in 2008, I got an idea for a Mature story.  It wasn't much; I just wanted a cute bee and a sexy flower to have yaoi hijinks together.  I didn't realize how it would take off and become popular with yaoi fans.  I was happy to get my story out there. It was very rough, crude even, but people enjoyed the world and the characters I created. Some even added to the growing world.\n",
      "The story of Rights of Spring centers on three couples: The Free Lovers- Chrys and Pio, The Fated Lovers- Ori and Lillybell, and The Forever Lovers- Nodus and Lyle.  It follows the development of their love and how it affects all around them. \n",
      "There's romance, drama, comedy, and of course lots and LOTS of love making-Yaoi style!\n",
      " A lot has changed in my life (drawing skills included) and I wanted to reboot the story so it flowed better.  I also wanted to change the look of it so I relaunched Rights of Spring to much success! \n",

Die grösste Herausforderung wird die Übergabe der Produktion an die entsprechende Sozialinstitution sein. Gerne hätten wir diesen Teil besser vorbereitet. Doch dazu fehlten uns die finanziellen Ressourcen. Aus diesem Grund werden wir die ersten Lautsprecher wohl auch nicht komplett extern fertigen lassen können.\n",
      "Wir leben für unseren Traum. Damit dieser Traum Realität wird, haben wir bewusst darauf verzichtet, externe Investoren für Euphony zu gewinnen. Wir möchten unabhängig bleiben und frei über Geschäftsstrategien, Gewinnmargen etc. entscheiden. Um finanziell über die Runden zu kommen, müssen wir neben Euphony einen \"normalen\" Job ausüben.

      "Classic waves, samplers from our favourite synthesizers or sampled instruments can be loaded on to it.\n",
      "Ctrl-x collects different types of synthesis such as FM and RM or one complete section to carry out waveshaper and other sections for synthesis by phase distortion.\n",
      "Both sections can be mixed with our oscillator sf2 or be used as single signal.\n",
      "It also counts on a unison engine with pitch independence to diffuse these voices through a different spectrum from the original signal.\n",
      "A sub-oscillator with classic waves and octave selection complete the oscillator.\n",
      "Filters\n",
      " \n",
      "Filters and more filters sum up this section. We offer you different types of filters: classic filter emulations, transistor ladders, diodes, state variables, comb… with more than 50 types of slopes. And all these come with a slight equalization and a soft distortion to give character to signal.\n",
      "Modulation\n",
      "The stuff gets serious here. The LFOs also work through soundfont; again, hundreds of waves available to modulate. Adds a slight entrance fade or uses some from the sequencers to shoot the tune and create innovative rhythms in an easy and quick way, without forgetting the available modulation envelopes.\n",
      "The Matrix is the en-routing brain. We´ve divided the modulation destinations into two areas: One to choose the section and another to choose the value, to avoid huge menus, the quick allocation is thus guaranteed.\n",
      " Hardware   \n",
      "\n",
      "At Ctrl x we count on an integrated step sequencer to use either with hardware or with software. Its multi-touch screen gives us quick and intuitive edition. The encoders give us the precision for certain more sensitive aspects. Together they are the perfect team.\n",
      " We consider template creation something which is always tiresome, that´s why we´ve made an effort to create them in the quickest possible way.\n",
      "\n",
      "We´ve created a software where you’ll be able to produce and personalize your own templates in a quick and simple way. To learn more about this, let´s take a look at the video.\n",
      " If you like making a mess with stuff and you aren´t afraid of programming, Ctrl x is compatible with Arduino, which is why the possibilities are almost endless: Send some messages through the mackie control protocol to control your sequencer reproduction or stoppage, create your own arpeggiator or customize your machine.\n",
      " Ctrl x is in its prototype phase at the moment, even if all its electronics and its programming is already in its final stage. The moulds are produced with a 3D printer, that is why the finishing touch is still really far from its final result. That is due to the fact that injection moulds have a very high cost, surpassing the €25,000. This is one of the reasons for the crowdfunding, another one is the importance of producing big quantities, as this cuts prices on components, materials and labour, allowing us to reduce the sales price.\n",
      " After several years working on different prototypes related to music production, we created Ctrl Boy - a complete midi controller.\n",
      "Our first intention was to put it in a Kickstarter, but as we saw that there was a lot of potential in the system we had created, we decided to launch other functions such as step sequencer or synthesizer and further optimize the midi controller.\n",

      " The Murel Venom™ securely and comfortably hugs your ears. Experience comfort and security even after hours of use. Your ears won't get fatigued liked they do with other truly wireless earbuds.\n",
      "- POWERFUL DESIGN - \n",
      "We've designed the Murel Venom™ to be as small as possible and still deliver an incredible HD audio experience. We strongly feel that current truly wireless headphones on the market completely miss the mark by designing their headphones with small and weak drivers--which produce weak and poor sound. In addition, many truly wireless headphones only offer 1-2 hours of listening between charges.\n",
      " IN THE BOX: YOU WILL RECEIVE: THE MUREL VENOM HEADPHONES, CHARGING CASE, 3 SIZES OF SILICON EARTIPS, USB CHARGING CABLE, AND USER MANUAL. \n",
      "We've taken extra care in the design and development of the Murel Venom™ charging case. The Charging case will charge your headphones up to 3 times...thereby extending your music playtime to an incredible 25.5 hours before you need to charge the case!\n",
      " - PERFECT FOR EVERY ACTIVITY - \n",
      "The Murel Venom™ is the perfect headphones for almost any activity. The unique one-size-fits all hook design keeps the headphones securely in your ears while doing the most aggressive workouts, bike riding, jumping, running, etc. Feel secure and confident your headphones will stay put doing any activity! The Murel Venom™ is also great for the not-so aggressive activities, like watching movies, taking calls, or just listening to music. The Murel Venom™ delivers HD-quality sound while doing all of your favorite activities.\n",
      " - THE BEST TECHNOLOGIES - \n",
      "The Murel Venom™ boasts a partnership with companies like Liquipel™ and Comply™.  Liquipel™ has an incredible nano-coating treatment which protects against water and sweat. And Comply™ supplies us with foam ear tips which enhance both the sound and fitment when paired with the Murel Venom™.\n",
      " - MUREL ZERO - \n",
      "Last year we launched and successfully delivered the Murel Zero™. Our backers loved the HD-sound quality as well as the incredible strong Bluetooth™ connectivity. But we realized through customer feedback that security of the fitment was lacking.\n",
      " - FRANKEN-PROTOTYPE - \n",
      "So we set out to improve upon the current design by adding a flexible hook that wraps around the ear. We took the Murel Zero™ and a hook from another set of headphones and used special bonding puddy to create our first rough prototype of the Murel Venom™. We personally used this custom prototype in the gym and loved the fitment! We realized we were onto something big! \n",
      " - ROUGH SKETCHES - \n",
      "From the hand-made sample, we developed sketches that would give a rough outline for the dimensions of the new design.\n",
      " - 2D SCHEMATICS - \n",
      "From these rough sketches, we designed and developed in more detail the outside shell of the new design. Every angle and dimensions was added to make sure the overall form of the Murel Venom™ was covered. In fact, we used giant circles to give the outside curves their form. If you look closely you'll notice that every line on the Murel Venom™ is curved. This gives the overall design a very futuristic and avant-guard feel to it.\n",
      " - 3D MODEL -  From the 2D design we had a 3D designer create the 3D CAD files in SolidWorks. This design only included the outside walls and did not include the inside components. Those inside details would come later once we've finalized the outside form.\n",
      " - RENDERINGS FIRST ROUND -  We were a little early in doing the 3D photo-realistic renderings from these early 3D files. But we wanted to get an idea of how the final product would look. These renderings would later be modified and altered slightly by the factory in order to accommodate the design of the components on the inside.\n",
      " - DFM - \"DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING\" - \n",
      "We then started to work closer with the factory. In order to get the 3D files ready to be manufactured, the factory engineers created the DFM files \"Design for Manufacturing\". These files are the final and complete files the factory will use to create the injection molding tooling, as well as source the components which will be used during the manufacturing process. The DFM file is the last step before the manufacturing process can be started.\n",
      " - MACHINE PROTOTYPE ONE -  From the DFM files the factory produced two different sets of prototypes. These are hi-fidelity prototypes which are used to test the overall design of the headphones. As you can see in this photo, we did consider embedding wire inside the ear hook in order to allow the user to custom form the hook to fit the ear. In the end we decided against this final design. Instead, we use the natural spring of the TPU material to maintain a comfortable and snug fitment around the ear.\n",
      " - MACHINED PROTOTYPE TWO -  The second prototype set was identical to the first with exception to the hooks--which didn't include the internal wire. We decided this was the best design for the headphones. We added some modeling paint to see how the finished and final colors would look.\n",
      " - FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE -  Our last prototype is a 100% functional prototype. It features all of the electronic components that will go into the final product. This is the unit we've been testing for sound quality and Bluetooth™ distance and connectivity. We can confidently say it has exceeded our expectations. The fitment is secure and doesn't fatigue the ear. Also, The HD audio sounds incredible! And the Bluetooth™ connection is hands down the best we've ever experienced.\n",
      " - FINAL RENDERINGS -  From the final DFM (Design for Manufacturing) 3D model we were able to generate hi-fidelity photo-realistic renderings to show how the final product will look once in production. We love how the white looks in this final design embodiment, However, we are open to doing other color combinations once certain milestone are met.\n",
      " - FINAL ALUMINUM PROTOTYPE -  We decided that for the final prototype and the final production we would make the Venom out of machined aluminum to give it that high-end and study look and feel. \n",
      " - BE PART OF THE MUREL VENOM STORY - \n",
      "You are the last step in the Murel Venom™ story. We have come as far as we can without your support. With your support we can bring this awesome product to market and into your hands! let's do this!\n",
      " Murel™ has multiple patents pending on the Murel Venom™. One of which is the CUx™ (Copper Alloy Antenna) which has both an incredible extended range of connection as well as superior connection without interruptions. Secondly, we have a design patent pending for the Venom's™ unique design. We feel strongly that these two patents along with the superior manufacturing capability of our factory, the Venom™ will provide an experience like none other.\n",
      "Q. How do I choose my color?\n",
      "A. The color selection will happen shortly after purchase...once the stretch goals have been met.\n",
      "Q. Is there a microphone included?\n",
      "A. Yes! You'll be able to take and make calls. Each of the two headphones contains a omni-directional microphone. No hands!\n",

      "A. We are committed to providing the very best experience possible for our backers and loyal customers. We offer a 1-year warranty on all the electronic components.\n",
      "Q. I have small / abnormal ears, will the earbuds fit?\n",
      "A. Yes, the unique ear-hook design of the Murel Venom allows it to fit on any ear regardless of shape or size. Also, you will receive multiple sizes of silicon ear tips to fit any size ear canal.\n",
      "Q. How is the sound quality?\n",
      "A. Sounds Quality is the most important priority for us. We are committed to delivering to you HD quality sound.

      "Q. Are the earbuds waterproof?\n",
      "A. They are water resistant. They are treated with a nano-coating over the electronics called Liquipel,  which makes them extremely resistant to water and sweat. So feel free to use them in the rain. \n",
      "Q. What happens if I change my address before you ship?\n",
      "A. We'll make an announcement 1 week before we ship. You'll then be able to update your address on your Kickstarter profile.\n",

The sound quality is on par or exceeds that of wired headphone that I have owned. And it is true that the Murel Zeros have no skipping. Thanks for a great product and hope to see more outstanding products in the future!\" \n",
      "– Richard \n",
      "\"The Murel's are one of the best campaigns I've ever backed. You guys delivered in a timely manner with a great product. The bluetooth connection is smooth and the music is strong and clear. Love that they are priced for the average person\" \n",
      "– Isabel\n",
      "\"Personally i like sound to be represented in a spacious, lively way with the emphasize on the bass. Finally i understand that comparing wired to wireless and earbuds to headphones is not a fair comparison in soundquality but my goal is simply giving an idea of the soundquality. Songs: Editors - Honesty (44.1 khz / 16 bits mp3) Pearl Jam - Man of the Hour live (44.1 khz / 16 bits FLAC) Raging Fyah - Fight (44.1 khz / 16 bits mp3) Kim André Arnesen - Magnificat performed live (2822.4 khz DSD) While doing this comparison i found that i am even more impressed with these wireless earbuds then beforehand. The overall sound is neutral and for earbuds very spacious with good details. The quality is definitely above average. It does however all come to down to the perfect fit. In my case this means i regret not buying the extra comply tips since i am guessing this would improve the overall fit in my case. So would i recommend the Murel Zero's to others? Yes, rid yourself of wires but not from good quality and get these Zeros\"\n",
      "– Etienne\n",
      "\"I have been thinking of sending yall a thank you since I got my headphones. These headphones have joined my all my other tech in my gig bag for everyday life. The headphones are a true life saver whenever I just need to sit back and relax with my music. The simplicity of turning them on and getting them connected before getting out of my car makes my life quick and easy. The clarity and sound of the drivers are exceptional and I'm so glad I backed this project. keep up the great work, I'll be buying more products soon\" \n",
      "– Ricardo\n",
      "\"I must say that I am very happy with my murels. I have backed fireflies earbuds and murels on KS and there is no comparison which earbuds sound better and hold a longer charge. Another bonus is being able to answer incoming calls whereas with my fireflies I always had to take one earbud out to answer incoming calls.\" \n",
      "– Dan\n",
      "\"I had a pair of wireless sport headphones from another company that just weren't performing up to par for my needs. With only 11 reviews at the time of purchase, I took a risk on these headphones and couldn't be happier. Great headphones; I can't recommend them enough.\"\n",
      "– Tony\n",
      "\"I Love these headphones. Design is great, sound is loud and clean. I am confident that this company will continue to put out great products and continue their exceptional customer service.\"\n",
      "– Gary\n",
      "\"I have been using the Murel P01 earbuds for about a year and a half. I have loved their fit and length of charge. They will last 8 hours on a charge. I run ultramarathons and spend a lot of time running at one outing. The earbuds stay comfortable and don't fall out of my ear. I'm looking forward to my next pair, the P02's!\"\n",
      "– Mark\n",
      "\"These are great buds! I love mine. They fit nicely and are sweat resistant. I highly recommend these. Their customer service is excellent!\"\n",
      "– Mike\n",
      "\"I have to say that this company stands behind there product and will go above an beyond to make sure there customers are happy and that to me is the greatest thing about these headphones.

      " Murel™ is proud to be a company that is born from crowdfunding. We believe that together we can make something much greater. We’d like to thank all of our backers and customers who support the Murel™ brand. Murel™ was founded with the quest to improve upon the past. Our last company CruxCase LLC, received international acclaim including being featured in Wired, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, as well as being highlighted in two recent books: “iPad Secrets”  and “Crowdfund Investing For Dummies”. In October of 2012 Crux launched a high-end aluminum product called the CruxSKUNK. This product succeeded in raising $500K on both kickstarter.com and the website. In total, Crux has pre-sold nearly $1 Million in product through crowdfunding. Crux was sold to BGZ Brands in July of 2014. Murel™ is a company founded on our passion for sport combined with our unique design-crowdfunding DNA. Our mission is to design and develop incredible products for sport & adventure enthusiasts. We hope you'll join us on this new journey!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The risks and challenges that Murel faces are very manageable. We already have a working prototype that is functioning exactly the way we want it to. We are aware that there are always shipping challenges to international backers which may be a challenge. Also, we are aware of and have experienced the challenges of shipping, customer service, and replacements. We plan to increase our shipping and customer service capacity by hiring out help for these two potential bottlenecks. But we plan to address each of these by a case by case scenario. Finally, there are quality control issues that may arise. We plan to personally do a quality control check of the shipment before it leaves China. We are confident that we can overcome any challenges that come our way.\n",

      "ADVANCED GT-R is an open-back full-size over-ear headphones that are built from the ground up to deliver uncompromising audiophile sound from its proprietary planar magnetic drivers.\n",
      "We have been showing our GT-R headphones at various headphone shows around the globe and have received approval from many seasoned audiophiles.  \n",
      "Following are some of the comments and reviews from the revered audiophiles:\n",
      "We also received an official, independent measurement of the GT-R from Head-fi.org using their state-of-the-art headphone measuring system to strengthen the credibility of our claim for high sound quality.\n",
      "Check out the interview of co-founders Peter and Joe from the video below:\n",
      "The proprietary single-sided 65mm planar magnetic driver used to power the GT-R provides extremely transient and quick bass response and treble extension that far exceeds regular headphones in the market.\n",
      "The open-back design means that the back of the headphone housing is open. This allows the sound-stage to be ever so expansive, and its imaging to be accurate and realistic.\n",
      "The GT-R is designed to be comfortable for long listening sessions by utilizing the self- adjusting headband, exquisite protein leather and super-soft memory ear pads and padded headband. The ear cups rotate 180-degree to fit the contour of your head perfectly.\n",
      "The GT-R is beautifully constructed with the premium high-strength steel and highest quality protein leather for prolonged durability. Each part is meticulously prepared and precision- assembled with near-zero tolerance for play.\n",
      "The GT-R has already gone through prototype stage of development and is in its final stage of development. The fund from Kickstarter will allow us to open required tooling and secure raw material in order to kick off the production.\n",
      "It was for the love of music. It was the respect for all musicians of the past, present and future. It was for the struggling instrumental buried under the heavy bass line. It was for the audiophiles craving that crystal clear and mind-blowing detail. We wanted to bring the ultimate aural experience in a package that is simply affordable for everyone - because we believe that everyone deserves good sound.\n",
      "Our quest for the ultimate sound has just begun. We're working relentlessly with world's renowned audio engineers that have brought some of the best sound to the market as well as local and global musicians in different genres ranging from hard rock, hip-hop, EDM to jazz for that advanced sound.\n",

The first season of the strip kicks off with the birth of Wes’ son, Parker, and - together with his wife, Kari - Wes must ensure that his child thrives in a warm, loving environment with plenty of food and water. Parenthood is hard! But it’s also hilarious! So at least it has THAT going for it.\n",

      "“'MOLEBASHED' features a reliable narrator because he’s a real person. It’s Wes. And Kari. And Parker. It’s a window for Wes to shout from, but a mirror for the rest of us. We’ve been there, are there or will be there: It’s that simple.\"     - Michael Jantze [from the foreword] (The Norm)\n",
      "\"Wes has created that strip the internet (and the world) needs right now: a funny, loving, crazy, silly, cute, adorable strip about young people making even younger people and surviving it one day at a time. If you've been there, like me, it will bring it all back, but if you haven't yet, it will make you want to be there! Oh- and it looks like Michael Jantze's and Bill Watterson's love child - how great is that?! \"           - Tom Bancroft (Disney Animation Vet, Character Designer, Webcomicker, Author, Podcaster)\n",
      "\"I don't read many webcomics. If you know that, and you know me, you might not think that I'd regularly follow a slice-of-life webcomic about a mild-mannered, church-positive couple and their baby, but you'd be dead wrong. With MOLEBASHED, Wes has created something that he very clearly cares about, and he manages to make even the most mundane task or child-friendly observation funny. And I needn't say anything about the art; Wes' style has always been a draw, and his delicious color scheme on MOLEBASHED is icing on the art cake!\"     - Danielle Corsetto (Girls With Slingshots)\n",
      "\"MOLEBASHED is a comic I faithfully follow, and quite honestly I don't follow a whole lot. The artist, Wes Molebash, is a down-to-earth guy who keeps his strip clean, minimal, friendly and full of heart. It's just himself, his wife and baby... and a six-color color scheme. Webcomics have mostly been dominated by fanboy gamer culture and a swarm of disenfranchised misanthropes, while MOLEBASHED represents a rising revolution that returns to the beauty of everyday slices of life in the tradition of the Sunday comics we grew up with. It has my highest recommendation.\"      - Matthew Paul Mewhorter (Cancer Owl)\n",
      "\"I can't think of many more occupations in life that need to be approached with a good sense of humor than being a husband and father. Wes' strip MOLEBASHED delivers all the charm and humor of raising a young family, but spares me from having to change the diapers.\"      - Anthony Holden (freelance story and development artist)\n",

      "The primary goal for this project is to raise $12,500. With that money we'll be able to print a run of MOLEBASHED Season 1 books. But if we go above and beyond the initial $12.5K, here's what I plan to do with the moola: \n",

There’s always a chance the books could get delayed in transit somewhere, but I’ve left some wiggle room in the estimated ship dates.

I have already completed one third of the work. Fifty percent of the daily prayers are already in the database. Plus I use them every day and so if there are modifications I make them on the fly.

Miraculously, cold beverages stay cold and hot beverages stay hot, but not at the same time. Tests show up to 6 hours for hot coffee and up to 24 hours for water with ice.\n",

      "Screw-on plastic top won’t leak when you tip your bottle over at the gym. Flip-up sippy spout allows you to drink without removing the top. Removable, interior straw enables you to get to the dregs. All plastic parts are BPA-free. Tip: To prevent leaks when the bottle tips over, close the sippy spout. Duh.\n",
      "Bottle diameter is 3\" (76mm) so it will fit in most cup holders. Will probably also fit on your bicycle bottle rack.\n",
      "Height of the bottle with lid on is 10.5\" (25.5cm). Without the lid, the bottle stands 9.5\"H (27cm).\n",
      "Capacity is 24 ounces ( 700 mL).\n",
      "Production will be completed at Asia’s top manufacturer of stainless steel insulated bottles. These folks routinely produce high-end bottles for the leading global brands. They’ll use premium, food-grade materials and test each bottle to ensure the vacuum insulation works. All plastics are BPA-free. They’ll do the decoration using water transfers (decals) which proved to be the most durable in our tests.\n",

      "• Toiling in a job that reminds you of Hell\n",
      "• While couchpotatoing\n",

But if you were sipping coffee, tea, margaritas, or kryptonite, a wash out with mild soap is the way to go. Swish inside with a bottle brush to get any nasties. Always rinse thoroughly and dry before use. To protect the demons decoration, don't use the dishwasher or scrub the outside with harsh abrasives. \n",

      "Just the local neighborhood. Because shipping has become so unreliable, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. I wrote a blog about the international trade mess, if you care about these things.\n",
      "Customs. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they’ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can’t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring your insulated bottles during their next trip.\n",
      "Tracking number. You will receive a tracking number when we ship, so monitor your package daily to make sure it doesn’t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don’t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled (often in the last mile of their journey). Monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\n",
      "Where are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we’ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don’t respond to that survey within 6 months, we’ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don’t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\n",

      "The history of guitars is a history of innovation. Electric guitar players throughout the world have always loved to create new and unique sounds regardless of their favorite musical genre.\n",
      "Tim Clarke, the inventor of the Pitch Pilot, has felt that passion for his whole life. He was always intrigued by the unique string-bending sounds made possible by the \"B-Bender\", invented over 50 years ago, and the other string-benders that have come along since.\n",
      "But as much as Tim loved the sound of traditional bending devices, he couldn't help but wonder if maybe there was a better way. What would it take to make a string-bender that could bend the pitch both up and down? What if you could put it on any string? What would it sound like on the G-string, or the low-E? Could you design a string-bender that wouldn't require the permanent alteration of the instrument, and could you do it affordably?\n",
      "With these issues in mind, Tim set out to make his own string-bending device over 6 years ago. His first prototype was cobbled together from scrap metal and the handle of an old nail clipper. As his design evolved, he began to contemplate a model that would work with a Fender or Gibson guitar.\n",
      "Tim started by creating a prototype for the Gibson Les Paul. As he continued to perfect his design, his enthusiasm grew, and when he shared his device with fellow guitarists they were enthralled with its capabilities. He knew he was on to something.\n",
      "Creative uses followed; some wanted two for their guitars, discovering that a \"B\" and \"E\" set-up is awesome! It immediately opened up new stylistic possibilities.\n",
      "Motivated by the enthusiasm of his fellow guitarists, Tim started work on a production model that he could share with everyone. His goal was to make an affordable and easily-installed product requiring no modifications to the guitar. \n",
      "Whether you play country, jazz, rock, R&B, heavy metal or anything else - Pitch Pilot will allow you to add new and unique elements to your sound. It is a revolutionary and versatile device that will be give you endless sound possibilities!\n",
      "Check out this review by Guitar World to see Paul Riario give a prototype of the Pitch Pilot a workout!\n",
      "Riario says, \"Pitch Pilot is an innovative mod that allows you to transform your guitar into a bender on any string\".\n",
      "Note: The handle design as shown in the video has been reworked since this video was filmed, to allow palm muting. See the changes in the gallery videos!\n",
      "The Pitch Pilot allows for new musical expressions, allowing guitarists to expand their sound repertoires. After a simple installation, any string can be manipulated in pitch, bending the note up by as much as three semi-tones or down seven. \n",
      "Similar in use to a whammy bar, this low profile device stays out of the way until, using nothing more than finger or hand pressure, the guitarist bends the note up or down with a simple push or pull on the handle - on a single string. The remaining strings remain in standard tuning, opening up new ways to play.\n",
      "With a quick and simple alteration, guitarists can create endlessly dynamic musical sounds unlike anything previously possible.\n",
      "Starting at a very affordable CA $75.00 or less, the Pitch Pilot includes the device itself and everything you need to install it.\n",
      "- Bends notes to an exceptional degree, both up and down, offering a range of pitch alteration unmatched by any other bending device.\n",
      "- Is easily installed and removed without any permanent modification to the guitar.\n",
      "- Can be installed on more than one string on a single guitar, to allow independent manipulation of pitch on multiple strings.   \n",
      "- The handle rotates out of the way for palm muting.\n",
      "-Does not interfere with the simultaneous use of a vibrato/whammy bar.\n",
      "The Pitch Pilot sound potential is not limited to B-Bending. It can be a G-Bender or an E-Bender or any combination you wish. So put wings on your strings!\n",
      "Today, a Pitch Pilot model compatible with Gibson Les Paul and Gibson-type bridges is already in production and available for sale on our website, so now it is time to produce a Pitch Pilot compatible with the Fender Telecaster and Stratocaster. The prototype is finalized and ready for tooling and production, but we need additional funds to make that happen. \n",
      "We appreciate your support in bringing the Fender model to production! With your help we can deliver both Gibson and Fender units - whichever your preference - by June 2018.\n",
      "Pitch Pilot units are manufactured in Canada, with U.S. components,  by a high-precision machine shop. It is well-engineered, extensively tested, and manufactured to robust standards that will provide thousands of hours of creative play.\n",
      "The Pitch Pilot costs considerably less than competing benders, starting at CA $75.00 for this campaign, with a reduction in price for every additional unit. Gibson and Fender units are priced the same.\n",
      "We are offering 6 and 12-packs for dealers or guitar shops looking to retail Pitch Pilot in their stores.\n",
      "At the campaign's completion, you will receive an order form via email, offering you a choice of Fender or Gibson models.\n",

      "My goal is to produce an educational and insightful podcast which sheds light on the complicated nature of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. Since I contracted Lyme in early 2007, the internet has vastly increased and offers substantially more information about Lyme and its co-infections. The problem is that a great deal of this information is often contradictory and controversial. \n",
      "I want to raise funds to put together a stellar podcast with professional and personal perceptions and opinions on Lyme and its co-infections. This will include visits to research facilities like the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University in New York and Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Research Center in Baltimore. At these research centers, I plan to engage in a number of interviews with professionals in the field of tick-borne and infectious diseases. Also planned is a visit to Igenex labs in Palo Alto, CA. This is a lab which specializes in running lab diagnostics on Lyme and its co-infections.\n",
      "Interviews with some Lyme sufferers will also be conducted to get a personal insight into this disease and its complications. I also plan to interview some of the 'moderators' from the online Lyme forums I used to follow back when I first contracted chronic Lyme. \n",
      "The funds raised will be used for straightforward purposes: filling up the gas tank on my Honda Fit for travel, taking time off of work to travel for conducting interviews, paying an assistant to help me record/edit/produce the podcast, covering basic lodging while on the road interviewing.\n",

The sibling's world is disrupted as they come in contact with a bizarre cult named “The Method”. The play focuses on Ebola’s struggles with identity, religion and gender as she overcomes both her brother’s dominance and her mother's abandonment while discovering her own spiritual powers. The play constructs a portrait of contemporary American gender relations, which despite the strides of the women’s movement, continues to offer women limited options of subjecthood, citizenship and social status.\n",

I would like to first revive the old cartoon \"Power Puff Girls\" in the art form of colored-manga(Anime) and create my own story line and plot.  My new title for it is called \"Power Puff Girls Teen:Omni-Verse\". Hopefully you all can help me reach my goals or even further than that! I will be posting updates on my comic.                                   \n",

      "REWARDS\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the book, rewards also include an exclusive tote bag available only through the campaign (and featuring an adapted version of THIS cartoon), 5x7 cartoon prints and, for the super fancy backers, a random smattering of premium rewards featuring our characters including a pillow (printed with our signature Hibernation cartoon) and cross-stitch! How gay is that? You could even choose a name for our Sabertooth Lion and Sassy Bee characters!\n",

Suddenly, he was reminded of his awkward adolescence and the endless afternoons he spent reading his favorite cartoon books like The Far Side and Bloom County.\n",
      "Dave was inspired to make his own cartoon series about naked, gay Neanderthals and, after a few months of gentle harassment, Bill finally agreed to collaborate with him on The Corporeals. Since then it's been a creative partnership made in social media heaven.\n",

      "However, if we surpass our initial goal, not only will you receive your rewards BEFORE Christmas, you can be assured that any extra funds will go directly to producing more cartoons as well as convention fees, promotional expenses and, if we're really swimming in it, we'll use some of the extra scratch to finally fly Bill out to Comic Con next summer! Believe it or not, Bill and Dave have never met in person! Hey, dreams can come true, right?\n",

      "www.radio4u.us Is a website that focuses on Art,Music,community & health  as well  self help programs. I love knowledge and i love to help people. I love to make people feel good. I would like to become a  interactive website catering to the needs of the community.                                                                                                                            www.radio4u.us also has a internet radio station called Cupids List.It is  smooth R&B and Jazz  playing both current songs as well as old school.It is a live 365 station.And it is starting to grow fast. I had an opportunity recently to get a lot of exposure when I was one of the Valentine playlist winners and to really see  how listeners would react. Well in my first month I got over 6,000 streams from all over the world (stats upon request). So i need exposure.At present I am at a point where I can not move and if I grow too fast it can be very detrimental to the station. I want to become an large station first and eventually an independent station and / or local community radio station in pgh pa.I need funds for growth some working capital so I can handle the  increase in listeners also additional equipment for radio station so i can do live shows.The website and logo I also want to change and improve, also adding a beauty page focusing on the hair,skin-care,nail care. Each week focusing on a new topic  and highlighting different salons who specialize in that particular topic. Licensed  stylists & salons  who participate will pay a small yearly fee,as well as getting hair companies to participate                                                                                                                                                                                                              In order to pull it off  I need to advertise and get advertisers but I have to keep up my stats. Since the station is 128 kbp I can get my station on iTunes,Yahoo,Roku.& AOL. Use Google ad words,advertise with Facebook,press releases,contest and giveaways as well as local advertising. Tee shirts,bracelets are other creative ways to get my name out.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I have  incurred many risks and challenges being a salon owner for 20 yrs, in management 10 yrs prior to opening salon in 1994.When I started my salon in 1994 i could not get any credit because of a previous bad business deal from a former employer when the bank repossessed the building and all her assets in Dec 1992 (including the equipment i was supposed to purchase) . My husband also got laid off 3 months prior.We almost lost everything with both of us being unemployed for 14 months. So with no credit or investors ,I started with pure sweat equity & first and last rent. I know hard work & I learned perseverance as well as patience.I have had to balance between running a business , taking care of my mom who was sick with cancer , and my family; in which i also have an autistic daughter.We also had a fire and lost everything (it all worked out).These are my qualifications and they come from life experiences. So in other words I don't quit.  i will keep persevering until i succeed at getting my music played..the hardest will be getting my music on yahoo & aol.I already have some one to help with advertising etc. I am aware the internet has slow times just like the hair business.That is why i want to build my audience to keep my stats up.                                                                                                           As far as the beauty page I have been in this field since 1977.I currently have at least thirty topics to start.When you work for hair companies and a boss who was a educational director you learn plenty of product knowledge.\n",
      "--------1414895124/the-flavour-compass------\n",
      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Currently I live with my roommate and best friend who's educated in the field of nutrition and health. I prefer asking him all sorts of questions about cooking, training and health. Now it's time for me to move and therefore I can't just ask him anymore. This is why I made this project based on the most important thing he taught me, namely to taste the food, enjoy the food and never hold back to  try something new. By learning to make and appreciate good food, I have found it much easier to eat healthy and in variation. Cooking is once again a thing I can enjoy to its fullest.  \n",
      "Why I need your supportAt first I designed this poster for myself, I wanted it to hang in the kitchen as a tool and to remind me about the importance of taste. I started searching around but failed to find any designs that I liked and no international versions. Therefore I was eager make my own up-to-date interpretation and share it with you. The problem with this is that I don't have the money to cover the cost of a large first batch, which I need to bring down the pricing of the poster. I want this to be easily accessible and affordable to anyone interested to learn more about nutrition and cooking. I also want to share this easy guide-to with everyone and hopefully will help you as much as it has helped me. Become a part of the project by sharing the project or pledge for a poster or a magnet for yourself or as a gift for your health and food obsessed friend. \n",
      "Why you need the flavour compass and how to use it There's nothing quite enjoyable than having a good tasty home-cooked meal. One can only tolerate that bland, dry chicken breast for only so long! Therefore it's important to use some of the five basics flavours if not all. With the flavour compass you'll be able to learn how the tastes go well together. An example of that could be if you have something salty, you can balance it out with something sour. Think about a tequila shot, this usually goes well with kosher salt and lemon (sour) or maybe just the cheeseburger example from the video. \n",
      "With the flavour compass you'll get great and common examples of how to combine different tasting ingredients to accentuate each other's flavour. Hopefully, this will add some inspiration to your own cooking. These are only a few examples to get you started in the right direction, there are many other endless amount combinations for you to experiment.\n",
      "The compass is divided into five different sectors, with each color representing one of the five basic tastes, sweet, sour, salt, bitter and umami. \n",
      "Moving inwards, in the outermost ring, you will find raw, unprocessed ingredient groups that are great representatives of that corresponding taste and form the base of your meal. The next ring contains the processed foods you can find when you go out shopping, these are can be used when flavouring your food. In the innermost ring, you can find inspiration of what you can use to garnish your dish. In the corners, you will see how the tastes match each other, by the smaller color circles. These will describe how the flavour pairs interact with one and another. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rewardsThere are different kinds of rewards, and then some choice of colour, you can see them illustrated below. The examples are not the finished prints, they are mock-up of prototypes. I will fiddle with colours and font sizes to make it look perfect for when you get it. More about that in \"risks and challenges\".  \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The main challenge will be to get a print that will meet the quality criteria. When designing something on the computer you won't necessarily have the color represented in the same way when you print it, even if you use a high quality printing technique. \n",
      "In order to solve this, I will go through the desired iterations until the quality of the print is to my and hopefully your satisfaction. \n",
      "There could be some issues with delivering the print to you in time, based on the number of iterations the design process has to go through.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to resolve this, I will make sure to speed up the logistical process of delivery in order to make up for any lost time due to the design process. I keep you updated as we move forward.\n",

      "Recently, the average NFL career decreased yet again... to 3.3 years.\n",
      "So how is it that a clearly below average player like Reno Mahe was able to play four seasons?\n",
      "The reason this is significant is because after 4 seasons, NFL players are vested in the league's pension plan and will continue to draw significant income.\n",
      "One group, however, who seems to continually draw an NFL tenure disproportionate to their skill sets are the members of the Mormon Church.\n",
      "A church that requests its members donate 10% of their income back into the church.\n",

      "WHY DO I THINK THERE IS A NEED?\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to put the MOTIVATION PLANNER together for a couple of reasons. The first was my frustration when one day I could not find one of my books with inspirational quotes and my gratitude journal. The second reason was the requests I received from my clients in my health and wellness practice. \n",
      "I found myself having to go to separate sources and places to find things and to remember where I had written them.\n",
      " At times I would misplace one of my books or journals and I could not find where it was at a time when I needed it most. Sometimes I would forget to complete my gratitude thoughts for the day because I had misplaced my gratitude journal.\n",
      "It is also costly having to purchase each year so many journals/notebooks, a planner etc. to document all my information and thoughts. Referring to separate books and sources was also time consuming. Time I could spend doing something else such as relaxing. \n",
      "Often in my health and wellness practice my clients would ask me what my daily life and organizing practices were and I found myself referring them to multiple sources to obtain information and to record the information. Some clients would get anxious and overwhelmed when they could not locate some of this Information or could not easily find it. \n",
      "I wanted a one stop shop where all of this information was consolidated in one place and I could not find any product that encompassed all of this and could do all of this. \n",
      "With this planner I can now refer them to one place with all the useful information included in there for them. It is now in one convenient place making it easier to complete and create a daily practice. \n",
      "Everyone can now invest in one streamlined planner that provides all the life tools that they need making life easier. \n",
      "I want to inspire people to make decisions from a place of love and gratitude. It will help people keep focussed on their dreams and to not lose sight of them. \n",
      "Also in my life I have had no family or other human support network. I searched for ways and tried many self-help tools to support me in achieving my goals. Many of the tools that worked for me to help me feel supported and to keep going in life are encompassed in the MOTIVATION PLANNER. \n",

      "PAU is a pocket-sized drum set that we can bring around with us to create music anytime and anywhere. It lets us bring our own music with us by letting us tap out whatever we want on it, whenever we want.\n",
      "As musicians ourselves, we understand that the urge and the inspiration to create music happens spontaneously.  PAU brings the ability to create music to anyone, so that anyone can play and create music anytime, anywhere.\n",
      "PAU is inspired by the Ocarina, an ancient instrument used in many different cultures, PAU is a handheld instrument with finger positions similar to the holes on an Ocarina that allow for quick finger movement to create complex rhythms such that speed of tapping is not compromised.\n",
      "PAU has 7 tactile buttons that are mapped to the position of drums on a drum set. Simply connect the audio cable, press the button, hear the drum beat and continue tapping away!\n",
      "The ergonomic curves of PAU are specially designed to fit into the palm of the hand and the symmetrically placed buttons allow for both left and right-handed usage of PAU easily. Of course, you can choose to play PAU however you wish!\n",
      "Every drummer has a different style of playing. We'd expect this to be no different on the PAU!\n",
      " We gave PAU to a band to try out. Here's their reaction.\n",

      "PAU is an intuitive, tactile, easy-to-use device that allows anyone to create music easily, in any situation.\n",

      "PAU is compact enough to fit into our pockets, or into our palms, so that we can tap away whenever we want and stick it into our pockets whenever we need our hands for other things.\n",

      "Why look at the buttons when you can feel it? Just like a real instrument, the keys on PAU are made of tactile buttons that allow you to feel where they are so you can continue tapping away, eyes-free.\n",
      "When our friend / colleague / family member cracks a bad joke.\n",
      "For the past few months, we have been prototyping and developing PAU to create the most user friendly version of it, and combing the electronics market to source out reliable suppliers. \n",
      "We believe in creating a high quality product that is user-friendly, intuitive and functional, yet at the same time, aesthetically pleasing.\n",
      "We experimented with different shapes, sizes, button mechanism and finishing before coming to the final prototype. \n",

      "Most instruments currently available are large and bulky, and create much sound (music/noise) when played. This makes it hard for musicians to carry around their instruments and to play whenever they feel like it so as to not disturb other people. As we also lead busy lives constantly on the go, the opportunities to make music decrease as we are unable to carry our instruments around, so we end up just listening to music instead.\n",
      "At Bethm, we believe that there is another way to bring music to people. Right now, we have created a pocket-sized instrument that can be played silently on the go.\n",

      "Check the video above demonstrating how to remap a Light Effect key on the top right corner of the K8 Pro keyboard to Eject key with VIA software, so you can get a shortcut to put your Mac to sleep (Command-Option-Eject), or even remap the fn key in a breeze.

      "Philip, MERKUR's founder and lead designer, has been a military fan from childhood. He’s been so obsessed with a gang of little buddies in junior school sharing and discussing military gear and aircrafts. As times passed by, the little boys grew up, leaving their hometown for different colleges and universities, and moved onto very different paths. They’re not that close anymore and only contacted once a while at summer breaks. After university graduation, Philip carried on the passion in aircrafts and aviation and started his career with a famous European airline. It was until quite recently that Philip realized his best buddy has also carried on that same passion and becomes a pilot; their paths crossed again, chatting about old days and picking up the old hobby on military aircrafts.\n",
      "Now that Philip is quitting his 9-to-5 job and starting his venture as  watch manufacturer, their conversations now have a new addition: pilot watches. In memory of this great childhood friendship, they decide to co-design a watch series paying tribute to the fascination upon pilots and aircrafts and their watches.\n",
      "It was not a hard decision for them to come up with the design language and theme; neither did they have any technical difficulties (Philip happened to be very familiar with mechanical chronograph movement, and the ST19 movement can offer the best size and manual winding texture when applying the chronograph function). But instead...\n",
      "One key consideration on top of both Philip and his friend’s mind, is that they want something of their own; the design has to incorporate some unique features onto the classic themes, not just making another replica of the well known models. After many late nights of brainstorming and sampling, today Merkur brand is thrilled to be introducing the \"Big Eye\" Military Chronograph series, coming in two very funky colorways.\n",
      "From Design to Prototype：\n",
      "There's many more later watches built to pay tribute to the famous pilot watches but they either directly copy the \"Mark XI\" or the \"Big Eye\" features, while we spent much time and effort in figuring out the perfect match and give-or-takes.\n",
      "The first look at the MERKUR \"Big Eye\" Chronograph series, it highlights the standard formula of military watches.\n",
      "When it comes to case design, obsession in vintage was admittedly the driving force behind the decision. Our watch would be a lovely addition to your personal charm, not a burden.\n",
      "Aligned with many chronographs of the 1940s and not like modern bulky chronographs, the sleek 38mm size and 18mm lug size design are absolutely comfortable to wear on a daily basis; the thickness of 13.6mm would truly make a difference on your wrist.\n",
      "And we offer 40mm case too for you to have a better choice about this sport chronograph style.\n",
      "In history, the military preferred acrylic because it would flex under pressure and not shatter in the cockpit of an aircraft. To maintain originality and our watch's 'warmth', its vintage feel and the slight, bespoke domed acrylic crystal was chosen by us. The pleasing distortions it makes when the watch is viewed at certain angles is just awesome.\n",
      "Rest assured, Acrylic will scratch but it is easily polished with a compound such as Polywatch or even toothpaste.\n",
      "Also,We Provide A watch case with 120clicks rotating bezel and Sapphire GLass.\n",
      "We are super pumped upon our final draft and to add more fun into our offering, we will offer two different combinations and colorways. Both will be available for you to choose from and back for!\n",
      "Only For KICKSTARTER Black/Green Combination \n",
      "We are developing a Gradient Green dial Especially for KS. this is our Brand new Desgin ..with Stronger cream luminous .  \n",
      "Classy series with retro Black/ Cream combination\n",
      "A serious military colorway, the simple and neat Black/ Cream combination is low profile at first glance, but results in much more open space on the dial and feeling less cluttered. You should be comfortable to wear it and proudly talk about it across gatherings with die-hard military or pilot watch fans.\n",
      "Urban series with Light Grey/ Red hand combination\n",
      "A more casual and daily colorway thanks to the light grey dial; contrasted with the very sharp white subdial and red chronograph hand. We built this for everyday use, it's so chilled and young that you might even want to wear it to a date with your beloved ones.\n",
      "Beyond the history story, we're essentially renovating a vintage inspired watch for modern use, and shall serve as grab-and-go piece for whatever look you're on today. Every detail, texture, fonts and finishing of our products has been meticulously thought through to make sure it sends tribute to some greater watch designs yet has a unique MERKUR aesthetic language.\n",
      "We've been working recklessly between our design team and the production team upon every design and product details.\n",
      "Transparent Case Back for Sapphire Case\n",
      "The Mechanical hand-winding ST-1901 Movement has an incredibly rich history; even though it's more commonly known as a Chinese representative in the chronograph movement, it is indeed a blue blood swiss innovation with proper transfer of licensing and intellectual property.\n",
      "In the 1960s and to compete against other major movement manufacturer (the Longines, Valjoux, Minerva, Lemania and Landeron's), Venus decided to partner with the young China government; shared their design and drawing of Venus 175 to help build the first chronograph for Chinese Air Force; and expect the supply chain in China can scale quickly and bring prosperity to the very mature yet easy to maintain design.\n",
      "We all know the latter story, China has become world factory and can produce ST19 movement with great quality after careful adjustment, and exceptionally affordable,making it an ideal choice for this project.\n",
      "As we scale quickly we have never given up on standard and quality control. On the contrary, we decided to form a special quality unit- the MERKUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT (MTS) to review all product quality along the production and before dispatching to our end customer.\n",
      "Specifically on mechanical chronographs, we commit the right position of all chronograph hands. Please check your MERKUR products at arrival and both hands would be in exactly the right spot after first time re-positioning- that's our commitment to worldwide fans of MERKUR.\n",
      "We offer standard two sets of strap: French leather. They're of impeccable design quality but carefully considered to match the watch design. Our strap manufacturer already work for renowned watch brands and their skills greatly enhance our watches.\n",
      "Straps for Acrylic Case：18MM\n",
      "Straps for Sapphire Case：20MM\n",
      "We like to think that the MERKUR quality comes across in our packaging as well. They will be made out of high quality wooden cases to reduce use of plastic material; with a delicate bronze plate that would age and add in more robust and mechanic texture .\n",
      "Kickstarter campaigns make ideas into reality. It’s where brands and designers can meet up and share their visions for unique lifestyles and value proposition with the watchfam communities that will come together to fund them. If you like our project, you can choose to pledge money to help make it happen.\n",

After his graduation and six years working on a 9-to-5 job, he still found great passion in watchmaking and \"Design in China\"; he decided to quit his well-paid job at famous int'l airline and found Merkur.\n",

      "Hi everyone, we're Avni Patel & Philip James McGoldrick. We're bringing to you Mariage Blanc, a play by Polish playwright, Tadeausz Rozewicz, - but it's our REIMAGINED version.\n",
      "Coming to the UK stage for the first time, this play is Directed by Philip and Produced by Avni. With essential help from our core team: Perfumers Sarah McCartney and Harry Sherwood, set designer Solrun Osk, costume designer Bronya Arciszewska and extremely talented performing cast - we are all about collaboration. \n",
      "The important bit\n",
      "We need your help to raise, £2750 to kick start this unique project into action. \n",
      "Why is it unique? Below we explain, the incredible story, why we're doing it at all, why your support is so important, and our ambitious vision. \n",
      "---\n",
      "In a 19th Century household, Bianca has been raised as a boy and is now suddenly to be married off upon her coming of age. Facing the torment of burgeoning womanhood and the sexual expectations of marriage, Bianca becomes increasingly consumed by surreal phallic visions while clinging onto the remnants of childhood. \n",
      "It's safe to say, we're inspired by the bravery and willingness to challenge taboo.\n",
      "It explores themes of gender identity, sexuality and the challenges of womanhood against a backdrop of male dominance and patriarchal tradition. We believe these are not only poignant contemporary issues, but this play can contribute to these current conversations by further exploring the complex effect these pressures can have on women at any stage of life. \n",
      "We strongly believe this play stands in its own right as an important piece of literature, a timeless piece which can tell the story of overcoming adversity through tenderness and humour. Importantly, it also shows a positive representation of women in literature. \n",
      "We have an amazing idea, to bring this play to life in truly unique and interesting way - and we want you to be part of it. Your donations will form the basis of our collaboration. \n",
      "There are 3 main reasons:\n",
      "We want to create a visceral Theatre experience involving smells, to bring this humorous yet dark play to life in an intriguing and innovative way.\n",
      "1. CAST\n",
      "As you know we really want to pay our cast fairly. These two women are a part of a larger cast. They are all incredibly talented and we hope to give them the opportunity to flourish in these complex and intriguing roles with your help. \n",
      "---\n",
      "Our main character Bianca will be played by one of Hero Talent Group's biggest stars Mollie Lambert.  \n",
      "When asked about the importance of the play, Mollie replied:\n",
      "\"At a time when people are listening to each other a lot more...more people feel like they can have a voice [to express their sexuality and gender].\"\n",
      " \n",
      "Helen Baranova will play the supporting role of Pauline. She has performed in numerous plays including a 5 star production of 'Voices From Chernobyl'. \n",
      "When asked what themes speak to her personally? Helen answered: \n",
      "\"Women are sexual beings and I... agree with it ... It’s good to see [that explored] especially from a male writer, that’s unusual.\"\n",
      "2. PRODUCTION DESIGN\n",
      "The production designer Solrun Osk Jonsdottir, a National Film & Television school (NFTS) graduate is working hard at creating the perfect mood for this piece. Working with new textures, light and fabric in a challenging space, you can see Sol's ideas are ambitious - help us breath life into them!\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "3. COSTUME DESIGN\n",
      "Our costumes will be designed by talented designer Bronya Arcziszewska, who's Polish heritage connects her to the play. Perfectly capturing timelessness, with your help, we can source and make these wonderful designs.\n",
      "Bronya's vision is to start by designing the base layers of underwear. \n",
      "And for the buttoned openings of the nightdress to show glimpses of the base layer.\n",
      "4. SMELLS DESIGN\n",
      "Mariage Blanc will be staged for the first time ever as a sensory experience. \n",
      "Key information about our smell design:\n",
      "Benefiting from the knowledge and experience of the crazily talented perfumers Harry Sherwood and Sarah McCartney, from 4160Tuesdays perfume, scents like Semen, halitosis, violets and custard, are already in the making!\n",
      "5. ABOUT THE DIRECTOR\n",
      "Born in 1987 in Warsaw, Philip James McGoldrick is a British citizen and National Film & Television school (NFTS) graduate. In 2009 he finished his Master's degree in Audiovisual Arts at the RITCS film academy in Brussels. His award winning debut film 'Siemiany' is a coming of age drama about Polish teenagers in a phase of sexual exploration. \n",
      "As well as his impressive career in film, Philip has had an extensive experience directing in television and advertising. 'Mariage Blanc' will be Philip's directorial debut in the world of Theatre. \n",
      "Here's what Phil has to say:\n",

      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "CHALLENGES.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue #1: PLANNING\n",
      "When you talk to us about the play, you will hear excitement, joy, wonder, and... that it's tiring. We are working on this because it's a labour of love. We love it and many of us work on the play in our spare time and in between hours to fundraise, promote, write, create, plan and produce.\n",
      " \n",
      "The solution: \n",
      "We endeavour to work to a clear production schedule which maps out not only what needs to be done, but also how to mitigate risks, move times lines and help juggle the opposing time schedules of Philip and Avni! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue #2: A LARGE CAST\n",
      "We envisage challenges on the way; preparing the actors, managing schedules, rehearsal spaces, cast expectations, as well as using the opportunity to support them to develop professionally. Importantly, we want to pay them fairly.\n",
      " \n",
      "The solution: \n",
      "We love our actors and they bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to their roles. They are well versed in Eastern European literature, or have personal connections to the themes. From this foundation of respect, we will endeavour to work with them to manage expectations, provide concrete and manageable schedules to work with, respond to feedback and offer them support. This kickstarter is a perfect opportunity to start this journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue #3: We’re doing this for the FIRST TIME!\n",
      "Philip and Avni are working towards their debuts in directing and producing, respectively, as well as bringing the play to the UK stage for the first time!\n",
      " \n",
      "The solution: \n",
      "Both Philip and Avni have trusted mentors who are experts in the field. They are working closely with them to identify potential issues, work through problems and offer guidance along the way. They have also spent over a year researching the play, it’s ideas and the writer – speaking with academics, technicians, producers, psychologists and engaging the polish community. It is through these meticulously built and strong foundations that the play has a platform from which to succeed. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "THE RISKS\n",
      " \n",
      "The issue #1: SMELL DESIGN\n",
      "Using scents as part of the performance is ambitious, and we want to get it right. It runs the risk of being tokenistic.\n",
      " \n",
      "The solution: \n",
      "We work closely with Harry and Sarah from 4160 Tuesdays perfume who are experts and have a lot of experience in this area. With Avni’s work at festivals and in performances using scent, there is a practical and creative vision which emerges. It will be tested in rehearsals to ensure it works and enhances the play. We will ensure Harry and Sarah are present to advise and inform throughout.\n",
      " \n",
      "We would also like to test the innovation of using scent to get into character for the actors - a unique way of preparing actors for the performance.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "The issue #2 : NOT REACHING THE GOAL\n",
      "This goal is one generous step in a long journey.\n",
      " \n",
      "The solution: \n",
      "We believe in equality, fairness and collaboration. If we reach the goal we can start the journey as we mean to go on, and do this performance justice, not only for it being a seminal piece of literature, but as a positive marker for women and help open conversations about equality in all of it’s forms. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Any donations that meet (or even exceed) our goal, will be incredibly appreciated.\n",

When he so generously donated, he wrote: “refer to me as a longtime admirer of your artistic vision who made this matching gift to encourage others to lend their support.” We are of course humbled and honored by Todd’s support and generosity. \n",

      "The funds raised by you, and Todd’s gift, will be used for the development of PACKRAT, our new puppet play and its developmental workshop presentation. Every dollar that you give will be matched by Todd!\n",
      "And, there are a lot of puppets to make!  The puppets will be diverse in style: modified Bunraku, rod, hand and large parade-style, fully articulated puppets.  We will also make use of projections and video and anticipate working with 5 puppeteers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our fundraising goal for this phase of development is $3000, to be matched by Todd to give us $6000! The funds will be used to make Phase I of the project happen, from developing, building, and performing the puppets to paying puppeteers, composer and technical staff. \n",
      "Summer 2016, Concrete Temple Theatre was in-residence with Montello Foundation, in the Sagebrush Desert of Montello, NV. The Foundation is “dedicated to supporting artists who foster our understanding of nature, its fragility and our need to protect it.”  This experience has inspired us to create a work that is focused on: what is preserved, saved, collected, and what is ignored, discarded, forgotten; a piece that is an investigation of what happens when a being thinks themselves separate from their environment and how the adaptability of nature can be used as an example of what needs to be done when faced with adversity. We have chosen a packrat as our main character, as packrats are natural collectors.\n",

      "OK, now you know everything. Sort of.\n",

      "Ordinary guys need epics too: Rather than the more typical Roman epic about gladiators and orgies and imperial assassinations (not that there's anything wrong with that), it’s about the lives of ordinary people in the city of Herculaneum, Pompeii's less famous neighbour--though there are the occasional murders, mysteries, banquets, and battles. Many of the characters are based on people who really lived in the town. Our hero Marcus Antonius Felix, the self-described descendent of a slave of the much more famous Marcus Antonius, arrives jobless, homeless, and missing his clothing, but carrying a lot of secrets. The first job he gets (after putting on some clothes) is as bodyguard for a wealthy teenage girl in danger, Petronia Iusta.\n",

      "PDF edition, bookmarks, art prints, posters, saucy portraits, original sketches, random sketches based on words in my big box o' Latin flashcards, custom-made Roman-style wood-&-wax note tablets (very nifty!

Other module based amplifiers on the market use tremendous amounts of negative feedback to correct for output error.  The result is ringing and high-frequency hash much like the mega-feedback Class-AB amps of the 1980s. CRISPIN offers amazing bench measurements without massive feedback or phase compensation networks. The Maraschino difference is simply better sonics. The harshness associated with other Class-D amps has been eliminated.\n",

      "Furry. Loveable. Beer-and-stale-air-scented. Meet Bar Dog, canine denizen of Buz's, a neighborhood bar.\n",
      "Thanks to readers like you, this Kickstarter raised the funds to create the Bar Dog website, where you can read episodes of Bar Dog, submit story suggestions and vote on what happens next. \n",
      "Bar Dog was inspired by a few different things—my own goofy dog Asta, the years I spent working as a bartender and an old, rather jaded looking dog I saw lounging in an armchair in a neighborhood bar. I thought there was something really funny about the canine perspective of the human experience, and I loved the idea of a story that goes back and forth between the above-the-table human world and the under-the-table canine world.\n",
      "As I was finishing the first episode and deciding what would happen next, I thought—what if I put Bar Dog online and let readers decide? So the idea of a \"crowd-plotted canine comic\" was born. Here's how it works:\n",
      "This will be a really fun (and funny) way for readers to be involved in creating an ongoing story. So I'm raising funds to pay a designer and web developer to create a Bar Dog website, where people can read Bar Dog, submit story ideas, vote on what happens next and discover mouthwatering cocktail and dog biscuit recipes. (More about the website below the rewards.) \n",
      "There will also be a lot of great rewards, ranging from Kickstarter-exclusive comic books to t-shirts, posters and original art. \n",
      "Here are some pictures of the rewards.\n",
      "How will the Kickstarter funds be used?\n",
      "Most of the funds are going towards hiring a developer and designer to create the Bar Dog website. I'm hiring a professional team to create the site, not \"my cousin who makes cool websites.\" This is because the website needs to not only be well designed, but have great functionality.\n",
      "On my end, I need to be able to easily log on and upload new episodes, read through audience story suggestions and put my favorite suggestions up for the crowd's final vote. I am very right-brained, so it's important that I have a simple, hassle-free user experience on my end that doesn't involve me entering a bunch of code or doing anything too technical.\n",
      "The Bar Dog audience also needs to have a seamless and easy user experience. They need to be able to easily read a Bar Dog episode, which will be followed by an entry form where they can enter a suggestion about what happens next and submit it. When it's time to vote they need to be able to easily enter their information or log on to vote.\n",
      "In order to create a website that functions this well is a job that requires professionals who are on their game. I approached two different companies and received estimates of around $5000. I am upping that to $6500 to cover contingencies such as the site taking longer or being more difficult than expected and for updates or changes that need to be made in the first few months after the Bar Dog site goes live.\n",
      "The remainder of the $10,000 I am asking for will be going toward the printing and shipping of the Kickstarter rewards as well as Kickstarter fees and processing fees.\n",
      "And now, for your reading pleasure, here are the first 12 pages of Bar Dog. Each page is a photo of the original 11 x 17\" art with some tools I used to create the art. I hope you enjoy it. \n",
      "Bar Dog Episode 1: \n",
      "Thank you so much for your support! Answers to some frequently asked questions are below.\n",
      "Questions:\n",
      "1. Is Bar Dog a choosable adventure story? No, Bar Dog is determined by majority vote. Readers will vote on three storyline suggestions, and the one that receives the most votes will determine the next part of the story.\n",
      "2. Why is Bar Dog green? I was doing lots of messy green and black drawings when I originally drew Bar Dog, so I decided to keep that look, since it creates an interesting nighttime feel and lends a grungy dive-bar texture to the story. Here's an old notebook page of one of my first Bar Dog sketches (warning: graphic puking visual): \n",
      "3. Do you talk to your dog? If so, what are some of the topics you discuss? Yes, I do talk to my dog. It's usually about going for a walk or having dinner or a treat. Sometimes I talk to my dog about other topics, such as the presidential debates or red carpet fashions, but those topics are generally greeted with a blank stare.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I've already received an estimate and timeline from the Bar Dog website creators, and they'll start working on the site once the Kickstarter is successfully funded. It will probably take a few months to complete, as they have multiple projects going on, and we'll more than likely go through a few rounds of revisions. Ideally, I'd like to see the site up by the end of January and of course, I will keep all Bar Dog supporters informed of the project's progress along the way.\n",

      "Regarding the rewards, I've created and professionally printed a few independent comic books, and I illustrated and designed an award-winning children's book. I've already received quotes from two printers for the Bar Dog project—the first will be creating the comic books, stickers and posters and the second will be printing the t-shirts. Also, in my years of working on the creative side of advertising, I've shepherded hundreds of projects from original concept to final development. In producing the Bar Dog rewards, I'll not only be creating many of them myself, but I'll also be supervising the production of all Bar Dog products, from t-shirts to coasters, to ensure that anything bearing the Bar Dog name is of the highest possible quality and, most importantly, delivered on time.\n",

      "It emulates classic and modern tube amps with true analog sound circuitry in order to avoid the monotony of digital amp modeling. Use it anywhere with all the convenience possible – standalone or controlled with your smartphone.\n",
      "The poets One has four channels, each representing a different gain stage with its own unique voice. It offers you a very bold soundscape with a variety of distinctive amp tones, seamlessly transitioning from blues to classic rock or hard rock to metal. Bubbly sparkling crunch sounds are possible as well as a dark and punchy high-gain pandemonium. Plug into the poets One, and playing the first notes you'll notice the amazingly tight bottom-end and the crisp treble. Harmonically rich and detailed chords go along with resonating single notes, even when cranking up the gain further. Let's give you an idea of what the channels sounds like:\n",
      "Texas Twang: A shimmering bright and very dynamic sound with sparkling distortion on top, inspired by the tweed amps of the early sixties. Great for Jazz, Country and Blues.\n",
      "British Classic: This channel nails the sound of amps like Marshall’s Plexi and Super Lead. It offers a crunchy, growling distortion which is adjustable in a wide range with your guitar’s volume. A perfect match for any kind of rock, blues and punk.\n",
      "British Modern: A “High Gainer” with creamy compression that invites you to explore all the varieties of metal sounds – from eighties Heavy Metal to brutally dark.\n",
      "U.S. High Gain: In the tradition of Californian high gain amps, this channel offers you an ultra fast attack, a vivid reaction and virtually unlimited gain reserves. Suitable for any kind of clear and powerful lead sounds, it is adjustable for a wide range of musical styles.\n",
      "Controlling the preamp can be easily done with just two buttons: A true bypass switch for enabling or disabling the unit and up to six presets that can be selected by pushing a momentary switch. The pedal’s state and the active preset are visualized by six LEDs.\n",
      "You can use your smartphone to modify existing sound presets or create new ones. The poets One app provides the following functions: channel selection, preset selection, storing and retrieving the presets. Additionally, the sound of a preset can be adjusted by controls for Boost (Texas Twang only), Gain, Volume, Treble, Bass and Mid (amp voicing).\n",
      "For power supply, use a 9V battery or a supply unit with 9V – 12V and (-) polarity on the inside (“BOSS standard”). The power consumption will be about 55mA max. Two LEDs allow monitoring of the supply voltage – green: voltage is okay, red: change battery by time.\n",
      "Bluetooth is supplied by a certified Microchip Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module. For switching the wireless connection on or off, you need to press and hold the select button for more than 3 seconds. The BLE status is visualized by a blue LED.\n",
      "In October 2015 we started looking for a small, affordable guitar preamp with several channels and a dynamic sound that comes as close as possible to high quality tube amps. And it should have smartphone based real-time operability and all the convenience that comes with it.\n",
      "But we found nothing to fit the bill. It seemed that there was merely the choice between an analogue stomp box with only one good sound configurable via potentiometers or a digital modelling device with intuitive setup but poor sound.\n",
      "So what constitutes a “convenient device with a perfect guitar sound”? How can all the advantages of analogue and digital worlds can be combined? That was the point at which we decided to create the “poets One”. Here are the main features we put on our wish list:\n",
      "We started with the development of the analogue audio section of the circuit. Because our device should be battery powered we decided to use semiconductors instead of valves to emulate tube sound as close as possible. Another point is that the settings-adjustment circuitry should be digital to allow smartphone based control. In addition, digital control components can’t withstand the high voltage common to tube circuits.\n",
      "It was a stony road. We tested hundreds of diodes, op amps, capacitors and other components which would be responsible for a perfect sound and added several weeks of LTspice simulation.\n",
      "The goal was to emulate tube distortion without compromising dynamic response and to avoid the noisy and jarring sound typical when using semiconductors for signal clipping.\n",
      "Another major challenge was the tone stack design. In particular the mid filter should be able to manipulate the preamp’s voicing range from “classic tweed” to “modern metal”. We achieved this by designing a filter where the amplitude, centre frequency and Q-ratio can be adjusted with just one control.\n",
      "Upon completion of the sound stages the first prototype had been created – albeit a breadboard design with mechanical switches and potentiometers.\n",
      "The next challenge would be to develop a digital control that doesn’t affect the audio quality. Checking out a lot of digital switches and potentiometers, it turned out that only a few components on the market would be suitable for our purposes. We envisaged that the link between control circuit and smartphone would be an Arduino equipped with a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module. But we soon realised that the open source Arduino software is not efficient enough for our needs. Additionally the Bluetooth module had a big issue with latency.\n",
      "So we developed a completely new control unit, coded our own operational system for the underlying Atmel microcontroller and chose a professional Bluetooth module with the possibility to implement a private BLE stack.\n",
      "While we where at it, we also decided to create a complete new housing. Almost every FX pedal uses Hammond aluminium cases. But using Bluetooth inside a metal case isn’t ideal and it also seemed a good idea to have a modern design with a direct view into the inner PCB and several LEDs. Eventually we designed a 3D-printed housing with a massive transparent cover out of hardened plexiglass XT.\n",
      "Having a functional breadboard design is one thing – creating a professional mixed signal SMD unit on a multilayer PCB another. Parallel to the programming of an attractive iOS app with intuitive handling we had to suffer disappointment on our first PCB. Due to the high gain of the audio circuit and the pulses on the digital part of the power supply caused by the BLE module we had several EMC issues. Furthermore, numerous SMD film capacitors downgraded the audio quality and therefore we had to take a step back and replace them with through hole parts. At that time we began to work with professional German manufacturing companies in order to ensure the best manufacturing quality possible for PCB and SMD soldering.\n",
      "During the entire development process our guiding principle was to make no compromises in respect of sound. After nearly one year of work, two PCB redesigns, a new ground concept, a special power supply circuit and different revisions of the case we finally had a fully functional “golden master”.\n",
      "And after half a year of testing the poets One on stage, in the studio and practice rooms with professional guitarists we are proud to present it to you on Kickstarter:\n",
      "The poets One.\n",

      "Everyone has a fairy tale dream, every bedtime story brings memorable childhood, warm, sweet and full of love.\n",
      "Thus, three art-major dads established Howcat Studio, studied children's favorite fairy tales and their loved board games, combined with the most popular education model, created three unique fairy tale houses. Make those fairy tales come true.\n",
      "Each fairy tale house has about one hundred wooden pieces.\n",
      "Each colored piece can be perfectly assembled together.\n",
      "Numerous details, detachable items bring the entire model to life.\n",
      "Come with light, let the finished fairy tale house has a fantasy color.\n",
      "For children: With the help of their parents, they will love the feeling of pressing the parts down one by one with their tiny hands.\n",
      "For teenagers: It is a fun STEAM Toy to train their patience. The process of finding parts, pressing them out, and assembling them together improves the ability of observation and logical thinking.\n",
      "For grown ups: Believe me, the 3-hour immersive building experience will leave you wanting for more.\n",
      "Is it over when the fairy tale house is built? of course not. You also own a board game. \n",
      "Rolling dice, flipping cards, answering questions, and being the first one to reach the destination. Let everyone enjoy this family and friend time.\n",
      "The rules are simple, 2-4 players, move their character on the board by rolling dice, and whoever reaches the finish first wins. There are two kinds of special colored grids on the board. If the player walks there, they must draw cards from the corresponding color. \n",
      " According to the instructions on each card, complete the task and receive corresponding rewards or punishments according to the result.\n",
      "If we can reach our goal, we will solicit card content from our backers, so that every backer who wants to participate has the opportunity to join us in the creation of the fairy tale house.\n",
      "It's not just a craft, but a piece of art work. \n",
      "The actual fairy tale house is more eye-catching than the photo.\n",
      "With led lights, which let it become the most dreamy night lights at night. In the evening room, with the moonlight outside the window, the shadow hits the wall, just like a gorgeous fairy tale world.\n",

      "Reward packs which include the Book Three eBook set will now also include the first chapter of Book FOUR (Chapter 16).\n",
      "If we can reach the following milestones, I will watch and draw comics of the Multiplex 10's resident film snob Jason reviewing selected works of his arch-nemesis, Michael Bay. (One strip per movie!)\n",
      "————————————————————————————————\n",
      "Multiplex is an online comic about the staff of a movie theater. It has been running for ten years — since July 10, 2005. I've previously run, funded and fulfilled two Kickstarter projects, for the print collections Multiplex: Enjoy Your Show and Multiplex: There and Back Again. And now, the Multiplex gang is back, hoping to raise funds to produce a third collection… Multiplex: The Revenge!\n",
      "Multiplex: The Revenge will contain Chapters 11–15 of the series (strips #217–338, which ran from March 2008 to March 2009). In this volume, Jason and Angie get serious, the Multiplex 10 and Flickhead crews battle it out on the silver screen (sort of), and Gretchen has her long overdue comeuppance.\n",
      "All of the Multiplex books strive to be new-reader friendly, so if you haven't read either of the first two books (or haven't read them in a long time), there will be a six-page \"The Story So Far\" comic to get you up to speed. And even if you've read all the comics online, there will be about 35 pages of all-new material to flesh out all the dramedy. That's over four months worth of comics!\n",
      "All the new material means there's finally room to answer one of the questions I get asked most at conventions — \"Whatever happened to Brian?\" Brian (and his accomplice) will turn up in a few bonus strips spread throughout the book expanding on their existing appearances, and culminating in an all-new arc at the end of the book set on opening night of Zack Snyder's Watchmen!\n",
      "Rather than working on the new material for the book sporadically in my \"free time\" (ha!) between freelance design or illustration work, with your help, I can get the book in your hands next year. I know I would rather be working on Multiplex, and I know Multiplex fans would prefer that, too! I hope I can count on your support to help me continue the Multiplex book series.\n",
      "I'm Gordon McAlpin, the writer and illustrator of Multiplex. I've previously run — and fulfilled — two Kickstarter projects, for the first two print collections.\n",
      "Multiplex: Enjoy Your Show (Book One) was enthusiastically reviewed by the Chicago Tribune, Fandomania, Weekly Comic Book Review, Comics Waiting Room and a host of other comics sites and publications. Multiplex: There and Back Again (Book Two) won the Gold medal for Graphic Novel/Drawn Book–Humor/Cartoon in the 2014 Independent Publisher Book Awards.\n",
      "PDF eBooks! Multiplex is illustrated with vector shapes using Adobe Illustrator. The PDF eBooks preserve the art as vectors, making them the best possible reproduction and a really fun way to read the strip, especially on a tablet.\n",
      "The eBooks will be made available to backers as they are completed. Chapters 1–11 are already finished and will be made available to backers with them in their reward packs as soon as the project is successfully funded!\n",
      "Mini-posters! The set of three 11\"x17\" mini-posters included in several of the rewards packs will feature the movie poster parody artwork from the T-shirts for the last two Kickstarter projects — plus one brand new design parodying a movie poster suggested by you, the Kickstarter backers. Brokeback Multiplex? The Multiplex Strikes Back? It's up to you! (Posters will be folded in half for shipment.)\n",
      "UPDATE: I totally forgot about another older parody poster I did, so let's make that FOUR instead:\n",
      "Bookmarks! Bookmarks included with the Basic Sponsor Pack (and up) will look similar to this. The \"frames\" will pull from throughout the Multiplex series, however, not just Book One:\n",
      "Sketches! Original character sketches included with Premium Sponsor Pack will look something like this, though not all sketches will be toned with Copics; I like to figure something out that feels appropriate to each sketch:\n",
      "Be an extra in Book Three! With the Extra pack (as well as the Strip Pack and the Dinner and a Movie Pack), you will appear in one of the bonus comics for Book Three. You may or may not have a line of dialogue (they haven't been written yet; it's kind of the luck of the draw), but you will get a digital image of you as you appear in the strip suitable for use as a social media avatar.\n",
      "Movie Review Comics! With the Movie Snob Pack (and up), you can select a movie — any (non-pornographic) movie — for me to write and draw a review comic strip featuring either Jason and/or Kurt, whomever qyou prefer (if you have a preference). Here's an example from the Book Two Kickstarter project:\n",
      "NOTE: To keep shipping costs down, all physical rewards will be shipped at the same time, in as few shipments as possible, when Book Three is ready to ship — approximately September 2016.\n",
      "The funding goal — the amount needed to create and ship the books and all the rewards — is $24,000. The largest expense, of course, is the print run. Due to increases in both labor and material costs (probably inflation, too), the printing quotes I’ve seen have been at least 30% higher than for Book Two (despite identical specs and projected quantities), and so the funding goal needs to be higher to account for that and the increased fees and income taxes.\n",
      "I'd also like to use BackerKit (or a similar service), which introduces an additional expense but should greatly simplify the fulfillment and pre-order process for non-backers — as well as give you the ability to upgrade your rewards package even after the funding period has ended.\n",
      "All the numbers below are approximate, but this breakdown gives you some idea of where the funding will go:\n",
      "This budget is meant to give me a little wiggle room, because at $6,000 for roughly six months of work, I’m only making about minimum wage for the time I’ll be working on the book and will not be able to absorb any overages as I did with Book One. (This factors in $600/month from my ongoing Patreon project, which covers the ongoing expenses for the webcomic during that same timeframe.)\n",
      "Kickstarter funds will be used solely for book-related expenses. If there are any funds remaining once the project is completely fulfilled, I will continue to push forward with the bonus material for the collected editions — and include the eBooks of any chapters produced to backers with the Book Three eBooks (Chapters 11–15).\n",
      "As with the Kickstarter projects for Books One and Two, this project doesn’t only fund the print run for the books, but also the production of the new material in the book.\n",
      "I'm hoping to have the books and all rewards in backers' hands in September 2016. I think this is a fairly conservative estimate.\n",
      "If we go over the goal, every penny pledged will go toward the production of future Multiplex collections.\n",
      "For every additional $2,000, I’ll be able to continue working on bonus strips for the collected editions and laying out the print book — reducing the production costs needed for a future Book Four Kickstarter Project.\n",
      "Chapters 16–20 comprise Book Four, which was conceived as the conclusion to “Act One” of Multiplex’s planned nine book run.\n",
      "$26,000: CHAPTER 17 EBOOK — I'll also produce the bonus comics for Chapter 17 AND add the finished eBook to all reward packs that include the Book Three eBooks.\n",
      "$38,000: CHAPTERS 18–20 EBOOKS — I'll produce the bonus comics for Chapters 18–20 AND add the finished eBook to all reward packs that include the Book Three eBooks. (Chapters 18–20 don’t have as much new material in them as 16 or 17.)\n",
      "Special thanks go out to the people who helped me with the \"book trailer\" in the project video:\n",

      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I don't anticipate a September 2016 release date being a challenge. While I can't work on the book during the fall semester, if funded, I will be working full time on Multiplex (including the regular updates) for the rest of the summer and after completing my MFA in December. My timeline on the first Kickstarter project was a bit too optimistic, and I ended up going over budget as a result; I've made every effort to make this timeline more conservative.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one likely wrinkle next summer (my fiancée and I making an interstate move next summer) but this has already been factored into the timeline. If it ends up not happening (I’ll know in the next six months or so), the books may be able to ship early.\n",

We’ve offered nutrition information classes that inspire healthy culinary creations in the kitchen so moms learn how to magically add nourishing ingredients like kale and eggplant to fun dishes like mac and cheese. We’ve taught community members how to engage local politicians effectively to create change through letters and initiatives that help their communities lose excess weight and get healthy.

This project will consist of a gallery opening and show in December 2013, consisting of original paintings.

I feel that it is important to take time to notice nature's beauty in a society that can't slow down to enjoy nature around them because of deadlines, busy schedules, and time clocks. Because of this, I bring the city lights and flash of our society's colors to my paintings of animals in hopes of catching the viewer's eye, and causing them to stop and truly look at the beauty of the animals in the world around us. The funding provided will be used for supplies including canvas, artistic and professional acrylic paints, brushes, pallet knives, and frames.

      "Welcome to my first kickstarter for my new series of enamel pins; Choose your weapons!! This is a project i've been working on for a couple of months now and includes original designs of typical and non typical RPG weapons as well as a few sneaky extra weapons commonly found within games and anime. \n",
      "Hi! I'm Lauren, the creator, artist, designer and sole founder of LRNPage. I'm mostly known for apparel these days but I have created several pins this past year and I always enjoy creating more and already have several new ones in the works. \n",
      "I am the one solely responsible for picking, checking, managing and posting all orders for LRNPage and I always strive to offer the best product possible :) I'm super excited about this weapons series and I hope you are too! \n",
      "Designs are unlocked with more pledges. Please pledge for the designs you want, and if it doesn't unlock you can always reduce or cancel your pledge. If all designs are unlocked more stretch goals will be added. Unless stated otherwise all pins are hard enamel and gold or silver plated according to the depicted artwork. \n",
      "Once pins arrive to me, I will grade them accordingly, checking for flaws and ship out backers pins according to what they have ordered. This may take several days to complete so please be patient with me. I will keep everyone updated on the status of this. UK backers can expect to receive their packages in 2-5 days and international buyers can expect theirs typically within 1-2 weeks after shipping, but please be aware it can take 6 weeks depending on location. International buyers will not recieve a tracking number, please message me if you need a tracking number, UK post doesn't offer this as standard and will be charged extra for this service. UK packages are sent out second class mail. \n",
      "When will I be charged? You are charged when the campaign ends in mid-late January. \n",
      "If I don't pledge now can I buy the pins in your webshop? Please understand that I am using kickstarter to fund these pins and so, if a design doesn't get unlocked the likelihood of it being in the webshop is slim. To try guarantee your favourite design being available you will need to pledge in the kickstarter. \n",
      "When will my order be shipped? As soon as I recieve the pins, you will recieve an email estimating the time in which I will ship them out. Once i've shipped your pledge I will email again to confirm it's been shipped. After that it is dependant on location. Please read the shipping section for information on shipping estimates and how they will be shipped. \n",

      "I live in Newfoundland, an island off the east coast of Canada. Newfoundland is about twice the size of the United Kingdom, but only 1/13th of the population. This makes for large amounts of untamed nature and large sections of beautiful landscapes. Hence, why I am ‘Capturing the Beauty of Newfoundland’ and sharing a beauty that many people don’t even know exist. Just this year a tourist told me that Newfoundland was the best kept secret in Canada and that he wished more people could come and see it. I want to share this beautiful place with the world. \n",

But unfortunately, the camera used for most of those amazing shots is broken, R.I.P., and I can't afford a new one. If I want to continue capturing this beautiful place I need a camera. This is the reason for my kickstarter campaign. I’m trying to raise the money to purchase a camera so that I can share a piece of the beautiful place I call home with the world. As a gift of appreciation, Backers will receive a little gift as outlined on my page. Please help me bring Newfoundland to the world. I thank you so much for your support!\n",

      "Introductory\n",
      "First and foremost, thank you for taking some of your valuable time to visit my Kickstarter campaign. I have been a weddings and events photographer for over 2 years now and the sole breadwinner in my family. It's taken me a while, and the urging of friends, to get up the courage post this.  I believe in working hard and that there is no free lunch.\n",
      "Throughout my career as a photographer in Singapore, it has been quite challenging competing with several other photographers, new or old. Most of the time I would be shooting with my Nikon D5300 with a Nikon 17-55mm lens whereas others, if the budget fits, I would be renting a Nikon D810 and a 24-70mm lens from my preferred rental center. \n",
      "It has been a rewarding few years meeting with clients and working with various make up artists on the job whilst shooting a wedding. it was also the hardest work I've ever done and there was no paycheck to boot.\n",
      "However over the last wedding that recently have passed, I found out that my digital SLR have not been performing the way it used to be. Purchased it from a collection of my hard earn money, I can't bear to let it go.\n",
      " I had hoped to repurchase at least one camera and lens before the new year, but life (medical emergencies, dialysis billings, rent etc.) happened and it was not possible.\n",
      " \n",
      "I love photography, and having a dysfunctional camera was like losing a limb. Let alone providing a service to my clients that is not top form would greatly affect my income. As soon as I have enough to purchase my camera and lens, I will commence my landscape photography immediately!   \n",
      "So, I'm offering a trade.  For $50 and above you pledge towards a camera and lens (Nikon D810A and 24-70mm 2.8 lens), I will have the respective rewards sent to you.\n",
      " Funding Through Kickstarter  \n",
      "Whether or not you contribute, thank you for taking to time to stop by.  Keep pursuing your own dreams and don't let anything stop you.  Life is beautiful.\n",

      "Natural climates also pose a risk to the output quality of the image and I would have to make a return trip to the same location on a clear weather. Please note that I do not photoshop clouds etcs to my work as it will ruin the originality of nature's creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other risk involved which may be beyond my control would be the production time for the calendar. However having work together with my print partner has deemed that they are more than capable of fulfilling the order on time.\n",

      "Let’s face it.  Today’s foods ares killing us slowly.  With the GMO’s and food being grown for size and speed of getting it to market, the nutritional value is nil.  Factoid:  It takes 12 carrots today to equal the ‘nutritional’ value of the same size carrot grown in the 1950’s in the U.S.  \n",
      "The results -- 9 out of 10 Americans suffer from some form of Degenerative disease or syndrome.  8 out of 10 Americans are overweight or obese.  Fortunately, more and more people are turning to organically grown food.  Many folks are even growing their own in smaller gardens and some folks are even banding together to form ‘Community’ gardens.  We truly are what we eat and people are sick and tired of being sick and tired and taking drugs just to function.  That is not how are bodies were made.\n",
      "Due to personal health challenges, we started growing our own food and wanted to go organic all the way.  Not as easy as it sounds.  The seeds must be GMO free and not treated with anything.  The soil must be organic as well.  Water must be chemical free.  Fertilizers must be chemical free.  The answer is vermicompost.  So where to get it.  There is an eclectic mix of local suppliers throughout the country and fewer that sell nationwide.  We ordered vermicompost from several different suppliers via the internet.  We were not impressed with the results.  So we decided to make our own.  That meant growing worms.  The first attempt met with minimal results.  As with anything else, education is key.  So we became educated on all things vermicompost.  Vermicompost (Worm Poop) is in HIGH DEMAND around the nation.  We started with 1000 Red Wigglers (Eisenia Fetida).  Six months later and a whole lot smarter, we have approximately 4000 worms.  We have harvested the Black Gold (worm castings/poop) twice within that time.  The results from using our worm poop are AMAZING so much to the point that word has gotten out that we were making high quality vermicompost in our local area and request started pouring in for some of this amazing black gold.  We even produce our own organic based worm food from our gardens that increase worm growth and sexual maturity.  This means more reproduction of stronger healthier worms and way more vermicompost.\n",
      "Based on research and what the market will bear, we sell our 64oz / 1814 gram container for $19.95 per container.  In our target market, we are unable to keep up with demand.  \n",
      "We are looking for investment capital in order to tool up and build a facility that will allow us to increase production while maintaining quality.  We also want to create a website for our black gold.  It is our intention and desire to grow this into a viable business to support and help grow the organic community throughout the country and around the world in order to promote better health through better food.  Quality is our top priority. \n",

In the Vermicomposting community, the risk is always the same.  \"Consistency\".  Finding the right combination of soil composition and bedding to grow worms successfully then maintaining that standard.  Other factors are what the worms are fed and how often. Most or all of the large Commercial Vermicomposters feed straight \"Composted Cow Manure\".  We don't!  Moisture content, temperature and PH are other important factors.  Throughout the last year, we have perfected a system that have our worms maturing sexually in 8-10 weeks instead of the normal 10-12 week time frame.  Once mature they start to produce 2-3 eggs a week and each egg casing on average is producing 2-3 healthy juveniles.  The fact that we started with 1000 worms and even lost half of that batch due to inexperience in the first 3 months then came back strong is testament to our commitment to being the best in the field.  We don't give up.\n",

Additionally, we were not afraid to try new things based on what we were learning about what makes a good earth worm.  We have had great success and will be keeping many of these new techniques proprietary.\n",

      "Hello,\n",
      "My name is Robert Sandage. I am the screenwriter, producer, and director of THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I am from Decatur, Illinois and live in Decatur where I would like to see THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE filmed at. I have looked up locations in my home town and can visually see the movie being made. I have a list of actors that I would love to see play the roles of the characters that I have created for THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE.\n",
      "THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE is a 80's style horror movie with the special effects that are old school effects. I am trying to capture is the creativeness that I enjoyed in horror movies from the 80's. There will be some CGI effects used, but I do not want the entire movie done in CGI though. I have a list of actors who come from a variety of horror films from the 80's that I fill would embody the roles in the movie. THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE will be filmed in Decatur, Illinois and Louisiana. Michelle Torres will be the producer on the Louisiana film crew and has a role in the movie as the TV broadcasting anchorwoman. I will be releasing her characters name eventually on the IMDB board once the film is going to be made. \n",
      "What is THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE about? Well I had entered a contest and a part of the contest is where you submit a LOGLINE. I had that done and added it to the campaign here for you all to be able to watch. The devil hatches a plan to encase a succubus into a rare jewel or diamond. That rare jewel or diamond winds up on a engagement ring. A boyfriend who is in love with his girlfriends buys the ring and decides to propose to her. The sweet innocent virgin accepts his proposal and the ring is placed onto her finger. When that happens the succubus then possesses her and she begins to claim souls for the devil. The more souls the sweet innocent virgin claims the more her power to shift change and look like any woman that would appeal to any man alive taking their souls.\n",
      "I have spoken to a lawyer in Decatur, Illinois and it is not cheap to hire a lawyer to write up a Letter Of Agreement or a contract. I have even spoken to some of the actors agents and assistants that they have to see about them appearing in THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. In order for this to happen I am needing to have the movie fully funded. This is not my first time creating a campaign page for THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I honestly admit that I was asking for too much money to make it happen. Hiring the screenwriters, director, production staff, casting directors, art directors, lighting crews, and editors is not cheap at all. That is why I am seeking $2,500,000.00 to $3,000,000.00 for a budget for THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I am needing your help for that.\n",
      "I have set up prizes to meet my goal into making this happen. If you love 80's style horror movies then I promise you that you will love THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I would love to see this happen and make it happen for everyone to enjoy including myself. Thank you for your time and making this happen.\n",
      "Robert Sandage\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "This is my second go at trying to make THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE happen and it is not easy. I am more than qualified to making sure in creating a great 80's style horror movie. It will have some legends and things that no one has ever seen in a movie before. I want to create a movie that will go into the books as a brilliant master piece. The obstacle that I face right now is not having full funding for the movie. I am just merely asking for every horror movie fan out there to make this happen. Hey I am willing to do what it takes to make this happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Right now due to the movie not being fully funded it makes it difficult to pay a lawyer to write up a contract for the film company to get the production staff, casting directors, art directors, lighting crews, and editors for the production. In order for this to happen you have to have a legal contract with the production company. Then also there has to be a contract with the agents and assistants that their client is pleased with what is going to be made into a movie. I feel very confident that I can make this happen and have horror fans out there love what my vision is for THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I have many challenges and I am willing to face them and work to make it happen.\n",

      "Wow! Two weeks left, and almost half of funds raised. Most of the projects that fail on Kickstarter never raise more than about 10% of their goal, so we are on a great path. I should mention here that our family and friends have been more generous than I could imagine, and your faith in us is a massive inspiration! To celebrate you guys, we have created a special Thank You image, tagging all of our supporters. Head over to the Logan & Royce Facebook page to check it out! \n",
      "Update 5-5-14:\n",
      "Almost at $2000! Special thanks to the band Bon Saints, who have contacted us and agreed to allow use of their music free of charge, to nerd-tastic fan haven dorkly.com for helping spread the word on Twitter, and to production company Atomic Imaging for getting involved and offering their industry standard facilities and equipment for a fraction of the price! \n",
      "This has been a lot of work so far, but even more fun. This week we will be hitting blogs, personalities, and unique funding sources to help get the word out. Take care, and talk to you soon! \n",
      "-Radek \n",
      "People are ready to have fun with zombies again. \n",
      "Although a few projects like The Walking Dead have explored these creatures, I believe there is room in our cultural landscape for a more tongue-in-cheek romp through an apocalypse. Think 'Thelma and Louise' meets 'Buffy: The Vampire Slayer', with a sprinkle of 'The Road' for flavor.\n",
      "Let me back up. \n",
      "Logan and Royce began as a self-challenge to play recreate some of the visual effects of (what else?) The Walking Dead. A motion graphics and visual effects artist by trade, I was fascinated by how the show was able to ingeniously blend simple techniques to create very convincing effects, and believed I could build from these while applying my own spin. I strung together methods and shots I wanted to try, collected a small crew, secured a shooting location, and went to work. \n",
      "But in those few hours of shooting, a funny thing happened. Our two leads developed a fantastic rapport and we got to talking. What were these two gals doing in this strange world? How did they meet? The world has ended, so why the heck are they so at ease? Where did the zombies come from, and why do most seem to be clones of just one actor? (Surely it can't be because only one extra showed up for filming...) \n",
      "The Project\n",
      "We'll produce an online miniseries, two episodes long, approximately 10 minutes each. Why not one, longer episode? That lets us tease you guys with a great cliffhanger midway through! \n",
      "The Goal\n",
      "In order to create this project from start to finish, script writing to signed DVDs, we need to raise $15,000. This might seem like a lot, but it's surprisingly low-budget compared to other shows. For 20 minutes of video content, the average US Sitcom costs over a MILLION DOLLARS. House of Cards runs roughly $1.5 million for 20 minutes. The Walking Dead? Nearly $3 million. Even the fantastic online web-series Videogame High School (season 2) cost $150,000 for 20 minutes of show. \n",
      "How can we do it so cheap? We have a community of people that will work for the experience and the love of the concept. We can call in favors with regard to crew and locations. We own much of the equipment needed, so rental costs are lower. \n",
      "Our Financial Plan\n",
      "What's next? \n",
      "Free online distribution! Online entertainment is only going to grow in the future, and the savvy content creator would do well to position themselves to take advantage of this trend! Machinima, Indieflix, Amazon, and Hulu are just a few targets we will shop the show around to. Even if none of them bite, with enough followers there could be a full season in the works. Anything is possible! \n",
      "But first, we need your help! \n",
      "With funding platforms such as Kickstarter, you, the audience, are empowered to choose what gets made and what you want to see by voting with your wallet before a single scene is filmed, instead of waiting to see what the networks or mega-studios decide your content for you. \n",
      "Why Kickstarter? \n",
      "As one of the most prominent of the crowdfunding services available, Kickstarter has grown over the past few years from a relatively unknown, niche funding source for artists and creative people to a force to be reckoned with. Filmmakers Spike Lee and Zack Braff have raised millions for their next projects using Kickstarter. This summer's Veronica Mars movie broke records with a total of $5.7 million raised in just 30 days. All from ordinary people that wanted to see the projects made, the vast majority pledging between $10 and $50. \n",
      "These are not simply donations. In addition to supporting the creative effort, backers receive awards based on their level of contribution. \n",
      "We don't want to flood you with a bunch of trinkets or stickers that you may never use. Instead, we offer experiences. We will take you on the filmmaking journey with us, fromexclusive behind the scenes production updates to having a say in the script and editing process, to being a zombie extra in our show! \n",
      "But there is a catch to Kickstarter. It's not for the faint of heart, one must wholeheartedly believe in their vision, for if the financial goals is unfulfilled, the project receives no funding at all. It's an all-or-nothing horse race, exciting and nerve wracking in equal measure. \n",
      "How can you help? \n",
      "Aside from pledging to our campaign, and bagging yourself a perk in the process, help spread the word! Facebook and Twitter are great, but word of mouth is still the best avenue for sharing the love. You know that nerdy guy in your office that gushes about Game of Thrones every Monday? Or your friends who nerd out to Joss Whedon's Firefly? Perhaps they'll get a kick out of getting our shooting script ($10 backer reward) or getting blown away on set ($500 backer reward). \n",

      "          For Debut Launch of Line in May, 2013\n",
      "  My most recent sumi-e paintings have been on Habotai silk scarves. I have an opportunity to display my newest work at \"The Goods: An Artisan Festival\" at Orfilia Winery,San Pasqual Valley, San Diego CA. I need materials to paint fifty 22\" x 60\" silk scarves in two weeks, then get them to my seamstress for hemming in time for the festival. I estimate the cost of materials and production to be $1,500. Backers who contribute at least $40 to this effort will be rewarded with a hand painted Habotai silk scarf, (20\" x 20\"), or 20\" x 60\" for a pledge of $80 or more. My deep gratitude to all who believe in my work and support with your donations and your applause.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I have calculated that I can paint thirty 22\" x 60\" scarf panels per 5 day work-week. A five day schedule leaves two days for catch up and problem solving. This allows Two weeks for painting. At the end of week one the first thirty scarves can go to my seamstress for hemming. Second week, the next thirty, so as I'm painting, she is hemming. I have contracted with her before on another project and was happy with her work and delivery. Should she show any delivery problems, I have a recommended alternative for back-up. \n",
      "   My supplier of silk has a large and diverse inventory, in a broad spectrum of colors. The inks I use are well stocked at my local art supply store. I also have alternate sources in Los Angeles.\n",
      "    I have already painted prototypes of the scarves as Christmas gifts for friends and family. They were very well received. I know my painting technique and production process, which is how I calculated my production capacity.\n",
      "    I think the Artisan Festival is a good venue to launch the line and assess the public response. Any remaining inventory from sales at the Artisan Festival can be offered on an Etsy store and through local specialty boutique shops and art galleries. Market research shows hand painted silk scarves sell  between $45 upward to $80+ each. I intend to offer at a retail price of $80.\n",
      "  My studio is in my home, and has sufficient space for the production of this initial venture.\n",

      "Your support is crucial to the success of this campaign! Please take a closer look at the project description below as well as the terrific rewards on the right that I am offering in return for your generous contribution. Thank you!\n",
      "Project Description:\n",
      "I’ve been invited to have my first one-woman show with Reginald Ingraham gallery in Los Angeles May 25th. I am really excited about this great opportunity to share my work on the West Coast.The exhibition is titled, \"Had I Been Raised In the Village...\" and will showcase many of the paintings in my current body of work. \n",
      "As a Rwandan living in Harlem, New York, I work to configure ways of demonstrating my in-between state of being stuck in a perpetual transit lounge. I mine diverse sources such as imigongo cow dung painting patterns, Matisse's color palette, and the visual effects on the severely deteriorated exterior walls of old colonial buildings on the West coast of Africa. I use these points of inspiration combined with oxidized metal detritus I discover on my walks around the city to create works that reflect issues of displacement, cultural adaptation, and what it means to be an immigrant today. My work questions assumptions around hybrid identity in this increasingly globalized world. In exploring these issues, I focus on the transitional material of iron oxide as well as industrial thin-set mortar/concrete to create my paintings and installations. I coalesce disparate components, suspending them in space, to suggest geographical collision.\n",
      "I am creating new pieces over the next month to be included in the exhibition and I’d be humbled to have your support to help with developing and shipping these works. Many of the works in the exhibition are 4 x 4 feet and with objects protruding from their surface. They will require special attention to build crates to protect the work on their journey to L.A.. Your support is an important part of my success in completing the works for the exhibition and making sure they are properly shipped!\n",
      "You can donate any amount.  If you’re in LA you can come to the show...I’d love to meet you. \n",

      "MONOTYPE:\n",
      "Monotyping is a type of printmaking made by drawing or painting on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque colour. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.\n",

      "For the past year and a half, ever since I moved to London, I have been preparing for my first solo painting exhibition. Having studied painting in Brooklyn, New York at Pratt Institute and since been heavily involved in the Brooklyn art scene, it is my dream to spend the rest of my life creating art and making it my career. I have spent more time than I ever have on this project and I can't wait to see it come to fruition. But I need your help. Living as a working artist in it's beginning stages is a financial struggle. There are many hours needed to have a productive studio practice so it has been hard to save money with part-time work. I am sure with a little help, I can use your support to launch myself into the art scene and show the world all the hard work I've been doing. I can sell my work at this exhibition and make contacts which will further my career. This specific exhibition will show off my newest series of oil paintings while also highlighting some of my older work which has brought me to this point. I've brought to life a dream world where animals live as you and I do and combined it with the the magic of realism with it's devotion to light. Check out my links to see what I've been working on. Your contribution will go to renting the gallery space and the remainder will go to paying for promotional items and gallery installation materials. Any contribution would be more than appreciated. As an artist, your love and support is invaluable and essential.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "I've found that the most difficult thing in becoming a financially successful artist is acquiring the right following.  A gallery can be useful for it's mailing list, but there have to be enough art collectors, designers, and other clients interested in my work to provide enough income to live and have a full-time studio practice.  In New York there are many gallery's that can provide this for but can charge the me anywhere from 40-75% on the sale price of the artwork.  In London it is common for an emerging artist to rent a space for an exhibition but will not necessarily receive promotional help from the gallery.  I have chosen to have my first solo exhibition in The Annexe of The Brick Lane Gallery.  The space is for rent, but also gives me access to their extensive mailing list.  Hopefully, with both of our promotional efforts, this exhibition will produce a crowd capable of propelling my career and producing opportunities I wouldn't otherwise have.  Luckily, I have many friends in the art world who can help me with this DIY approach and with your help, can use this well located space and their resources to put together a very professional, well-represented exhibition.\n",

      "Hello, My name is Daryl and I run a small Etsy store where I sell enamel pins and other products of my designs. Typically, I try to focus on designing and selling original characters, but I recently played through the PS3 classic Ni No Kuni and was inspired to design my first keychain.  Here are some specifics: Assurance: All pledge money received will go straight into the production and manufacturing of this keychain. The manufacturer that I work with does require 100 piece minimum, so I don't foresee having much money leftover. If there does happen to be some funds left over, all the remainder will go toward purchasing new backing cards and other such items for packaging.\n",
      "LATEST RISK IN LIST \n",

      "I've been designing and manufacturing hard enamel pins for almost a year now and have yet to encounter any sort of challenge that wasn't easily overcome. However, this being my first keychain design, things might work a little differently, considering it's a new type of item. But I trust in my contacts with the manufacturer and I will do everything in my power to ensure that this product turns out the best that it can possibly be.\n"

The most time-consuming tasks will be completing the artwork and the layout. I've done this before, with the previous Akashic Titan zine and with my game Project 8Ball. Depending on the stretch goals I will be depending on someone else for illustrations and additional text, but I have worked with Josh before and I am confident he will hit his deadlines. \n",
