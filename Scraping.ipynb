      "Ademi Bar: Our Journey\n",
      "While looking back and thinking about where our journey started, we realized that the story of every entrepreneur and of every immigrant in the United States is very similar, it is the story of unimaginable hard work and never ending efforts to make it work. It was no different for us.\n",
      "Here we were in 2015, the newly immigrated and entrepreneurial just-married couple. I, Aizhan, think that this is where our journey had begun… Aidar thinks our journey started when we said NO to meat, but that is just a few months later, so let's not think about little differences but common points.\n",
      "It was 2015, when we started experimenting with food and trying out cooking for people. As new folks in town (country), we thought sharing food is the fastest way to find like minded friends which eventually turned out to be a good plan. Please note this for yourselves if any of you happen to move to a new place with no friends or family. We were cooking different sweets and snacks, sharing them with friends and neighbors. Then we started selling our creations at the farmers markets, pop up events and local stores here in San Francisco. You will be hearing this a lot throughout our Kickstarter campaign because we treasure all these moments very much and want you to see how much fun it can be - the cruelty free food, doing business and building your life from scratch.\n",
      "Being an entrepreneur by nature is not an easy thing. For us, being a true entrepreneur is finding one thing that motivates you so much that you are ready to put your whole life into it, as I said, not easy. But we were very lucky, we’ve found that one thing that motivates both of us very much - the FOOD.\n",
      "The History Behind Ademi Bar\n",
      "We launched Ademi as a natural snack company back in 2016. We were influenced by traditional Indian treats like fruit based laddoos. We developed our own recipe and came up with a product Almond Date Bites. We worked on a label design, purchased packaging and obtained permission to sell at a local farmers’ market.\n",
      "Although we tested out Almond Date Bites and a variety of other different products, the idea never really took off and as a result Ademi went into hibernation until February 2019. It was our family, friends and past customers who inspired us to design a new product.\n",
      "We went back to the drawing board but this time we wanted to make it right. We used the knowledge that was already gained and decided to try out a few of our recipes of plant-based protein bars. \n",
      "Some of them worked and some didn’t. We had a fair share of triumphs and setbacks. But over time Ademi bars were selling out like hot cakes. People from different parts of town became frequent visitors to our tent at the farmers’ market. We even started to deliver Ademi bars to local Bay Area marathon and triathlon clubs who were praising our bars and spreading the word. And of course we got some nice triathlon swag for free! That was the most precious, sweetest and coolest time. We experimented with different packaging too, because our original packaging was not strong enough, or couldn’t hold the vacuum, or wasn’t professional enough. \n",
      "This was all valuable feedback from our customers, which we listened to and followed. We always came back to our drawing board and re-designed, re-packaged and re-worked our bars. This kept us on our toes and prepared us for the next push.\n",
      "We outgrew the farmers’ market and found a manufacturing partner who helped us to improve our recipes and introduced us to the world of professional packaging. With all new packaging and manufacturing support our capabilities became endless. We started selling Ademi bars on Amazon and to the local Bay Area shops and supermarkets. They quickly gained popularity on Amazon and in the Bay Area. \n",
      "At the same time we developed marketing and sales strategy and found more about our target customers. Our buyers like that Ademi bars are not overly sweet, large in size, great for digestion, high in dietary fiber and chickpea protein, low in ingredients list count and taste good. Ademi bars simply do their job!\n",
      "With our success in the last few months, it has become clear that we've outgrown the farmers’ market. We have worked hard, but have sometimes really struggled to keep up with demand.\n",
      "Why does Ademi Bar need your help?\n",
      "The next step for Ademi bars to grow would be to offer more exciting flavors to a wider audience! The Ademi community is vast, filled with amazing customers who are extremely supportive of our product, our journey, and who share our passion for vegan life style.  We would LOVE your help and support as we try to bring and widen our passion in the US.\n",
      "We are hosting this Kickstarter campaign to help build brand recognition for Ademi bars and develop new and exciting flavors. While there are a handful of companies that are dedicated to the plant-based nutrition bar arena, we believe we are still early to market.\n",
      "Ademi Bars need your support because we want to make Ademi a part of a plant-based revolution. As a community we can change the way we eat, the way we treat each other and animals and the way we care for our nature.\n",
      "What will our backers get by contributing?\n",
      "You will get our many many thanks for supporting our small business and helping to bring our dreams to life!!! In terms of Kickstarter rewards, you have the options for the following depending on the reward level you choose: (Please see Rewards options; it's a top menu item on a mobile device, or it's on the right on the desktop version)\n",
      "What will our contribution bring to Ademi Bar:\n",
      "We’ve designed two pilot flavors and manufactured beta batch of 5,000 chocolate sea salt Ademi bars, but need your help for the next step:\n",
      "What will be covered by Ademi:\n",
      "When will you start selling?\n",
      "We plan to start selling Ademi bars on November 5th, 2021! We will send updates to backers and post key updates on this page.\n",
      "Why now?\n",
      "We are deeply grateful to our customers and partners for their support and where this journey has brought us so far.\n",
      "The last couple of years have not been easy. Taking Ademi out of hibernation, searching for the right manufacturing partner, developing recipes and packaging design, establishing distribution network by pushing online and offline sales - it’s been a tough play, especially during pandemic. During the last two years we have been able to get to know more local convenience store owners and coffee shop owners than we have ever known in our lifetime.\n",
      "Running a small business makes you get into the funniest situations like discovering that Ademi bars sell in good volumes at liquor stores and the saddest situations where some of our best distribution partners had to go out of business or risked to shut their doors for good due to pandemic. This provided us an opportunity to learn and open our minds. Support from our distribution partners and online customers have been inspiring us and providing much needed validation that Ademi bars can do the job. It is only when they keep calling us back and requesting more bars when the reality hits - OMG, Ademi Bars sell! The excitement, gratitude and faith in our mission and product make us want to push forward!\n",
      "Our distribution partners are waiting for us to develop and offer a wide variety of flavors with beautiful and shiny packaging so that they can start leveraging our renewed capabilities and put Ademi bars on the shelves to compete with other brands. Stores and distribution network partners pretty much sell the real estate in the form of shelves and they are keen on filling the shelves with the few brands that have multiple flavors to offer. \n",
      "This is how products like Ademi bars become noticeable by customers who search for their favorite flavors. We hope this will give Ademi bars a better opportunity to compete, fulfill our mission and expand.\n",
      "Let’s unleash the full potential of Ademi Bar!\n",
      "We are still in the middle of a global pandemic, and the times are uncertain. But, it is what it is, we can’t change it, we can only look forward, carry on and hope for the best. In these uncertain times, we are turning to you - our backers, for your help to get Ademi forward. We’ve done all we could by sustaining Ademi with our savings and loans.\n",
      "What next for Ademi Bar?\n",
      "It is important to continue working and ensuring that growth is consistent. We have the product, mission, now we need to add more flavors, improve packaging, marketing and push offline and online sales. As long as we are in business and not hibernating, the momentum shouldn’t be lost. It will be easier to improve profitability once sales are consistent and rising. We are also planning to control and manage our own supply chain, this way we can manage costs at every turn.\n",
      "What happens if this fundraising campaign fails to meet its goal?\n",
      "It is expensive to run an early stage nutritional food business. If we don’t meet our funding goal, Ademi bars will not live on and we will have to shut down our business.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We understand the challenges that lie ahead of us. Some industry experts say that the market for protein bars is too crowded. These days companies decide to focus on one niche and cater to specific needs of their customers. Ademi’s mission is not only to spread vegan lifestyle, but to innovate and bring out the best in nutrition technology. We sincerely believe that Ademi bars can survive with this Kickstarter campaign plus sales projections that we are planning to generate by adding more flavors and controlling our own supply chain along the way.\n",

      "   who are looking for performance breakfast,\n",
      "   our product is a set of Nutrition for your mind and body,\n",
      "   that's made up of Clean and organic ingredients.\n",
      "And, We believe that together we can change the food industry..\n",
      " Here's how our macro-nutritional profile stacks up with other Breakfasts:\n",
      "That's why Unicox Power Breakfast are packed with healthy fats and contain just 4-5g of net carbs per serving. We also included 6g of fiber/per serving to slow the absorption of those net carbs...\n",
      "To bring all this to life I mastered recipe at home and with help of  nutritionist and RD's we fixed caloric profile, Our blend have a \"fat-fueled\" mentality. They're packed with healthy fats from chia seeds, flax seeds and almonds to provide the ultimate form of energy and naturally sweetened with monk fruit. We developed them from the ground-up to be both functional and delicious.\n",
      "“Breakfast is the most important meal of the day\" With plant-powered protein, you can depend on your breakfast to keep you full for longer, increased gut health, and organic ingredients that you can trust. While many associate the word vegan with bland flavorless vegetable loaves, our superfood blend is just the opposite. Delight your morning with Power Breakfast Blend which contains Organic Almond Protein...\n",
      "In order to “get this show on the road” so to speak, we need your help! Our product needs funding in order to make its way to you. While we have the ingredients and the skills to formulate them into a kick-ass one of a kind breakfast, we want to be able to share the benefits with folks like you that deserve a healthy alternative that tastes great. When you choose to invest in Unicox Kickstarter, you’re supporting a woman-owned small business.\n",
      "It takes purchasing power to implement meaningful change. A fully-funded Kickstarter will allow us to:-\n",
      "I founded Unicox in 2020 after trying and failing to find a good quality Breakfast. The problem was most available breakfasts are high in sugar, contains gluten or fillers. So, I am crowdfunding to raise money to start clean ingredients product line, and bring new outstanding vegan products, I need your help! I am a one women army and your help will allow me to  hire team members.\n",
      "How all started?\n",
      "In 2019, I was  diagnosed with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). One of the visible PCOS symptoms was weight gain and fatigue. Then I decided to change my eating lifestyle because  without the right diet, I realized, no amount of hard work would change that. Within weeks of adopting a Gluten free diet I started to see visible results. I wanted to go fully Plant-Based, but I never could because I couldn't replace my breakfast. I tried Overnight Oats but it didn't helped me that much, but I achieved a remarkable rebound in my performance by eating chia and flax breakfast!\n",
      "It's been a Bumpy ride at times...\n",
      "To keep my PCOS normal...\n",
      "*Drum roll please* ….Hence my new adventure: Combining the benefits of superfoods with the good fats for a dietary essential that’s as yummy  and filling as it is health -conscious. I am excited to finally share my work with all of you!\n",
      "I hope you can relate to my vision, and that my blend will make a real difference in helping you to achieve your health goals.\n",

      "Shortly after the new year, I was notified that I was accepted into the Art Students League of NY's Residency at Vytlacil in Sparkill, NY and awarded a full scholarship to cover the costs of studio and housing for the month of June. I'm over-the-moon excited about this opportunity to submerge completely into my work for a full 4 weeks!\n",
      "I want to maximize this opportunity and the proximity to NYC's unique burlesque scene by bringing these performers into my studio. With this favorable time I shall observe and study each performer and their elaborate costumes from life, creating new works surpassing what I have accomplished to date. I plan to create multiple works during the residency, and am excited to announce those whom I am working with in the coming weeks!\n",
      "I am excited to work with the very top level of performers in the field. Among the list of performers working with me on this project is someone considered to be one of the single most important influences in that field today! The official lineup includes: Peekaboo Pointe, Delysia LaChatte, Amber Ray, and Dirty Martini!\n",
      "The vast majority of funds raised will be used to pay for the performer, model and costume costs for this project. The rest of the funds will be used to cover postproduction costs for posters and prints.\n",
      "In 2010 I started a series of paintings that focused on local Kansas City performers of various types; fire dancers, jugglers, singers, and burlesque artists. At first I saw this as a chance to explore the alter egos of people who develop an on-stage persona and live in a way that is free from the constraints of typical daily American life. Over time I found that something about burlesque resonated with me on a personal level. I began to see beyond performances and props and realized the underlying theme of women who live liberated from the status quo of a misogynistic society. The burlesque stage is a place where women (and men, straight, gay, queer, and transgender all equally welcome) are free to express their sexuality without shame, and without the need to pander to or protect themselves from male desires. Body positivity and self-expression are encouraged if not required, and feminist social commentaries are applauded rather than discounted. What a wonderful world!\n",
      "In my paintings, I seek to stir this feeling of power and freedom in the viewer, allowing them to vicariously experience the confidence, power, and abandon I've felt in the presence of these performers. Moreover, I present images of women as sexual subjects in a medium traditionally associated with respectability, making a subtle statement not only about the social perception of the performers specifically, but about women's sexuality in general.\n",
      "As a thank you for supporting my goals during this residency, I will invite you to follow my progress via a secret blog where I will post exclusive photos, stories, and videos throughout the month of June and beyond! I also offer a variety of rewards including posters of some of my most popular paintings, Skype sessions, and original artwork. Finally, if you are as excited as I am about the opportunity to work with one of today's most celebrated burlesque figures, choose a poster, limited edition print, or heck, commission an original oil painting!\n",
      " Although life as an artist comes with it’s own set of hurdles and challenges; I have been fortunate to have experienced such intense and moving support from those within and outside the artist community. Knowing that there are people out there that appreciate my work keeps me going through both the challenges as well as the good times... I thank you most sincerely!\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "With a full month and complete flexibility on my end, it's hard to imagine that anything would get in the way of this project. In some *insanely unlikely* event that I am unable to paint during my stay in Sparkill, a rescheduling of modeling sessions at a later date will occur as necessary and painting will continue once home in Kansas City, thereby completing the paintings and fulfilling the rewards. The schedule may be affected, but not the result.\n",

This is a project I have wanted to do for years, but such a major undertaking is of course, very expensive.  To make this project a reality, I need more than just a single camera.  I need a studio so that I can mold my photos into what I want. Equipment, such as lights, video cameras, and other items are essential. Finally, it's necessary to hire models or pay to bring survivors to me so that they can be a part of this project.  This is no small idea.That's where you come in.  I have created a KickStarter page for this project. My goal is not just to do this for myself, but to raise awareness on a global scale.  But to do it, I need your help.  If you support this cause, know someone who is a survivor, or are one yourself, consider donating. Every donation will go towards making this a reality.  And if you'd be interested in working on this project, contact me!\n",

The girls, Amelia and Cynthia, take them to their family’s land deep in the woods for a sexy weekend of camping, drinking, and drugs. The guys start to realize too late, however, that they may have wandered into a dangerous situation. The film is inspired by the classic horror films of the 70’s, exploring the ideas of the occult, nature worship, and human sacrifice. Centered on the traditions of hoodoo, it blurs the lines of what is real and what is a superstition. A homage to horror classics, it will blend the lines of frightening and funny. \n",
      "The Cult of Ammon is an ambitious project, so we're making sure our budget is as tight as can be. Primarily, a large portion of our funding will go to purchasing film, developing and scanning. Finding Aaton a-minima spools has been difficult, but we've sourced a steady supply in California. We're calling in a lot of favors when it comes to equipment rental.\n",
      "In addition to our film needs, a large portion of the budget will be going to our cast.

Happy actors means better filmmaking for everyone. \n",

      "Decisions is a short horror film from the creators of 'Meat' which is to be featured in the horror anthology series 'World of Death'.\n",
      "This is Johnny Saurette's second time directing.  He is the founder of Cannibal Fx special effects studio.\n",
      "Our team, which consists of Kristen Saurette-Brady and Leann Brady, is fully committed to bringing you an amazing movie experience but we need a little help from you. We are asking for a donation of $1,000 (total) which will go directly to the making of the movie.  The following is a cost analysis:  \n",
      "With the funding we already have from Still Rings True Productions we need:\n",
      "$450 for Special Effects- We are firm believers in practical effects. Cannibal FX will be doing all special effects work and it is a huge chunk of our funding goal but it will be well worth it in the end.\n",
      "$200 for camera equipment- We will be shooting all of Decisions on DSLRS which we own so production cost will be very low. The $200 will be for a boom mic and any unexpected repairs we need.\n",
      "$350 for editing and distribution- The remaining money will go directly to editing and distribution. We are renting a high powered desktop to do our editing on. We also plan on releasing the short on our website however we will be taking pre orders and will be selling our film on DVD along with our other shorts.\n",
      "We will be using any all and all of your contributions towards the film. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "A challenge we face is time. We plan on the film being complete and released by the week of halloween. All of the creators work fulltime jobs outside of their film jobs (which during filming can also be fulltime) so getting the film shot and edited and released in 60 days will be a challenge. \n",
      "Our short 'Meat' was shot edited and released in two days with a 100$ budget. So we are fully confident in our ability.\n",

Kickstarter, and together we brought over 15 pins to life and raised over $17,000. As I worked more and more on the project, I realized just how many tropes were still left and how many folks wanted. So, this sequel to the project brings together the top tropes from the last project's poll.\n",

      "Here's the breakdown:\n",
      "PINs & STICKERs: 65-70%\n",
      "SHIPPING: 22-25%\n",
      "KICKSTARTER FEES: 8-10%\n",
      "Why the increase from the last project?\n",
      "I want to upgrade the production time, which would make the wait for the pins 50% shorter. It does, however, cost a bit more. Thus, the upgrade to the goals.\n",

      "Hello Friends! Hope this finds you well, hunkering down, readying for winter… Thanks for checking out our Kickstarter page! First, a few facts about the Lonely Heartstring Band…We met up through the American Roots Music program at Berklee College of Music in Boston.  For a gig in September of 2012 we were asked to play only Beatles' music--using bluegrass instrumentation.  From the first rehearsal, there was great chemistry, and we decided that we’d take the band seriously and carry it beyond that gig (and beyond just the Beatles!).  Our inspiration ranges from bluegrass, old time, jazz, classical music, and more.  Since 2012, we’ve been writing and arranging our music, exploring traditional music, and touring the continent. This past summer, we toured extensively from May until September, playing festivals on both coasts and in both Canada and the USA. Being our first tour, the band matured in a way that only tour can do, and we feel that we’re ready to make our first record!\n",

      "WHAT?!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With your support, the Lonely Heartstring Band will make the record of our dreams!  With a dozen songs ready to record– most of them originals – and a handful more just around the corner, we think that this January will be the right time to get into the studio. It’s late November now, and we haven't booked any shows between now and mid-January so that we can completely focus on preparing to record. We’re rehearsing almost every day, getting our material studio-ready, and with each day that passes, we’re all a little more excited to get these songs recorded and into your stereos!\n",

      "WHERE?!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve chosen the Great North Sound Society in Parsonsfield, Maine as our studio of choice for this record. It’s a beautiful 18th century farmhouse converted into a remote, tucked-away, cell-reception-free (yesssss), live-in studio. It’s been the studio-of-choice for some amazing sounding records (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive, Joy Kills Sorrow), and we’ve booked ourselves a full week! It’s got a large open main(e) room for all the bed tracks, and the rest of the house will serve as isolation booths for all the extra bits… not to mention sleeping spaces and tri-harmony-around-the-fireplace-zones.\n",
      "WHO?!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve enlisted the masterful work of David Travers-Smith of Toronto, Ontario to come to Maine and engineer, produce, mix and master this record. He’s worked with fabulous artists (Wailin’ Jennys, Jayme Stone and many many more) and his knowledge of traditional, pop, vocal and new acoustic music makes him the ideal man for the job.  He’s got a ton of experience, and he’ll be coming down early to work some pre-production with us. He’s an awesome guy, and we’re really excited to be enlisting his help for this project.\n",

      "HOW?!\n",

      "We’ve lined up everything we can to make this record the best it can possibly be, from David the producer, the studio, the material, the warm wool sweaters and the excitement… Our last big step is your support through this Kickstarter! So THANK YOU! We love you all. It would he a HUGE help to us if you could share our Kickstarter with your communities. We look forward with sharing our music with you, we couldn’t do this without Your Help!!!\n",

      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "The main challenges involved with recording this record are preparing the material and making sure that we are all healthy both mentally and physically before we get into the studio.  We have a limited time to complete this project and we are on a tight budget.  But we feel confident that with the love and support of our friends, family and community, we can work through any obstacle that will arise.\n",

      "We are passionate about ingredients and read labels meticulously - Are these ingredients healthy?  Were they sourced and processed ethically?  Do any of them cause anxiety because we don't believe they should be in our food?\n",

Those regional opportunities validated our recipes and allowed us to build a small kitchen; where our purveying, processing and distribution systems have won 2 sustainability awards.  The next step, is getting NexVeg on your doorstep!\n",
      "Clearly it all starts with 100% whole foods and admittedly, our goal is to do as little processing as possible, as fast as possible.  \n",

      "We flash freeze and vacuum seal, retaining freshness and eliminating nutritional degradation caused by air or frostbite.\n",

      "We know how hard it is to find out online what's really in your food.  We love sharing every little detail about what goes into NexVeg.  Let's start with these USDA panels and some photos of the actual ingredients that we process into NexVeg.\n",
      "Remember, in order to maximize the quality and minimize the footprint we choose the freshest ingredients that travel the fewest miles to our production kitchens.  Here's what those fresh East / West ingredients look like, when they arrive at our kitchens.\n",
      "In fact, we take our ingredients even a bit more seriously than that: \n",
      "1) It's delicious.  We've tested more than 208 recipes and served 1,000,000 portions to get to our 3 current product lines and 6 flavor profiles.\n",
      "2) It's healthy.  Whole food diets are medically proven to lower risk of heart disease and control weight gain. \n",
      "3) It's sustainable.  Lightly processing whole foods consumes less water, produces less carbon and  creates less food waste than heavy processing of plants or raising animals.\n",
      "4) It's easy.  NexVeg is formable like ground meat and cooks fast in a skillet or the oven.  It is great for bulk prep and can be plated hot or cold.  There's a variety worthy of replacing the meat in your favorite comfort foods no matter the cuisine.\n",
      "Whether you love the performance protein in the NexVeg Hemp & Seed line or the intense sustainable and healthy eating ethos of NexVeg Tepary, or the comforting familiarity of  Black Beans, there's a NexVeg product for you:  \n",

Originally this concept started as a way to encourage myself and my community to consume more fruits and veggies for more energy and healthier living. I'd wake up early on the weekends and make drinks to sell at my cousin's apothecary in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. At the time, I was also a full- time student at Brooklyn College, a doula and a nanny, As a nineteen year old, I did not have all the answers, but I did know a few things- 1) I'm passionate about curating accessible \"feel good\" experiences for my community, 2) I want to further develop my \"Sol Sips\" concept. After a couple years of doing pop-ups, drafting business plans and receiving feedback from mentors and family, an opportunity for a three month brick and mortar pop up fell into my lap via Craigslist. On December 2017 we opened \"Sol Sips Vegan Bevs and Bites\" in Bushwick, NY with the intention of staying for three months to test the waters. At the end of our three month test run our customers and the landlord of the space encouraged us to find a way to permanently stay. At the time it seemed unpromising to jump into owning and operating a restaurant as a 21-year old while finding the funds to do so.  I decided to go for it and launched a $50,000 crowd-funder, in addition to a family/friends round of funding. We didn't reach our goal of $50,000- instead we raised $5,000 and my family and friends raised $15,000. Although I didn't reach the goal- I was determined to make it work. Now almost two years later we are here and still standing.  \n",
      "The passion and care that we put into our food is evident. We need support with gathering the final resources to open the doors of \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\", our new location in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, NY. This is a refreshing opportunity that would allow us to serve more people, expand our menu and incorporate the elements of fellowship that love so much. This includes live music, dj sets, art, storytelling and most important- a brave and comfortable space for black/poc people and families to commune and be nourished. \n",
      "The inclusivity of this upcoming space is what we are most excited about. We've witnessed the power of accessible wellness and community here in our current location of  300sq ft. In February of 2018 we introduced out \"Sliding Scale Brunch\", encouraging people from all walks of life to test the waters of plant based food in an affordable manner. They are given the option to pay what they can, based on what they can afford. Our commitment to giving everyone the access to eating healthy is what drives us. It is also what drives our customers to continue communing with us. \n",
      "Sustaining our customer base and the rising volume of our orders in our current Bushwick location is causing the inevitable discomforts of growth which effects the customer experience and also makes it difficult for us to further evolve.\n",
      "We are evolving from the cramped space of our current \"Sol Sips Bevs and Bites\" location- where customers often bump shoulders in this 9-seat space. Our tiny and beautiful space has served as our restaurant/cafe hybrid for nearly two years, we've truly learned the power of \"working with what we've got\". At last, we'll be able to scale it back down to a cafe space where dinners can come in for a quick beverage and bite that can be accommodated with  the tools and resources we have here in the space. \n",
      "\"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" is a larger space that will provide more comfort to our dinners. We encourage our guests to stay for a while and take up space. We are excited to see people bring their friends and family along to enjoy great food, service and a good time! \n",

      "Article by Wilbert Cooper \n",
      "We've already invested a lot into our new space and we'll continue to work towards reaching our funding goals. We're confident that this Kickstarter will support us in opening \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" this fall. We are currently training a solid team of staff and working with an amazing architect to complete our design plan of a full-service dinning room, bar and stage. We've started collaborating with artists and musicians who are excited about curating residencies in the space that coincides with our dining experiences. We've even developed a unique and intentional menu that centers afro-indigenous and black southern cuisines with just plants- making most of our menu soy-free and gluten-free. \n",
      "Meeting our goal of $250,000 will enable us to: \n",
      "I've built Sol Sips from scratch- but not alone. Every step of the way I've been met with the support of my \"village\" of family, friends, mentors, community, organizations, allies and strangers. For this, I am grateful. \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" will reflect the power of gathering by providing vitality, love and innovation in every taste, scent, sight and sound. \n",
      "We look forward to sharing space and fellowship with you. \n",
      "Much Gratitude. \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "We're transparent in communicating the physical and mental demands that come with running a restaurant. It's no secret that a bigger space means that the responsibilities, expenses and maintenance will double. One of the biggest risks is not having the right team to divide the responsibilities amongst. We've experienced this in the past. We've been working from within our current team to build a better structure for operations, prep and service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another risk in opening \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" is the challenge that comes with running two locations. The structure and demands of our small cafe is being scaled down to accommodate a breakfast and brunch menu w/a fresh juices, coffee and tea in the early half of the day. Our full service location will be for lunch/dinner and nightlife service. Strategically having these locations open at different times will help with balancing out the managerial needs and maintenance of both spaces.\n",

      "I’m Greg, I’m the typical ‘’average italian’’ born and raised between football and tasty food. I spent most of my 20s locked in my room until, five years ago, I decided to give a twist to my life by changing completely my daily routine: sport and healthy food replaced videogames and junk food. It’s been a long time since I got over this negative part of my life and, today, I’m ready to live a better part of it and to put myself out there, focusing everything on healthy food.\n",
      "Cados was born, at least as a concept, circa a year ago; since then my idea has changed many times until becoming the actual one which shares the same aim as the original one, even though it’s a lot different: producing high quality avocado snacks and selling them at an affordable price. To do so I’m going to use an atypical internal politcs, that uses quality and a good price as it’s ONLY advertisement; I wanted, for the same reason, to limit as reasonably as possible the net gain on the finished product (keeping it around 5%) to promote an higher quality/price ratio. The products available at the launch of Cados will be 2:\n",
      "· AVOCADO CHIPS: simple avocado chips, ready to be devoured at any time.\n",
      "· AVOCUDDLE: the perfect synthesis between the classic potato chips bag and avocado.\n",
      "Despite having in mind 3 new types of snacks I believe, at the current state, that only these are suitable for marketing but it’s also possible that, until January 2020, on the official e-shop some of these could already be available. I want to be very trasparent so, below, I left you a short but complete list of how funds raised through this campaign will be used, with the relative percentages:\n",
      "· FIRST STOCK OF RAW MATERIALS (70%)\n",

      "· E-SHOP (15%)\n",

      "Those maked with * are additional costs that I consider useful to make the product more attractive and/or to further reduce the price but that I didn’t include in the requested amount and which I would take care just if it were exceeded.\n",
      "I would personally thank whoever decided to believe in my project but, for obvious reason, I can’t do that; i do want to let you know that your support was very important to me, and this is the reason why I wanted to divide the rewards in 3 levels in order to include as many people as possible:\n",
      "· HIGH FIVE (5+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 5% discount.\n",
      "· TASTE TEST (50+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 10% discount + 1x Avocado chips + 1x Avocuddle.\n",
      "· AVOCADO LOVER (100+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 15% discount + 1x Avocado chips + 1x Avocuddle + 1x Special Gratefull Avocado.\n",

      "We are two humans who met at the perfect time and since the day we met we have done nothing but grow stronger as individuals and even stronger as a unit.\n",
      "We are Hayley 32 years of age and Joakim 31 years of age and we recently moved a little deeper, but not deep enough into the woods in the centre of Sweden.\n",
      "We met over a shared interest of psychedelics and especially the healing benifits that they have on human beings, we were both very responsible users, something we bonded over and we both have \"magic mushrooms\" to thank for curing f.ex severe migrane and psychedelics in general have helped us both grow a lot.\n",
      "We wanted to show our growth in some way, we wanted to show how the whole world could benefit from the responsible use of psychedelics. So we started with our project \"Hippy Spirit Clothing\" 2.5 years ago and we have slowly watched it grow into something we are very proud of, and we have grown along with Hippy Spirit, a lot as well.\n",
      "The idea for Vegan EVERYTHING came, just like with our clothing brand, from us and the way we choose to live.\n",
      "Today our conscious green eating makes us both feel amazing and cooking and experimenting with food has been a passion since early teenage years, and has become even more fun since turning vegan! :)\n",
      "Healthy, good tasting vegan food is exensive if you eat out today and it seems like everyone wants to put a \"healthy-tax\" on everything and it is really not fair for the ones who really cares about what they eat and needs something quick on the go.\n",
      "We want to change that.\n",
      "We will sell something that we are surprised that we have never seen any food truck our fast food place sell in Sweden and the thing is, we really dont want to say it yet, because we fear someone with the money to start tomorrow will come in and do this before us, this is how much we believe in this idea.\n",
      "As we go we will add a lot, like green smoothies, smoothie bowls, raw balls, avocado on toast, golden milk, chai tea, vegan ice-cream, the list can be made so long, jummy and healthy!\n",
      "Everything vegan of course!\n",
      "Vegan EVERYTHING is so much more than a food truck, it is more of a movement and together with the clothing we design and the music we produce and the art that we make we try in our little way to open up as many hearts and third-eyes as possible! :)\n",
      "And it all start with a healthy diet! You truly are what you eat! :)\n",
      "Chosing to work for yourself is hard, but once you are there it is out of the question to go back to work for someone else. No matter how hard it is, we will not give up!\n",
      "We work every single day to come up with new designs, new content, new music to increase sales to eventually pay for this huge addition to our lives, our Vegan EVERYTHING. food truck idea, but it is going way to slow and we are in the best time ever to start.\n",
      "We have come a long way planning all of this, but we are still basically on step one with all of this since we can not afford to buy the truck or the kitchen that it has to have inside, everything around the whole project is basically done, we have events to go to many places in Sweden, this is events we have spoken to as well as events who has contacted us. Many of these events do not have any vegan food at the moment, so we see a huge opportunity there, with well over 10.000 visitors on an average day. We also want to sell at bigger events in other countries in the summers, this is huge music events where we would fit in perfectly but stick out with our food! *and clothing*\n",
      "We are asking for help so that we have a chance to open up our business before someone else does it and we would hope to raise 200.000sek to make this dream come true. The cost of the van will be the biggest expence, then it might have to be re-built with ventilation and then it needs a working kitchen. Roughly counted this will cost somewhere between 150-200.000sek.\n",
      "We would be forever thankful if we would get help with this project, it is exactly what we are meant to do and we have such big plans for the future and we believe in this so extremely much, we are in the right time with everything and this is not just a job for us, this van will become a part of our lifestyle!\n",

      "There is risks and challenges with everything you decide to do, but if you never try then you will never know. Vegan food and healthy food is everywhere, but a vegan food truck serving the vegan food that we are going to serve is something we have not seen here and that is what we are so optimistic about!\n",

      "When I was in high school I was lucky enough to go on a trip to Rome, Florence, and Paris. To say that I had a blast would be an understatement, I got to eat new things, interact with people who didn't speak the same language, and see all of these places that were not only beyond beautiful but steeped in history. And that's what did it for me, how amazing everything looked. I still remember winding through these narrow shadowed cobbled streets in Florence that all of a sudden opened up into the Piazza della Signoria. The famous David and the Medici Bank where now towering over my  right shoulder, while a line of marble statues twisted and writhed to my left,  the Tuscan sun played off the stone of the Piazza and the water of Neptune's fountain, all the while the lure of \"Italy's best gelato\" called from across the square. From that moment on I knew I wanted to keep traveling, and when I decided to pursue art as a career, that I wanted to share my experiences through painting what I saw on my travels. \n",

Lastly head to Spain with stops in Barcelona, Albarracin, and Madrid. To keep costs down I would fly back home out of Porto, Portugal. \n",

Anyone who contributes to my campaign, and should it be funded, will be able to follow this blog and read more as soon as each post is published!

Also all artwork will be fully insured during shipping for full reimbursement to backers should it be lost or damaged and there is no possibility of replacement (ie. original artwork not prints). \n",

      "Though I've tried to plan my trip for the most suitable weather for outdoor painting, it is always possible that some days that might not be true. If the weather is not cooperating and I'm not able to paint outside I'll do my best to find a interior sheltered location in which to paint, or do an extra painting another day. But if I'm not able to complete all the plein air paintings purchased by backers while on the trip, then the remaining number of paintings will be completed in studio from photos once back home in the same style and size of their plein air counterparts and backers receiving these paintings will be notified of the change. \n",

      "It is very challenging to market art, and to try to sell a piece of your heart and soul to the world. Artists often feel forced to be a jack of all trades, while sometimes sacrificing our more personal artistic inspirations. I've learned throughout the years that the business side of the art world is a vital aspect, and unfortunately the creative side is another entirely. I've also learned, that I am not good at doing both simultaneously, which has led me to this idea of going public with a plea for help.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "English below\n",
      "Jag har en vision om att starta och driva en verksamhet med fokus på hållbarhet, mänskliga möten och en levande förort. Jag vill skapa en lugn kafémiljö som är ett bra alternativ för de som vill arbeta hemifrån men ändå vill lämna hemmet. Ett ställe där du kan möta likasinnade, knyta nya kontakter och skapa samarbeten. \n",
      "Utöver den dagliga verksamheten med mat och kafé kommer vi ordna evenemang med fokus på kultur, skapande och hantverk, både själva och i samarbete med andra organisationer, allt i syfte att skapa en mer levande förort. \n",
      "Bakgrund\n",
      "Idéen om att starta ett veganskt coffice i en av Stockholms förorter föddes från början av en stammis på ett trevligt vegankafé i närheten. Idén vandrade sedan vidare och hamnade så småningom hos mig. Jag har behållt grundtanken men låtit idén växa åt sitt eget håll. \n",
      "Jag fick tag på en fantastisk lokal i Bandhagen. En lokal med historia och liv. Min vision är nu att ta tillvara på lokalen och skapa en kreativ mötesplats och på så sätt också vara med att skapa en levande förort. \n",
      "Från början var tanken att det skulle vara ett coffice, alltså ett ställe dit människor går för att arbeta där det samtidigt finns möjlighet att få sig kaffe och kanske en bit mat. Jag upplever att platsen jag vill skapa är mer än så. Platsen ska leva och det ska inte kosta något att sitta där. Jag vill dock fortfarande behålla tanken att det ska vara en plats en går till för att arbeta. \n",
      "Kortfattat kan en säga att jag vill skapa en blandning av ett coffice och ett kafé. \n",
      "Vilka är vi? \n",
      "Jag som fick idéen av en stammis på ett vegankafé heter Nina och är även jag stammis på samma vegankafé. Jag älskar djur, äter helst av allt frukt och pluggar stickning på folkhögskola. \n",
      "Någonstans längs den här resan hittade jag Zaphira som nu är med och hjälper till att starta upp verksamheten. Hon bidrar med tankar, idéer och en massa positiv energi. Zaphira är från början vän till en vän som sedan har blivit även min vän. Hon är en färgglad person som älskar katter och brinner för jämställdhet. \n",
      "Vad erbjuder vi? \n",
      "Vi erbjuder en lugn och kreativ miljö för dig som vill komma hemifrån men inte åka in till stan. Vi erbjuder kaffe, fika och luncher på plats i kaféet och vi kommer även att erbjuda frukostpaket, mellanmål och picknickkorgar som take away för dig som har vägarna förbi. \n",
      "\n",
      " Det finns även möjlighet att hyra konferensrum (under våra öppettider) samt hela lokalen (när kaféet är stängt). \n",
      "När och hur ?\n",
      "Om allt går som vi hoppas, får vi tillgång till lokalen den 1/8. Därefter behövs renovering, uppfräshning och städning innan vi förhoppningsvis kan slå upp dörrarna den 9/9. \n",
      "Vad behöver vi pengarna till? \n",
      "Vi behöver pengar för renovering. Vi behöver köpa kylskåp, frysar, ugn, diskmaskin och någon form av spis eller spisplatta. Vi behöver även en rörmokare som kan dra om vattenledningar och installera en diskmaskin. Vi kommer eventuellt även att behöva en elektriker. \n",
      "Vi tror på tillsammansskap\n",
      "Den är idéen har växt fram tillsammans med människor i vår omgivning. Den har formats och växt sig större i mötet med andra människor och deras idéer. Vi vill låta växandet fortsätta och se vad idéen blir som verklighet. \n",
      "Maten \n",
      "Vi gillar smaker. Många olika sorters smaker och gärna från världens alla hörn. Vår plan är att catera lunchen från vårt favoritvegankök. Frukost, fika och mellanmål fixar vi själva. Vi kommer att laga mat efter säsong och göra det vi kan för att minska matsvinnet. \n",
      "Hos oss kommer all mat och dryck vara växtbaserad men våra gäster är välkomna oavsett vilken kost de äter. Vi äter båda växtbaserat och brinner för såväl djurrätt samt miljö så för oss kändes valet givet. Vi gillar att experimentera med smak och konsistens och att utmana föreställningen om hur vegansk mat ska vara. Även fyrbenta gäster är varmt välkomna.\n",
      "English\n",
      "It all started when one of the other regulars at my favorite café had an idea to open a coffice in the neighbourhood. We discussed the idea, and I was thrilled about it. Pretty soon, I got the blessing to take the idea and run with it. Through meetings and input from friends and enthusiasts, the whole thing grew into something bigger.\n",
      "I then found a fantastic place in Bandhagen, south of Stockholm. My vision is to continue to develop the original idea and together with other people make this a venue for creation, our contribution to make this an even more alive neighbourhood.\n",
      "In short, I would like to create something in between a café and a coffice. A place that is calm and encourages you to be creative and a possibility to connect with people nearby. \n",
      "Who are we?  \n",
      "I am Nina, the founder of this business. I love animals, prefer to eat fruits and I am studying knitting at a Folkhögskola. \n",
      "Zaphira is a friend of mine and somewhere along the line she got involved. She is a colourful person with a lot of energy who loves cats and is passionate about equality. Zaphira contributes with thoughts, ideas and a lot of positive energy and is now an important person for the startup. \n",
      "What do we want? \n",
      "Create a plant based café with a peaceful atmosphere perfect for those who want to work outside the office but still want to leave the house. A place where you could make new contacts and find nice people to cooperate with. We will also offer breakfast, snacks and picnic baskets to take away for those of you who just pass by. \n",
      "Beyond the daily business with food and coffee we will also arrange events with focus on culture, creating and craftsmanship, both on our own and together with different organisations, all with the purpose to contribute to a living suburb.\n",
      "It's also possible to rent our conference room (during opening hours) or the whole place (when the cafe is closed). \n",
      "When and how? \n",
      "We will access the place on the first of August. There are renovations that has to be done, along with some cleaning and freshening things up before we can open the doors on the ninth of september (hopefully). \n",
      "The money? \n",
      "We need money to renovate the place. We need to buy refrigerators, freezers, dishwasher, an oven and a stove. We also need to hire a plumber and probably also an electrician. \n",
      "We believe in creating together \n",
      "This idea has grown and developed thanks to the ideas and creativity from people around us. We want this project to grow further and are looking forward to see it in action.  \n",
      "The food \n",
      "We like a lot of different tastes from all over the world. We plan to cater lunch from our favourite vegan kitchen but will make breakfast, fika and snacks ourselves. We will adjust the food according to season and do our best to not let any food go to waste. \n",
      "We both eat plant based food and are passionate about animals and the environment so it all felt obvious. All of our food and drinks will be plant based but our customers are welcome regardless their own food preferences.  We like to experiment with taste and texture and to challenge the picture of what vegan food should be. Even guests on four legs is warmly welcome! \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Vi ska starta upp en helt ny verksamhet som är beroende av att människor gillar det vi skapar och kommer att stötta oss när vi väl har öppnat. Vi har mycket renovering att göra och vi vet inte exakt vad det kommer kosta i nuläget. Vi tror på den här idén och på att vi tillsammans kan lösa de situationer som kan komma att uppstå.\n",

      "Hello, we are The Odd Folk, a quintet of ramshackle musicians from the far west of Cornwall (although our drummers a Grimsby man with Cornish adoption pending!) We play folk music and we have always been a little odd. We use ironing boards as keyboard stands, branches as mic stands and all pile into an old Renault 4 and drive around the country playing music and getting lost. We're been carrying our debut album, The Sweet Release, around with us for the last couple of years and as well as most of our friends and fans having a copy we're actually running very low on stock! We've long been scratching our heads on how on earth we were going to fund another 'baby' when we stumbled on this sweet medium! We're so pleased to be able to offer rewards to our fans as a way of saying thank you, and all of the prizes will be created with as much love as we can muster.We are really honoured to be able to work with Andy Bell, a sound engineer with a CV as long as your leg; who's worked with many greats from the folk circuit including Bellowhead, Eliza Carthy and Seasick Steve to namedrop but a few! Being a mobile sound engineer ables him to travel wherever we want him, and so we're choosing Belan Hall, an old shooting lodge in the middle of Wales, where we sometimes go to rehearse and have creative lockdown.\n",
      "We will also be working closely with our designer, Mae Voogd, to make the album cover and all the posters and T-Shirts to go with it. She's drawn the band a number of times but one of the rewards is for you to join us on the launch poster as well as get your portrait drawn! All you'll have to do is submit a photo and you can hop onto the page with us.\n",
      "The T-Shirts will also be designed by Mae Voogd and for this reward you will need to submit your size preference and colour preference.\n",
      "The figure we are after is £5000, which seems like a lot of money but in reality is just about scraping the barrel. And no, we're not going to do a runner to The Caribbean! The list below will give you an idea of what we need and what's involved in making an album.\n",
      "The Sound Man - this is the main component, this includes all tracking, editing, mixing and producing of the album!\n",
      "The Duplication - this is the where we get numbers, for instance 1000 copies to be released.\n",
      "The Design - this involves all the album artwork, storyboarding the sleeves and booklets, and drawing up the posters.\n",

      "There is many risks and challenges ahead for us, most notably that we will fail to raise the required amount and the project fails. This is will be most unpleasant and will mean that all of the money raised thus far will be returned to it's lender as this is an all of nothing vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge we might face is that Belan Hall is under such heavy snow that we will not be able to get there. If this is the case we will scratch our stubble and agree on an equally creative (though less remote) place to record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge we could face is that we don't receive any bookings for festivals, which although unlikely, could happen, as at this stage we only have it in 'word' and not 'writing'. If this is the case and we fail to agree on any festivals the THE FESTIVAL prise will be refunded to the sum of £300 and the THE VIP will be offered as a makeweight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final challenge will be staying fit and healthy and creative, if for any reason a release date is pushed back we will give you ample warning and communicate throughout.\n",

      "For this movie, I've pulled inspiration from every corner of the horror genre, which I am a huge fan of! It would best be described as a haunted house/creature feature hybrid. I had someone describe it as an \"Americana nightmare\" and an \"electric circus\". Which I LOVE, and I think describes the film perfectly.\n",

The production was chugging along and we were getting amazing footage! Then, on the last day and a half of shooting, one of our key locations caught on fire just minutes before we arrived (thanks to the good ol' California drought). The best choice for our movie creatively, logistically, and safety-wise was to halt production.\n",

With her incredible dramatic abilities and attention to detail and nuance, Belland breathes an extra dimension of life and character into the extremely intense and demanding character.\n",

Pulling from movie monsters throughout the years, Corbin truly built this creature from the ground up. In the end, he delivers a performance quite unlike anything you've seen before.

      "Hello my name is James Carney, I am the writer and director of this short film. Being a person who enjoys video games but also an aspiring filmmaker I've always wanted to create fan films for my favorite games but those ideas never worked out. But with the recent launch of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 I decided to try again. The more specific reasoning behind this is I feel there aren't enough strong female characters represented in film and mainly want to focus on changing that and this game does fit with that sort of idea.\n",
      "For the story it’s a vague scenario revolving around Claire and Moira, purely based around all the narrative information included in the trailers out of respect for people who may not have played the game yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As for production cast(though at this point the leads have yet to be cast but there are a lot of interested volunteers so it's just a matter of choosing the right people) and crew are already on board with budget being all that’s left. The cost adds up to $1400 for all the necessities including: equipment, props and costuming. Hopefully this goal can be reached within a soon enough time.\n",
      "The overall scope aside from the focus is a creating a fun project that Resident Evil fans and others can enjoy and hopefully lead to enough interest that would allow me to work on other projects I’m very interested in making in the near future as part of my initial goal of creating media that shows strong, realistic and unexploited female characters.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Primarily everything is being planned by myself but there are some things that require speaking with and coordinating everyone involved will be a bit tough. This project is also a bit experimental as everything will be edited on tablets(i Pad) with a wide selection of interesting editing programs that create surprisingly great quality videos. Casting the actresses for Claire and Moira could also be challenging as they are iconic characters with a specific look but thankfully there are a few theatre student volunteers who are interested so it'll just be a matter of choosing the right people. Lastly there's finding the right location to film at that reasonably captures the look of the various environments within the game, but with enough research a place should be found.\n",

      "We've been super busy baking up delicious, vegan cupcakes from scratch.  In fact we've outgrown our shared kitchen space.  We are forever grateful to our friends at LaBelle Aurore in Niantic, CT for helping our fledgling business get off the ground, but it's time to move into our very own store! \"Dutch's\" will be filled with fresh baked treats and we will continue our made to order custom creations.\n",
      "We were very successful with our local farmer's markets last season, selling out most days. When not at the market, we continue to fill special orders weekly.  All thanks to our loyal customers. But, the one question we get asked the most is... \n",
      "\"When are you opening a store? \".  We understand that our customers want to be able to stop in whenever they feel like a quick treat.  With a location of our own we will have a chance to meet and interact with you all year long. We will continue to make all of our cupcakes from scratch in small batches to provide consistent quality with every order. We're building an inviting, trendy cafe, perfect for meeting up with friends and hanging out. A bigger kitchen and better equipment will allow us to start whipping up new and delicious creations for you to enjoy and we can also roll out our newest menu item...vegan MILKSHAKES!!  Hand crafted vegan shakes, made with vegan soft serve, dairy free milk and homemade syrups, sauces and toppings.\n",
      "Our mission at Dutch's has always been to expand and offer even more delicious and convenient vegan food option to our community and fill a gap in the current landscape. Vegan food is on the rise and this is not  a trend.  While some businesses are beginning to stock vegan offerings, they usually have only 1 or 2 options.  Dutch's currently has over 20 cupcake flavors on our menu.  With more space we can continue to experiment and bring you more fun treats. Now that we've shown people cupcakes can be sinfully indulgent without the use of animal products, we want to add the convenience of our very own store front.\n",
      "We love our community and we want to be a part of the evolution of food while helping you rethink what options are available to you.  Meeting people, talking and answering questions is what we live for.  The love and support we've received so far has been mind blowing and we cant wait to do more.  One of the main reasons Dutch's chooses a vegan lifestyle is to protect animals and the planet we share with them. While building our shop we are keeping that same mind set and utilizing eco-concious products for packaging and design. We want to contribute to the beautification of our neighborhoods and local communities.  With a little help from a lot of people, we can expand our brand to reach further.  We want you to feel good about what you eat.\n",
      "\"Honestly I cannot explain how amazing these cupcakes are!  Tiffany made us a special cupcake for my daughter vanilla cupcake, \"nutella\" filling and banana frosting.  I dont like vanilla cupcakes and i don't like banana flavor.  But I LOVEDDD these cupcakes.  I had to stop myself from eating all of my daughter's cupcakes.  We also had the triple chocolate peanut butter which was also amazing.  Do yourself a favor and trust Dutch's with all of your cupcake needs in the future you won't be disappointed!\" -Breanna Haskins\n",

      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "Every great business venture involves some risk.  I feel I am very well prepared because of my years of experience in the food service industry.  Everything from waitressing to cooking to bookkeeping.  I have over 20 years under my belt to handle the hustle and bustle of preparing and serving food.  I've utilized many resources to properly guide me on my journey to entrepreneurship.  Most invaluable has been my business advisor Matt from the CT Small Business Development Center (SBDC).  He has successfully assisted in the opening of over 50 food based businesses and his tutelage and guidance has been my greatest gift.  I believe slow and steady wins the race.  So my goal is to expand Dutch's without going \"too big, too soon\".  A consistent quality product is always my first priority.  My focus for successful business will be proper financial management, well developed marketing strategies, building a strong team, superior customer service and continuously looking for opportunities to improve.  Our biggest challenge will be attracting non vegan customers.  To overcome that challenge we plan to have as much face to face contact as possible.  I believe that most people are open to listen and try something new once even a small amount of trust is established.  If we can be on hand to answer questions about ingredients or preparation it will help them gain a better understanding and be less fearful of eating something new.  It only takes one bite to be hooked.\n",

      "This project is about a trip we want to make in February 2016 to island.  Our goal is to travel all around the island of Iceland to take pictures not only of the amazing landscape but mostly of the northern lights. \n",
      "Since the northern lights are our main goal, we chose to go there when the circumstance are best for northern lights photography. But to do this project we need your help! Our goal is to rent a save and good car that we are flexible to drive to the best spots at night. We have no chance with public transport; buses don't drive in winter and not even at night, and the spots we want to visit have never seen a bus before. This is why renting a car is crucial for our project.\n",

There is the risk that no northern lights will appear or that the weather will be so cloudy or foggy that even if there are northern lights, we won't see them. But this is why we go for 3 weeks to get a good chance of clear nights with hopefully lots of northern lights. Otherwise there are no risks just fun in the cold winter nights ;-)\n",

      "I've always been a big fan of multi page wall calendars... you know the ones that you turn over a page every new month and get a new image to look at for the next 30 days or so. I buy at least 3 every year for different rooms in my house.  And while we’re all pretty much forced to keep our schedules on our computers and phones, I like tangible objects, artifacts if you will. And I like that ritual turning of the page every month... and, of putting up the new calendars every year and taking down the old ones.\n",
      "And, I've always wanted to do a calendar of just my images. So I decided now's the time. I've designed the calendar: It's 12in X 12in square with a heavy cover, front and back. It will be saddle stitched, which just means it has staples in the fold (I've never really been a fan of the wire binding). I've found an awesome printer that will give me great turn around time. And I've selected twelve of my favorite fine art images from the last few years. \n",
      "I’ve created what I feel is a very simple and elegant calendar that will showcase the images and be an art artifact for your wall. Four of these images have been awarded prestigious prizes in two of the premier photography competitions in the world… the PX3 in Paris… and the International Photography Awards in the US.\n",

      "The biggest challenge will be getting all the calendars out to backers in time for the holidays. The funding period closes on the 8th of November and the printer has assured me that I can get an eight day turnaround on printing. With an estimated seven days to ship at the most, I'm looking to have the calendars by the 23rd or 24th of November. It'll be hectic, but I believe I can get them all shipped within two weeks. That means they're out my door two and half weeks before Christmas. If the response is so large that I need to hire help to make that happen, then I'll do that.\n",

      "I've always been into sci-fi and fantasy, but last year, largely thanks to Jeffro Johnson's Hugo nominated Appendix N Retrospective series, I found myself picking up a lot of the older, weirder and pulpier stuff.  I felt particularly inspired by authors like Leigh Brackett, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, and publications like Planet Stories.  \n",
      "I decided to launch a semi-pro zine to showcase pulse-pounding Sword & Planet and Heroic Fantasy fiction in the tradition of those classic pulp magazines. \n",

      "All that's left to do for issue 1 is fill some of the limited advertising space and get it into your hands as soon as possible! No T-shirts, no secret forums, no skype calls, conventions or parties, just what I can without a doubt put in your hands: a high quality sci-fi magazine.\n",
      "Issue 1 will have nearly 100 pages of pulse pounding SFF action!\n",
      "The first issue of Cirsova features the following line-up:\n",

      "Poetry\n",
      "Feature Column\n",
      "Cover Art\n",
      "Stretch Goal 1: $1,000\n",
      "I'll be able to pay for about half of the second issue without having to dip into out-of-pocket funds.  Meeting this goal means that around 100 people will get their hands on this amazing anthology.  There MAY be enough interest and buzz generated from folks who get to see it that Cirsova MIGHT take off as a sleeper mag to watch out for by mid 2016.     \n",
      "Stretch Goal 2: $5,000\n",
      "Begin work on a second issue sometime in 2016.\n",
      "Reaching $5,000 will mean that my expenses associated with issue 1's assemblage will be met.  Issue 1 has roughly $1k worth of already-paid-for top-notch content, and the rest of the cost is POD + S&H.  \n",
      " Seems silly that meeting my expenses would be a stretch goal, but I'd rather play it safe than bank on an explosive outpouring of pledges.  Because Cirsova Issue 1 is already paid for, I can put it out without needing to raise the extra funds to cover the costs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if I don't meet this stretch goal, there's a good chance I'll try to scrape together enough money for a second issue this year, because I've already got some AMAZING stories from authors who have said \"I'll hold onto this until you can get the next issue together.\"  I want to tell you all about them and how great they are, but I can't until I actually get the ball rolling on issue 2 and pay for the rights to them.\n",
      "Stretch Goal 3: $10,000\n",
      "Begin work on a second issue immediately.\n",
      "Now, $10,000 would be ideal, because that would mean that my poorly scrawled out calculations of content + mfg. + shipping costs turned out to be more or less right and I didn't completely screw up on calculating my per-issue price point (approx 1000 issues w $1 content cost per issue + approx $5 per issue pod allows for a per issue price comparable to the 'big' SFF mags).  Oh, it also means that I would be able to immediately begin soliciting stories for issue 2.\n",

      "Issue 2 will have interior artwork, for one thing!\n",
      "Notes on Shipping:\n",
      "I want to make this magazine available both as cheaply and widely as possible.  To do so, I needed to add variable shipping costs to pledge levels with rewards that can be shipped outside of the US.  Reward levels that are marked \"Only Ships to: United States\" have shipping costs factored in already.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Notes on Bulk Orders:\n",
      "US Domestic Media Mail rates are the primary reason why these bulk orders can be pledged for so cheaply.  The downside is that these prices must be exclusive to US customers.  If you are outside of the US and interested in bulk rates, please contact me directly and I will arrange for the best deal I can make you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Notes on Advertisements:\n",
      "Image Advertisements will appear in soft-cover print and pdf copies.  Depending on how well we can get the eBook version formatted, they may appear there as well, however this should be considered a \"bonus\" beyond the pledge goal based on its technical feasibility.  Interior advertisements may be in true black & white or in gray-scale.  Color images should be converted to gray-scale before submitting.\n",
      "Be advised that the Rear Cover advertisement is sized to accommodated a barcode rather than fit the page.\n",
      "Advertisement images should be 300 dpi, with the following measurements:\n",
      "Please have both text and graphic ads prepared for submission no later than one week after the end of the Kickstarter!\n",

      "Let me explain.  I intend to put out this high quality science fiction magazine regardless of what happens on this Kickstarter.  So, why am I Kickstarting?  Because I intend to use Kickstarter as an investment platform. By supporting this first issue of Cirsova, you are investing in the future of the magazine.  Proceeds from the Kickstarter will be used to fulfill orders and profits will be used to purchase stories for a second issue.\n",

      "From it's inception in 1993, Gearhead® Magazine has been unique in the world of automotive journalism. Focusing on the lifestyle, stories and culture surrounding car enthusiasts, especially those in love with muscle cars and hot rods, the magazine became the world’s go-to source on the combined influences of pop culture, music and clothing on car culture and vise versa. It is a celebration of the DIY spirit in all things hot rods and rock and roll. Now in it's 22nd year, Gearhead® Magazine is once again being published after a 5 year hiatus. Welcome to the relaunch of Gearhead!\n",
      "Pioneering a movement unheard of until the magazine bearing the name GEARHEAD was first published in May 1993, former editor Michael LaVella  masterminded and gave birth to a rebel child that would soon become the basis for a movement known as kustom kulture. Raising the banner of muscle cars and guitar crushing garage rock GEARHEAD MAGAZINE became infamous among those “in the know” as THEE tastemaker for all things hot rods and rock and roll. Kooks and weidos dug it, but so did the general public! Mention you read GEARHEAD, and you were instantly part of the cool kids' club! \n",
      "In 2000, the brand expanded to include the record label when Rev. Michelle became co-owner. Having met when both were writers for the critically acclaimed punk magazine Maximum Rock ‘n’ Roll, the two worked together to release over eighty records as well as create a line of clothing and accessories.  The team continued publication of the magazine, publishing one issue a year, with a goal to make it quarterly. \n",
      "Internationally recognized, the distinct logo and products associated with the brand were sold to over 50 countries. But all that hard work took it's toll. The team split up in 2006 with Michelle taking over the record label, and Mike taking back the magazine. \n",
      "The magazine went dormant in 2009 when LaVella stepped away from publishing to pursue other interests, but demand never died. A whole new generation of rock and roll and hot rod enthusiasts grew up reading about the legendary magazine, but could only find back issues to whet their appetite. \n",
      " In 2014 the magazine was once again returned to parent company Gearhead Productions, Inc., where owner Rev. Michelle Haunold now seeks to revive the much loved cooler than cool rag with the enthusiastic release of the long awaited issue Number Nineteen! \n",
      "When you pledge to support this project, you are funding the long-anticipated relaunch of Gearhead Magazine with issue #19. You are also helping to KEEP PRINT ALLIVE! Like the rest of the media world, physical products are going by the way side as it becomes cheaper to produce digitally. But nothing can replace the feel of a magazine in your hands, or the smell of a magazine as you flip through the pages. \n",
      "That love of the actual product fueled the resurgence of vinyl in the music industry, and I’m hoping to tap into a similar passion for people who love printed media. I do also plan to make Gearhead available digitally for the first time for those who favor this form of content with print on demand and digital download options! But honestly, holding an actual magazine in your hands feels great, so why not go old school? \n",
      "Once this project funds, (because I know it will!) and this first re-launch issue is published, my goal is to eventually get the magazine up to being printed 4 times a year. This has been a goal of mine since I first started working on the magazine back in 2000! I’d also like to expand coverage to a wider variety of topics, and stories, because there's so many great stories out there! Maybe it could even evolve into a podcast or TV show, you know? There's so much cool stuff out there to discover and share! I’d also love to be able to start paying writers, who right now submit projects voluntarily simply because they want to be part of GEARHEAD.\n",
      "The money being raised during this campaign will be used to print the physical magazine. It will cost about $3500 to cover the printing costs. Any extra money will be used to pay a professional design artist who will handle the lay out of the magazine and setting up the files for print. If there’s extra money after all that, it will go into the redesign of the GEARHEAD website where customers can shop online, subscribe, stay current on what’s going on with Gearhead and follow all our social media sites. \n",
      "I don't want to reveal too much since I don't want to spoil the surprise! But the new issue will be packed with cool stories not seen anywhere else and exclusive photos! Running about 80 pages, the magazine will feature a full-color cover with black and white book stock insides. It gives the magazine that vintage feel, much like the old school Hot Rod and Car Craft Magazines that were the original inspiration. It will be a limited edition run of 2500 printed copies, as well as available for digital download and print on demand. Among the articles you'll get a \"from the pits\" look at the annual Yolo County Demolition Derby, \n",
      "a behind the scenes look at the life of producer extraordinaire Kim Fowley, a short history of the custom car phenomenon from the '60s known as Zingers,\n",
      "and a chat with the creator of the wildly popular Lady Luck Tattoo Convention. Gearhead also sits down with Jake \"The Preacher\" Cavaliere, frontman for the long-running gear-grinding rock and roll band out of Los Angeles The Lords of Altamont.\n",
      " And finally, the last known interview with Famous Monsters of Filmland creator, Forrest J. Ackerman. \n",
      "There will also be lots of cool underground record reviews, movie and book reviews and lots more cool stuff for hep cats and kittens. \n",
      "Does any of this sound interesting or fun? Got yer mouth watering for these and other cool pics and stories ? Then please help me get the scratch together to bring this baby to print! \n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "There are many challenges with completing a project of this size. The main one is being able to pay a professional lay out artist to set up the magazine for printing. This is a very specific skill set and it doesn't come cheap!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge is getting all the content together. It takes a tremendous amount of time and creative energy to write the stories, take the photos and put the whole thing together in a cohesive whole. While I've written and published many articles for other magazines, I've never put a whole magazine together myself. The previous editor had years to figure this out and I was part of the team, but I have never been responsible for a magazine from start to finish, so I'm learning as I go. \n",
      "\n",
      "The final challenge; allowing enough time to actually create the content and production. I always think I'll be able to finish a project much faster than I actually do. As you can see from the above video, I originally expected to have this out by early summer. Here it is, late fall, and I'm finally done pulling all the articles and pictures together. I'm working with a lay out artist now to design the magazine, and by the time this campaign ends, I will finally be ready to go to print!\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything in this magazine has been done from scratch; there is no pre-made template where you just plug images in and voila, you have a magazine. I'm building it all from the ground up. Even finding a printer has been a challenge since so few places exist now that print in the style I want to print in! \n",

      "Hello Friends,\n",
      "My name is JR Renusson and in 2019 I will be opening up West Michigan's first All Vegan Food Truck: Faux.  Our mission is to reduce the world's dependency on animal products.  We will play a role in this by creating food that both vegans and non-vegans equally enjoy.  Faux will offer burgers, chick'n and fish sandwiches, grilled cheese, appetizers, along with shakes, cookies and more.  The entire menu will also be available gluten-free to insure that everyone is welcome.\n",
      "Having been vegan for over 10 years, it can sometimes be exhausting trying to find food that my wife and children will enjoy while also being vegan.  I've been working on this concept for a few years and I believe now is the time to let it loose.  Veganism has also been growing among all demographics as people are looking to either improve animal welfare, reduce their impact on the environment, and improve their health.\n",
      "Our end goal is to have Brick-and-Mortar Fauxs dotting the map all over the midwest but we will be starting with the humble food truck.  We need to raise approximately $50k to open up and are launching this campaign to hopefully get close to half that amount.  The money from this campaign will be used to purchase a used truck.  Then with our own funds along with some additional investments, we will outfit the truck with the necessary equipment, attain the required licenses and have enough working capital to launch in the Spring of 2019.\n",
      "I will use my passion for veganism, plus the knowledge I've gained through owning two vegan food businesses over the last 5 years, along with help from a seasoned restaurateur and other trusted advisors to bring Faux to fruition.  I have a culinary degree from the Secchia Institute.  I've created vegan menus for multiple restaurants and have created vegan product lines for national companies.  I have been preparing my other two vegan businesses (Bit Baking Co. and Cheeyeah) over the last year to be able to operate with minimal involvement from me so I can focus all of my attention on Faux this year and for the years to follow.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "1. I understand that restaurants face their fare share of challenges.  That is one of the reasons we are starting with a food truck.  This will allow us to introduce West Michigan to an all vegan dining experience, while running a lean operation and making data-driven decisions to ensure our success and growth.  Having a seasoned veteran of the industry on our team will help us avoid some of the common pitfalls of a food startup.\n",
      "2. The timeline could be pushed back as purchasing, outfitting and licensing a truck can sometimes take longer than planned.\n",
      "3. NASA says that thousands of meteors hit the ground every year so the chance of one of them hitting our truck is something that keeps us up at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you all so much for your continued support with my companies Bit Baking Co. and Cheeyeah and I look forward to sharing this amazing project (and food) with you! \n",

We currently offer a limited juice and smoothie menu to our customers, but we want to expand to offer healthy and natural food options. We have a passion for helping people get healthy through the power of food and nutrition as well as education. \n",
      "One of our goals is to create outreach programs partnering with our local school district to educate children so they understand the effects of practicing good and not so good eating habits. We will also offer workshops that are open to the public dealing with nutrition, health, environment, and personal well-being.\n",
      "We plan to operate with a low to no waste policy in which all of our operating materials will be reused or recycled. We will utilize solar panels, rain barrels, and composting facilities. I hope you watch the video to get an understanding of my vision, because when it comes to our personal health and the environment, the investment is invaluable.

      "This project, a month of art making in New Mexico, is about painting and drawing development. I have had many influential teachers over the years, and one of them was Donna Bruton. She told me that the most important piece of advice she could give was to paint every day. I was unfortunately never able to tell her before she died how much impact her education had on me.  \n",
      "This time will allow me to fully focus on creating paintings and drawings. The schedule that I have set has me completing one painting per day. I will be alternating between 3 different types of painting.  \n",
      "1. Observational painting, where I look directly at real things like plants, and paint them.   \n",
      "2. Fusion painting, a technique where I take source material from a book of smaller drawings that I have done in the past, and combine them into one painting.\n",
      "3. Abstract painting, where I use techniques of painting like gradients, and then spontaneously improvise in a jazzy style.  \n",
      "I will also be completing drawings in colored pencil. These are the smaller and faster counterpart to the larger and slower paintings. \n",
      "With your support, I will be able to have a full month to focus on working on these paintings, and developing painting technique and theory. \n",

With this project, I have a clear schedule of work and a definite number of paintings to finish, which corresponds to the days of the month of July: 31. It is always good for me to be working on something that I know I will be giving to someone for them to enjoy.\n",

      "My name is Kevin Boylan. I first studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) in Philadelphia as a Painting Major for two years. I discovered the  Florence Academy of Art (FAA) in my second year at PAFA and decided to continue my education there. I took a year off to work and saved everything to cover my first year in Florence studying at FAA. The next two years were spent going to school off and on while working to pay for the tuition when scholarships weren't enough. It's been a long hard road but I'm currently finishing my third and final year of FAA's program and expect to be back home in the states this summer.  \n",
      "The Hudson River School Fellowship\n",
      "For those of you not familiar with the Hudson River School Fellowship, it's an annual prize for young painters who pursue working from nature. It's modeled itself after the tradition of the Hudson River School (a 19th century romanticism American art movement). It's put together by The New York Grand Central Academy and takes a chosen handful of artists to experience three weeks of painting, lectures and talks by other artists. I've been accepted for this year's Fellowship. \n",
      "Why I need Kickstarter\n",
      "With help from FAA (The Florence Academy of Art) I've been able to complete my education, but not without serious sacrifices. I've received an excellent education but I've had to take time off to work and poured all my savings into finishing school. The Hudson River School Fellowship is a great way to mark the end of my schooling, get involved with artists from my home country and give me enough work to have my first show. \n",
      "The Fellowship has a small participation fee of $100 and the students are responsible for their own supplies and food. \n",
      "This is where Kickstarter comes in. If successful this project will allow me to attend The Hudson River School Fellowship, have the supplies to draw and paint everyday while there, help with transportation, buy groceries for meals, and put together a small show exhibiting work from school and the fellowship. \n",
      "Thank you for your interest and support in my aspirations. A lot of you have already supported me in my journey and education, even aside from this project, I just wanted to say thank you. \n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "After a decade in the outdoor industry as a ranger, educator, guide, and retailer, I am ready to launch a portfolio of outdoor goods that address the accessibility and sustainability needs of the outdoor industry. \n",
      "Since I was kid in scouts, I lusted over the top of the line backpacks, mess kits, and pocket knives, but growing up as a first generation POC, I didn't always have access to the best gear. As I replaced my aging, simple gear for new technical gear, something was missing. Working for a large retailer informed me about the ethics of the large companies pumping out gear, and exposed me to the waste of the increasingly fast seasonal refresh. I saw the serious enthusiasts and crusty dirt bags who designed all of the classic gear, responsible for opening the out doors for most of us, be replaced with the fashion industry's approach to manufacturing and design. \n",
      "Accessibility is an after thought, a point I had to confront recently as I tried to update my bike components and was looking at a price tag more than the bike was worth. Support me in filling out the empty bottom end of the outdoor industry with quality, affordable goods made in Minnesota by hand! \n",
      "I know, birds are so passé, but hear me out: icterids, or the blackbird family, are a great symbol of what I want my portfolio to represent: thoughtful tools built by and for those who exist on the fringes of the outdoor industry. I think of my operation as a form of brood parasitism: I am salvaging the excess material production of large companies to create gear for those looking for affordable gear. \n",
      "Let's face it, this is going to be a year of cutting back and looking for alternative solutions to daily problems, but don't let that keep you from using quality gear!\n",
      "Here's what I am doing and how you can help. I am setting out to create a line of simple and affordable backpacks and bags, among other experiments, that prioritize cost savings over bells and whistles. I will be using dead stock (material that is no longer wanted by the fashion/outdoor industry, sold at ~1/4 original cost) as the foundation of the line and sourcing quality notions ( hardware: buckles, thread, strapping, etc.) to incorporate serious functionality. The line will be made by hand in Duluth on my lovely Sailrite LSZ-1. \n",
      "Each design will prioritize functionality and relevance over flair and features, in other words just what you need and not what you don't. \n",
      "Current offerings:\n",
      "I'm weary of vapor ware, you should be too. This is why I am starting my funding request with small wallets and building the portfolio up slowly. One major aspect of preserving the value of my goal is keeping myself on track and producing rewards and designing the next offering in a timely fashion. I am a student of the lean, kanban, just-in-time models of production and will keep labor time down by streamlining specific runs of goods as they are funded. \n",
      "I have already made the initial investments in my business and have the materials and tools for the launch of this kickstarter, your contribution is funding the development of the next product in my line. My funding goal of $250+ will buy the necessary yardage and appointments to design and produce my next line: storage cubes and two backpacks. \n",
      "The biggest challenge for me as a designer is building a logical portfolio to bring to production. I have been brainstorming ideas for years, but I probably shouldn't launch that tent for river guides just yet! If this campaign is funded,  I will be able to launch a small range of gear organization cubes and one or two backpacks. Beyond that, I'd like to have a line of bike bags (panniers, handlebar, and basket bags) and share my knowledge and designs with the DIY community, after all, we are all beta-testers and the best gear is customized to our individual needs. \n",

I mean one backed with creative clout and steeped in roots/Americana sound alongside the best players in the business. Now, after 19 albums, I finally have that chance! \n",

Ken has been part of projects for Billy Joe Shaver, Steve Earle, Will Hoge and many others.  Needless to say, I was excited to get started! With the generosity of friends I have been able to record the first half of the album. It is going to be AMAZING! Guitarist Kenny Vaughan (Marty Stuart, Lucinda Williams, etc) joined the sessions along with bass player Dave Roe (Johnny Cash, Dwight Yoakum, John Mellencamp).

      "One project Impact is composed of large scale (44x65\") photos representative of the moment when birds collide with built structures. Many of the birds were found while walking in downtown Minneapolis or St.Paul for the Audubon's BirdSafe program during migration season. Birds are photographed intact and turned over to the Audubon society for collection and data entry.\n",
      "The second project DIY Bird Populator is a participatory exercise in rewilding and considering the consequences of loss. \n",

In 2018 it became obvious that the Valdez Glacier ice shelf was entering its end of life phase and I began to document its breakdown. What I thought would be an 6-10 year processes, quickly became a 2 year metamorphosis punctuated in a single cataclysm. On July 7, 2020, the over mile long Valdez Glacier ice shelf calved into thousands of pieces. This is the collection of photos from the first time I saw Valdez Glacier, through my years of guiding the ice shelf and glacier, to its demise.\n",

      "-------STORY--------\n",
      "Feminists have never hesitated to dissect and attack art whose misogyny offends and repulses us. But what happens when we fall in love with the work of a musician, writer, or painter we see as anti-female? Do we rationalize our cognitive dissonance away, turn our back on the offending artist, or find a way to embrace the film or story that moves us while acknowledging what disturbs us about it? How does our attraction to misogynist art complicate our relationship to both the artist and feminism itself?\n",
      "When we asked these questions earlier this year in our call for submissions for It's Complicated, we received an overwhelming response, both from contributors and those eager to see the project come to fruition. Although we originally intended to publish a single anthology of feminists' personal essays on loving misogynist art, it soon became clear that the potential subjects were endless and the range of approaches to them broad. Many writers told us they'd spent years thinking about their fraught relationship to a particular artist or work.\n",
      "In kicking off the project with a series of handmade, themed zines culled from the excellent submissions we received, we hope to start an ongoing cultural conversation about the uncomfortable yet influential role that misogynist art plays in our lives. Over the next several months, our plan is to expand It's Complicated into a book and create a website where even more contributors can publish their writing and readers are invited to participate in discussions on the topic. The money we raise from this Kickstarter will fund the creation of two limited-edition zines: Totally Crushed Out, themed around the writers' teenage love of a problematic artist, and Identity Crisis, focused on contributors whose appreciation for a certain artist leaves them torn between their feminist values and some other aspect of their identity.\n",
      "To design the zines, we are working together with Birds of Lace, a small feminist literary publisher. After they are designed, the zines will be printed by the DIY-minded printer 1984 Printing using quality materials. \n",

      "Project Goal\n",
      "I am excited to inform you, that I am launching the crowdfunding campaign to support my sixtcoming book, to be released in December 2019, in partnership with Escourbiac publication house.\n",
      "My photographic project is about documenting the Faroe islands archipelago - the green jewels in the North Atlantic !\n",
      "The goal is to publish a Coffee Table Book about the nature and lifestyle found in the Faroe islands.\n",
      "I intend to print a hardcover version. The book will contain approximately 120 pages and the size format of 22x26 cm.\n",
      "I wish to share my images in the book with the public, to show the unique Faroe islands never seen before : its people, its exotic life forms and the harsh beauty of the landscape. Also, I wish to raise awareness of the risk of vanishing cultural heritages in the islands, like collecting bird eggs, raising faroe horses, agriculture and fishing traditions etc.\n",
      "Many people don’t even know where the Faroe islands lies and the destination is still quite unknown for many travellers.\n",
      "As part of the project, I will hold photographic exhibitions at various locations around the world. \n",
      "I expect the first exhibition to be shown in Paris, France in early 2020 and further on in Copenhagen, Denmark as part of a campaign promoting tourism to the Faroe islands.\n",
      "Supporting the project\n",
      "My Kickstarter backers have the option of receiving a fine art quality print of one image in the book or, a limited edition Coffee Table Book. \n",
      "Another option for the Kickstarter backers is to choose among various pictures on my website martinjohansen.com/gallery and order a print of 35 euros, in order to support my work and book project.\n",
      "My Background\n",
      "My name’s Martin N. Johansen, I’m originally from Denmark. My passion for the great outdoors and wildlife led me to become a nature photographer. For the past 28 years, I have specialising in photographing landscapes and animals around the world, on every continent, from New Zealand to Antarctica, France to Yemen.\n",
      "My photographs have appeared in many publications and have also been exhibited both in Europe and in the United States.\n",
      "Beside exploring the wild areas of Greenland and Iceland, I have been travelling widely in the Faroe Islands since 2008. Over the years, I've been adding many images to my archive. Recently, I collaborated with both danish, german and french magazines and published my articles and photo stories about the Faroe islands.\n",
      "What will my project involve ?\n",
      "My project have already involved lots of time and energy - more than 10 years and numerous trips to the Faroe islands. \n",
      "I expect to finish the final pictures end of october. I will then start editing and work on the lay-out of the book in collaboration with a graphic designer. Additionally, I will be adding illustrations in the book and expect to complete the final lay-out and illustrations early or mid-novembre, 2019.\n",
      "-------RISKS--------\n",
      "My book project about the Faroe Islands is still a work in progress. \n",
      "I expect to return to the Faroe islands in september and october 2019, in order to photograph some last subjects for my book. \n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, I will begin to do picture selections and edit the text for the book. This process takes time and might involve delays. However, I wish to have the book published in december 2019.\n",
      "Photo books are expensive to print and a minimum of 500 copies are required to order. Otherwise, the unit price will become too expensive. \n",
      "In other words, it is a 'Limited edition print' and my Kickstarter backers will have priority and a signed copy of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other challenges with self-publishing will be marketing. Since I have no distributors, I will have to promote the book on the internet. Also, I will take personal contacts with selected book stores in order to have presentation. Additionally, I will of course present the book and do signing during my exhibitions.\n",

      "Hi! My name is Sarah and I’m a wife, mother and Disney fanatic living in the SE of England. In the past 18 months I’ve got into the Disney pin scene, building up great relationships with traders and sellers alike. \n",
      "Last year, I decided to dabble with creating my very own pin and after a tentative start, it sold out within a matter of months leaving me chomping at the bit to release another.\n",
      "I enjoyed the entire process, from spending hours creating and tweaking the design to get it just right, (waiting for the physical product was excrutiating though as I’m so impatient,) managing and setting up my own online shops, promoting and finally, packaging them up and sending them off to their new homes. I loved reading the positive feedback (all of which can be found on my Spookyloupins Etsy page) and seeing the tags on Instagram.\n",
      "Marie seemed like the perfect choice as the starter, for what I hope will become a mini series featuring several other Disney cats, because she is absolutely adorable (and sassy.) The addition of the daisies is a personal nod to my favourite film ’Alice in Wonderland.’ I wanted something playful and fun.\n",

      "To minimise any issue, first and foremost, I will always communicate. If there is a delay, I will be as transparent as possible and I’m always on social media so can answer any queries you may have.\n",
      "I will use the same manufacturing company as I have done previously and found them to be extremely good. They are based in the uk and send me all proofs for me to go through before it gets sent to China to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "This product will not be funded unless the target is reached and while the target may seem high, it is to cover all costs (not only manufacturing) but envelopes, postage and backing cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "All pins will be sent secured to its individual backing card, wrapped in bubble wrap and then placed inside a bubble wrapped Jiffy bag to minimise any damage that could occur. These will then be sent first class signed for.\n",

      "Finally, at present, the Coronovirus is making a dent in China’s ability to work. The UK manufacturer hasn’t highlighted any issues with production but it is worth noting.\n",

      "She would get green peppers, onions, cilantro and quite a few other vegetables and herbs to make her sofrito.\n",
      "My mother was the oldest daughter and third oldest of ten siblings. She had allot to do with the raising of the younger siblings. She grew up in Ponce Puerto Rico, the south side of the island. Her family, very poor. She learned at a very young age to cook utilizing local harvested ingredients as well as herbs from her mothers garden and had a passion for it.\n",
      "Upon returning from the market, she would place all her vegetables and herbs on the kitchen table and start separating them.  I remember as if it was yesterday the essence of the aroma of the fresh herbs. The table covered, I could not see the tabletop.\n",
      "You see, her sofrito was so award winning with friends and family, she would make bulk amounts to share it with everyone.\n",
      "My mother  passed away a few years back and my father passed a couple of years after her. When my brother and I went to their home to clean it out, The first thing  I new I wanted to find was mama’s recipe box.  After reading some of her recipes i came across her \"SOFRITO\" recipe.  It was then that  after all these years of following what I thought was her recipe (she had three different recipes), I was missing a couple of key ingredients. So, I went to the market, bought all the things on her list (for all three different recipes). Came home, made the recipes and I was overwhelmed at the difference in taste. I now understand how she would use one of the three with different dishes she would prepare.\n",
      "I have partnered up with one of New York’s finest executive chefs, Chef Jim Donahue, who is also my husband. Chef Jim was so impressed with my mother’s sofrito; we began to come up with recipes for other products, So you will have to stay tuned in.\n",

In the last couple of years we've been selling our sofrito from home, farmers markets and on ebay. \n",

Since we make our sofrito without preservatives, we know that with an amazing sales and marketing team and plan, we will approach with confidence potential markets. A couple of the markets we will approach with our sofrito are, Wholefoods, Trader Joes (these stores do not sell sofrito).

      "A bit about why I want to make this album...\n",
      "I've been writing and performing these songs for the past two years now, and after every performance, I get asked, \"Where can I download your music?\" And I never have a good answer. The songs are about telling stories and talking to the people listening. Shared experiences and personal relationships. I've tried to sit down and do simple recordings on my own, but I was never satisfied with the outcome, mostly because it lacked human connection and the songs seemed to pale in comparison to live performance.\n",
      "But. At the beginning of this year, I decided that I wanted to do something bigger with my music. Something more than one night at a bar or theater. Something that I could give to people, because ultimately that's what it is, a gift. A bit of myself that I want to share with anyone that's willing to listen, because I have a feeling that the listener will relate. So I needed to figure out how the music could translate from live performance to simply audio, because those are two very different things.\n",
      "One night at a dive bar in the east village, my friend Lorenzo Wolff convinced me to let him produce my album. (it didn't take a ton of convincing...) Through his studio, Restoration Sound, I'll have the opportunity to work with other musicians, who will help me create a fuller sound, and engineers, who will mix and blend the sounds so that there is balance. It will be my songs heard in a way that has only ever existed in my head, where they are always much bigger and more complicated, even though in reality they are just little things.\n",
      "It is going to take so much work. And time. And talent. Which is why I need to raise money. Work, time, and talent should be compensated. The money raised will go to pay the musicians that play on the album, and the engineers that put such meticulous work in finding that perfect mix. It will pay for studio time and for the time that Lorenzo puts into crafting other instrumentals and gorgeous harmonies to accompany me. It will pay the artist who creates the album cover and then the press that actually prints the album itself. The money you give will buy the meal I feed the musicians as we go into a twelve hour day of recording, because dear me, they need to eat.\n",
      "You see why I need your help? The amount that I am asking for is the bare minimum required. If we raise more than that, that means the album will be that much better. If a song desperately needs a harp, that extra money will pay for that harpist.\n",
      "So please empty your pockets into this kickstarter. And please tell your friends about it. I promise they'll want to hear the music. I don't know much, but I do know that it is good.\n",

      "The biggest challenge for me was finding the right producer. And I've already found the perfect guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lorenzo and I did a practice run with my song, Crosby Street, and he nailed it. He wrote parts for a guitar, banjo, bass, keys, even back up harmonies for me to sing for myself. He heard the music I wrote and then he heard the possibility that lies within it. And the best part is that he then knew how to execute it. He knows the best people to work with. And my favorite part is that he knows me. He knows how to push and challenge me to stretch my talents to create something that's better than I could have imagined. \n",

You also may have heard some of my original songs and tunes on past albums with the Avant Gardeners band and my own previous solo recordings, such as No Gravity.  Having just moved to Asheville, NC, and passed through unexpected life changes, i find that my songwriting has sprouted new wings and I'm so excited to be in the studio recording them with my favorite musical partners, the hyper talented guitarist, Bert Carlson, world class percussionist Loren Oppenheimer, and everyone's favorite bass player, Ralph Gordon, with guest appearances by Dave Bartley on mando and guitar and George Paul on keys.  This project swept me away at a time when funds are quite limited, so I'm asking friends and the dance and music community I'm lucky to be a part of, to help me out with this kickstarter campaign. By basically pre-ordering your copy of the CD, I'll be able to complete the project this summer and hopefully have a recording for you this fall.  There are also some other great rewards, so check it out. All the new songs are written and some already recorded, but there is much left to do! Not to mention, that new songs keep cropping up!!  I'll be posting some links on facebook for you to listen to the new songs, so watch for that!  I'm so grateful to be part of the folk music and contra dance communities and I welcome your support in this effort.\n",

It’s also referred to as the ‘freelancer economy,’ ‘agile workforce,’ ‘sharing economy,’ or ‘independent workforce.’ You might think it’s a buzzword, and you’d be right, but the widespread growth of startups supporting the gig economy (and the number of workers leveraging them) are a sure indication that the nature of work as we know it is changing.  The freelancer economy (or freelance economy) differs from traditional employment in that jobs are not permanent, but more specifically, the term relates to many one-off tasks or individual shift assignments. However, the term may also be used to reference longer-term freelance arrangements and independent contracting assignments.” \n",

During our first studio experience, we tracked three songs a day, and then took another day to do vocals on those three tracks. And then it costs the same amount to complete all of the post-production work with engineers to mix, and then subsequently master the album. When mixing for an album, it takes even longer than tracking. \n",

Years go by like they do, and people lose track of old friends and as such I lost track of Chuck. In recent years the advent of social media has allowed many of us to re-connect with old friends and relatives we thought we'd never see again and so once I joined Facebook I set out to find all my old classmates of Arundel Sr. High School Class of 1980.

It took me a while to even comprehend the circumstances of his death and to this day I still can't understand it....

To assist the Michigan Wildlife Conservancy in their efforts, I will be donating 10% of the proceeds from the photo book, after its published, to help ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy the outdoors. \n",

If you're fast enough to snag an Early Bird tier, you'll be getting a single pin for just $11- that's $4 cheaper than retail price! Standard tiers are still discounted at $13 per pin. All leftover pins will be sold in my shop for $15 each.\n",

      "All of the current Day and Night pins will be hard enamel, gold plated, with two back posts for double security. These will be heftyboy pins spanning 2.25\" across!\n",
      "As these are Day and Night sets, the pins are designed to be worn in pairs of 2 (as shown below). I've designed them to fit together in any combination, so you can wear a day and night set of one kingdom, or mix n match your own pairs!\n",
      "Now let’s take a look at the designs!\n",
      "In addition to the Day and Night pins, I've also included my snail mini pins in the campaign. At 0.75\" across, these super tiny, kinda rude pins are the perfect size for discreet middle fingers (and they're great as board fillers, too)! For the Kickstarter only, these snails will be $5 each (retail price $7) and available in 6 colors: pink, blue, yellow, purple, green, and LICH (glow in the dark). Please add $5 per snail to your pledge and in the survey after the campaign, you'll be able to select which color(s) you'd like.\n",
      "At any time during the campaign, you can adjust your pledge higher or lower. Remember: you won't be charged until the Kickstarter ends on Sat 1/25 at 11:59 PST.\n",
      "For early bird backers: please manually add +$11 per pin to your current pledge.\n",
      "For standard tier backers (non-early bird): no math required! Simply select the new tier and Kickstarter will automatically adjust your pledge accordingly.\n",
      "To add a tiny snail pin: for both early bird and standard tier backers, please manually add +$5 per snail to your current pledge.\n",

Each bar is made with 10 or fewer ingredients, which even your kids can pronounce and understand. The base of the snack bar features organic, gluten-free oats, organic chia and flax seeds, and organic maple syrup. Next, we add slightly toasted nuts, organic and un-sulfured dried fruits, and maybe some vegan, fair-trade dark chocolate or organic coconut, depending on the flavor. And unlike other bars on the market, Naked Hippie bars contain absolutely no soy, no gums, and no ingredients labeled “natural flavors.” \n",
      "Naked Hippie bars have gone through over two years of experimentation and taste-testing to ensure that they are not only more flavorful than any other bar, but also offer more balanced nutrition. Each ingredient is hand-picked for its health benefits, even our sweeteners. Here are our stats: each 52g bar has 250 calories or less, 6g of fiber, 6g of protein, at least 1600mg of Omega-3, 12g of sugar from organic maple syrup and dried fruits. \n",

      "\"I absolutely loooove your bars! I tried one a couple of days ago at Romancing the Bean and I've been obsessed ever since! *heart eyes emoji*\"-Rebecca S.\n",
      "\"These bars are so good, I ate them all.\"-Jenna T.\n",
      "\"It’s crazy! I’ve come to realize I’m addicted to these bars. If somehow I get too distracted and don’t have one when I should…I suddenly crave it and have to reorganize my priorities!!!! They taste good and ARE good.\"-Terry G.\n",
      "\"I LOVE these bars! I was given the opportunity to try the bars with the drizzled chocolate on them and felt my chocolate craving satiated. The fact there are no flour products whatsoever in any of the Naked Hippie Snacks makes them a perfect choice for those who need to be gluten-free in their lives. I’m a chocolate lover with a massive sweet tooth and all the snacks take care of my cravings, yet are so much more healthy than a candy bar or cookie! Awesome job!\"-Kathy A.\n",
      "\"These are amazing for protein bars, The texture is good, and the flavor is perfect to me. So many protein bars have a heavy flavor or are sweet, this one avoids both. I never thought I would find a protein bar I liked.\"-Sheryl H.\n",
      " \n",
      "Chia seeds\n",
      "Containing a larger amount of omega-3 fatty acids than salmon, chia seeds are also very high in fiber (40% fiber by weight) and contain up to 14% protein by weight. They are high in antioxidants and studies have found that they may improve cardiovascular risk factors in Type 2 diabetes. \n",
      "Hemp seeds\n",
      "Considered the most nutritious seed in the world, hemp seeds are a complete protein with a highly concentrated balance of protein, essential Omega-3 and 6 fatty acids, and vitamins and minerals such as Magnesium, Vitamin E and Zinc.\n",
      "Flaxseeds\n",
      "A tablespoon of flaxseeds contains 1800 mg of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, an ingredient needed to carry out normal bodily functions. The daily consumption of flax may also play a role in preventing diabetes and lowering the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. \n",
      "Oats\n",
      "Organic, gluten-free oatmeal is unprocessed, high in fiber and rich in protein.  Among its benefits are the stabilization of blood sugar levels to gently pace your body’s nutrition absorption rate and the removal of bad cholesterol. \n",
      "Almonds\n",
      "A single serving of almonds has nearly 50% of your daily recommended Vitamin E intake. This vitamin has been shown to reduce the risks of cancer. \n",
      "Maple syrup\n",
      "In addition to being incredibly delicious and vegan, organic maple syrup has recently been discovered as a super food, much like broccoli and blueberries. Research from the University of Rhode Island has found that maple syrup contains compounds that may help manage Type 2 diabetes, prevent cancer and reduce inflammation. The 54 compounds in maple syrup all work together to create a natural sweetener that inhibits enzymes from converting carbohydrates to sugar and provides the body with essential vitamins and minerals including zinc, manganese, B2, biotin, calcium, Vitamin A, and many more. \n",
      " \n",
      "According to the Harvard School of Public Health, Omega-3 and Omega-6 are essential fatty acids, meaning they are required by our bodies to carry out vital functions, like building cell membranes in the brain and keeping bones strong. The problem in the Western diet is two-fold: we don’t get nearly enough Omega-3 fatty acids as we need and we consume way too much Omega-6 in the form of soybean and corn oils found in many fast food and overly processed foods. Human bodies require no more than 4 times as much Omega-6 as Omega-3 fatty acids, but our current diets are filled with over 40 times as much.  Naked Hippie bars contain a 1:2 ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6, that when paired with a more balanced daily diet, closes the gap between the two. \n",
      " \n",
      "For the past two years, Naked Hippie Snacks has been operating as a Cottage Food Kitchen business, meaning that we make the bars out of our home kitchen. Under the Cottage Food Act, we can only sell in Los Angeles County. We have been successful locally, selling out at coffee shops, grocery stores and artisan food fairs. Everyone who tastes these bars absolutely loves them. \n",
      "While producing these bars at home and selling them in LA has been a great way to start out and gauge people's interest, it has been difficult to earn the capital we need to expand to a commercial kitchen. We want to produce in a commercial kitchen so we can ship nationally and share our healthy and delicious snacks with everyone. \n",
      "The funds we receive through this campaign will go toward three aspects of the business. It will fund rent and staff at our own commercial kitchen, the purchase of specialty, medium-scale equipment for production and packaging, and promotional materials and efforts such as distribution, trade shows, marketing and sales staff. Rather than sharing a kitchen with other producers, we would like to produce out of our own commercial kitchen so we can control and prevent contaminants such as animal products, gluten, soy, etc.\n",
      "Start the year off right with healthy, vegan snacks! If your New Year Resolution is to eat healthy, our bars will help you stay on track.\n",
      "Some of our rewards include a custom-designed Naked Hippie Snacks T-shirt. JUST BECAUSE OUR SNACKS ARE NAKED DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD BE! Cover up your naughty bits with our T-shirt that's fun, fresh and vintage-inspired. Here's a little peek at what it looks like:\n",

      "Because we have been running this business for over two years, we already have much of the infrastructure in place and are prepared to meet and overcome any obstacles we face. \n",
      "\n",
      "The designs for our packaging are complete and ready to be ordered as soon as funds become available. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will need to find and secure a commercial kitchen and can pay rent once the project is successfully funded. To fulfill orders, we will need to hire two bakers. Our family has had many years of combined experience in the food production industry--Grigor as a restaurant owner, Christina as a coffee shop assistant manager and baker, and Tony as a professionally-trained pastry chef--which will enable us to start up and run a kitchen that meets all Health Department and FDA requirements.\n",

      "[\"Ademi Bar: Our Journey While looking back and thinking about where our journey started, we realized that the story of every entrepreneur and of every immigrant in the United States is very similar, it is the story of unimaginable hard work and never ending efforts to make it work. It was no different for us. Here we were in 2015, the newly immigrated and entrepreneurial just-married couple. I, Aizhan, think that this is where our journey had begun… Aidar thinks our journey started when we said NO to meat, but that is just a few months later, so let's not think about little differences but common points. It was 2015, when we started experimenting with food and trying out cooking for people. As new folks in town (country), we thought sharing food is the fastest way to find like minded friends which eventually turned out to be a good plan. Please note this for yourselves if any of you happen to move to a new place with no friends or family. We were cooking different sweets and snacks, sharing them with friends and neighbors. Then we started selling our creations at the farmers markets, pop up events and local stores here in San Francisco. You will be hearing this a lot throughout our Kickstarter campaign because we treasure all these moments very much and want you to see how much fun it can be - the cruelty free food, doing business and building your life from scratch. Being an entrepreneur by nature is not an easy thing. For us, being a true entrepreneur is finding one thing that motivates you so much that you are ready to put your whole life into it, as I said, not easy. But we were very lucky, we’ve found that one thing that motivates both of us very much - the FOOD. The History Behind Ademi Bar We launched Ademi as a natural snack company back in 2016. We were influenced by traditional Indian treats like fruit based laddoos. We developed our own recipe and came up with a product Almond Date Bites. We worked on a label design, purchased packaging and obtained permission to sell at a local farmers’ market. Although we tested out Almond Date Bites and a variety of other different products, the idea never really took off and as a result Ademi went into hibernation until February 2019. It was our family, friends and past customers who inspired us to design a new product. We went back to the drawing board but this time we wanted to make it right. We used the knowledge that was already gained and decided to try out a few of our recipes of plant-based protein bars.\\xa0 Some of them worked and some didn’t. We had a fair share of triumphs and setbacks. But over time Ademi bars were selling out like hot cakes. People from different parts of town became frequent visitors to our tent at the farmers’ market. We even started to deliver Ademi bars to local Bay Area marathon and triathlon clubs who were praising our bars and spreading the word. And of course we got some nice triathlon swag for free! That was the most precious, sweetest and coolest time. We experimented with different packaging too, because our original packaging was not strong enough, or couldn’t hold the vacuum, or wasn’t professional enough.\\xa0 This was all valuable feedback from our customers, which we listened to and followed. We always came back to our drawing board and re-designed, re-packaged and re-worked our bars. This kept us on our toes and prepared us for the next push. We outgrew the farmers’ market and found a manufacturing partner who helped us to improve our recipes and introduced us to the world of professional packaging. With all new packaging and manufacturing support our capabilities became endless. We started selling Ademi bars on Amazon and to the local Bay Area shops and supermarkets. They quickly gained popularity on Amazon and in the Bay Area.\\xa0 At the same time we developed marketing and sales strategy and found more about our target customers. Our buyers like that Ademi bars are not overly sweet, large in size, great for digestion, high in dietary fiber and chickpea protein, low in ingredients list count and taste good. Ademi bars simply do their job! With our success in the last few months, it has become clear that we've outgrown the farmers’ market. We have worked hard, but have sometimes really struggled to keep up with demand. Why does Ademi Bar need your help? The next step for Ademi bars to grow would be to offer more exciting flavors to a wider audience! The Ademi community is vast, filled with amazing customers who are extremely supportive of our product, our journey, and who share our passion for vegan life style. \\xa0We would LOVE your help and support as we try to bring and widen our passion in the US. We are hosting this Kickstarter campaign to help build brand recognition for Ademi bars and develop new and exciting flavors. While there are a handful of companies that are dedicated to the plant-based nutrition bar arena, we believe we are still early to market. Ademi Bars need your support because we want to make Ademi a part of a plant-based revolution. As a community we can change the way we eat, the way we treat each other and animals and the way we care for our nature. What will our backers get by contributing? You will get our many many thanks for supporting our small business and helping to bring our dreams to life!!! In terms of Kickstarter rewards, you have the options for the following depending on the reward level you choose: (Please see Rewards options; it's a top menu item on a mobile device, or it's on the right on the desktop version) What will our contribution bring to Ademi Bar: We’ve designed two pilot flavors and manufactured beta batch of 5,000 chocolate sea salt Ademi bars, but need your help for the next step: What will be covered by Ademi: When will you start selling? We plan to start selling Ademi bars on November 5th, 2021! We will send updates to backers and post key updates on this page. Why now? We are deeply grateful to our customers and partners for their support and where this journey has brought us so far. The last couple of years have not been easy. Taking Ademi out of hibernation, searching for the right manufacturing partner, developing recipes and packaging design, establishing distribution network by pushing online and offline sales - it’s been a tough play, especially during pandemic. During the last two years we have been able to get to know more local convenience store owners and coffee shop owners than we have ever known in our lifetime. Running a small business makes you get into the funniest situations like discovering that Ademi bars sell in good volumes at liquor stores and the saddest situations where some of our best distribution partners had to go out of business or risked to shut their doors for good due to pandemic. This provided us an opportunity to learn and open our minds. Support from our distribution partners and online customers have been inspiring us and providing much needed validation that Ademi bars can do the job. It is only when they keep calling us back and requesting more bars when the reality hits - OMG, Ademi Bars sell! The excitement, gratitude and faith in our mission and product make us want to push forward! Our distribution partners are waiting for us to develop and offer a wide variety of flavors with beautiful and shiny packaging so that they can start leveraging our renewed capabilities and put Ademi bars on the shelves to compete with other brands. Stores and distribution network partners pretty much sell the real estate in the form of shelves and they are keen on filling the shelves with the few brands that have multiple flavors to offer.\\xa0 This is how products like Ademi bars become noticeable by customers who search for their favorite flavors. We hope this will give Ademi bars a better opportunity to compete, fulfill our mission and expand. Let’s unleash the full potential of Ademi Bar! We are still in the middle of a global pandemic, and the times are uncertain. But, it is what it is, we can’t change it, we can only look forward, carry on and hope for the best. In these uncertain times, we are turning to you - our backers, for your help to get Ademi forward. We’ve done all we could by sustaining Ademi with our savings and loans. What next for Ademi Bar? It is important to continue working and ensuring that growth is consistent. We have the product, mission, now we need to add more flavors, improve packaging, marketing and push offline and online sales. As long as we are in business and not hibernating, the momentum shouldn’t be lost. It will be easier to improve profitability once sales are consistent and rising. We are also planning to control and manage our own supply chain, this way we can manage costs at every turn. What happens if this fundraising campaign fails to meet its goal? It is expensive to run an early stage nutritional food business. If we don’t meet our funding goal, Ademi bars will not live on and we will have to shut down our business.\", '\\xa0Our company Unicox Superfoods, \\n \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Power Blend is for\\xa0everyone,\\n \\xa0\\xa0who are looking for performance breakfast,\\n \\xa0\\xa0our product is a set of Nutrition for your mind and body,\\n \\xa0\\xa0that\\'s made up of Clean and organic ingredients.

The problem was most available breakfasts are high in sugar, contains gluten or fillers. So, I am crowdfunding to raise money to start clean ingredients product line, and bring new outstanding vegan products, I need your help! I am a one women army and your help will allow me to \\xa0hire team members. How all started? In 2019, I was \\xa0diagnosed with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). One of the visible PCOS symptoms was weight gain and fatigue. Then I decided to change my eating lifestyle because \\xa0without the right diet, I realized, no amount of hard work would change that. Within weeks of adopting a Gluten free diet I started to see visible results. I wanted to go fully Plant-Based, but I never could because I couldn\\'t replace my breakfast. I tried Overnight Oats but it didn\\'t helped me that much, but I achieved a remarkable rebound in my performance by eating chia and flax breakfast! It\\'s been a Bumpy ride at times... To keep my PCOS normal... *Drum roll please* ….Hence my new adventure: Combining the benefits of superfoods with the good fats for a dietary essential that’s as yummy \\xa0and filling as it is health -conscious. I am excited to finally share my work with all of you! I hope you can relate to my vision, and that my blend will make a real difference in helping you to achieve your health goals.

I'm over-the-moon excited about this opportunity to submerge completely into my work for a full 4 weeks! I want to maximize this opportunity and the proximity to NYC's unique burlesque scene by bringing these performers into my studio. With this favorable time I shall observe and study each performer and their elaborate costumes from life, creating new works surpassing what I have accomplished to date. I plan to create multiple works during the residency, and am excited to announce those whom I am working with in the coming weeks! I am excited to work with the very top level of performers in the field. Among the list of performers working with me on this project is someone considered to be one of the single most important influences in that field today! The official lineup includes: Peekaboo Pointe, Delysia LaChatte, Amber Ray, and Dirty Martini! The vast majority of funds raised will be used to pay for the performer, model and costume costs for this project. The rest of the funds will be used to cover postproduction costs for posters and prints. In 2010 I started a series of paintings that focused on local Kansas City performers of various types; fire dancers, jugglers, singers, and burlesque artists. At first I saw this as a chance to explore the alter egos of people who develop an on-stage persona and live in a way that is free from the constraints of typical daily American life. Over time I found that something about burlesque resonated with me on a personal level. I began to see beyond performances and props and realized the underlying theme of women who live liberated from the status quo of a misogynistic society. The burlesque stage is a place where women (and men, straight, gay, queer, and transgender all equally welcome) are free to express their sexuality without shame, and without the need to pander to or protect themselves from male desires. Body positivity and self-expression are encouraged if not required, and feminist social commentaries are applauded rather than discounted. What a wonderful world! In my paintings, I seek to stir this feeling of power and freedom in the viewer, allowing them to vicariously experience the confidence, power, and abandon I've felt in the presence of these performers. Moreover, I present images of women as sexual subjects in a medium traditionally associated with respectability, making\\xa0a subtle statement not only about the social perception of the performers specifically, but about women's sexuality in general. As a thank you for supporting my goals during this residency, I will invite you to follow my progress via a secret blog where I will post exclusive photos, stories, and videos throughout the month of June and beyond! I also offer a variety of rewards including posters of some of my most popular paintings, Skype sessions, and original artwork. Finally, if you are as excited as I am about the opportunity to work with one of today's most celebrated burlesque figures, choose a poster, limited edition print, or heck, commission an original oil painting! \\xa0Although life as an artist comes with it’s own set of hurdles and challenges; I have been fortunate to have experienced such intense and moving support from those within and outside the artist community. Knowing that there are people out there that appreciate my work keeps me going through both the challenges as well as the good times... I thank you most sincerely!\", \"In our society, many issues exist that people live with as part of their day to day lives. \\xa0Such issues include discrimination (race, gender, etc.) rape, sexual assault, abuse, bullying, poverty, body image, suicide, depression, and so many more. \\xa0As someone who was bullied for most of his schooling career, I feel very strongly about raising awareness of these many issues. This is a project I have wanted to do for years, but such a major undertaking is of course, very expensive. \\xa0To make this project a reality, I need more than just a single camera. \\xa0I need a studio so that I can mold my photos into what I want. Equipment, such as lights, video cameras, and other items are essential. Finally, it's necessary to hire models or pay to bring survivors to me so that they can be a part of this project. \\xa0This is no small idea.That's where you come in. \\xa0I have created a KickStarter page for this project. My goal is not just to do this for myself, but to raise awareness on a global scale. \\xa0But to do it, I need your help. \\xa0If you support this cause, know someone who is a survivor, or are one yourself, consider donating. Every donation will go towards making this a reality. \\xa0And if you'd be interested in working on this project, contact me!

The girls, Amelia and Cynthia, take them to their family’s land deep in the woods for a sexy weekend of camping, drinking, and drugs. The guys start to realize too late, however, that they may have wandered into a dangerous situation. The film is inspired by the classic horror films of the 70’s, exploring the ideas of the occult, nature worship, and human sacrifice. Centered on the traditions of hoodoo, it blurs the lines of what is real and what is a superstition. A homage to horror classics, it will blend the lines of frightening and funny.\\xa0 The Cult of Ammon is an ambitious project, so we're making sure our budget is as tight as can be. Primarily, a large portion of our funding will go to purchasing film, developing and scanning. Finding Aaton a-minima spools has been difficult, but we've sourced a steady supply in California. We're calling in a lot of favors when it comes to equipment rental. In addition to our film needs, a large portion of the budget will be going to our cast. Our crew is passionate about this project, and we are all volunteering our time to make it happen - but we feel feeding, housing and paying our actors is of the utmost importance. Happy actors means better filmmaking for everyone.\\xa0 We've been hard at work creating props and set pieces, and are now at a point to where we are on track to begin preliminary photography in early October.

Our team, which consists of Kristen Saurette-Brady and Leann Brady, is fully committed to bringing you an amazing movie experience but we need a little help from you. We are asking for a donation of $1,000 (total) which will go directly to the making of the movie.  The following is a cost analysis:   With the funding we already have from Still Rings True Productions we need: $450 for Special Effects- We are firm believers in practical effects. Cannibal FX will be doing all special effects work and it is a huge chunk of our funding goal but it will be well worth it in the end. $200 for camera equipment- We will be shooting all of Decisions on DSLRS which we own so production cost will be very low. The $200 will be for a boom mic and any unexpected repairs we need. $350 for editing and distribution- The remaining money will go directly to editing and distribution. We are renting a high powered desktop to do our editing on.

Earlier this year I launched the 'I Ship It!' Kickstarter, and together we brought over 15 pins to life and raised over $17,000. As I worked more and more on the project, I realized just how many tropes were still left and how many folks wanted. So, this sequel to the project brings together the top tropes from the last project's poll. \\xa0. These are the designs that were crafted with the guidance of the Draft-Room tier backers. I think they turned out pretty awesome, and they will be available to add on to your pledge! . Along with the monetary stretch goals, there are also social media stretch goals! Help spread the word and unlock additional goodies! After the success of four projects, I have learned a LOT about timetables. The following timeline is made based on the use of my tried-and-true production company. They have produced excellent quality pins and I feel very confident in their abilities to create my pins in a timely manner. This will hopefully make the timeline below a reality. July: August: Late August/Early September: --- My initial goal is to fund the 'A.U. AUTHORITY' pin and the 'I ❤ FANFIC!' sticker. The goal covers the production of pin, packaging, Kickstarter fees, and shipping. The goal to achieve this is: $350. Here's the breakdown: PINs & STICKERs: 65-70% SHIPPING: 22-25% KICKSTARTER FEES: 8-10% Why the increase from the last project? I want to upgrade the production time, which would make the wait for the pins 50% shorter. It does, however, cost a bit more. Thus, the upgrade to the goals.

Hope this finds you well, hunkering down, readying for winter… Thanks for checking out our Kickstarter page! First, a few facts about the Lonely Heartstring Band…We met up through the American Roots Music program at Berklee College of Music in Boston. \\xa0For a gig in September of 2012 we were asked to play only Beatles' music--using bluegrass instrumentation. \\xa0From the first rehearsal, there was great chemistry, and we decided that we’d take the band seriously and carry it beyond that gig (and beyond just the Beatles!). \\xa0Our inspiration ranges from bluegrass, old time, jazz, classical music, and more. \\xa0Since 2012, we’ve been writing and arranging our music, exploring traditional music, and touring the continent. This past summer, we toured extensively from May until September, playing festivals on both coasts and in both Canada and the USA. Being our first tour, the band matured in a way that only tour can do, and we feel that we’re ready to make our first record!\\n\\n WHAT?!\\n\\n With your support, the Lonely Heartstring Band will make the record of our dreams!  With a dozen songs ready to record– most of them originals – and a handful more just around the corner, we think that this January will be the right time to get into the studio. It’s late November now, and we haven't booked any shows between now and mid-January so that we can completely focus on preparing to record. We’re rehearsing almost every day, getting our material studio-ready, and with each day that passes, we’re all a little more excited to get these songs recorded and into your stereos!\\n\\n WHERE?!\\n\\n We’ve chosen the Great North Sound Society in Parsonsfield, Maine as our studio of choice for this record. It’s a beautiful 18th century farmhouse converted into a remote, tucked-away, cell-reception-free (yesssss), live-in studio. It’s been the studio-of-choice for some amazing sounding records (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive, Joy Kills Sorrow), and we’ve booked ourselves a full week! It’s got a large open main(e) room for all the bed tracks, and the rest of the house will serve as isolation booths for all the extra bits… not to mention sleeping spaces and tri-harmony-around-the-fireplace-zones. WHO?!\\n\\n We’ve enlisted the masterful work of David Travers-Smith of Toronto, Ontario to come to Maine and engineer, produce, mix and master this record. He’s worked with fabulous artists (Wailin’ Jennys, Jayme Stone and many many more) and his knowledge of traditional, pop, vocal and new acoustic music makes him the ideal man for the job.  He’s got a ton of experience, and he’ll be coming down early to work some pre-production with us. He’s an awesome guy, and we’re really excited to be enlisting his help for this project.\\n\\n HOW?!\\n\\n We’ve lined up everything we can to make this record the best it can possibly be, from David the producer, the studio, the material, the warm wool sweaters and the excitement… Our last big step is your support through this Kickstarter!

Unfortunately, when it comes to convenience there are few choices in \\xa0non-allergen 100% whole-food, plant-based proteins, today we have few choices:\\xa0 We wanted more convenient, tasty and healthy options - and since, we\\'ve been on a mission to make lightly processed 100% whole-food plant-based meat alternatives that are delicious and accessible. \\xa0 We\\'ve spent years developing products diverse enough to satisfy the student population at ASU to the international tourists eating NexVeg™ at our National Parks, like the Grand Canyon. Those regional opportunities validated our recipes and allowed us to build a small kitchen; where our purveying, processing and distribution systems have won 2 sustainability awards. \\xa0The next step, is getting NexVeg on your doorstep! Clearly it all starts with 100% whole foods and admittedly, our goal is to do as little processing as possible, as fast as possible. \\xa0 Our micro-batching process lets us choose the freshest ingredients that travel the fewest miles to our production kitchens. \\xa0We lightly process them into NexVeg varieties. \\xa0Then we distribute them utilizing GreenCell sustainable packaging materials, and the direct ground-based shipping services of FedEx®.

Remember, in order to maximize the quality and minimize the footprint we choose the freshest ingredients that travel the fewest miles to our production kitchens. \\xa0Here\\'s what those fresh East / West ingredients look like, when they arrive at our kitchens. In fact, we take our ingredients even a bit more seriously than that:\\xa0 1) It\\'s delicious. \\xa0We\\'ve tested more than 208 recipes and served 1,000,000 portions to get to our 3 current product lines and 6 flavor profiles. 2) It\\'s healthy. \\xa0Whole food diets are medically proven to lower risk of heart disease and control weight gain.\\xa0 3) It\\'s sustainable. \\xa0Lightly processing whole foods consumes less water, produces less carbon and \\xa0creates less food waste than heavy processing of plants or raising animals. 4) It\\'s easy. \\xa0NexVeg is formable like ground meat and cooks fast in a skillet or the oven. \\xa0It is great for bulk prep and can be plated hot or cold. \\xa0There\\'s a variety worthy of replacing the meat in your favorite comfort foods no matter the cuisine.

Originally this concept started as a way to encourage myself and my community to consume more fruits and veggies for more energy and healthier living. I\\'d wake up early on the weekends and make drinks to sell at my cousin\\'s apothecary in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. At the time, I was also a full- time student at Brooklyn College, a doula and a nanny, As a nineteen year old, I did not have all the answers, but I did know a few things- 1) I\\'m passionate about curating accessible \"feel good\" experiences for my community, 2) I want to further develop my \"Sol Sips\" concept. After a couple years of doing pop-ups, drafting business plans and receiving feedback from mentors and family, an opportunity for a three month brick and mortar pop up fell into my lap via Craigslist. On December 2017 we opened \"Sol Sips Vegan Bevs and Bites\" in Bushwick, NY with the intention of staying for three months to test the waters. At the end of our three month test run our customers and the landlord of the space encouraged us to find a way to permanently stay. At the time it seemed unpromising to jump into owning and operating a restaurant as a 21-year old while finding the funds to do so. \\xa0I decided to go for it and launched a $50,000 crowd-funder, in addition to a family/friends round of funding. We didn\\'t reach our goal of $50,000- instead we raised $5,000 and my family and friends raised $15,000. Although I didn\\'t reach the goal- I was determined to make it work. Now almost two years later we are here and still standing. \\xa0 The passion and care that we put into our food is evident. We need support with gathering the final resources to open the doors of \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\", our new location in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, NY. This is a refreshing opportunity that would allow us to serve more people, expand our menu and incorporate the elements of fellowship that love so much. This includes live music, dj sets, art, storytelling and most important- a brave and comfortable space for black/poc people and families to commune and be nourished.\\xa0 The inclusivity of this upcoming space is what we are most excited about. We\\'ve witnessed the power of accessible wellness and community here in our current location of \\xa0300sq ft. In February of 2018 we introduced out \"Sliding Scale Brunch\", encouraging people from all walks of life to test the waters of plant based food in an affordable manner. They are given the option to pay what they can, based on what they can afford. Our commitment to giving everyone the access to eating healthy is what drives us. It is also what drives our customers to continue communing with us.\\xa0 Sustaining our customer base and the rising volume of our orders in our current Bushwick location is causing the inevitable discomforts of growth which effects the customer experience and also makes it difficult for us to further evolve. We are evolving from the cramped space of our current \"Sol Sips Bevs and Bites\" location- where customers often bump shoulders in this 9-seat space. Our tiny and beautiful space has served as our restaurant/cafe hybrid for nearly two years, we\\'ve truly learned the power of \"working with what we\\'ve got\". At last, we\\'ll be able to scale it back down to a cafe space where dinners can come in for a quick beverage and bite that can be accommodated with \\xa0the tools and resources we have here in the space.\\xa0 \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" is a larger space that will provide more comfort to our dinners. We encourage our guests to stay for a while and take up space. We are excited to see people bring their friends and family along to enjoy great food, service and a good time!\\xa0 Click below to learn more about our vision for \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" in New York Times\\' T-Magazine below.\\xa0 Article by Wilbert Cooper\\xa0 We\\'ve already invested a lot into our new space and we\\'ll continue to work towards reaching our funding goals. We\\'re confident that this Kickstarter will support us in opening \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" this fall. We are currently training a solid team of staff and working with an amazing architect to complete our design plan of a full-service dinning room, bar and stage. We\\'ve started collaborating with artists and musicians who are excited about curating residencies in the space that coincides with our dining experiences. We\\'ve even developed a unique and intentional menu that centers afro-indigenous and black southern cuisines with just plants- making most of our menu soy-free and gluten-free.\\xa0 Meeting our goal of $250,000 will enable us to:\\xa0 I\\'ve built Sol Sips from scratch- but not alone. Every step of the way I\\'ve been met with the support of my \"village\" of family, friends, mentors, community, organizations, allies and strangers. For this, I am grateful. \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" will reflect the power of gathering by providing vitality, love and innovation in every taste, scent, sight and sound.\\xa0 We look forward to sharing space and fellowship with you.\\xa0 Much Gratitude.\\xa0', 'I’m Greg, I’m the typical ‘’average italian’’ born and raised between football and tasty food. I spent most of my 20s locked in my room until, five years ago, I decided to give a twist to my life by changing completely my daily routine: sport and healthy food replaced videogames and junk food. It’s been a long time since I got over this negative part of my life and, today, I’m ready to live a better part of it and to put myself out there, focusing everything on healthy food. Cados was born, at least as a concept, circa a year ago; since then my idea has changed many times until becoming the actual one which shares the same aim as the original one, even though it’s a lot different: producing high quality avocado snacks and selling them at an affordable price. To do so I’m going to use an atypical internal politcs, that uses quality and a good price as it’s ONLY advertisement; I wanted, for the same reason, to limit as reasonably as possible the net gain on the finished product (keeping it around 5%) to promote an higher quality/price ratio. The products available at the launch of Cados will be 2: · AVOCADO CHIPS: simple avocado chips, ready to be devoured at any time. · AVOCUDDLE: the perfect synthesis between the classic potato chips bag and avocado. Despite having in mind 3 new types of snacks I believe, at the current state, that only these are suitable for marketing but it’s also possible that, until January 2020, on the official e-shop some of these could already be available. I want to be very trasparent so, below, I left you a short but complete list of how funds raised through this campaign will be used, with the relative percentages: · FIRST STOCK OF RAW MATERIALS (70%) · PROFESSIONAL EQUIPMENT (15%) · E-SHOP (15%) · BETTER PRINTS* · FIRST AVOCADO PLANTATION* Those maked with * are additional costs that I consider useful to make the product more attractive and/or to further reduce the price but that I didn’t include in the requested amount and which I would take care just if it were exceeded. I would personally thank whoever decided to believe in my project but, for obvious reason, I can’t do that; i do want to let you know that your support was very important to me, and this is the reason why I wanted to divide the rewards in 3 levels in order to include as many people as possible: · HIGH FIVE (5+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 5% discount. · TASTE TEST (50+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 10% discount + 1x Avocado chips + 1x Avocuddle. · AVOCADO LOVER (100+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 15% discount + 1x Avocado chips + 1x Avocuddle + 1x Special Gratefull Avocado. The rewards will be shipped from January 2020 but I don’t exclude a priori the possibility of some anticipation or short delay.', 'We are two humans who met at the perfect time and since the day we met we have done nothing but grow stronger as individuals and even stronger as a unit. We are Hayley 32 years of age and Joakim 31 years of age and we recently moved a little deeper, but not deep enough into the woods in the centre of Sweden. We met over a shared interest of psychedelics and especially the healing benifits that they have on human beings, we were both very responsible users, something we bonded over and we both have \"magic mushrooms\" to thank for curing f.ex severe migrane and psychedelics in general have helped us both grow a lot. We wanted to show our growth in some way, we wanted to show how the whole world could benefit from the responsible use of psychedelics. So we started with our project \"Hippy Spirit Clothing\" 2.5 years ago and we have slowly watched it grow into something we are very proud of, and we have grown along with Hippy Spirit, a lot as well. The idea for Vegan EVERYTHING came, just like with our clothing brand, from us and the way we choose to live. Today our conscious green eating makes us both feel amazing and cooking and experimenting with food has been a passion since early teenage years, and has become even more fun since turning vegan! :) Healthy, good tasting vegan food is exensive if you eat out today and it seems like everyone wants to put a \"healthy-tax\" on everything and it is really not fair for the ones who really cares about what they eat and needs something quick on the go. We want to change that. We will sell something that we are surprised that we have never seen any food truck our fast food place sell in Sweden and the thing is, we really dont want to say it yet, because we fear someone with the money to start tomorrow will come in and do this before us, this is how much we believe in this idea. As we go we will add a lot, like green smoothies, smoothie bowls, raw balls, avocado on toast, golden milk, chai tea, vegan ice-cream, the list can be made so long, jummy and healthy! Everything vegan of course! Vegan EVERYTHING is so much more than a food truck, it is more of a movement and together with the clothing we design and the music we produce and the art that we make we try in our little way to open up as many hearts and third-eyes as possible! :) And it all start with a healthy diet! You truly are what you eat! :) Chosing to work for yourself is hard, but once you are there it is out of the question to go back to work for someone else. No matter how hard it is, we will not give up! We work every single day to come up with new designs, new content, new music to increase sales to eventually pay for this huge addition to our lives, our Vegan EVERYTHING. food truck idea, but it is going way to slow and we are in the best time ever to start. We have come a long way planning all of this, but we are still basically on step one with all of this since we can not afford to buy the truck or the kitchen that it has to have inside, everything around the whole project is basically done, we have events to go to many places in Sweden, this is events we have spoken to as well as events who has contacted us. Many of these events do not have any vegan food at the moment, so we see a huge opportunity there, with well over 10.000 visitors on an average day. We also want to sell at bigger events in other countries in the summers, this is huge music events where we would fit in perfectly but stick out with our food! *and clothing* We are asking for help so that we have a chance to open up our business before someone else does it and we would hope to raise 200.000sek to make this dream come true. The cost of the van will be the biggest expence, then it might have to be re-built with ventilation and then it needs a working kitchen. Roughly counted this will cost somewhere between 150-200.000sek. We would be forever thankful if we would get help with this project, it is exactly what we are meant to do and we have such big plans for the future and we believe in this so extremely much, we are in the right time with everything and this is not just a job for us, this van will become a part of our lifestyle! Thank you so much! Hayley and Joakim', 'UPDATE 3- NEW STRETCH GOAL $11,500. Well we made it over our goal of $9500, and then we made it over our first stretch goal of $10000 to add an extra week and location. Now let\\'s try for $11500 and add another week and another place! We can do it!  UPDATE 2- 15% TO ONLINE STORE FOR ALL BACKERS. As a thank you, all of my wonderful backers of this project will receive 15% off in my online store once it goes live (early January). The store will be offering prints and original art, as well as greeting cards and more. Thank you all so much. UPDATE 1- Now that the project has reached it\\'s initial funding goal. Some of you may be wondering what happens with the extra money? Well extra money will go to incidentals on the trip, and if we make it $500 over the goal then I\\'ll add another week with at least 1 city into the trip. REACHED! My name is Jessica, and I’m a fine artist and illustrator living in San Francisco, and I\\'d like you to join me on a painted exploration through Europe. \\nI do many types of art, but one of my favorite things to do is to go out and paint and sketch on location, typically known as \\'Plein Air\\'. For me this is a great way  to see my city in a new way and then to turn around and share it with others. That\\'s what I especially love about making things, is sharing them with people. \\n When I was in high school I was lucky enough to go on a trip to Rome, Florence, and Paris. To say that I had a blast would be an understatement, I got to eat new things, interact with people who didn\\'t speak the same language, and see all of these places that were not only beyond beautiful but steeped in history. And that\\'s what did it for me, how amazing everything looked. I still remember winding through these narrow shadowed cobbled streets in Florence that all of a sudden opened up into the Piazza della Signoria. The famous David and the Medici Bank where now towering over my  right shoulder, while a line of marble statues twisted and writhed to my left,  the Tuscan sun played off the stone of the Piazza and the water of Neptune\\'s fountain, all the while the lure of \"Italy\\'s best gelato\" called from across the square. From that moment on I knew I wanted to keep traveling, and when I decided to pursue art as a career, that I wanted to share my experiences through painting what I saw on my travels. \\n\\n\\xa0 So that\\'s what brings me here today. I would like your help to take a month and paint my way through Italy, France, and Spain creating paintings and sketches of the beautiful and interesting things I see on my trip. I plan to fly out in early May of 2015 landing in Naples, Italy, then head to Florence, Venice, and Milan. Next up Southern France starting in Annecy, then on to Moustiers-Sainte-Marie, and Pezenas. Lastly head to Spain with stops in Barcelona, Albarracin, and Madrid. To keep costs down I would fly back home out of Porto, Portugal.\\xa0 During this month, I will blog daily about my art and my adventures. Anyone who contributes to my campaign, and should it be funded, will be able to follow this blog and read more as soon as each post is published! My schedule will be simple: two consecutive days of art, a day for travel time and location scouting, repeat. My hope is to paint two acrylic paintings and one watercolor each day. Once back home, I will work on prints, wallpapers, and shipping the original artwork to backers in the qualifying pledge categories. Please note the large canvas paintings will take longer to ship as they will be completed upon return. All of the money raised from this Kickstarter will go to helping to pay for everything, from the plane flights, food and lodging, to art supplies, train and bus tickets, and shipping costs to get everything to my backers after I get back home.\\xa0 Travel: plane flights $1200 each way. Month long train pass $850. \\xa0Buses and the occasional taxi\\xa0$250. Coming to $3500 Lodging through Air B&B and food will run about $100/day coming to $3000. Art supplies: New lightweight durable easel (mine is super heavy, clunky, and will not survive baggage handling) $250. Paint and canvas panels $250. Fine art printing $400. Coming to $900. Shipping: Boxes $300. Shipping $1000. Coming to $1300.\\xa0 Subtotal- $8700 Adding taxes, Kickstarter, and credit card fees I\\'ll need you help to raise $9500 for this trip.

Jag vill skapa en lugn kafémiljö som är ett bra alternativ för de som vill arbeta hemifrån men ändå vill lämna hemmet. Ett ställe där du kan möta likasinnade, knyta nya kontakter och skapa samarbeten.\\xa0 Utöver den dagliga verksamheten med mat och kafé kommer vi ordna evenemang med fokus på kultur, skapande och hantverk, både själva och i samarbete med andra organisationer, allt i syfte att skapa en mer levande förort.\\xa0 Bakgrund Idéen om att starta ett veganskt coffice i en av Stockholms förorter föddes från början av en stammis på ett trevligt vegankafé i närheten. Idén vandrade sedan vidare och hamnade så småningom hos mig. Jag har behållt grundtanken men låtit idén växa åt sitt eget håll.\\xa0 Jag fick tag på en fantastisk lokal i Bandhagen. En lokal med historia och liv. Min vision är nu att ta tillvara på lokalen och skapa en kreativ mötesplats och på så sätt också vara med att skapa en levande förort.\\xa0 Från början var tanken att det skulle vara ett coffice, alltså ett ställe dit människor går för att arbeta där det samtidigt finns möjlighet att få sig kaffe och kanske en bit mat. Jag upplever att platsen jag vill skapa är mer än så. Platsen ska leva och det ska inte kosta något att sitta där. Jag vill dock fortfarande behålla tanken att det ska vara en plats en går till för att arbeta.\\xa0 Kortfattat kan en säga att jag vill skapa en blandning av ett coffice och ett kafé.\\xa0 Vilka är vi?\\xa0 Jag som fick idéen av en stammis på ett vegankafé heter Nina och är även jag stammis på samma vegankafé. Jag älskar djur, äter helst av allt frukt och pluggar stickning på folkhögskola.\\xa0 Någonstans längs den här resan hittade jag Zaphira som nu är med och hjälper till att starta upp verksamheten. Hon bidrar med tankar, idéer och en massa positiv energi. Zaphira är från början vän till en vän som sedan har blivit även min vän. Hon är en färgglad person som älskar katter och brinner för jämställdhet.\\xa0 Vad erbjuder vi?\\xa0 Vi erbjuder en lugn och kreativ miljö för dig som vill komma hemifrån men inte åka in till stan. Vi erbjuder kaffe, fika och luncher på plats i kaféet och vi kommer även att erbjuda frukostpaket, mellanmål och picknickkorgar som take away för dig som har vägarna förbi.\\xa0 \\n Det finns även möjlighet att hyra konferensrum (under våra öppettider) samt hela lokalen (när kaféet är stängt).\\xa0 När och hur ? Om allt går som vi hoppas, får vi tillgång till lokalen den 1/8. Därefter behövs renovering, uppfräshning och städning innan vi förhoppningsvis kan slå upp dörrarna den 9/9.\\xa0 Vad behöver vi pengarna till?\\xa0 Vi behöver pengar för renovering. Vi behöver köpa kylskåp, frysar, ugn, diskmaskin och någon form av spis eller spisplatta. Vi behöver även en rörmokare som kan dra om vattenledningar och installera en diskmaskin. Vi kommer eventuellt även att behöva en elektriker.\\xa0 Vi tror på tillsammansskap Den är idéen har växt fram tillsammans med människor i vår omgivning. Den har formats och växt sig större i mötet med andra människor och deras idéer. Vi vill låta växandet fortsätta och se vad idéen blir som verklighet.\\xa0 Maten\\xa0 Vi gillar smaker. Många olika sorters smaker och gärna från världens alla hörn. Vår plan är att catera lunchen från vårt favoritvegankök. Frukost, fika och mellanmål fixar vi själva. Vi kommer att laga mat efter säsong och göra det vi kan för att minska matsvinnet.\\xa0 Hos oss kommer all mat och dryck vara växtbaserad men våra gäster är välkomna oavsett vilken kost de äter. Vi äter båda växtbaserat och brinner för såväl djurrätt samt miljö så för oss kändes valet givet. Vi gillar att experimentera med smak och konsistens och att utmana föreställningen om hur vegansk mat ska vara. Även fyrbenta gäster är varmt välkomna. English It all started when one of the other regulars at my favorite café had an idea to open a coffice in the neighbourhood. We discussed the idea, and I was thrilled about it. Pretty soon, I got the blessing to take the idea and run with it. Through meetings and input from friends and enthusiasts, the whole thing grew into something bigger. I then found a fantastic place in Bandhagen, south of Stockholm. My vision is to continue to develop the original idea and together with other people make this a venue for creation, our contribution to make this an even more alive neighbourhood. In short, I would like to create something in between a café and a coffice. A place that is calm and encourages you to be creative and a possibility to connect with people nearby.\\xa0 Who are we? \\xa0 I am Nina, the founder of this business. I love animals, prefer to eat fruits and I am studying knitting at a Folkhögskola.\\xa0 Zaphira is a friend of mine and somewhere along the line she got involved. She is a colourful person with a lot of energy who loves cats and is passionate about equality.\\xa0Zaphira contributes with thoughts, ideas and a lot of positive energy and is now an important person for the startup.\\xa0 What do we want?\\xa0 Create a plant based café with a peaceful atmosphere perfect for those who want to work outside the office but still want to leave the house. A place where you could make new contacts and find nice people to cooperate with. We will also offer breakfast, snacks and picnic baskets to take away for those of you who just pass by.\\xa0 Beyond the daily business with food and coffee we will also arrange events with focus on culture, creating and craftsmanship, both on our own and together with different organisations, all with the purpose to contribute to a living suburb. It's also possible to rent our conference room (during opening hours) or the whole place (when the cafe is closed).\\xa0 When and how?\\xa0 We will access the place on the first of August. There are renovations that has to be done, along with some cleaning and freshening things up before we can open the doors on the ninth of september (hopefully).\\xa0 The money?\\xa0 We need money to renovate the place. We need to buy refrigerators, freezers, dishwasher, an oven and a stove. We also need to hire a plumber and probably also an electrician.\\xa0 We believe in creating together\\xa0 This idea has grown and developed thanks to the ideas and creativity from people around us. We want this project to grow further and are looking forward to see it in action. \\xa0 The food\\xa0 We like a lot of different tastes from all over the world. We plan to cater lunch from our favourite vegan kitchen but will make breakfast, fika and snacks ourselves. We will adjust the food according to season and do our best to not let any food go to waste.\\xa0 We both eat plant based food and are passionate about animals and the environment so it all felt obvious. All of our food and drinks will be plant based but our customers are welcome regardless their own food preferences. \\xa0We like to experiment with taste and texture and to challenge the picture of what vegan food should be. Even guests on four legs is warmly welcome!\\xa0\", \"Hello, we are The Odd Folk, a quintet of ramshackle musicians from the far west of Cornwall (although our drummers a Grimsby man with Cornish adoption pending!) We play folk music and we have always been a little odd. We use ironing boards as keyboard stands, branches as mic stands and all pile into an old Renault 4 and drive around the country playing music and getting lost. We're been carrying our debut album, The Sweet Release, around with us for the last couple of years and as well as most of our friends and fans having a copy we're actually running very low on stock! We've long been scratching our heads on how on earth we were going to fund another 'baby' when we stumbled on this sweet medium! We're so pleased to be able to offer rewards to our fans as a way of saying thank you, and all of the prizes will be created with as much love as we can muster.We are really honoured to be able to work with Andy Bell, a sound engineer with a CV as long as your leg; who's worked with many greats from the folk circuit including Bellowhead, Eliza Carthy and Seasick Steve to namedrop but a few! Being a mobile sound engineer ables him to travel wherever we want him, and so we're choosing Belan Hall, an old shooting lodge in the middle of Wales, where we sometimes go to rehearse and have creative lockdown. We will also be working closely with our designer, Mae Voogd, to make the album cover and all the posters and T-Shirts to go with it. She's drawn the band\\xa0a number of times but one of the rewards is for you to join us on the launch poster as well as get your portrait drawn! All you'll have to do is submit a photo and you can hop onto the page with us. The T-Shirts will also be designed by Mae Voogd and for this reward you will need to submit your size preference and colour preference. The figure we are after is £5000, which seems like a lot of money but in reality is just about scraping the barrel. And no, we're not going to do a runner to The Caribbean! The list below will give you an idea of what we need and what's involved in making an album. The Sound Man - this is the main component, this includes all tracking, editing, mixing and producing of the album! The Duplication - this is the where we get numbers, for instance 1000 copies to be released. The Design - this involves all the album artwork, storyboarding the sleeves and booklets, and drawing up the posters. T-Shirts - for your new frocks! Photographs - for your mantlepieces! Postage and Packaging - wherever you are the postman will come and deliver your rewards to you! We look forward to working with you! THE ODD FOLK Morgan Val BakerSam Brookes\\xa0Shelley MacphailOscar Bloomfield-CroweAndy Watson\", 'Country music fans, meet The Justin Alan Black Band. Today, the band calls Nashville home, but these three life long friends from Georgia started writing and playing music together as teenagers. Currently in the studio recording their debut country album, the band says the new songs are inspired from a place they all know so well, home. “No matter where I go, Georgia’s home to me.”\\n-from the song “Georgia”, featured on the band’s new album. After months of writing and focusing the band’s sound, The Justin Alan Black Band entered Cherry Box Studios in Nashville to begin recording their debut in country music. “This has been a long time coming.”, says Josh, who plays mandolin and banjo with the group. “We’ve worked hard and are proud to see this all come together.”\\xa0 The band is raising the funds needed to finish the record through a Kickstarter campaign and social media promotions this fall. “Our families, friends, and our fans\\n have always been so supportive.” says Mic, guitarist. “We’ve been making music together all our lives and they’ve been there every step of the way.” \\xa0With the release of their first album this fall and an extensive tour planned for the spring and summer of 2015, it’s safe to say that “Home” is the one place the band won’t be seeing very much of in the coming year. “It’s never easy being away from your family.” says Patrick, the band’s lead singer. “They never leave my mind, they’re in the songs, and they’re the reason we do what we do.” Patrick went on to say, “These guys are like my brothers, we’re family. We’ve built this together, and that’s what makes what we do so special to me.”\\xa0 Watch for the band’s new release this spring on iTunes and follow on social media for updates and ways you can stay connected with The Justin Alan Black Band. www.facebook.com/justinalanblack\\xa0 @justinalanblack : twitter', 'If questions and curiosity prompted The Sun Flights to leave\\non their nine month musical adventure around the country, then it’s only to be\\nassumed that greater questions and curiosity remain. We returned with no\\nanswers whatsoever. But we did write House\\nof Man, a nine song album. I don’t think any of our songs pinpoint a specific experience\\nor moment during our travels. In fact, many of the songs were written in a few\\ndifferent places and over a period of a couple months. However, they are based\\non emotions, imagery and stories from around this country.House\\nof Man is a reflection of the time we live in, which is a reflection of the\\ntimes we come from, all of which will determine where we are going. We, as\\nmankind. There is critique in this album but it comes from a place of\\nlove and hope. The generosity shown to us during our travels, the hardships and\\nstrength of the people we met, the landscapes we encountered are so vast, so\\nindescribable that we know House of Man\\nis a small perspective. But it is what we have. We’re looking forward to recording this album at The Spice\\nHouse. A beautiful, recording studio in Fishtown, built out of wood from an old\\nLancaster barn.

We hope to have this album recorded and ready to share by\\nearly 2015.', 'Emma, a college student with a crippling fear of clowns, must come face to face with her worst fear when a clown that has been terrorizing the town promises to kill her. This clown gives a balloon to each his victims with the exact time and date he\\'s going to kill them written on it. After\\xa0receiving one herself,\\xa0Emma realizes that she has two days left to live, and\\xa0must fight against the clock to find a way to survive. The film is based on a short film we did called The Clown Statue (based on my favorite urban legend!)\\xa0that has since gained a cult following online and has won awards at film festivals nationwide! For this movie, I\\'ve pulled inspiration from every corner of the horror genre, which I am a huge fan of! It would best be described as a haunted house/creature feature hybrid. I had someone describe it as an \"Americana nightmare\" and an \"electric circus\". Which I LOVE, and I think describes the film perfectly. I love\\xa0horror movies, and I LOVE\\xa0scary clowns! So you can imagine how upset I was to find out how few scary clown movies actually exist. So I wrote my own and set out on a crazy journey to bring the next great clown movie to life! After six months writing and perfecting the script, I left my Nashville home and met our crew out in Los Angeles to shoot the movie! The production was chugging along and we were getting amazing footage! Then, on the last day and a half of shooting, one of our key locations caught on fire just minutes before we arrived (thanks to the good ol\\' California drought). The best choice for our movie creatively, logistically, and safety-wise was to halt production. I returned home, we edited the film, and we figured out exactly what we needed to complete it (we have 90% of the film done!). In addition, we had the rare opportunity to be able to see our movie and write some\\xa0amazing new scenes to make it even better!\\xa0Now we need your help to finish it! We have the budget left over to shoot what we had originally intended. The trick is getting a new production up and running again, and paying to shoot the newly written scenes. Things like re-renting the camera equipment, paying the cast and crew, and paying location fees again cost a lot! All of this gets broken up into: So join the team, get your copy of the movie, and be a driving force in making the next great clown movie a reality! \\xa0Brittany Belland plays Emma - With over a dozen films under her belt, Ohio-born Brittany Belland was more than excited to tackle the role of Emma: the story\\'s protagonist who must race against the clock after learning that she will be killed by her greatest fear in two days\\' time. With her incredible dramatic abilities and attention to detail and nuance, Belland breathes an extra dimension of life and character into the extremely intense and demanding character. Eric Corbin plays Ribcage the Clown - LA actor Eric Corbin blew everyone away during auditions, bringing a sense of athleticism and ferocity to the character that nobody expected. Pulling from movie monsters throughout the years, Corbin truly built this creature from the ground up. In the end, he delivers a performance quite unlike anything you\\'ve seen before. Strong, animalistic, and inhuman Corbin makes Ribcage the Clown something to truly be feared. Monica Baker plays Heather - Michigan-native Monica Baker works as an actress and voice actress in Los Angeles. Baker plays Heather, Emma\\'s big-mouthed, sweet-as-sugar-but-tough-as-nails best friend. When things begin to go downhill and Emma locks up with fear, Heather pushes her to move forward whether it\\'s for better or for worse. Sean Patrick Murray plays Jonah - Emma and Heather\\'s other partner in crime, Jonah, is played by Sean Patrick Murray, a Los Angeles based actor and producer. Jonah is sarcastic but totally down to Earth. However, (without spoiling anything) Emma quickly realizes that if she doesn\\'t come up with a plan, her life might not be the only one at risk. Burt Culver plays Mr. Randal - Seattle native Burt Culver has appeared in over 40 TV shows and movies since his move to LA in 2012 (including a guest role in Criminal Minds). Culver plays Mr. Randal, the father of the clown\\'s first victim. Out for revenge, he latches onto Emma. Insisting that he protect her, for better or for worse. Tom Seidman plays Pops - Seidman is truly a Hollywood veteran, having worked as a producer and an assistant director for over thirty years on films such as Dead Poets Society, Reds,\\xa0and Ordinary People. Though he has always been an actor at heart. Seidman plays Pops, a local ice cream man who, while working with the police, starts to suspect there might be more than meets the eye with the case. Johnjay Fitih plays The Town Sheriff - British actor Johnjay Fitih plays the town Sheriff, who very quickly becomes the clown\\'s favorite puppet. Caitlin Rigney plays Meghan - New York theatre actress Caitlin Rigney plays Meghan, Mr. Randal\\'s daughter who haunts him in more ways than one after her gruesome death.', \"Hello my name is James Carney, I am the writer and director of this short film. Being a person who enjoys video games but also an aspiring filmmaker I've always wanted to create fan films for my favorite games but those ideas never worked out. But with the recent launch of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 I decided to try again. The more specific reasoning behind this is I feel there aren't enough strong female characters represented in film and mainly want to focus on changing that and this game does fit with that sort of idea. For the story it’s a vague scenario revolving around Claire and Moira, purely based around all the narrative information included in the trailers out of respect for people who may not have played the game yet.\\n\\n As for production cast(though at this point the leads have yet to be cast but there are a lot of interested volunteers so it's just a matter of choosing the right people) and crew are already on board with budget being all that’s left. The cost adds up to $1400 for all the necessities including: equipment, props and costuming. Hopefully this goal can be reached within a soon enough time.\\nThe overall scope aside from the focus is a creating a fun project that Resident Evil fans and others can enjoy and hopefully lead to enough interest that would allow me to work on other projects I’m very interested in making in the near future as part of my initial goal of creating media that shows strong, realistic and unexploited female characters.\", 'We\\'ve been super busy baking up delicious, vegan cupcakes from scratch. \\xa0In fact we\\'ve outgrown our shared kitchen space. \\xa0We are forever grateful to our friends at LaBelle Aurore in Niantic, CT for helping our fledgling business get off the ground, but it\\'s time to move into our very own store! \"Dutch\\'s\" will be filled with fresh baked treats and we will continue our made to order custom creations. We were very successful with our local farmer\\'s markets last season, selling out most days. When not at the market, we continue to fill special orders weekly. \\xa0All thanks to our loyal customers. But, the one question we get asked the most is...\\xa0 \"When are you opening a store? \". \\xa0We understand that our customers want to be able to stop in whenever they feel like a quick treat. \\xa0With a location of our own we will have a chance to meet and interact with you all year long.

Now that we\\'ve shown people cupcakes can be sinfully indulgent without the use of animal products, we want to add the convenience of our very own store front. We love our community and we want to be a part of the evolution of food while helping you rethink what options are available to you. \\xa0Meeting people, talking and answering questions is what we live for. \\xa0The love and support we\\'ve received so far has been mind blowing and we cant wait to do more. \\xa0One of the main reasons Dutch\\'s chooses a vegan lifestyle is to protect animals and the planet we share with them. While building our shop we are keeping that same mind set and utilizing eco-concious products for packaging and design.

This project is about a trip we want to make in\\xa0February 2016 to island. \\xa0Our goal is to travel all around the island of Iceland to take pictures not only of the amazing landscape but mostly of the northern lights.\\xa0 Since the northern lights are our main goal, we chose to go there when the circumstance are best for northern lights photography. But to do this project we need your help! Our goal is to rent a save and good car that we are flexible to drive to the best spots at night. We have no chance with public transport; buses don't drive in winter and not even at night, and the spots we want to visit have never seen a bus before. This is why renting a car\\xa0is crucial for our project. We (Claudia Bischoff, Martin Tödtling and Matthias Urwyler)\\xa0are experienced photographers. We are passionate about the northern lights. We\\xa0already made a trip to Norway two years ago. \\n\\nThere we learned all we need to know for this job. We know how to capture the \\n\\nnorthern lights when they appear, we know how to hunt them and bring them home as breath \\n\\ntaking pictures.\\xa0 Since we are experienced, we know what it takes to be out all night long even when the temperature gets way below zero. It can be very hard, but we are definitely up for it. When the northern lights appear we forget the cold, we forget the wetness and we act as \\n\\nfast as we can, to get the perfect picture for you.\\xa0 For our trip we have all the necessary gear and knowledge. To get around the island, we need to hire a good and safe car, that is able to drive in the snowy cold. But with your support we can do it! Our goal is to come home with the most stunning pictures of the northern lights. We want to make a presentation about the trip around the island and present the best pictures of the northern lights of Iceland. Thank you all for your support and feel free to post and spread the word about our project! For any further questions don't hesitate to contact us, we are happy to get to know you and to answer all your questions! Yours Claudia, Martin and Matthias\", 'I\\'ve always been a big fan of multi page wall calendars... you know the ones that you turn over a page every new month and get a new image to look at for the next 30 days or so. I buy at least 3 every year for different rooms in my house.\\xa0 And while we’re all pretty much forced to keep our schedules on our computers and phones, I like tangible objects, artifacts if you will. And I like that ritual turning of the page every month... and, of putting up the new calendars every year and taking down the old ones. And, I\\'ve always wanted to do a calendar of just my images. So I decided now\\'s the time. I\\'ve designed the calendar: It\\'s 12in X 12in square with a heavy cover, front and back. It will be saddle stitched, which just means it has staples in the fold (I\\'ve never really been a fan of the wire binding). I\\'ve found an awesome printer that will give me great turn around time. And I\\'ve selected twelve of my favorite fine art images from the last few years.\\xa0 I’ve created what I feel is a very simple and elegant calendar that will showcase the images and be an art artifact for your wall. Four of these images have been awarded prestigious prizes in two of the premier photography competitions in the world… the PX3 in Paris… and the International Photography Awards in the US. If you even remotely like wall calendars and photography, or know someone who does, I think you\\'ll love this one. I\"m very excited about this project, and will really appreciate your help in making it possible. Thanks so much for your time. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0- Gunnar', 'I\\'ve always been into sci-fi and fantasy, but last year, largely thanks to Jeffro Johnson\\'s Hugo nominated Appendix N Retrospective series, I found myself picking up a lot of the older, weirder and pulpier stuff. \\xa0I felt particularly inspired by authors like Leigh Brackett, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, and publications like Planet Stories. \\xa0 I decided to launch a semi-pro zine to showcase pulse-pounding Sword & Planet and Heroic Fantasy fiction in the tradition of those classic pulp magazines.\\xa0 Cirsova Magazine is for readers who want exciting tales of daring heroes up against impossible odds in exotic settings. It\\'s also for authors of adventure SFF. \\xa0I want to create an enduring market for pulp adventure writers to sell their fiction for competitive semi-pro rates. \\xa0 All that\\'s left to do for issue 1 is fill some of the limited advertising space and get it into your hands as soon as possible! No T-shirts, no secret forums, no skype calls, conventions or parties, just what I can without a doubt put in your hands: a high quality sci-fi magazine. Issue 1 will have nearly 100 pages of pulse pounding SFF action! The first issue of Cirsova features the following line-up: Short Stories Novelette Poetry Feature Column Cover Art Stretch Goal 1: $1,000 I\\'ll be able to pay for about half of the second issue without having to dip into out-of-pocket funds. \\xa0Meeting this goal means that around 100 people will get their hands on this amazing anthology. \\xa0There MAY be enough interest and buzz generated from folks who get to see it that Cirsova MIGHT take off as a sleeper mag to watch out for by mid 2016. \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 Stretch Goal 2: $5,000 Begin work on a second issue sometime in 2016. Reaching $5,000 will mean that my expenses associated with issue 1\\'s assemblage will be met.  Issue 1 has roughly $1k worth of already-paid-for top-notch content, and the rest of the cost is POD + S&H.  \\n Seems silly that meeting my expenses would be a stretch goal, but I\\'d rather play it safe than bank on an explosive outpouring of pledges. \\xa0Because Cirsova Issue 1 is already paid for, I can put it out without needing to raise the extra funds to cover the costs. \\xa0\\n Even if I don\\'t meet this stretch goal, there\\'s a good chance I\\'ll try to scrape together enough money for a second issue this year, because I\\'ve already got some AMAZING stories from authors who have said \"I\\'ll hold onto this until you can get the next issue together.\" \\xa0I want to tell you all about them and how great they are, but I can\\'t until I actually get the ball rolling on issue 2 and pay for the rights to them. Stretch Goal 3: $10,000 Begin work on a second issue immediately. Now, $10,000 would be ideal, because that would mean that my poorly scrawled out calculations of content + mfg. + shipping costs turned out to be more or less right and I didn\\'t completely screw up on calculating my per-issue price point (approx 1000 issues w $1 content cost per issue + approx $5 per issue pod allows for a per issue price comparable to the \\'big\\' SFF mags).  Oh, it also means that I would be able to immediately begin soliciting stories for issue 2.\\n\\n\\xa0 Stretch Goal 4: $20,000 I think I\\'ll have enough to pay off my car note; that means an almost extra $300 a month I\\'ll be able to sock away to invest in future content! Issue 2 will have interior artwork, for one thing! Notes on Shipping:\\nI want to make this magazine available both as cheaply and widely as possible.  To do so, I needed to add variable shipping costs to pledge levels with rewards that can be shipped outside of the US.  Reward levels that are marked \"Only Ships to: United States\" have shipping costs factored in already.\\n\\n\\xa0 Notes on Bulk Orders:\\nUS Domestic Media Mail rates are the primary reason why these bulk orders can be pledged for so cheaply.  The downside is that these prices must be exclusive to US customers.  If you are outside of the US and interested in bulk rates, please contact me directly and I will arrange for the best deal I can make you.\\n\\n Notes on Advertisements:\\nImage Advertisements will appear in soft-cover print and pdf copies.  Depending on how well we can get the eBook version formatted, they may appear there as well, however this should be considered a \"bonus\" beyond the pledge goal based on its technical feasibility. \\xa0Interior advertisements may be in true black & white or in gray-scale. \\xa0Color images should be converted to gray-scale before submitting. Be advised that the Rear Cover advertisement is sized to accommodated a barcode rather than fit the page. Advertisement images should be 300 dpi, with the following measurements: Please have both text and graphic ads prepared for submission no later than one week after the end of the Kickstarter!', 'From it\\'s inception in 1993, Gearhead® Magazine has been unique in the world of automotive journalism. Focusing on the lifestyle, stories and culture surrounding car enthusiasts, especially those in love with muscle cars and hot rods, the magazine became the world’s go-to source on the combined influences of pop culture, music and clothing on car culture and vise versa. It is a celebration of the DIY spirit in all things hot rods and rock and roll. Now in it\\'s 22nd year, Gearhead® Magazine is once again being published after a 5 year hiatus. Welcome to the relaunch of Gearhead! Pioneering a movement unheard of until the magazine bearing the name GEARHEAD was first published in May 1993, former editor Michael LaVella \\xa0masterminded and gave birth to a rebel child that would soon become the basis for a movement known as kustom kulture. Raising the banner of muscle cars and guitar crushing garage rock GEARHEAD MAGAZINE became infamous among those “in the know” as THEE tastemaker for all things hot rods and rock and roll. Kooks and weidos dug it, but so did the general public! Mention you read GEARHEAD, and you were instantly part of the cool kids\\' club!\\xa0 In 2000, the brand expanded to include the record label when Rev. Michelle became co-owner. Having met when both were writers for the critically acclaimed punk magazine Maximum Rock ‘n’ Roll, the two worked together to release over eighty records as well as create a line of clothing and accessories. \\xa0The team continued publication of the magazine, publishing one issue a year, with a goal to make it quarterly.\\xa0 Internationally recognized, the distinct logo and products associated with the brand were sold to over 50 countries. But all that hard work took it\\'s toll. The team split up in 2006 with Michelle taking over the record label, and Mike taking back the magazine.\\xa0 The magazine went dormant in 2009 when LaVella stepped away from publishing to pursue other interests, but demand never died. A whole new generation of rock and roll and hot rod enthusiasts grew up reading about the legendary magazine, but could only find back issues to whet their appetite.\\xa0 \\xa0In 2014 the magazine was once again returned to parent company Gearhead Productions, Inc., where owner Rev. Michelle Haunold now seeks to revive the much loved cooler than cool rag with the enthusiastic release of the long awaited issue Number Nineteen!\\xa0 When you pledge to support this project, you are funding the long-anticipated relaunch of Gearhead Magazine with issue #19. You are also helping to KEEP PRINT ALLIVE! Like the rest of the media world, physical products are going by the way side as it becomes cheaper to produce digitally. But nothing can replace the feel of a magazine in your hands, or the smell of a magazine as you flip through the pages.  That love of the actual product fueled the resurgence of vinyl in the music industry, and I’m hoping to tap into a similar passion for people who love printed media. I do also plan to make Gearhead available digitally for the first time for those who favor this form of content with print on demand and digital download options! But honestly, holding an actual magazine in your hands feels great, so why not go old school?\\xa0 Once this project funds, (because I know it will!) and this first re-launch issue is published, my goal is to eventually get the magazine up to being printed 4 times a year. This has been a goal of mine since I first started working on the magazine back in 2000! I’d also like to expand coverage to a wider variety of topics, and stories, because there\\'s so many great stories out there! Maybe it could even evolve into a podcast or TV show, you know? There\\'s so much cool stuff out there to discover and share! I’d also love to be able to start paying writers, who right now submit projects voluntarily simply because they want to be part of GEARHEAD. The money being raised during this campaign will be used to print the physical magazine. It will cost about $3500 to cover the printing costs. Any extra money will be used to pay a professional design artist who will handle the lay out of the magazine and setting up the files for print. If there’s extra money after all that, it will go into the redesign of the GEARHEAD website where customers can shop online, subscribe, stay current on what’s going on with Gearhead and follow all our social media sites.  I don\\'t want to reveal too much since I don\\'t want to spoil the surprise! But the new issue will be packed with cool stories not seen anywhere else and exclusive photos! Running about 80 pages, the magazine will feature a full-color cover with black and white book stock insides. It gives the magazine that vintage feel, much like the old school Hot Rod and Car Craft Magazines that were the original inspiration. It will be a limited edition run of 2500 printed copies, as well as available for digital download and print on demand. Among the articles you\\'ll get a \"from the pits\" look at the annual Yolo County Demolition Derby,  a behind the scenes look at the life of producer extraordinaire Kim Fowley, a short history of the custom car phenomenon from the \\'60s known as Zingers, and a chat with the creator of the wildly popular Lady Luck Tattoo Convention. Gearhead also sits down with Jake \"The Preacher\" Cavaliere, frontman for the long-running gear-grinding rock and roll band out of Los Angeles The Lords of Altamont. \\xa0And finally, the last known interview with Famous Monsters of Filmland creator, Forrest J. Ackerman.  There will also be lots of cool underground record reviews, movie and book reviews and lots more cool stuff for hep cats and kittens.\\xa0 Does any of this sound\\xa0interesting or fun?

I have had many influential teachers over the years, and one of them was Donna Bruton. She told me that the most important piece of advice she could give was to paint every day. I was unfortunately never able to tell her before she died how much impact her education had on me. \\xa0 This time will allow me to fully focus on creating paintings and drawings. The schedule that I have set has me completing one painting per day. I will be alternating between 3 different types of painting. \\xa0 1. Observational painting, where I look directly at real things like plants, and paint them. \\xa0\\xa0 2. Fusion painting, a technique where I take source material from a book of smaller drawings that I have done in the past, and combine them into one painting. 3.\\xa0Abstract painting, where I use techniques of painting like gradients, and then spontaneously improvise in a jazzy style.\\xa0\\xa0 I will also be completing drawings in colored pencil. These are the smaller and faster counterpart to the larger and slower paintings.\\xa0 With your support, I will be able to have a full month to focus on working on these paintings, and developing painting technique and theory.\\xa0 For a selection of my previous work, please visit my image site or play the video above. Thank you.\\xa0 http://natecarlsonpaintingdrawing.blogspot.com/', \"Bio My name is Kevin Boylan. I first studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\\xa0(PAFA) in Philadelphia as a Painting Major for two years. I discovered the  Florence Academy of Art (FAA) in my second year at PAFA and decided to continue my education there. I took a year off to work and saved everything to cover my first year in Florence studying at FAA. The next two years were spent going to school off and on while working to pay for the tuition when scholarships weren't enough. It's been a long hard road but I'm currently finishing my third and final year of FAA's program and expect to be back home in the states this summer. \\xa0 The Hudson River School Fellowship For those of you not familiar with the Hudson River School Fellowship, it's an annual prize for young painters who pursue working from nature. It's modeled itself after the tradition of the Hudson River School (a 19th century romanticism American art movement). It's put together by The New York Grand Central Academy\\xa0and takes a chosen handful of artists to experience three weeks of painting, lectures and talks by other artists. I've been accepted for this year's Fellowship.\\xa0 Why I need Kickstarter With help from FAA (The Florence Academy of Art) I've been able to complete my education, but not without serious sacrifices. I've received an excellent education but I've had to take time off to work and poured all my savings into finishing school. The Hudson River School Fellowship is a great way to mark the end of my schooling, get involved with artists from my home country and give me enough work to have my first show.\\xa0 The Fellowship has a small participation fee of $100 and the students are responsible for their own supplies and food.  This is where Kickstarter comes in. If successful this project will allow me to attend The Hudson River School Fellowship, have the supplies to draw and paint everyday while there, help with transportation, buy groceries for meals, and put together a small show exhibiting work from school and the fellowship.\\xa0 Thank you for your interest and support in my aspirations. A lot of you have already supported me in my journey and education, even aside from this project, I just wanted to say thank you.\\xa0 Follow my progress at the Hudson River School Fellowship on my blog www.KevinBoylanArt.Blogspot.com\\xa0\", \"After a decade in the outdoor industry as a ranger, educator, guide, and retailer, I am ready to launch a portfolio of outdoor goods that address the accessibility and sustainability needs of the outdoor industry.\\xa0 Since I was kid in scouts, I lusted over the top of the line backpacks, mess kits, and pocket knives, but growing up as a first generation POC, I didn't always have access to the best gear. As I replaced my aging, simple gear for new technical gear, something was missing. Working for a large retailer informed me about the ethics of the large companies pumping out gear, and exposed me to the waste of the increasingly fast seasonal refresh. I saw the serious enthusiasts and crusty dirt bags who designed all of the classic gear, responsible for opening the out doors for most of us, be replaced with the fashion industry's approach to manufacturing and design.\\xa0 Accessibility is an after thought, a point I had to confront recently as I tried to update my bike components and was looking at a price tag more than the bike was worth. Support me in filling out the empty bottom end of the outdoor industry with quality, affordable goods made in Minnesota by hand!\\xa0 I know, birds are so passé, but hear me out: icterids, or the blackbird family, are a great symbol of what I want my portfolio to represent: thoughtful tools built by and for those who exist on the fringes of the outdoor industry. I think of my operation as a form of brood parasitism: I am salvaging the excess material production of large companies to create gear for those looking for affordable gear.\\xa0 Let's face it, this is going to be a year of cutting back and looking for alternative solutions to daily problems, but don't let that keep you from using quality gear! Here's what I am doing and how you can help. I am setting out to create a line of simple and affordable backpacks and bags, among other experiments, that prioritize cost savings over bells and whistles. I will be using dead stock (material that is no longer wanted by the fashion/outdoor industry, sold at ~1/4 original cost) as the foundation of the line and sourcing quality notions ( hardware: buckles, thread, strapping, etc.) to incorporate serious functionality. The line will be made by hand in Duluth on my lovely Sailrite LSZ-1.\\xa0 Each design will prioritize functionality and relevance over flair and features, in other words just what you need and not what you don't.\\xa0 Current offerings: I'm weary of vapor ware, you should be too. This is why I am starting my funding request with small wallets and building the portfolio up slowly. One major aspect of preserving the value of my goal is keeping myself on track and producing rewards and designing the next offering in a timely fashion. I am a student of the lean, kanban, just-in-time models of production and will keep labor time down by streamlining specific runs of goods as they are funded.\\xa0 I have already made the initial investments in my business and have the materials and tools for the launch of this kickstarter, your contribution is funding the development of the next product in my line.\\xa0My funding goal of $250+ will buy the necessary yardage and appointments to design and produce my next line: storage cubes and two backpacks.\\xa0 The biggest challenge for me as a designer is building a logical portfolio to bring to production. I have been brainstorming ideas for years, but I probably shouldn't launch that tent for river guides just yet! If this campaign is funded, \\xa0I will be able to launch a small range of gear organization cubes and one or two backpacks. Beyond that, I'd like to have a line of bike bags (panniers, handlebar, and basket bags) and share my knowledge and designs with the DIY community, after all, we are all beta-testers and the best gear is customized to our individual needs.\\xa0 Thank you for checking out this project and contributing if you can, I hope to support your outdoor gear needs!\\xa0\", \"Hi!

Many of the birds were found while walking in downtown Minneapolis or St.Paul for the Audubon\\'s BirdSafe program during migration season. Birds are photographed intact and turned over to the Audubon society for collection and data entry.

On July 7, 2020, the over mile long Valdez Glacier ice shelf calved into thousands of pieces.

But what happens when we fall in love with the work of a musician, writer, or painter we see as anti-female? Do we rationalize our cognitive dissonance away, turn our back on the offending artist, or find a way to embrace the film or story that moves us while acknowledging what disturbs us about it? How does our attraction to misogynist art complicate our relationship to both the artist and feminism itself? When we asked these questions earlier this year in our call for submissions for It\\'s Complicated, we received an overwhelming response, both from contributors and those eager to see the project come to fruition. Although we originally intended to publish a single anthology of feminists\\' personal essays on loving misogynist art, it soon became clear that the potential subjects were endless and the range of approaches to them broad. Many writers told us they\\'d spent years thinking about their fraught relationship to a particular artist or work. In kicking off the project with a series of handmade, themed zines culled from the excellent submissions we received, we hope to start an ongoing cultural conversation about the uncomfortable yet influential role that misogynist art plays in our lives.\\xa0Over the next several months, our plan is to expand It\\'s Complicated into a book and create a website where even more contributors can publish their writing and readers are invited to participate in discussions on the topic.\\xa0The money we raise from this Kickstarter will fund the creation of two limited-edition zines: Totally Crushed Out, themed around the writers\\' teenage love of a problematic artist, and Identity Crisis, focused on contributors whose appreciation for a certain artist leaves them torn between their feminist values and some other aspect of their identity.

We have been focusing on this topic all throughout our classes. I am a big horror fan myself, and i have been watching almost all horror movies, and all i now need is YOU! I have the idea to make a danish version of a \"found footage\" film. In Denmark there has only been 1 \"found footage\" film ever. We have the perfect scenery. Creepy old forests, castles, mansions and other creepy areas. My idea is: A boy and his smaller sister is on a roadtrip with 2 girls. Their car gives up and the backpacking trip they were going on, starts sooner than expected. They have no GPS, NO cellphone signal and only each other. Lost in the huge forrest they encounter voodoo, old danish folklore and a creepy \"entity\" that just won\\'t leave them alone. They end their journey by an abandoned hospital, hungry, confused and with amnesia. They are less people than when they began.

At\\nseventeen, Debbie must meet her end of the bargain: A murderous task involving\\na beach house and Debbie’s classmates. The goal is to make a truly entertaining\\nhorror film that plays with genre conventions and throws out tiresome clichés\\nwhile also having a darkly humorous, surrealist tone. We have all seen the\\nmovie where a bunch of kids go to some secluded place and get picked off by\\nsome evil person or thing, so instead of laboriously going through the motions,\\nDebbie and The Devil approaches the story from an angle rarely seen in\\nmainstream horror films: It is from the perspective of the slasher, that, and\\nit’s meant to be fun. The\\nmajority of horror films are, quite frankly, cynical cash grabs. They are made\\nby committee, and usually the end result is a lifeless and a bit depressing\\nexercise in separating teenagers from their allowances. Debbie and The Devil is\\nmeant to be a lively, fun,\\xa0 and\\nshocking (in a fun way) experience. It is a movie made with midnight movie\\nmadness in mind. Tailor made for the following audience groups: horror lovers,\\ncinema lovers, lovers on dates and lovers of fresh, exciting cinema. Most\\nhorror movies, and, lets face it, movies in general, are painted by the\\nnumbers, Debbie and The Devil is a mad frenzy of a horror film, meant to make\\nthe audience giddy with excitement and disbelief. While the list of films and\\nfilmmakers that have inspired Debbie and The Devil could fill a large book,\\naside from the obvious influences like Tarantino and Eli Roth and Scorsese and\\nboth Anderson’s, Debbie and The Devil is strongly influenced by slasher films\\nand Italian Giallo movies like Argento’s Suspiria and the works of Mario Bava\\nand Lucio Fulci.

I think it’s important to acknowledge these global issues and find new ways for man made structures to work together within the landscape and improve the living of communities that are impacted by these factors.\\xa0 This project is very important to me because I set myself a task to launch my own personal first solo exhibition about something I am passionate about, with the hope to be able to positively influence everyone that comes to my exhibition about global issues and ways to overcome them.While enjoying the beauty of a two week long documentary project that explores the landscapes and communities of Indonesia.\\xa0 In order to make this happen, I need your help! As I am funding and running this project completely on my own, I kindly ask that you guys help me achieve my goal for this year, as I believe great things are done together. Furthermore, the big aim of this project is to come together, work as a community and make a difference for the better. Therefore with your help, my project can have a stepping stone to achieve more and impact people on a bigger scale towards the future.\\xa0 If you believe in my project and the aim behind it, please go and support. About the exhibition This exhibition will include roughly 10-20 pieces of A4 to A2 size prints, all covering a varied range of documentary images of the volcanic areas of 'Mount Bromo' and the 'Ijen Crater'.\\xa0 Following by a hard cover photo book, which will include research about the volcanos with further imagery and information gathered from the locals about their everyday lives in these conditions.\\xa0 Below I have included some of the photographs which will be displayed in the gallery and the photo-book so that you guys can see what to expect from the show.\\xa0 The Funding.\\xa0 The money raised from your donations will include the cost of the rental of the gallery space which is £1,200 for the week and £500 for the costs of printing and framing the images on the finest quality paper.\\xa0 Lastly, I would like to thank anyone who's supporting my project and I hope you enjoy my images and the project itself and will be able to take back something new for yourself and a story to tell others.\\xa0 Kind regards,\\xa0 Krista\", \"Project Goal I am excited to inform you, that I am launching the crowdfunding campaign to support my sixtcoming book, to be released in December 2019, in partnership with Escourbiac publication house. My photographic project is about documenting the Faroe islands archipelago - the green jewels in the North Atlantic ! The goal is to publish a Coffee Table Book about the nature and lifestyle found in the Faroe islands. I intend to print a hardcover version. The book will contain approximately 120 pages and the size format of 22x26 cm. I wish to share my images in the book with the public, to show the unique Faroe islands never seen before : its people, its exotic life forms and the harsh beauty of the landscape. Also, I wish to raise awareness of the risk of vanishing cultural heritages in the islands, like collecting bird eggs, raising faroe horses, agriculture and fishing traditions etc. Many people don’t even know where the Faroe islands lies and the destination is still quite unknown for many travellers. As part of the project, I will hold photographic exhibitions at various locations around the world.\\xa0 I expect the first exhibition to be shown in Paris, France in early 2020 and further on in Copenhagen, Denmark as part of a campaign promoting tourism to the Faroe islands. Supporting the project My Kickstarter backers have the option of receiving a fine art quality print of one image in the book or, a limited edition Coffee Table Book.\\xa0 Another option for the Kickstarter backers is to choose among various pictures on my website martinjohansen.com/gallery and order a print of 35 euros, in order to support my work and book project. My Background My name’s Martin N. Johansen, I’m originally from Denmark. My passion for the great outdoors and wildlife led me to become a nature photographer. For the past 28 years, I have specialising in photographing landscapes and animals around the world, on every continent, from New Zealand to Antarctica, France to Yemen. My photographs have appeared in many publications and have also been exhibited both in Europe and in the United States. Beside exploring the wild areas of Greenland and Iceland, I have been travelling widely in the Faroe Islands since 2008. Over the years, I've been adding many images to my archive. Recently, I collaborated with both danish, german and french magazines and published my articles and photo stories about the Faroe islands. What will my project involve ? My project have already involved lots of time and energy - more than 10 years and numerous trips to the Faroe islands.\\xa0 I expect to finish the final pictures end of october. I will then start editing and work on the lay-out of the book in collaboration with a graphic designer. Additionally, I will be adding illustrations in the book and expect to complete the final lay-out and illustrations early or mid-novembre, 2019.\", 'Hi! My name is Sarah and I’m a wife, mother and Disney fanatic living in the SE of England. In the past 18 months I’ve got into the Disney pin scene, building up great relationships with traders and sellers alike.\\xa0 Last year, I decided to dabble with creating my very own pin and after a tentative start, it sold out within a matter of months leaving me chomping at the bit to release another. I enjoyed the entire process, from spending hours creating and tweaking the design to get it just right, (waiting for the physical product was excrutiating though as I’m so impatient,) managing and setting up my own online shops, promoting and finally, packaging them up and sending them off to their new homes. I loved reading the positive feedback (all of which can be found on my Spookyloupins Etsy page) and seeing the tags on Instagram. Marie seemed like the perfect choice as the starter, for what I hope will become a mini series featuring several other Disney cats, because she is absolutely adorable (and sassy.) The addition of the daisies is a personal nod to my favourite film ’Alice in Wonderland.’ I wanted something playful and fun.

I\\'ve been writing and performing these songs for the past two years now, and after every performance, I get asked, \"Where can I download your music?\" And I never have a good answer. The songs are about telling stories and talking to the people listening. Shared experiences and personal relationships. I\\'ve tried to sit down and do simple recordings on my own, but I was never satisfied with the outcome, mostly because it lacked human connection and the songs seemed to pale in comparison to live performance. But. At the beginning of this year, I decided that I wanted to do something bigger with my music. Something more than one night at a bar or theater. Something that I could give to people, because ultimately that\\'s what it is, a gift. A bit of myself that I want to share with anyone that\\'s willing to listen, because I have a feeling that the listener will relate. So I needed to figure out how the music could translate from live performance to simply audio, because those are two very different things. One night at a dive bar in the east village, my friend Lorenzo Wolff convinced me to let him produce my album. (it didn\\'t take a ton of convincing...) Through his studio, Restoration Sound, I\\'ll have the opportunity to work with other musicians, who will help me create a fuller sound, and engineers, who will mix and blend the sounds so that there is balance. It will be my songs heard in a way that has only ever existed in my head, where they are always much bigger and more complicated, even though in reality they are just little things. It is going to take so much work. And time. And talent. Which is why I need to raise money. Work, time, and talent should be compensated. The money raised will go to pay the musicians that play on the album, and the engineers that put such meticulous work in finding that perfect mix. It will pay for studio time and for the time that Lorenzo puts into crafting other instrumentals and gorgeous harmonies to accompany me. It will pay the artist who creates the album cover and then the press that actually prints the album itself. The money you give will buy the meal I feed the musicians as we go into a twelve hour day of recording, because dear me, they need to eat. You see why I need your help? The amount that I am asking for is the bare minimum required. If we raise more than that, that means the album will be that much better. If a song desperately needs a harp, that extra money will pay for that harpist. So please empty your pockets into this kickstarter. And please tell your friends about it. I promise they\\'ll want to hear the music. I don\\'t know much, but I do know that it is good.', \"Hooray and thanks so much! \\xa0We made our goal! \\xa0You can still get the great deals listed on the rewards page for two more days, and the money will still go to production of the cd. \\xa0The full cost will be around 12,000 if all \\xa0goes as usual, and if I can cover even more of the expense, I'll be very grateful and promise to put it to good use. \\xa0Moonshine, Lime and Sugar started with this song at Clifftop last year!

During our first studio experience, we tracked three songs a day, and then took another day to do vocals on those three tracks. And then it costs the same amount to complete all of the post-production work with engineers to mix, and then subsequently master the album. When mixing for an album, it takes even longer than tracking. \\n   This puts us at approximately $10,000 just to complete the recording process.

Tenasie Bowe and Matt Kyler are two of the most talented young artists on the Nashville music scene today and are quickly being recognized as one of the next big things in Nashville!  The song, 'Where Is The Love' was inspired by the loss of one of my friends, Chuck Juba. Chuck was a high school friend with incredible musical abilities and I always thought he would go on to be a famous musician - his gift was just that great. Years go by like they do, and people lose track of old friends and as such I lost track of Chuck. In recent years the advent of social media has allowed many of us to re-connect with old friends and relatives we thought we'd never see again and so once I joined Facebook I set out to find all my old classmates of Arundel Sr. High School Class of 1980. I was shocked to learn eventually that Chuck has passed away after a decades long struggle with drug and alcohol addictions and long periods of homelessness in 2008. It took me a while to even comprehend the circumstances of his death and to this day I still can't understand it.... The song is an expression of my grief and I wrote it to make people more aware of the issues of addiction and homelessness that affects so many of our fellow citizens...

I have been making music for over 25 years. Almost EVERY time I finish a performance, people come up to ask me: \"Do you have any CDs for sale?\" Sadly, the answer is NO. It takes quite a bit of money to produce a CD! Well, now is your chance, fans of David Bryan! If we are able to raise these funds together, then I will be able to—for the first time—capture a performance with a high quality PROFESSIONAL recording (which shall be made available on digital download). This will not only allow you to carry my voice around in your Ipod wherever you go, but also then allows me to submit for consideration to play in various venues—as well as for music festivals all over the country. All money raised for this project will go entirely to help further my musical ambitions. Many people have told me over the course of my life that I have a beautiful voice. This praise is very gratifying, but often overshadowed in the face of the financial difficulties that this musician faces. (EVERY MUSICIAN has encountered such financial difficulties at one point or another!) That being said, after paying for the recording, every dollar contributed towards this project will in some way serve to create and sustain a path on which I can continue to share this wonderful gift which has been given to me: my voice. I am more excited about the possibilities for this particular concert than any other I have previously envisioned, as it is a tribute concert to my all-time favorite musician.

I'm a freelance artist and independent business owner, here to share with you my next project! Lets go meet the borbs! \\xa0Like a bird but much MUCH rounder - a bird orb = BORB!\\xa0These pins will be: \\xa0Meet the newest edition to the Chumby Borb Pin family: Pigeon Pals. These two adorable borb fronds come as a pair - that's right, two enamel pins together!! \\xa0The demand for Pigeons to be added to the family has been insane and so I'm super happy that I'm now getting the chance to do so. ADOPT OF PIGEON PAL NOW!!! • You will be paying a lower price for pre-ordering the pins through Kickstarter! They will be £7 in my shop and at conventions! • You will be getting extra Kickstarter-exclusive goodies such as the super cute stickers\\xa0 • Kickstarter is a very flexible platform - you commit now and pay later! This lets you manage your funds a lot better, and also gives you the ability to edit your pledge at any time, meaning you can increase, decrease or cancel it at any time until the campaign ends! \\xa0Once the initial £450 target is met and the campaign ends, the Pigeon designs will be able to go to print. Unlike my last Borb campaign, there are no other designs being added, as I am taking part in the Make100! The aim here is to get 100 Pairs of Pigeon Pals out to Backers! \\xa0Have you done this before? Yes! This is my second Enamel Pin Kickstarter and I have had a successful enamel pin Kickstarter campaign previously. Check out my previous Borbs Will the pins have custom backing cards? Yes! For this kickstarter it will be a large decorative backing card to accommodate both pigeon pals What clutch will they have? Because of the size it will be one clutch but hopefully with a rubber clutch When will I be charged? You will not be charged for your pledge until the campaign has been successfully funded. So you can pledge now and wont pay anything until the beginning of February. Will I receive both pins? Yes! this campaign is for a pair of pigeon pins What if I want more than one Pair of Pins? As I'm limiting this campaign to 100x Pairs to keep in line with the spirit of Make100, I have capped the tiers. Because of this there is only one option currently to add one pair. However, at the end of the campaign depending on availability, I might be able to do add ons. I will keep this in mind. How long will it take for me to receive my pins? As long as there are no delays with the manufacturing process, they should reach you sometime in April. I'm hoping earlier, but I'm giving myself a grace period for any delays. Once the pins are with me I'll be checking for any imperfections and then attaching the pins to backing cards and cutting stickers. I run my business on my own so you'll need to be patient with me once they arrive ^^;; Shipping times are estimated at UK: 2-4 days Europe: 7-14 days USA, Canada, Australia and the rest of the world: 14-21 days. N.B. These are estimates. I am based in the UK so please allow at least 21 days if you are outside of Europe What are the shipping charges? UK - £2 for 1st Class Royal Mail Everywhere Else - £4 for untracked international standard I've decided this time to keep the postage low as to not skew my goal total. It's difficult to gauge how much extra is needed for shipping for these campaigns and so this time I have kept them low at standard shipping. It's also more affordable for international backers - however, this means it will take longer for items to arrive. if you would like to upgrade to tracked be sure to add £5 to your pledge Why Kickstarter? Why pre-orders? I've wanted to design and have produced enamel pins for a long time now but the up front costs are quite pricey. Funding through Kickstarter is easy, simple and allows flexibility for backers. Will your pins be available in your shop/cons? Yes, hopefully if I can get enough made, any left over will go into my shop and to sell at cons, but they will be at the higher price of £7 a pin I have a question that wasn't answered here! Can I contact you? Sure! Feel free to DM me on here or over on my social medias :)\", 'Why Paint 100 Blue Face Paintings & Give them Away? Hi there. I\\'m Anna aka Bunny Glue. I\\'m an artist based in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Back in February I painted a blue face in acrylic on canvas. And then another. And just one more. Then I said to a friend, \"I\\'m going to paint one hundred of these.\" She shrugged and said, \"You\\'re crazy.\" And so I painted until I dreamed blue faces. And it was amazing.\\xa0 By June 25th I had finished painting one hundred. Now I have 100 paintings that need homes. Couches to live over. Other people to admire them. And I need money to buy more paint and canvas. They need homes. So here\\'s what I decided to do: 1. Give away 50 Paintings.  2. Swap 20 paintings for Karma. 3. Make a little pocket change (aka paint & canvas money) from choice. It\\'s not as complicated as it sounds.\\xa0 Shipping to US/Canada included in basic shipping pricing. I\\'m happy to ship internationally, just contact me and I can figure out any additional cost based on your location. All of the money raised will go to art supplies, developing art projects and studio costs.\\xa0My funding goal of $600 covers the cost of canvas for the project which is about one quarter of the total project cost when you factor in the other supplies (paint, brushes, glassine, protective foam etc) and shipping for the art that is involved.\\xa0 What are the paintings like?  You can see the paintings and pick out your favorite here: http://www.bunnyglue.com/blue.html Each painting is a 12 inch square one inch thick canvas suitable for easy immediate hanging. The paintings are in acrylic and most of the paint used is Kroma artist grade (some of the early paintings were student grade paint) and all of the paint used is light fast. Each painting depicts a blue face. The sooner you back the project, the more likely you are to get the painting of your choice! Preferences will be prioritized based first on reward level and second based on when you backed the project. Other ways to help?\\n•\\tLet your friends know about this project.\\n•\\tLike me on Facebook.\\n• \\xa0Follow me on Twitter. Thank you.\\xa0 You can see larger versions of the paintings at\\xa0http://www.bunnyglue.com/blue.html\\xa0but here is a quick preview', 'Over the next year, I will be traveling across Michigan to hike more than 300 trails, all while documenting my travels through photographs. My goal is to share some of the most beautiful and remote places in Michigan, some of which can only be reached by foot on a hiking trail. Throughout my journey I also plan to inform and educate people across Michigan and beyond, about the importance of wildlife and nature conservation. To assist the Michigan Wildlife Conservancy in their efforts, I will be donating 10% of the proceeds from the photo book, after its published, to help ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy the outdoors.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, not only for me, but for all of us to experience Michigan in a way that so few have been able to thus far. Join me on my mission to bring this breathtaking photo book to life, so that those across the US, and the world, can appreciate the wonders of Michigan that I have been lucky enough to appreciate my entire life.  Michigan is one of the top trial states in the nation, with well over 650 hiking trails. Although I will only reach less than half of those trails over the course of a year, I hope to bring to life the remaining trails in the years to come.\\xa0', 'DEMO. After the September 9th VZNBRAND launch, we have branched out and began working on and trying new things. VZNBRAND is entirely quality driven while maintaining superior design and concept, this is directly translated into the two part magazine that is \"DEMO\". DEMO is non-profit a summary of our love for everything. Initially, we wanted to do one magazine which focused on our own inspirations, creatives, and culture but as everything we do, it has snowballed into something else. It is with our pleasure to say that so far, nobody has turned down articles, interviews, and appearances in our magazine. This blessing is now allowing us to make this into a two-part publication, where we can focus on making this the best possible final product that can deliver all it is set out to.\\xa0 Both editions will release at the same time, and contain different artists, creatives, and cultural influencers. At this rate we have confirmed the artists and articles below, and have many others in the workings.\\xa0 DEMO Part One - Confirmed DEMO Part Two - Confirmed We are working on adding more people every day and we will provide the most balanced magazines that will surely shake up the journalism market.

I\\'m Audrey of Maintaining Mediocrity and together, we\\'re going to take a tour across the great land of Ooo. Before we begin, please remember to keep your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the vehicle at all time. What\\'s a Kickstarter? Kickstarter is a crowdfunding source where you help the creator bring their visions to life! In this case, a series of magical enamel pins. Think of it as a pre-order, but with extra benefits! Backers will receive frequent updates on the status of the pins during and after the campaign, a first look at the finished products, and most importantly, super super discounts!\\xa0 Why pledge? The prices listed for the Kickstarter are the cheapest I will ever be offering these pins. If you\\'re fast enough to snag an Early Bird tier, you\\'ll be getting a single pin for just $11- that\\'s $4 cheaper than retail price! Standard tiers are still discounted at $13 per pin. All leftover pins will be sold in my shop for $15 each. Additionally, you will not be charged until the end of the Kickstarter. You can adjust your pledge higher or lower (or even cancel your pledge altogether) throughout the duration of the campaign. For more details on how to adjust your pledge, scroll down to Pledge Adjustment. All of the current Day and Night pins will be hard enamel, gold plated, with two back posts for double security. These will be heftyboy pins spanning 2.25\" across! As these are Day and Night sets, the pins are designed to be worn in pairs of 2 (as shown below). I\\'ve designed them to fit together in any combination, so you can wear a day and night set of one kingdom, or mix n match your own pairs! Now let’s take a look at the designs! In addition to the Day and Night pins, I\\'ve also included my snail mini pins in the campaign. At 0.75\" across, these super tiny, kinda rude pins are the perfect size for discreet middle fingers (and they\\'re great as board fillers, too)! For the Kickstarter only, these snails will be $5 each (retail price $7) and available in 6 colors: pink, blue, yellow, purple, green, and LICH (glow in the dark). Please add $5 per snail to your pledge and in the survey after the campaign, you\\'ll be able to select which color(s) you\\'d like. At any time during the campaign, you can adjust your pledge higher or lower. Remember: you won\\'t be charged until the Kickstarter ends on Sat 1/25 at 11:59 PST. For early bird backers: please manually add +$11 per pin to your current pledge. For standard tier backers (non-early bird): no math required! Simply select the new tier and Kickstarter will automatically adjust your pledge accordingly. To add a tiny snail pin: for both early bird and standard tier backers, please manually add +$5 per snail to your current pledge. To add a banana guard pin: for both early bird and standard tier backers, please manually add +$9 per banana guard to your current pledge. January 9 - January 25: Kickstarter campaign February - March: pin production! Please keep an eye out for updates which will contain the first look at these pins during and post production. March - April: if all goes smoothly, the products will be delivered to me and I can send them all out to you! Funding during this campaign will go towards: 10%: Kickstarter fees 30%: shipping supplies (mailers) and shipping rewards to backers 60%: pin production and backer cards', \"\\xa0Who doesn't love pinnipeds?! These 4 pins represent some of our favorite mammals, whose survival all depend on the oceans we love. Okay, so they aren’t ALL pinnipeds but, for puns sake we are rolling with it!

As always, wear something that means something. <3 If our project is successfully funded, we will send out reward surveys to our backers! The reward surveys will allow you to choose your pins! :) If our project is not funded to the $500 goal, you will not be charged and we will not receive funds for this project. This Kickstarter's initial funding goal is $500 USD. This will help us produce all 4 hard enamel pins as well as help to cover backing cards, Kickstarter fees, taxes, and shipping costs/supplies. Though $500 USD doesn't cover all the fees, it will help us off to a great start!\\xa0 Once the Kickstarter has ended and backer surveys are completed, all pins will go on to production! Production takes an estimated 5-8 weeks. Estimated timeline (if we reach our goal early, we will update this!): How do I pledge? Just click the green “Back This Project” button on the campaign page or scroll down the page to select a reward tier! Do I get to choose my pins? \\xa0YES! If our project is successfully funded, meaning we reach our goal of $500 USD, we will send out surveys to all backers asking which pins you would like! \\xa0The reward surveys sent after the campaign ends will allow you to choose your pins! :) When are backers charged? If the project you’re backing is successfully funded, your card will be charged when the project reaches its funding deadline. If the project does not reach its funding goal, your card is never charged. What forms of payment are accepted? You can use a debit or credit card associated with Visa, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, or American Express. Discover and JCB cards are currently only accepted for US-based projects.

It is no longer a secret that bands (local and national) rarely make enough money to provide them with the tools necessary to spread their music as far as they can and with being able to offer multiple mediums from today's contemporary download cards and CD's to yesteryear's cassette tapes and vinyl records, we as musicians are able to reach a broad variety of listeners and collectors who may never have heard our music simply because of the device they prefer to experience it with!

I\\'ve been working in artist alleys on and off for the last few years, and I want to make the great leap into doing enamel pins. Recently I made my first pin, and it was a big success! I want to make another for the Make 100 here on kickstarter, and I knew exactly what i wanted to make. For a long time I\\'ve always enjoyed drawing animal skulls, and for this I wanted something related to where I currently live: California. BEAR SKULL AND POPPIES will be a 1.5\" gold hard enamel pin in creme, golden orange and accents of green and white. I will be doing a limited run of 100 for these pins.', \"To start out 2020 I have a trio of unrelated cat designs. \\xa0I have several larger more cohesive 'collections' that I want to release this year, so solo pins like these either need to have very short KS campaigns or be grouped together like this. \\xa0(I have another unrelated design that will be getting the one to two week treatment.) I completely understand that these may have different audiences so don't feel bad if you are only interested in one of these designs! My kids love for me to tell bedtime stories. \\xa0These stories often star their stuffed animals. \\xa0They have this little set of kitties that they love dearly. \\xa0One multi-chapter story involved a ninja kitty who trained their kitties as ninja so that they could team up and help him defeat an evil sorcerer. I designed 5 separate Ninja Kitties, but have chosen to have Snowflake as a ninja made into a pin. \\xa0Who knows, if this one is well received I may try to do the others at a later date.\\xa0 If you have ever simultaneously owned a cat and a laptop this design likely speaks to you. \\xa0Kitties love warm cozy places to nap and as we all know, if kitty fits, kitty sits! There are two things that are certain in life, death and coffee. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Late in 2019 my kitty of 14 years passed away. \\xa0I actually thought she was going to pass in 2017, so I was glad to get the extra time with her. \\xa0I wanted to do something as a tribute to her passing but given her rough personality a kitty with wings and a halo just didn't work for me. \\xa0I ended up designing this Kitty Reaper. \\xa0As for the coffee cup, well I like coffee. \\xa0Maybe the reaper decided to take a little coffee break in 2017. \\xa0 Here's to you, Lily!\\xa0 \\xa0My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. I am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins. \\xa0Many of my previous designs are available for sale through my online shop, frostdragondesigns.com. All of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers. I love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives. Every pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!\", 'I plan on completing a 50+ piece series depicting the abundant wildlife of my home state of Montana. The animals selected will encompass the majority of Montana\\'s mammals, birds, and fish. The stylistic manner in which I will approach these works, is a new, still developing technique that blends realism and cartooning. This strategy allows me to capture each animals personality, while accurately depicting its real life colors, markings, and textures. I find this style not only teaches the viewer about the biology of the animal, but also draws the viewer into a personal relationship with animal. My inspiration for this series came from my flagship painting attached to this project, the \"Bored\"-eal Owl. Budget Breakdown The first\\xa0expense of this project will be canvases. I intend to somewhat match the animals actual size to the canvas size, therefore canvases will range in size from 2x4 in. up to 4x6 ft. I\\xa0stretch my own canvases\\xa0that are over 16x20 in. in order to save money.\\xa0 $100 for wood for frames, $50 for \\xa0raw canvas, $50 for smaller canvases =$200 The final expenses for this project includes acrylic paint, spray paint and acrylic medium. Using large canvases and the vast number of pieces in this series will require a lot of paint. The acrylic medium allows me to capture more depth, while enhancing color. $40 for acrylic paint, $40 for acrylic medium, $20 spray paint (background texture) =$300.00 \\xa0If you have any questions feel free to contact me at a.grensten@gmail.com.

Naked Hippie Snacks is one of the first snack bars on the market that uses\\xa0hemp seeds as a plant-based protein source. And it\\'s delicious! The High on Protein bar combines hemp seeds, peanuts, figs and a medley of seeds for a taste that is reminiscent of a PB & J sandwich. The 56g bar clocks in at 250 calories, 6g of fiber and 10g of protein. It really is the best tasting, most natural protein bar out there! In addition to our vegan protein bar, we make a line of vegan snack bars that are just as healthy, but not as high in protein. These bars come in the following flavors: Off The Walnut,\\xa0which tastes like an oatmeal raisin cookie; Fudge N\\' Coconut,\\xa0a titillating trio of fair-trade, vegan dark chocolate, tart cherries and tropical coconut; Apricot Zing,\\xa0a healthy remake of a cranberry orange muffin; and Banana Bliss,\\xa0our twist on a vegan banana cream pie. Each bar is made with 10 or fewer ingredients, which even your kids can pronounce and understand. The base of the snack bar features organic, gluten-free oats, organic chia and flax seeds, and organic maple syrup. Next, we add slightly toasted\\xa0nuts, organic and un-sulfured dried fruits, and maybe some vegan, fair-trade dark chocolate or organic coconut, depending on the flavor. And unlike other bars on the market, Naked Hippie bars contain absolutely no soy, no gums, and no ingredients labeled “natural flavors.”\\xa0 Naked Hippie bars have gone through over two years of experimentation and taste-testing to ensure that they are not only more flavorful than any other bar, but also offer more balanced nutrition. Each ingredient is hand-picked for its health benefits, even our sweeteners. Here are our stats: each 52g bar has 250 calories or less, 6g of fiber, 6g of protein,\\xa0at least 1600mg of Omega-3, 12g of sugar from organic maple syrup and dried fruits.\\xa0 \\xa0 \"I absolutely loooove your bars! I tried one a couple of days ago at Romancing the Bean and I\\'ve been obsessed ever since! *heart eyes emoji*\"-Rebecca S. \"These bars are so good, I ate them all.\"-Jenna T. \"It’s crazy! I’ve come to realize I’m addicted to these bars. If somehow I get too distracted and don’t have one when I should…I suddenly crave it and have to reorganize my priorities!!!! They taste good and ARE good.\"-Terry G. \"I LOVE these bars! I was given the opportunity to try the bars with the drizzled chocolate on them and felt my chocolate craving satiated. The fact there are no flour products whatsoever in any of the Naked Hippie Snacks makes them a perfect choice for those who need to be gluten-free in their lives. I’m a chocolate lover with a massive sweet tooth and all the snacks take care of my cravings, yet are so much more healthy than a candy bar or cookie! Awesome job!\"-Kathy A. \"These are amazing for protein bars, The texture is good, and the flavor is perfect to me. So many protein bars have a heavy flavor or are sweet, this one avoids both. I never thought I would find a protein bar I liked.\"-Sheryl H. \\xa0 Chia seeds Containing a larger amount of omega-3 fatty acids than salmon, chia seeds are also very high in fiber (40% fiber by weight) and contain up to 14% protein by weight. They are high in antioxidants and studies have found that they may improve cardiovascular risk factors in Type 2 diabetes.\\xa0 Hemp seeds Considered the most nutritious seed in the world, hemp seeds are a complete protein with a highly concentrated balance of protein, essential Omega-3 and 6 fatty acids, and vitamins and minerals such as Magnesium, Vitamin E and Zinc. Flaxseeds A tablespoon of flaxseeds contains 1800 mg of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, an ingredient needed to carry out normal bodily functions. The daily consumption of flax may also play a role in preventing diabetes and lowering the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.\\xa0 Oats Organic, gluten-free oatmeal is unprocessed, high in fiber and rich in protein.  Among its benefits are the stabilization of blood sugar levels to gently pace your body’s nutrition absorption rate and the removal of bad cholesterol.\\xa0 Almonds A single serving of almonds has nearly 50% of your daily recommended Vitamin E intake. This vitamin has been shown to reduce the risks of cancer.\\xa0 Maple syrup In addition to being incredibly delicious and vegan, organic maple syrup has recently been discovered as a super food, much like broccoli and blueberries. Research from the University of Rhode Island has found that maple syrup contains compounds that may help manage Type 2 diabetes, prevent cancer and reduce inflammation. The 54 compounds in maple syrup all work together to create a natural sweetener that inhibits enzymes from converting carbohydrates to sugar and provides the body with essential vitamins and minerals including zinc, manganese, B2, biotin, calcium, Vitamin A, and many more.\\xa0 \\xa0 According to the Harvard School of Public Health, Omega-3 and Omega-6 are essential fatty acids, meaning they are required by our bodies to carry out vital functions, like building cell membranes in the brain and keeping bones strong. The problem in the Western diet is two-fold: we don’t get nearly enough Omega-3 fatty acids as we need and we consume way too much Omega-6 in the form of soybean and corn oils found in many fast food and overly processed foods. Human bodies require no more than 4 times as much Omega-6 as Omega-3 fatty acids, but our current diets are filled with over 40 times as much. \\xa0Naked Hippie bars contain a 1:2 ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6, that when paired with a more balanced daily diet, closes the gap between the two.\\xa0 \\xa0 For the past two years, Naked Hippie Snacks has been operating as a Cottage Food Kitchen business, meaning that we make the bars out of our home kitchen. Under the Cottage Food Act, we can only sell in Los Angeles County. We have been successful locally, selling out at coffee shops, grocery stores and artisan food fairs. Everyone who tastes these bars absolutely loves them.\\xa0 While producing these bars at home and selling them in LA has been a great way to start out and gauge people\\'s interest, it has been difficult to earn the capital we need to expand to a commercial kitchen. We want to produce in a commercial kitchen so we can ship nationally and share our healthy and delicious snacks with everyone.\\xa0 The funds we receive through this campaign will go toward three aspects of the business. It will fund rent and staff at our own commercial kitchen, the purchase of specialty, medium-scale equipment for production and packaging, and promotional materials and efforts such as distribution, trade shows, marketing and sales staff. Rather than sharing a kitchen with other producers, we would like to produce out of our own commercial kitchen so we can control and prevent contaminants such as animal products, gluten, soy, etc. Start the year off right with healthy, vegan snacks! If your New Year Resolution is to eat healthy, our bars will help you stay on track. Some of our rewards include a custom-designed Naked Hippie Snacks T-shirt. JUST BECAUSE OUR SNACKS ARE NAKED DOESN\\'T MEAN YOU SHOULD BE!\\xa0Cover up your naughty bits with our T-shirt that\\'s fun, fresh and vintage-inspired. Here\\'s a little peek at what it looks like: \\xa0', 'I am super excited about this project and I really want to get these songs out to you. I have enlisted the help of some great musicians and these are the songs you have been asking for.  1. Truth About an Outlaw\\xa0 2. (God Help My Mama) I Turned\\xa0 Out Like My Dad\\xa0 3. Let It Rain 4. Lie to Me I will be working with Don Dixon producing and playing bass. Jim Brock on percussion, Tomi Martin and Cooper Carter on guitar. With your help we can get these songs out to the world. ', \"Hey friends! So for the past few months I have been Recording and perfecting my EP\\xa0with Brian Crabtree at Rocket Skates Recording\\xa0. We are finally done! Unfortunately that only brings us about halfway and here is where i NEED you.\\xa0 I still have to mix and master and get Cd's Printed! Here are the costs: I've done the math and if i could spend a little money and create great perks for y'all we could get this record done! Check them out! If everyone can pitch in just a little you would make my dream come true and hopefully you will enjoy being a part of this.\\xa0 I invite all of you that haven't seen me play live please add me on facebook\\xa0https://www.facebook.com/michellemoonshinemusic\\xa0and come hang out with me! Thank you for being a part of this!\\xa0 -Michelle\", 'We have embarked on an exciting project to record our debut album (12 songs in total) with past and present members of the band. Years of playing, writing, laughing and performing all coming together to create an unique and eclectic album. We have funded the project ourselves this far but we\\'ve hit a block in the road. These things are expensive!!! The money you pledge will be used for mixing, mastering, duplicating, distributing and marketing our songs. We have 12 musicians in total including guest vocalists all with a different tones and qualities. We are from different musical backgrounds and walks of life but have joined forces to make a transatlantic, ericana vibe with lots of off-beat quirky zaniness. Its a celebration of the life and times of Wookalily. It\\'s been a great experience to make this music and we hope you all get to enjoy it as well. We are using Millbank Studios in Lisburn and the much sought after and talented sound engineer Michael Mormecha. \\xa0 A word from Michael...\"it\\'s the first of it\\'s kind to come out of Northern Ireland and it\\'s been really fun to make\" www.millbankstudios.net www.facebook.com/wookalily www.wookalily.com', 'Hello backers, \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Time for another adventure!! The Cathedral Grove Rainforest on Vancouver Island in BC is one of the most ancient and beautiful places in BC. I will be back packing with my awesome Dog \\xa0Kitchi to Vancouver Island for a week taking pictures at Cathedral Grove Rainforest for the Calendar. 800 year old giant redwood cedars, mossy landscapes and wildlife are a taste of what will make up the calendar. The funding will be spent on a high resolution camera, travel expenses and production costs at a local sighn shop, my favorite people for the job. Superior Signs in poco can handle anything, they have been very good to me with some imployment so it will be nice to bring them my project, Exciting!!', '\"My girlfriend and I have been making plant based, gluten free pizzas, and although we make them close to perfection every time - we are constantly improving!! We make everything from scratch including the dough, cheese and sauce using the healthiest, unrefined ingredients. Our gluten free crusts are made with brown rice flour, chia seeds, coconut oil and a grain/vegetable of your choosing(beet crust, sweet potato, plantain, lentil, bean, carrot,\\xa0zucchini).\\xa0\\xa0Our pizzas are so good and nourishing, we really want to share them in a larger scale! We provided samples at the farmers market and started taking personal orders for our customers who love our pizzas. \\n\\nWe need to raise funds in order to get our food vendors license and open a restaurant! \\n\\nTake note: meat eaters, vegetarians, and everyone in between —— This means so much because we believe its an experience that will nourish the body, mind and soul, it will leave you pleasantly full, satisfied and nourished. Specifically, we believe everyone will love our products.\\n\\nAs vegans, we will ensure no animal products are used making our products, and our pizzas are environmentally cool, and will be a fully alkaline meal! (Google this if you don’t know what we are referring to)… We want to share the message that you can eat a delicious, cruelty free, pizza that will leave you feeling electrified! \\n\\nYou may have heard it before, but just in case — ‘CHI’ means life energy or ‘prana’, it has many names\".\\xa0 Carlos and Laura instagram.com/pizzachi \\xa0']\n"
