  "Ademi Bar: Our Journey While looking back and thinking about where our journey started, we realized that the story of every entrepreneur and of every immigrant in the United States is very similar, it is the story of unimaginable hard work and never ending efforts to make it work. It was no different for us. Here we were in 2015, the newly immigrated and entrepreneurial just-married couple. I, Aizhan, think that this is where our journey had begun\u2026 Aidar thinks our journey started when we said NO to meat, but that is just a few months later, so let's not think about little differences but common points. It was 2015, when we started experimenting with food and trying out cooking for people. As new folks in town (country), we thought sharing food is the fastest way to find like minded friends which eventually turned out to be a good plan. Please note this for yourselves if any of you happen to move to a new place with no friends or family. We were cooking different sweets and snacks, sharing them with friends and neighbors. Then we started selling our creations at the farmers markets, pop up events and local stores here in San Francisco. You will be hearing this a lot throughout our Kickstarter campaign because we treasure all these moments very much and want you to see how much fun it can be - the cruelty free food, doing business and building your life from scratch. Being an entrepreneur by nature is not an easy thing. For us, being a true entrepreneur is finding one thing that motivates you so much that you are ready to put your whole life into it, as I said, not easy. But we were very lucky, we\u2019ve found that one thing that motivates both of us very much - the FOOD. The History Behind Ademi Bar We launched Ademi as a natural snack company back in 2016. We were influenced by traditional Indian treats like fruit based laddoos. We developed our own recipe and came up with a product Almond Date Bites. We worked on a label design, purchased packaging and obtained permission to sell at a local farmers\u2019 market. Although we tested out Almond Date Bites and a variety of other different products, the idea never really took off and as a result Ademi went into hibernation until February 2019. It was our family, friends and past customers who inspired us to design a new product. We went back to the drawing board but this time we wanted to make it right. We used the knowledge that was already gained and decided to try out a few of our recipes of plant-based protein bars.\u00a0 Some of them worked and some didn\u2019t. We had a fair share of triumphs and setbacks. But over time Ademi bars were selling out like hot cakes. People from different parts of town became frequent visitors to our tent at the farmers\u2019 market. We even started to deliver Ademi bars to local Bay Area marathon and triathlon clubs who were praising our bars and spreading the word. And of course we got some nice triathlon swag for free! That was the most precious, sweetest and coolest time. We experimented with different packaging too, because our original packaging was not strong enough, or couldn\u2019t hold the vacuum, or wasn\u2019t professional enough.\u00a0 This was all valuable feedback from our customers, which we listened to and followed. We always came back to our drawing board and re-designed, re-packaged and re-worked our bars. This kept us on our toes and prepared us for the next push. We outgrew the farmers\u2019 market and found a manufacturing partner who helped us to improve our recipes and introduced us to the world of professional packaging. With all new packaging and manufacturing support our capabilities became endless. We started selling Ademi bars on Amazon and to the local Bay Area shops and supermarkets. They quickly gained popularity on Amazon and in the Bay Area.\u00a0 At the same time we developed marketing and sales strategy and found more about our target customers. Our buyers like that Ademi bars are not overly sweet, large in size, great for digestion, high in dietary fiber and chickpea protein, low in ingredients list count and taste good. Ademi bars simply do their job! With our success in the last few months, it has become clear that we've outgrown the farmers\u2019 market. We have worked hard, but have sometimes really struggled to keep up with demand. Why does Ademi Bar need your help? The next step for Ademi bars to grow would be to offer more exciting flavors to a wider audience! The Ademi community is vast, filled with amazing customers who are extremely supportive of our product, our journey, and who share our passion for vegan life style. \u00a0We would LOVE your help and support as we try to bring and widen our passion in the US. We are hosting this Kickstarter campaign to help build brand recognition for Ademi bars and develop new and exciting flavors. While there are a handful of companies that are dedicated to the plant-based nutrition bar arena, we believe we are still early to market. Ademi Bars need your support because we want to make Ademi a part of a plant-based revolution. As a community we can change the way we eat, the way we treat each other and animals and the way we care for our nature. What will our backers get by contributing? You will get our many many thanks for supporting our small business and helping to bring our dreams to life!!! In terms of Kickstarter rewards, you have the options for the following depending on the reward level you choose: (Please see Rewards options; it's a top menu item on a mobile device, or it's on the right on the desktop version) What will our contribution bring to Ademi Bar: We\u2019ve designed two pilot flavors and manufactured beta batch of 5,000 chocolate sea salt Ademi bars, but need your help for the next step: What will be covered by Ademi: When will you start selling? We plan to start selling Ademi bars on November 5th, 2021! We will send updates to backers and post key updates on this page. Why now? We are deeply grateful to our customers and partners for their support and where this journey has brought us so far. The last couple of years have not been easy. Taking Ademi out of hibernation, searching for the right manufacturing partner, developing recipes and packaging design, establishing distribution network by pushing online and offline sales - it\u2019s been a tough play, especially during pandemic. During the last two years we have been able to get to know more local convenience store owners and coffee shop owners than we have ever known in our lifetime. Running a small business makes you get into the funniest situations like discovering that Ademi bars sell in good volumes at liquor stores and the saddest situations where some of our best distribution partners had to go out of business or risked to shut their doors for good due to pandemic. This provided us an opportunity to learn and open our minds. Support from our distribution partners and online customers have been inspiring us and providing much needed validation that Ademi bars can do the job. It is only when they keep calling us back and requesting more bars when the reality hits - OMG, Ademi Bars sell! The excitement, gratitude and faith in our mission and product make us want to push forward! Our distribution partners are waiting for us to develop and offer a wide variety of flavors with beautiful and shiny packaging so that they can start leveraging our renewed capabilities and put Ademi bars on the shelves to compete with other brands. Stores and distribution network partners pretty much sell the real estate in the form of shelves and they are keen on filling the shelves with the few brands that have multiple flavors to offer.\u00a0 This is how products like Ademi bars become noticeable by customers who search for their favorite flavors. We hope this will give Ademi bars a better opportunity to compete, fulfill our mission and expand. Let\u2019s unleash the full potential of Ademi Bar! We are still in the middle of a global pandemic, and the times are uncertain. But, it is what it is, we can\u2019t change it, we can only look forward, carry on and hope for the best. In these uncertain times, we are turning to you - our backers, for your help to get Ademi forward. We\u2019ve done all we could by sustaining Ademi with our savings and loans. What next for Ademi Bar? It is important to continue working and ensuring that growth is consistent. We have the product, mission, now we need to add more flavors, improve packaging, marketing and push offline and online sales. As long as we are in business and not hibernating, the momentum shouldn\u2019t be lost. It will be easier to improve profitability once sales are consistent and rising. We are also planning to control and manage our own supply chain, this way we can manage costs at every turn. What happens if this fundraising campaign fails to meet its goal? It is expensive to run an early stage nutritional food business. If we don\u2019t meet our funding goal, Ademi bars will not live on and we will have to shut down our business.",

Within weeks of adopting a Gluten free diet I started to see visible results. I wanted to go fully Plant-Based, but I never could because I couldn't replace my breakfast.

  "Shortly after the new year, I was notified that I was accepted into the Art Students League of NY's Residency at Vytlacil in Sparkill, NY and awarded a full scholarship to cover the costs of studio and housing for the month of June. I'm over-the-moon excited about this opportunity to submerge completely into my work for a full 4 weeks! I want to maximize this opportunity and the proximity to NYC's unique burlesque scene by bringing these performers into my studio. With this favorable time I shall observe and study each performer and their elaborate costumes from life, creating new works surpassing what I have accomplished to date. I plan to create multiple works during the residency, and am excited to announce those whom I am working with in the coming weeks! I am excited to work with the very top level of performers in the field. Among the list of performers working with me on this project is someone considered to be one of the single most important influences in that field today! The official lineup includes: Peekaboo Pointe, Delysia LaChatte, Amber Ray, and Dirty Martini! The vast majority of funds raised will be used to pay for the performer, model and costume costs for this project. The rest of the funds will be used to cover postproduction costs for posters and prints. In 2010 I started a series of paintings that focused on local Kansas City performers of various types; fire dancers, jugglers, singers, and burlesque artists. At first I saw this as a chance to explore the alter egos of people who develop an on-stage persona and live in a way that is free from the constraints of typical daily American life. Over time I found that something about burlesque resonated with me on a personal level. I began to see beyond performances and props and realized the underlying theme of women who live liberated from the status quo of a misogynistic society. The burlesque stage is a place where women (and men, straight, gay, queer, and transgender all equally welcome) are free to express their sexuality without shame, and without the need to pander to or protect themselves from male desires. Body positivity and self-expression are encouraged if not required, and feminist social commentaries are applauded rather than discounted. What a wonderful world! In my paintings, I seek to stir this feeling of power and freedom in the viewer, allowing them to vicariously experience the confidence, power, and abandon I've felt in the presence of these performers. Moreover, I present images of women as sexual subjects in a medium traditionally associated with respectability, making\u00a0a subtle statement not only about the social perception of the performers specifically, but about women's sexuality in general. As a thank you for supporting my goals during this residency, I will invite you to follow my progress via a secret blog where I will post exclusive photos, stories, and videos throughout the month of June and beyond! I also offer a variety of rewards including posters of some of my most popular paintings, Skype sessions, and original artwork. Finally, if you are as excited as I am about the opportunity to work with one of today's most celebrated burlesque figures, choose a poster, limited edition print, or heck, commission an original oil painting! \u00a0Although life as an artist comes with it\u2019s own set of hurdles and challenges; I have been fortunate to have experienced such intense and moving support from those within and outside the artist community. Knowing that there are people out there that appreciate my work keeps me going through both the challenges as well as the good times... I thank you most sincerely!",
  "In our society, many issues exist that people live with as part of their day to day lives. \u00a0Such issues include discrimination (race, gender, etc.) rape, sexual assault, abuse, bullying, poverty, body image, suicide, depression, and so many more. \u00a0As someone who was bullied for most of his schooling career, I feel very strongly about raising awareness of these many issues. This is a project I have wanted to do for years, but such a major undertaking is of course, very expensive. \u00a0To make this project a reality, I need more than just a single camera. \u00a0I need a studio so that I can mold my photos into what I want. Equipment, such as lights, video cameras, and other items are essential. Finally, it's necessary to hire models or pay to bring survivors to me so that they can be a part of this project. \u00a0This is no small idea.That's where you come in. \u00a0I have created a KickStarter page for this project. My goal is not just to do this for myself, but to raise awareness on a global scale. \u00a0But to do it, I need your help. \u00a0If you support this cause, know someone who is a survivor, or are one yourself, consider donating. Every donation will go towards making this a reality. \u00a0And if you'd be interested in working on this project, contact me! Together, we can improve awareness and the lives of people around the world. Photo credit - Angela Butler on Flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/angelamarybutler/5443734909/",

  "The Cult of Ammon is the story of Chuck and Brad, two naive college kids on a weekend getaway with their new girlfriends. The girls, Amelia and Cynthia, take them to their family\u2019s land deep in the woods for a sexy weekend of camping, drinking, and drugs. The guys start to realize too late, however, that they may have wandered into a dangerous situation. The film is inspired by the classic horror films of the 70\u2019s, exploring the ideas of the occult, nature worship, and human sacrifice. Centered on the traditions of hoodoo, it blurs the lines of what is real and what is a superstition. A homage to horror classics, it will blend the lines of frightening and funny.\u00a0 The Cult of Ammon is an ambitious project, so we're making sure our budget is as tight as can be. Primarily, a large portion of our funding will go to purchasing film, developing and scanning. Finding Aaton a-minima spools has been difficult, but we've sourced a steady supply in California. We're calling in a lot of favors when it comes to equipment rental. In addition to our film needs, a large portion of the budget will be going to our cast. Our crew is passionate about this project, and we are all volunteering our time to make it happen - but we feel feeding, housing and paying our actors is of the utmost importance. Happy actors means better filmmaking for everyone.\u00a0 We've been hard at work creating props and set pieces, and are now at a point to where we are on track to begin preliminary photography in early October. Though we'll be sad to see them go, we are happy some of the more iconic ones will go to a good home.\u00a0 \n We can't thank you enough for all the support, and we'll be sure to keep you updated on our progress. We are story-tellers who are determined to keep the art of film alive - and we think sharing our experiences is the best way to spread the knowledge. \u00a0",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQH2WJmB8CU Decisions is a short horror film from the creators of 'Meat' which is to be featured in the horror anthology series 'World of Death'. This is Johnny Saurette's second time directing.  He is the founder of Cannibal Fx special effects studio. Our team, which consists of Kristen Saurette-Brady and Leann Brady, is fully committed to bringing you an amazing movie experience but we need a little help from you. We are asking for a donation of $1,000 (total) which will go directly to the making of the movie.  The following is a cost analysis:   With the funding we already have from Still Rings True Productions we need: $450 for Special Effects- We are firm believers in practical effects. Cannibal FX will be doing all special effects work and it is a huge chunk of our funding goal but it will be well worth it in the end. $200 for camera equipment- We will be shooting all of Decisions on DSLRS which we own so production cost will be very low. The $200 will be for a boom mic and any unexpected repairs we need. $350 for editing and distribution- The remaining money will go directly to editing and distribution. We are renting a high powered desktop to do our editing on. We also plan on releasing the short on our website however we will be taking pre orders and will be selling our film on DVD along with our other shorts. We will be using any all and all of your contributions towards the film. ",
  "\u00a0Hullo there! My name is Emily, though I go by Leebobawitz on the internet (Etsy, Twitter, and Instagram). Earlier this year I launched the 'I Ship It!' Kickstarter, and together we brought over 15 pins to life and raised over $17,000. As I worked more and more on the project, I realized just how many tropes were still left and how many folks wanted. So, this sequel to the project brings together the top tropes from the last project's poll. \u00a0. These are the designs that were crafted with the guidance of the Draft-Room tier backers. I think they turned out pretty awesome, and they will be available to add on to your pledge! . Along with the monetary stretch goals, there are also social media stretch goals! Help spread the word and unlock additional goodies! After the success of four projects, I have learned a LOT about timetables. The following timeline is made based on the use of my tried-and-true production company. They have produced excellent quality pins and I feel very confident in their abilities to create my pins in a timely manner. This will hopefully make the timeline below a reality. July: August: Late August/Early September: --- My initial goal is to fund the 'A.U. AUTHORITY' pin and the 'I \u2764 FANFIC!' sticker. The goal covers the production of pin, packaging, Kickstarter fees, and shipping. The goal to achieve this is: $350. Here's the breakdown: PINs & STICKERs: 65-70% SHIPPING: 22-25% KICKSTARTER FEES: 8-10% Why the increase from the last project? I want to upgrade the production time, which would make the wait for the pins 50% shorter. It does, however, cost a bit more. Thus, the upgrade to the goals. Thank you for taking a look at my project, I hope that it made you smile and show your favorite tropes with pride! <3",

  "GREETINGS! \n\nHello Friends! Hope this finds you well, hunkering down, readying for winter\u2026 Thanks for checking out our Kickstarter page! First, a few facts about the Lonely Heartstring Band\u2026We met up through the American Roots Music program at Berklee College of Music in Boston. \u00a0For a gig in September of 2012 we were asked to play only Beatles' music--using bluegrass instrumentation. \u00a0From the first rehearsal, there was great chemistry, and we decided that we\u2019d take the band seriously and carry it beyond that gig (and beyond just the Beatles!). \u00a0Our inspiration ranges from bluegrass, old time, jazz, classical music, and more. \u00a0Since 2012, we\u2019ve been writing and arranging our music, exploring traditional music, and touring the continent. This past summer, we toured extensively from May until September, playing festivals on both coasts and in both Canada and the USA. Being our first tour, the band matured in a way that only tour can do, and we feel that we\u2019re ready to make our first record!\n\n WHAT?!\n\n With your support, the Lonely Heartstring Band will make the record of our dreams!  With a dozen songs ready to record\u2013 most of them originals \u2013 and a handful more just around the corner, we think that this January will be the right time to get into the studio. It\u2019s late November now, and we haven't booked any shows between now and mid-January so that we can completely focus on preparing to record. We\u2019re rehearsing almost every day, getting our material studio-ready, and with each day that passes, we\u2019re all a little more excited to get these songs recorded and into your stereos!\n\n WHERE?!\n\n We\u2019ve chosen the Great North Sound Society in Parsonsfield, Maine as our studio of choice for this record. It\u2019s a beautiful 18th century farmhouse converted into a remote, tucked-away, cell-reception-free (yesssss), live-in studio. It\u2019s been the studio-of-choice for some amazing sounding records (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive, Joy Kills Sorrow), and we\u2019ve booked ourselves a full week! It\u2019s got a large open main(e) room for all the bed tracks, and the rest of the house will serve as isolation booths for all the extra bits\u2026 not to mention sleeping spaces and tri-harmony-around-the-fireplace-zones. WHO?!\n\n We\u2019ve enlisted the masterful work of David Travers-Smith of Toronto, Ontario to come to Maine and engineer, produce, mix and master this record. He\u2019s worked with fabulous artists (Wailin\u2019 Jennys, Jayme Stone and many many more) and his knowledge of traditional, pop, vocal and new acoustic music makes him the ideal man for the job.  He\u2019s got a ton of experience, and he\u2019ll be coming down early to work some pre-production with us. He\u2019s an awesome guy, and we\u2019re really excited to be enlisting his help for this project.\n\n HOW?!\n\n We\u2019ve lined up everything we can to make this record the best it can possibly be, from David the producer, the studio, the material, the warm wool sweaters and the excitement\u2026 Our last big step is your support through this Kickstarter! So THANK YOU! We love you all. It would he a HUGE help to us if you could share our Kickstarter with your communities. We look forward with sharing our music with you, we couldn\u2019t do this without Your Help!!!\n Stay tuned for updates as we get closer to the release date!",

We are passionate about ingredients and read labels meticulously - Are these ingredients healthy? \u00a0Were they sourced and processed ethically? \u00a0Do any of them cause anxiety because we don't believe they should be in our food? Unfortunately, when it comes to convenience there are few choices in \u00a0non-allergen 100% whole-food, plant-based proteins, today we have few choices:\u00a0 We wanted more convenient, tasty and healthy options - and since, we've been on a mission to make lightly processed 100% whole-food plant-based meat alternatives that are delicious and accessible. \u00a0 We've spent years developing products diverse enough to satisfy the student population at ASU to the international tourists eating NexVeg\u2122 at our National Parks, like the Grand Canyon. Those regional opportunities validated our recipes and allowed us to build a small kitchen; where our purveying, processing and distribution systems have won 2 sustainability awards. \u00a0The next step, is getting NexVeg on your doorstep! Clearly it all starts with 100% whole foods and admittedly, our goal is to do as little processing as possible, as fast as possible. \u00a0 Our micro-batching process lets us choose the freshest ingredients that travel the fewest miles to our production kitchens. \u00a0We lightly process them into NexVeg varieties. \u00a0Then we distribute them utilizing GreenCell sustainable packaging materials, and the direct ground-based shipping services of FedEx\u00ae. We evaluate ingredients for the opportunity to be: We flash freeze and vacuum seal, retaining freshness and eliminating nutritional degradation caused by air or frostbite. We are asking you to take the next step with us toward eliminating animal agriculture by backing our award winning systems to serve more people. We know how hard it is to find out online what's really in your food. \u00a0We love sharing every little detail about what goes into NexVeg.\u00a0 Let's start with these USDA panels and some photos of the actual ingredients that we process into NexVeg. Remember, in order to maximize the quality and minimize the footprint we choose the freshest ingredients that travel the fewest miles to our production kitchens. \u00a0Here's what those fresh East / West ingredients look like, when they arrive at our kitchens. In fact, we take our ingredients even a bit more seriously than that:\u00a0 1) It's delicious. \u00a0We've tested more than 208 recipes and served 1,000,000 portions to get to our 3 current product lines and 6 flavor profiles. 2) It's healthy. \u00a0Whole food diets are medically proven to lower risk of heart disease and control weight gain.\u00a0 3) It's sustainable. \u00a0Lightly processing whole foods consumes less water, produces less carbon and \u00a0creates less food waste than heavy processing of plants or raising animals. 4) It's easy. \u00a0NexVeg is formable like ground meat and cooks fast in a skillet or the oven. \u00a0It is great for bulk prep and can be plated hot or cold. \u00a0There's a variety worthy of replacing the meat in your favorite comfort foods no matter the cuisine. Whether you love the performance protein in the NexVeg Hemp & Seed line or the intense sustainable and healthy eating ethos of NexVeg Tepary, or the comforting familiarity of \u00a0Black Beans, there's a NexVeg product for you:\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps you've seen \"The Game Changers\" , \"What the Health\", \"Plant Pure Nation\", etc... or otherwise learned through your or other's personal experiences; but if your looking for more reasons here's some solid health and sustainability science we find meaningful : \u00a0Hello! My name is Jonathan Netzky. I\u2019m passionate about local, fresh, whole foods and the health and sustainability benefits they provide.\u00a0 Over the last 15 years, I have made farm-to-table dining possible and meaningful beyond my own home. We are now ready to close a gap in the plant-based protein market with a locally-sourced, farmer's market quality, whole-food protein option - that everyone can enjoy! Leading industry chefs have served NexVeg\u2122 products in their restaurants and helped us hone our recipes based on customer feedback. Now, with your backing, we can provide nationwide, direct-to-consumer access to healthy and delicious plant-pure proteins. Ready to join us in this mission? - sharing real food, feeding the change!

  "\u00a0I'm here at it again with some original enamel pin designs as well as fan designs! I started making pins back in late 2018 and my collection has just grown so much thanks to the support found on here and on my other platforms! This time will be a collection of chain enamel pins to add to my hoard of pins! This is a project that needs a much higher capital of funding. So here I am! In spite of this horrible start of the year with the global crisis. I'm going to keep my head up and stay strong making more pins in support and in long term goals. This world COVID has definitely hit myself and a lot of artists down to the ground. Now with the new update mid month, of how our POC are being disgraced and shamed, now more than ever, we need to support them and take care of each other. No matter what, thank you always for the encouragement and please continue to support other artists, communities, and our people. I've learned my lesson in multiple areas in terms of growth in design and making this process much smoother and with even more precaution than before. I will continue to grow and expand my collection beyond even what I have now.\u00a0 \u2727 [ All Large Pins are to be ~38-40mm with Backing Posts x2 ] [ All Small Pins are to be ~28-32mm with Backing Posts x1 ] [Chains will measure at 6-12 cm depending on the design ] \u00a0...\u2726 . .

  "I\u2019m Dr\u00e9 of PintasticPH. This is my first project or campaign on Kickstarter and hopefully I\u2019ll reach the goal to make this project a success. This project is inspired by Taylor Swift\u2019s latest album \u201cLover\u201d. I have already produced one design \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d and out on my Etsy Store. The initial goal of this campaign ($350) is for the Lover Pin. Once the campaign ends and reaches its goal that\u2019s only time where Kickstarter charges you. Then we will send you a survey for you to choose which pin/s you like and also to collect shipping address.\u00a0If the campaign is not successful, you will \u00a0not be charged. During the campaign, these pins will be sold at a discounted price ($8 - $49 USD, if you\u2019re Early Bird). Pins will be sold on a regular price after the campaign ($12/pin USD). This collection features six (6) songs on the album: Pins will have: Timeline: REMINDER AND DISCLAIMER: I am shipping from Manila, Philippines. Pins will probably get to you around September or earlier (Depends on the production of pins). All pins will be sent as registered airmail. Average shipping time is as follows: \u26a0\ufe0f Backers are responsible for any customs fees their country may ask for. I would highly appreciate if you will share this campaign to your friends or on any of your social media. Disclaimer: This is not official a merchandise of Taylor Swift.

  "My name is Francesca Chaney, I am a 23-year old restauranteur and tastemaker. On August 15, 2015 I launched \"Sol Sips\". Originally this concept started as a way to encourage myself and my community to consume more fruits and veggies for more energy and healthier living. I'd wake up early on the weekends and make drinks to sell at my cousin's apothecary in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. At the time, I was also a full- time student at Brooklyn College, a doula and a nanny, As a nineteen year old, I did not have all the answers, but I did know a few things- 1) I'm passionate about curating accessible \"feel good\" experiences for my community, 2) I want to further develop my \"Sol Sips\" concept. After a couple years of doing pop-ups, drafting business plans and receiving feedback from mentors and family, an opportunity for a three month brick and mortar pop up fell into my lap via Craigslist. On December 2017 we opened \"Sol Sips Vegan Bevs and Bites\" in Bushwick, NY with the intention of staying for three months to test the waters. At the end of our three month test run our customers and the landlord of the space encouraged us to find a way to permanently stay. At the time it seemed unpromising to jump into owning and operating a restaurant as a 21-year old while finding the funds to do so. \u00a0I decided to go for it and launched a $50,000 crowd-funder, in addition to a family/friends round of funding. We didn't reach our goal of $50,000- instead we raised $5,000 and my family and friends raised $15,000. Although I didn't reach the goal- I was determined to make it work. Now almost two years later we are here and still standing. \u00a0 The passion and care that we put into our food is evident. We need support with gathering the final resources to open the doors of \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\", our new location in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, NY. This is a refreshing opportunity that would allow us to serve more people, expand our menu and incorporate the elements of fellowship that love so much. This includes live music, dj sets, art, storytelling and most important- a brave and comfortable space for black/poc people and families to commune and be nourished.\u00a0 The inclusivity of this upcoming space is what we are most excited about. We've witnessed the power of accessible wellness and community here in our current location of \u00a0300sq ft. In February of 2018 we introduced out \"Sliding Scale Brunch\", encouraging people from all walks of life to test the waters of plant based food in an affordable manner. They are given the option to pay what they can, based on what they can afford. Our commitment to giving everyone the access to eating healthy is what drives us. It is also what drives our customers to continue communing with us.\u00a0 Sustaining our customer base and the rising volume of our orders in our current Bushwick location is causing the inevitable discomforts of growth which effects the customer experience and also makes it difficult for us to further evolve. We are evolving from the cramped space of our current \"Sol Sips Bevs and Bites\" location- where customers often bump shoulders in this 9-seat space. Our tiny and beautiful space has served as our restaurant/cafe hybrid for nearly two years, we've truly learned the power of \"working with what we've got\". At last, we'll be able to scale it back down to a cafe space where dinners can come in for a quick beverage and bite that can be accommodated with \u00a0the tools and resources we have here in the space.\u00a0 \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" is a larger space that will provide more comfort to our dinners. We encourage our guests to stay for a while and take up space. We are excited to see people bring their friends and family along to enjoy great food, service and a good time!\u00a0 Click below to learn more about our vision for \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" in New York Times' T-Magazine below.\u00a0 Article by Wilbert Cooper\u00a0 We've already invested a lot into our new space and we'll continue to work towards reaching our funding goals. We're confident that this Kickstarter will support us in opening \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" this fall. We are currently training a solid team of staff and working with an amazing architect to complete our design plan of a full-service dinning room, bar and stage. We've started collaborating with artists and musicians who are excited about curating residencies in the space that coincides with our dining experiences. We've even developed a unique and intentional menu that centers afro-indigenous and black southern cuisines with just plants- making most of our menu soy-free and gluten-free.\u00a0 Meeting our goal of $250,000 will enable us to:\u00a0 I've built Sol Sips from scratch- but not alone. Every step of the way I've been met with the support of my \"village\" of family, friends, mentors, community, organizations, allies and strangers. For this, I am grateful. \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" will reflect the power of gathering by providing vitality, love and innovation in every taste, scent, sight and sound.\u00a0 We look forward to sharing space and fellowship with you.\u00a0 Much Gratitude.\u00a0",
  "I\u2019m Greg, I\u2019m the typical \u2018\u2019average italian\u2019\u2019 born and raised between football and tasty food. I spent most of my 20s locked in my room until, five years ago, I decided to give a twist to my life by changing completely my daily routine: sport and healthy food replaced videogames and junk food. It\u2019s been a long time since I got over this negative part of my life and, today, I\u2019m ready to live a better part of it and to put myself out there, focusing everything on healthy food. Cados was born, at least as a concept, circa a year ago; since then my idea has changed many times until becoming the actual one which shares the same aim as the original one, even though it\u2019s a lot different: producing high quality avocado snacks and selling them at an affordable price. To do so I\u2019m going to use an atypical internal politcs, that uses quality and a good price as it\u2019s ONLY advertisement; I wanted, for the same reason, to limit as reasonably as possible the net gain on the finished product (keeping it around 5%) to promote an higher quality/price ratio. The products available at the launch of Cados will be 2: \u00b7 AVOCADO CHIPS: simple avocado chips, ready to be devoured at any time. \u00b7 AVOCUDDLE: the perfect synthesis between the classic potato chips bag and avocado. Despite having in mind 3 new types of snacks I believe, at the current state, that only these are suitable for marketing but it\u2019s also possible that, until January 2020, on the official e-shop some of these could already be available. I want to be very trasparent so, below, I left you a short but complete list of how funds raised through this campaign will be used, with the relative percentages: \u00b7 FIRST STOCK OF RAW MATERIALS (70%) \u00b7 PROFESSIONAL EQUIPMENT (15%) \u00b7 E-SHOP (15%) \u00b7 BETTER PRINTS* \u00b7 FIRST AVOCADO PLANTATION* Those maked with * are additional costs that I consider useful to make the product more attractive and/or to further reduce the price but that I didn\u2019t include in the requested amount and which I would take care just if it were exceeded. I would personally thank whoever decided to believe in my project but, for obvious reason, I can\u2019t do that; i do want to let you know that your support was very important to me, and this is the reason why I wanted to divide the rewards in 3 levels in order to include as many people as possible: \u00b7 HIGH FIVE (5+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 5% discount. \u00b7 TASTE TEST (50+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 10% discount + 1x Avocado chips + 1x Avocuddle. \u00b7 AVOCADO LOVER (100+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 15% discount + 1x Avocado chips + 1x Avocuddle + 1x Special Gratefull Avocado. The rewards will be shipped from January 2020 but I don\u2019t exclude a priori the possibility of some anticipation or short delay.",
  "We are two humans who met at the perfect time and since the day we met we have done nothing but grow stronger as individuals and even stronger as a unit. We are Hayley 32 years of age and Joakim 31 years of age and we recently moved a little deeper, but not deep enough into the woods in the centre of Sweden. We met over a shared interest of psychedelics and especially the healing benifits that they have on human beings, we were both very responsible users, something we bonded over and we both have \"magic mushrooms\" to thank for curing f.ex severe migrane and psychedelics in general have helped us both grow a lot. We wanted to show our growth in some way, we wanted to show how the whole world could benefit from the responsible use of psychedelics. So we started with our project \"Hippy Spirit Clothing\" 2.5 years ago and we have slowly watched it grow into something we are very proud of, and we have grown along with Hippy Spirit, a lot as well. The idea for Vegan EVERYTHING came, just like with our clothing brand, from us and the way we choose to live. Today our conscious green eating makes us both feel amazing and cooking and experimenting with food has been a passion since early teenage years, and has become even more fun since turning vegan! :) Healthy, good tasting vegan food is exensive if you eat out today and it seems like everyone wants to put a \"healthy-tax\" on everything and it is really not fair for the ones who really cares about what they eat and needs something quick on the go. We want to change that. We will sell something that we are surprised that we have never seen any food truck our fast food place sell in Sweden and the thing is, we really dont want to say it yet, because we fear someone with the money to start tomorrow will come in and do this before us, this is how much we believe in this idea. As we go we will add a lot, like green smoothies, smoothie bowls, raw balls, avocado on toast, golden milk, chai tea, vegan ice-cream, the list can be made so long, jummy and healthy! Everything vegan of course! Vegan EVERYTHING is so much more than a food truck, it is more of a movement and together with the clothing we design and the music we produce and the art that we make we try in our little way to open up as many hearts and third-eyes as possible! :) And it all start with a healthy diet! You truly are what you eat! :) Chosing to work for yourself is hard, but once you are there it is out of the question to go back to work for someone else. No matter how hard it is, we will not give up! We work every single day to come up with new designs, new content, new music to increase sales to eventually pay for this huge addition to our lives, our Vegan EVERYTHING. food truck idea, but it is going way to slow and we are in the best time ever to start. We have come a long way planning all of this, but we are still basically on step one with all of this since we can not afford to buy the truck or the kitchen that it has to have inside, everything around the whole project is basically done, we have events to go to many places in Sweden, this is events we have spoken to as well as events who has contacted us. Many of these events do not have any vegan food at the moment, so we see a huge opportunity there, with well over 10.000 visitors on an average day. We also want to sell at bigger events in other countries in the summers, this is huge music events where we would fit in perfectly but stick out with our food! *and clothing* We are asking for help so that we have a chance to open up our business before someone else does it and we would hope to raise 200.000sek to make this dream come true. The cost of the van will be the biggest expence, then it might have to be re-built with ventilation and then it needs a working kitchen. Roughly counted this will cost somewhere between 150-200.000sek. We would be forever thankful if we would get help with this project, it is exactly what we are meant to do and we have such big plans for the future and we believe in this so extremely much, we are in the right time with everything and this is not just a job for us, this van will become a part of our lifestyle! Thank you so much! Hayley and Joakim",
  "UPDATE 3- NEW STRETCH GOAL $11,500. Well we made it over our goal of $9500, and then we made it over our first stretch goal of $10000 to add an extra week and location. Now let's try for $11500 and add another week and another place! We can do it!  UPDATE 2- 15% TO ONLINE STORE FOR ALL BACKERS. As a thank you, all of my wonderful backers of this project will receive 15% off in my online store once it goes live (early January). The store will be offering prints and original art, as well as greeting cards and more. Thank you all so much. UPDATE 1- Now that the project has reached it's initial funding goal. Some of you may be wondering what happens with the extra money? Well extra money will go to incidentals on the trip, and if we make it $500 over the goal then I'll add another week with at least 1 city into the trip. REACHED! My name is Jessica, and I\u2019m a fine artist and illustrator living in San Francisco, and I'd like you to join me on a painted exploration through Europe. \nI do many types of art, but one of my favorite things to do is to go out and paint and sketch on location, typically known as 'Plein Air'. For me this is a great way  to see my city in a new way and then to turn around and share it with others. That's what I especially love about making things, is sharing them with people. \n When I was in high school I was lucky enough to go on a trip to Rome, Florence, and Paris. To say that I had a blast would be an understatement, I got to eat new things, interact with people who didn't speak the same language, and see all of these places that were not only beyond beautiful but steeped in history. And that's what did it for me, how amazing everything looked. I still remember winding through these narrow shadowed cobbled streets in Florence that all of a sudden opened up into the Piazza della Signoria. The famous David and the Medici Bank where now towering over my  right shoulder, while a line of marble statues twisted and writhed to my left,  the Tuscan sun played off the stone of the Piazza and the water of Neptune's fountain, all the while the lure of \"Italy's best gelato\" called from across the square. From that moment on I knew I wanted to keep traveling, and when I decided to pursue art as a career, that I wanted to share my experiences through painting what I saw on my travels. \n\n\u00a0 So that's what brings me here today. I would like your help to take a month and paint my way through Italy, France, and Spain creating paintings and sketches of the beautiful and interesting things I see on my trip. I plan to fly out in early May of 2015 landing in Naples, Italy, then head to Florence, Venice, and Milan. Next up Southern France starting in Annecy, then on to Moustiers-Sainte-Marie, and Pezenas. Lastly head to Spain with stops in Barcelona, Albarracin, and Madrid. To keep costs down I would fly back home out of Porto, Portugal.\u00a0 During this month, I will blog daily about my art and my adventures. Anyone who contributes to my campaign, and should it be funded, will be able to follow this blog and read more as soon as each post is published! My schedule will be simple: two consecutive days of art, a day for travel time and location scouting, repeat. My hope is to paint two acrylic paintings and one watercolor each day. Once back home, I will work on prints, wallpapers, and shipping the original artwork to backers in the qualifying pledge categories. Please note the large canvas paintings will take longer to ship as they will be completed upon return. All of the money raised from this Kickstarter will go to helping to pay for everything, from the plane flights, food and lodging, to art supplies, train and bus tickets, and shipping costs to get everything to my backers after I get back home.\u00a0 Travel: plane flights $1200 each way. Month long train pass $850. \u00a0Buses and the occasional taxi\u00a0$250. Coming to $3500 Lodging through Air B&B and food will run about $100/day coming to $3000. Art supplies: New lightweight durable easel (mine is super heavy, clunky, and will not survive baggage handling) $250. Paint and canvas panels $250. Fine art printing $400. Coming to $900. Shipping: Boxes $300. Shipping $1000. Coming to $1300.\u00a0 Subtotal- $8700 Adding taxes, Kickstarter, and credit card fees I'll need you help to raise $9500 for this trip. Thank you so much for taking the time to explore my Kickstarter campaign, and remember to please share on social media.\u00a0 \u00a0Ciao! Au revoir! Adios!

  "It is very challenging to market art, and to try to sell a piece of your heart and soul to the world. Artists often feel forced to be a jack of all trades, while sometimes sacrificing our more personal artistic inspirations. I've learned throughout the years that the business side of the art world is a vital aspect, and unfortunately the creative side is another entirely. I've also learned, that I am not good at doing both simultaneously, which has led me to this idea of going public with a plea for help. I believe this is a breakout year for me as an artist. I've been an art teacher for almost 20 years, and the inspiration I get from my students is astounding. I hope to inspire and make my students proud. I've earned the opportunity to show at Spectrum Miami during Miami's art week. It's the push I needed to have the courage to put myself and my art work out there for the world to see... To broaden my horizons and do what I was put on this earth to do.\u00a0 I hope that by connecting with art collectors, gallery directors and art institutions and by finally being able to share my labor of love with the world, my art will have a greater purpose. If this endeavor is successful, it will provide the catapult for me to be able to support philanthropic art entities, such as \"Artists for a Cause\" and \"Women Supporting the Arts\" in the future.\u00a0 Although the opportunity is outstanding, as a teacher, funding it on my own is nearly impossible.\u00a0Please join me and Team MGMoriginals in helping me reach my goals!

  "Eight Bit Magazine celebrate early eight bit microcomputers from the 1970's to the early 90's. While most publications cover only the gaming aspect of such computers we want to cover the hardware and programming side of things as well. After a successful Issue 1 and Issue 2 Kickstarter campaigns we are delighted to offer even more in Issue 3. You will get a full colour, A5 size, 68 page printed magazine full of great articles written by people with a wealth of knowledge and passion for those computers. Expect programming, technical and gaming articles for the Apple II, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Sinclair Spectrum, Atari 8-bit and more!  Everything 8 bit from games to programming to hardware projects to enhance your enjoyment of those eight bit wonders. The goal of the magazine is to create the excitement of computer magazines of the 80's and early 90's, both gaming and otherwise. A part of the excitement is holding a proper magazine in your hand unlike reading online where something is lost. We have a number of people involved in this kickstarter project and the plan is to get more on-board for future issues. We want to create a community of eight bit enthusiasts writing for the magazine coming up with articles we haven't even thought of yet. Sample of the articles in Issue 3: The Collectors Guide to the Amstrad CPC 464.The Apple Adventurer (Adventure games on the Apple II)Hacking for Infinite Lives.Retropie: Emulating the 8-bits.Pond Software Feature.Second part of Programming Sprites for the C64 and CPC.Upcoming games and hardware to be released in 2017.Many game reviews as well as interviews and technical articles.\u00a0 \u00a0 Why such a low Kickstarter goal?\u00a0 \u00a0After the success of issue 1 the low Kickstarter goal is all we need to guarantee at least another 12 issues of 8-bit.

  "\"WAKE\" is a short horror film surrounding Alan Young, a hotshot inventor whose just made history as he's invented the world's first intuitively immersive virtual reality machine, allowing it's users to see and experience their most inner desires and fantasies, from both the past and present. The break through brings Alan fame and fortune, but not without cost. An inexplicable and horrific \"glitch\" in the machine is causing a\u00a0malfunction, instead\u00a0trapping Alan inside his worst nightmares. The glitch has pushed the revolutionary machine's total completion back months--causing the pressure of finishing it to rise from his impatient investors, declining reputation and credibility, and most importantly...his crumbling marriage. With his back against the wall, Alan is forced to take the dangerous risk of attempting to fix the problem from the inside, and confront horrific projections of his inner most fears and failures...with the antagonizing, shape-shifting glitch lurking around every corner... The film was shot in March 2015, and we need your help to pay back the numerous costs of production, as well as post-production and festival submissions. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meet the Crew Erich Westfield (Director/Producer/Writer)-- Erich is a graduating senior Television-Radio major at Ithaca College with a minor in Theater Arts.

We want to enter as many horror film festivals as possible, and those costs can add up.\u00a0",
  "English below Jag har en vision om att starta och driva en verksamhet med fokus p\u00e5 h\u00e5llbarhet, m\u00e4nskliga m\u00f6ten och en levande f\u00f6rort.

English It all started when one of the other regulars at my favorite caf\u00e9 had an idea to open a coffice in the neighbourhood. We discussed the idea, and I was thrilled about it. Pretty soon, I got the blessing to take the idea and run with it. Through meetings and input from friends and enthusiasts, the whole thing grew into something bigger. I then found a fantastic place in Bandhagen, south of Stockholm. My vision is to continue to develop the original idea and together with other people make this a venue for creation, our contribution to make this an even more alive neighbourhood. In short, I would like to create something in between a caf\u00e9 and a coffice. A place that is calm and encourages you to be creative and a possibility to connect with people nearby.\u00a0 Who are we? \u00a0 I am Nina, the founder of this business. I love animals, prefer to eat fruits and I am studying knitting at a Folkh\u00f6gskola.\u00a0 Zaphira is a friend of mine and somewhere along the line she got involved. She is a colourful person with a lot of energy who loves cats and is passionate about equality.\u00a0Zaphira contributes with thoughts, ideas and a lot of positive energy and is now an important person for the startup.\u00a0 What do we want?\u00a0 Create a plant based caf\u00e9 with a peaceful atmosphere perfect for those who want to work outside the office but still want to leave the house. A place where you could make new contacts and find nice people to cooperate with. We will also offer breakfast, snacks and picnic baskets to take away for those of you who just pass by.\u00a0 Beyond the daily business with food and coffee we will also arrange events with focus on culture, creating and craftsmanship, both on our own and together with different organisations, all with the purpose to contribute to a living suburb. It's also possible to rent our conference room (during opening hours) or the whole place (when the cafe is closed).\u00a0 When and how?\u00a0 We will access the place on the first of August. There are renovations that has to be done, along with some cleaning and freshening things up before we can open the doors on the ninth of september (hopefully).\u00a0 The money?\u00a0 We need money to renovate the place. We need to buy refrigerators, freezers, dishwasher, an oven and a stove. We also need to hire a plumber and probably also an electrician.\u00a0 We believe in creating together\u00a0 This idea has grown and developed thanks to the ideas and creativity from people around us. We want this project to grow further and are looking forward to see it in action. \u00a0 The food\u00a0 We like a lot of different tastes from all over the world. We plan to cater lunch from our favourite vegan kitchen but will make breakfast, fika and snacks ourselves. We will adjust the food according to season and do our best to not let any food go to waste.\u00a0 We both eat plant based food and are passionate about animals and the environment so it all felt obvious. All of our food and drinks will be plant based but our customers are welcome regardless their own food preferences. \u00a0We like to experiment with taste and texture and to challenge the picture of what vegan food should be. Even guests on four legs is warmly welcome!\u00a0",
  "Hello, we are The Odd Folk, a quintet of ramshackle musicians from the far west of Cornwall (although our drummers a Grimsby man with Cornish adoption pending!) We play folk music and we have always been a little odd. We use ironing boards as keyboard stands, branches as mic stands and all pile into an old Renault 4 and drive around the country playing music and getting lost. We're been carrying our debut album, The Sweet Release, around with us for the last couple of years and as well as most of our friends and fans having a copy we're actually running very low on stock! We've long been scratching our heads on how on earth we were going to fund another 'baby' when we stumbled on this sweet medium! We're so pleased to be able to offer rewards to our fans as a way of saying thank you, and all of the prizes will be created with as much love as we can muster.We are really honoured to be able to work with Andy Bell, a sound engineer with a CV as long as your leg; who's worked with many greats from the folk circuit including Bellowhead, Eliza Carthy and Seasick Steve to namedrop but a few! Being a mobile sound engineer ables him to travel wherever we want him, and so we're choosing Belan Hall, an old shooting lodge in the middle of Wales, where we sometimes go to rehearse and have creative lockdown. We will also be working closely with our designer, Mae Voogd, to make the album cover and all the posters and T-Shirts to go with it. She's drawn the band\u00a0a number of times but one of the rewards is for you to join us on the launch poster as well as get your portrait drawn! All you'll have to do is submit a photo and you can hop onto the page with us. The T-Shirts will also be designed by Mae Voogd and for this reward you will need to submit your size preference and colour preference. The figure we are after is \u00a35000, which seems like a lot of money but in reality is just about scraping the barrel. And no, we're not going to do a runner to The Caribbean! The list below will give you an idea of what we need and what's involved in making an album. The Sound Man - this is the main component, this includes all tracking, editing, mixing and producing of the album! The Duplication - this is the where we get numbers, for instance 1000 copies to be released. The Design - this involves all the album artwork, storyboarding the sleeves and booklets, and drawing up the posters. T-Shirts - for your new frocks! Photographs - for your mantlepieces! Postage and Packaging - wherever you are the postman will come and deliver your rewards to you! We look forward to working with you!

  "Country music fans, meet The Justin Alan Black Band. Today, the band calls Nashville home, but these three life long friends from Georgia started writing and playing music together as teenagers. Currently in the studio recording their debut country album, the band says the new songs are inspired from a place they all know so well, home. \u201cNo matter where I go, Georgia\u2019s home to me.\u201d\n-from the song \u201cGeorgia\u201d, featured on the band\u2019s new album. After months of writing and focusing the band\u2019s sound, The Justin Alan Black Band entered Cherry Box Studios in Nashville to begin recording their debut in country music. \u201cThis has been a long time coming.\u201d, says Josh, who plays mandolin and banjo with the group. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard and are proud to see this all come together.\u201d\u00a0 The band is raising the funds needed to finish the record through a Kickstarter campaign and social media promotions this fall. \u201cOur families, friends, and our fans\n have always been so supportive.\u201d says Mic, guitarist. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making music together all our lives and they\u2019ve been there every step of the way.\u201d \u00a0With the release of their first album this fall and an extensive tour planned for the spring and summer of 2015, it\u2019s safe to say that \u201cHome\u201d is the one place the band won\u2019t be seeing very much of in the coming year. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy being away from your family.\u201d says Patrick, the band\u2019s lead singer. \u201cThey never leave my mind, they\u2019re in the songs, and they\u2019re the reason we do what we do.\u201d Patrick went on to say, \u201cThese guys are like my brothers, we\u2019re family.

  "If questions and curiosity prompted The Sun Flights to leave\non their nine month musical adventure around the country, then it\u2019s only to be\nassumed that greater questions and curiosity remain. We returned with no\nanswers whatsoever. But we did write House\nof Man, a nine song album. I don\u2019t think any of our songs pinpoint a specific experience\nor moment during our travels. In fact, many of the songs were written in a few\ndifferent places and over a period of a couple months. However, they are based\non emotions, imagery and stories from around this country.House\nof Man is a reflection of the time we live in, which is a reflection of the\ntimes we come from, all of which will determine where we are going. We, as\nmankind. There is critique in this album but it comes from a place of\nlove and hope. The generosity shown to us during our travels, the hardships and\nstrength of the people we met, the landscapes we encountered are so vast, so\nindescribable that we know House of Man\nis a small perspective. But it is what we have. We\u2019re looking forward to recording this album at The Spice\nHouse. A beautiful, recording studio in Fishtown, built out of wood from an old\nLancaster barn. We knew we would record there when we walked in to the smell of\nwood, the tall ceilings and a conversation about the very sound we\u2019ve spent\nfour years sculpting. We hope to have this album recorded and ready to share by\nearly 2015.",
  "Emma, a college student with a crippling fear of clowns, must come face to face with her worst fear when a clown that has been terrorizing the town promises to kill her. This clown gives a balloon to each his victims with the exact time and date he's going to kill them written on it. After\u00a0receiving one herself,\u00a0Emma realizes that she has two days left to live, and\u00a0must fight against the clock to find a way to survive. The film is based on a short film we did called The Clown Statue (based on my favorite urban legend!)\u00a0that has since gained a cult following online and has won awards at film festivals nationwide! For this movie, I've pulled inspiration from every corner of the horror genre, which I am a huge fan of! It would best be described as a haunted house/creature feature hybrid. I had someone describe it as an \"Americana nightmare\" and an \"electric circus\". Which I LOVE, and I think describes the film perfectly. I love\u00a0horror movies, and I LOVE\u00a0scary clowns! So you can imagine how upset I was to find out how few scary clown movies actually exist. So I wrote my own and set out on a crazy journey to bring the next great clown movie to life! After six months writing and perfecting the script, I left my Nashville home and met our crew out in Los Angeles to shoot the movie! The production was chugging along and we were getting amazing footage! Then, on the last day and a half of shooting, one of our key locations caught on fire just minutes before we arrived (thanks to the good ol' California drought). The best choice for our movie creatively, logistically, and safety-wise was to halt production. I returned home, we edited the film, and we figured out exactly what we needed to complete it (we have 90% of the film done!). In addition, we had the rare opportunity to be able to see our movie and write some\u00a0amazing new scenes to make it even better!\u00a0Now we need your help to finish it! We have the budget left over to shoot what we had originally intended. The trick is getting a new production up and running again, and paying to shoot the newly written scenes. Things like re-renting the camera equipment, paying the cast and crew, and paying location fees again cost a lot! All of this gets broken up into: So join the team, get your copy of the movie, and be a driving force in making the next great clown movie a reality! \u00a0Brittany Belland plays Emma - With over a dozen films under her belt, Ohio-born Brittany Belland was more than excited to tackle the role of Emma: the story's protagonist who must race against the clock after learning that she will be killed by her greatest fear in two days' time. With her incredible dramatic abilities and attention to detail and nuance, Belland breathes an extra dimension of life and character into the extremely intense and demanding character. Eric Corbin plays Ribcage the Clown - LA actor Eric Corbin blew everyone away during auditions, bringing a sense of athleticism and ferocity to the character that nobody expected. Pulling from movie monsters throughout the years, Corbin truly built this creature from the ground up. In the end, he delivers a performance quite unlike anything you've seen before. Strong, animalistic, and inhuman Corbin makes Ribcage the Clown something to truly be feared. Monica Baker plays Heather - Michigan-native Monica Baker works as an actress and voice actress in Los Angeles. Baker plays Heather, Emma's big-mouthed, sweet-as-sugar-but-tough-as-nails best friend. When things begin to go downhill and Emma locks up with fear, Heather pushes her to move forward whether it's for better or for worse. Sean Patrick Murray plays Jonah - Emma and Heather's other partner in crime, Jonah, is played by Sean Patrick Murray, a Los Angeles based actor and producer. Jonah is sarcastic but totally down to Earth. However, (without spoiling anything) Emma quickly realizes that if she doesn't come up with a plan, her life might not be the only one at risk. Burt Culver plays Mr. Randal - Seattle native Burt Culver has appeared in over 40 TV shows and movies since his move to LA in 2012 (including a guest role in Criminal Minds). Culver plays Mr. Randal, the father of the clown's first victim. Out for revenge, he latches onto Emma. Insisting that he protect her, for better or for worse. Tom Seidman plays Pops - Seidman is truly a Hollywood veteran, having worked as a producer and an assistant director for over thirty years on films such as Dead Poets Society, Reds,\u00a0and Ordinary People. Though he has always been an actor at heart. Seidman plays Pops, a local ice cream man who, while working with the police, starts to suspect there might be more than meets the eye with the case. Johnjay Fitih plays The Town Sheriff - British actor Johnjay Fitih plays the town Sheriff, who very quickly becomes the clown's favorite puppet. Caitlin Rigney plays Meghan - New York theatre actress Caitlin Rigney plays Meghan, Mr. Randal's daughter who haunts him in more ways than one after her gruesome death.",
  "Hello my name is James Carney, I am the writer and director of this short film. Being a person who enjoys video games but also an aspiring filmmaker I've always wanted to create fan films for my favorite games but those ideas never worked out. But with the recent launch of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 I decided to try again. The more specific reasoning behind this is I feel there aren't enough strong female characters represented in film and mainly want to focus on changing that and this game does fit with that sort of idea. For the story it\u2019s a vague scenario revolving around Claire and Moira, purely based around all the narrative information included in the trailers out of respect for people who may not have played the game yet.\n\n As for production cast(though at this point the leads have yet to be cast but there are a lot of interested volunteers so it's just a matter of choosing the right people) and crew are already on board with budget being all that\u2019s left. The cost adds up to $1400 for all the necessities including: equipment, props and costuming. Hopefully this goal can be reached within a soon enough time.\nThe overall scope aside from the focus is a creating a fun project that Resident Evil fans and others can enjoy and hopefully lead to enough interest that would allow me to work on other projects I\u2019m very interested in making in the near future as part of my initial goal of creating media that shows strong, realistic and unexploited female characters.",
  "We've been super busy baking up delicious, vegan cupcakes from scratch. \u00a0In fact we've outgrown our shared kitchen space. \u00a0We are forever grateful to our friends at LaBelle Aurore in Niantic, CT for helping our fledgling business get off the ground, but it's time to move into our very own store! \"Dutch's\" will be filled with fresh baked treats and we will continue our made to order custom creations. We were very successful with our local farmer's markets last season, selling out most days. When not at the market, we continue to fill special orders weekly. \u00a0All thanks to our loyal customers. But, the one question we get asked the most is...\u00a0 \"When are you opening a store? \". \u00a0We understand that our customers want to be able to stop in whenever they feel like a quick treat. \u00a0With a location of our own we will have a chance to meet and interact with you all year long. We will continue to make all of our cupcakes from scratch in small batches to provide consistent quality with every order. We're building an inviting, trendy cafe, perfect for meeting up with friends and hanging out. A bigger kitchen and better equipment will allow us to start whipping up new and delicious creations for you to enjoy and we can also roll out our newest menu item...vegan MILKSHAKES!! \u00a0Hand crafted vegan shakes, made with vegan soft serve, dairy free milk and homemade syrups, sauces and toppings. Our mission at Dutch's has always been to expand and offer even more delicious and convenient vegan food option to our community and fill a gap in the current landscape. Vegan food is on the rise and this is not \u00a0a trend. \u00a0While some businesses are beginning to stock vegan offerings, they usually have only 1 or 2 options. \u00a0Dutch's currently has over 20 cupcake flavors on our menu. \u00a0With more space we can continue to experiment and bring you more fun treats. Now that we've shown people cupcakes can be sinfully indulgent without the use of animal products, we want to add the convenience of our very own store front. We love our community and we want to be a part of the evolution of food while helping you rethink what options are available to you. \u00a0Meeting people, talking and answering questions is what we live for. \u00a0The love and support we've received so far has been mind blowing and we cant wait to do more. \u00a0One of the main reasons Dutch's chooses a vegan lifestyle is to protect animals and the planet we share with them. While building our shop we are keeping that same mind set and utilizing eco-concious products for packaging and design. We want to contribute to the beautification of our neighborhoods and local communities. \u00a0With a little help from a lot of people, we can expand our brand to reach further. \u00a0We want you to feel good about what you eat. \"Honestly I cannot explain how amazing these cupcakes are! \u00a0Tiffany made us a special cupcake for my daughter vanilla cupcake, \"nutella\" filling and banana frosting. \u00a0I dont like vanilla cupcakes and i don't like banana flavor. \u00a0But I LOVEDDD these cupcakes. \u00a0I had to stop myself from eating all of my daughter's cupcakes. \u00a0We also had the triple chocolate peanut butter which was also amazing. \u00a0Do yourself a favor and trust Dutch's with all of your cupcake needs in the future you won't be disappointed!\" -Breanna Haskins \"The most AMAZING cupcakes your taste buds will ever experience!! \u00a0FINALLY a VEGAN OPTION?!!!\" -Tina Brown",
  "Make Your Mark has the possibility to expose artists, bring connection, support self expression, empower oneself and experience joy and fun in a community! \u00a0Together, artists and non-artists, we will create 5 paintings. \u00a0It is my hope that by being a part of the process the viewer of art will start to feel connected to art on a different level and open up their own creative power. \u00a0 The event will be in a public space, a courtyard near downtown Denver (the Highlands), during the first friday on September 5th. \u00a0Five artists will participate, each with a different distinct mark: calligraphy, brush work, thin layering (drips), monotype, trowels. \u00a0There will be 5 canvases with an artist by each to guide and support the people making their mark. \u00a0Twenty-five to thirty participants will be invited (5 to each canvas) plus there will be observers walking by. \u00a0(A large paper will be laid out for the public to play around too!) \u00a0There will be a couple of musicians playing with different beats to help inspire rhythm and mark within the participants. \u00a0The canvases will be started that night and then be taken home by each artist to complete and bring back the next month (first friday) to display to the public with all the names printed by each piece.\u00a0 The funds being raised are for the supplies for the event: (5) Painting Canvases 36\"x36\" or 36\" x 40\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$150 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Brushes and Palette knives, Trowels \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $100 Student Grade Acrylics \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$200 Gels and Medium for Acrylics \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$ 50 This would be an unforgettable experience for everyone involved! \u00a0Thank you for checking out this project. \u00a0Please contact me with any questions. \u00a0",

  "Hi everyone! This project is about a trip we want to make in\u00a0February 2016 to island. \u00a0Our goal is to travel all around the island of Iceland to take pictures not only of the amazing landscape but mostly of the northern lights.\u00a0 Since the northern lights are our main goal, we chose to go there when the circumstance are best for northern lights photography. But to do this project we need your help! Our goal is to rent a save and good car that we are flexible to drive to the best spots at night. We have no chance with public transport; buses don't drive in winter and not even at night, and the spots we want to visit have never seen a bus before. This is why renting a car\u00a0is crucial for our project. We (Claudia Bischoff, Martin T\u00f6dtling and Matthias Urwyler)\u00a0are experienced photographers. We are passionate about the northern lights. We\u00a0already made a trip to Norway two years ago. \n\nThere we learned all we need to know for this job. We know how to capture the \n\nnorthern lights when they appear, we know how to hunt them and bring them home as breath \n\ntaking pictures.\u00a0 Since we are experienced, we know what it takes to be out all night long even when the temperature gets way below zero. It can be very hard, but we are definitely up for it. When the northern lights appear we forget the cold, we forget the wetness and we act as \n\nfast as we can, to get the perfect picture for you.\u00a0 For our trip we have all the necessary gear and knowledge. To get around the island, we need to hire a good and safe car, that is able to drive in the snowy cold. But with your support we can do it! Our goal is to come home with the most stunning pictures of the northern lights. We want to make a presentation about the trip around the island and present the best pictures of the northern lights of Iceland. Thank you all for your support and feel free to post and spread the word about our project! For any further questions don't hesitate to contact us, we are happy to get to know you and to answer all your questions! Yours Claudia, Martin and Matthias",
  "I've always been a big fan of multi page wall calendars... you know the ones that you turn over a page every new month and get a new image to look at for the next 30 days or so. I buy at least 3 every year for different rooms in my house.\u00a0 And while we\u2019re all pretty much forced to keep our schedules on our computers and phones, I like tangible objects, artifacts if you will. And I like that ritual turning of the page every month... and, of putting up the new calendars every year and taking down the old ones. And, I've always wanted to do a calendar of just my images. So I decided now's the time. I've designed the calendar: It's 12in X 12in square with a heavy cover, front and back. It will be saddle stitched, which just means it has staples in the fold (I've never really been a fan of the wire binding). I've found an awesome printer that will give me great turn around time. And I've selected twelve of my favorite fine art images from the last few years.\u00a0 I\u2019ve created what I feel is a very simple and elegant calendar that will showcase the images and be an art artifact for your wall. Four of these images have been awarded prestigious prizes in two of the premier photography competitions in the world\u2026 the PX3 in Paris\u2026 and the International Photography Awards in the US. If you even remotely like wall calendars and photography, or know someone who does, I think you'll love this one. I\"m very excited about this project, and will really appreciate your help in making it possible. Thanks so much for your time. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Gunnar",
  "I've always been into sci-fi and fantasy, but last year, largely thanks to Jeffro Johnson's Hugo nominated Appendix N Retrospective series, I found myself picking up a lot of the older, weirder and pulpier stuff. \u00a0I felt particularly inspired by authors like Leigh Brackett, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, and publications like Planet Stories. \u00a0 I decided to launch a semi-pro zine to showcase pulse-pounding Sword & Planet and Heroic Fantasy fiction in the tradition of those classic pulp magazines.\u00a0 Cirsova Magazine is for readers who want exciting tales of daring heroes up against impossible odds in exotic settings. It's also for authors of adventure SFF. \u00a0I want to create an enduring market for pulp adventure writers to sell their fiction for competitive semi-pro rates. \u00a0 All that's left to do for issue 1 is fill some of the limited advertising space and get it into your hands as soon as possible! No T-shirts, no secret forums, no skype calls, conventions or parties, just what I can without a doubt put in your hands: a high quality sci-fi magazine. Issue 1 will have nearly 100 pages of pulse pounding SFF action! The first issue of Cirsova features the following line-up: Short Stories Novelette Poetry Feature Column Cover Art Stretch Goal 1: $1,000 I'll be able to pay for about half of the second issue without having to dip into out-of-pocket funds. \u00a0Meeting this goal means that around 100 people will get their hands on this amazing anthology. \u00a0There MAY be enough interest and buzz generated from folks who get to see it that Cirsova MIGHT take off as a sleeper mag to watch out for by mid 2016. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Stretch Goal 2: $5,000 Begin work on a second issue sometime in 2016. Reaching $5,000 will mean that my expenses associated with issue 1's assemblage will be met.  Issue 1 has roughly $1k worth of already-paid-for top-notch content, and the rest of the cost is POD + S&H.  \n Seems silly that meeting my expenses would be a stretch goal, but I'd rather play it safe than bank on an explosive outpouring of pledges. \u00a0Because Cirsova Issue 1 is already paid for, I can put it out without needing to raise the extra funds to cover the costs. \u00a0\n Even if I don't meet this stretch goal, there's a good chance I'll try to scrape together enough money for a second issue this year, because I've already got some AMAZING stories from authors who have said \"I'll hold onto this until you can get the next issue together.\" \u00a0I want to tell you all about them and how great they are, but I can't until I actually get the ball rolling on issue 2 and pay for the rights to them. Stretch Goal 3: $10,000 Begin work on a second issue immediately. Now, $10,000 would be ideal, because that would mean that my poorly scrawled out calculations of content + mfg. + shipping costs turned out to be more or less right and I didn't completely screw up on calculating my per-issue price point (approx 1000 issues w $1 content cost per issue + approx $5 per issue pod allows for a per issue price comparable to the 'big' SFF mags).  Oh, it also means that I would be able to immediately begin soliciting stories for issue 2.\n\n\u00a0 Stretch Goal 4: $20,000 I think I'll have enough to pay off my car note; that means an almost extra $300 a month I'll be able to sock away to invest in future content! Issue 2 will have interior artwork, for one thing! Notes on Shipping:\nI want to make this magazine available both as cheaply and widely as possible.  To do so, I needed to add variable shipping costs to pledge levels with rewards that can be shipped outside of the US.  Reward levels that are marked \"Only Ships to: United States\" have shipping costs factored in already.\n\n\u00a0 Notes on Bulk Orders:\nUS Domestic Media Mail rates are the primary reason why these bulk orders can be pledged for so cheaply.  The downside is that these prices must be exclusive to US customers.  If you are outside of the US and interested in bulk rates, please contact me directly and I will arrange for the best deal I can make you.\n\n Notes on Advertisements:\nImage Advertisements will appear in soft-cover print and pdf copies.  Depending on how well we can get the eBook version formatted, they may appear there as well, however this should be considered a \"bonus\" beyond the pledge goal based on its technical feasibility. \u00a0Interior advertisements may be in true black & white or in gray-scale. \u00a0Color images should be converted to gray-scale before submitting. Be advised that the Rear Cover advertisement is sized to accommodated a barcode rather than fit the page. Advertisement images should be 300 dpi, with the following measurements: Please have both text and graphic ads prepared for submission no later than one week after the end of the Kickstarter!",
  "From it's inception in 1993, Gearhead\u00ae Magazine has been unique in the world of automotive journalism. Focusing on the lifestyle, stories and culture surrounding car enthusiasts, especially those in love with muscle cars and hot rods, the magazine became the world\u2019s go-to source on the combined influences of pop culture, music and clothing on car culture and vise versa. It is a celebration of the DIY spirit in all things hot rods and rock and roll. Now in it's 22nd year, Gearhead\u00ae Magazine is once again being published after a 5 year hiatus. Welcome to the relaunch of Gearhead! Pioneering a movement unheard of until the magazine bearing the name GEARHEAD was first published in May 1993, former editor Michael LaVella \u00a0masterminded and gave birth to a rebel child that would soon become the basis for a movement known as kustom kulture. Raising the banner of muscle cars and guitar crushing garage rock GEARHEAD MAGAZINE became infamous among those \u201cin the know\u201d as THEE tastemaker for all things hot rods and rock and roll. Kooks and weidos dug it, but so did the general public! Mention you read GEARHEAD, and you were instantly part of the cool kids' club!\u00a0 In 2000, the brand expanded to include the record label when Rev. Michelle became co-owner. Having met when both were writers for the critically acclaimed punk magazine Maximum Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll, the two worked together to release over eighty records as well as create a line of clothing and accessories. \u00a0The team continued publication of the magazine, publishing one issue a year, with a goal to make it quarterly.\u00a0 Internationally recognized, the distinct logo and products associated with the brand were sold to over 50 countries. But all that hard work took it's toll. The team split up in 2006 with Michelle taking over the record label, and Mike taking back the magazine.\u00a0 The magazine went dormant in 2009 when LaVella stepped away from publishing to pursue other interests, but demand never died. A whole new generation of rock and roll and hot rod enthusiasts grew up reading about the legendary magazine, but could only find back issues to whet their appetite.\u00a0 \u00a0In 2014 the magazine was once again returned to parent company Gearhead Productions, Inc., where owner Rev. Michelle Haunold now seeks to revive the much loved cooler than cool rag with the enthusiastic release of the long awaited issue Number Nineteen!\u00a0 When you pledge to support this project, you are funding the long-anticipated relaunch of Gearhead Magazine with issue #19. You are also helping to KEEP PRINT ALLIVE! Like the rest of the media world, physical products are going by the way side as it becomes cheaper to produce digitally. But nothing can replace the feel of a magazine in your hands, or the smell of a magazine as you flip through the pages.  That love of the actual product fueled the resurgence of vinyl in the music industry, and I\u2019m hoping to tap into a similar passion for people who love printed media. I do also plan to make Gearhead available digitally for the first time for those who favor this form of content with print on demand and digital download options! But honestly, holding an actual magazine in your hands feels great, so why not go old school?\u00a0 Once this project funds, (because I know it will!) and this first re-launch issue is published, my goal is to eventually get the magazine up to being printed 4 times a year. This has been a goal of mine since I first started working on the magazine back in 2000! I\u2019d also like to expand coverage to a wider variety of topics, and stories, because there's so many great stories out there! Maybe it could even evolve into a podcast or TV show, you know? There's so much cool stuff out there to discover and share! I\u2019d also love to be able to start paying writers, who right now submit projects voluntarily simply because they want to be part of GEARHEAD. The money being raised during this campaign will be used to print the physical magazine. It will cost about $3500 to cover the printing costs. Any extra money will be used to pay a professional design artist who will handle the lay out of the magazine and setting up the files for print. If there\u2019s extra money after all that, it will go into the redesign of the GEARHEAD website where customers can shop online, subscribe, stay current on what\u2019s going on with Gearhead and follow all our social media sites.  I don't want to reveal too much since I don't want to spoil the surprise! But the new issue will be packed with cool stories not seen anywhere else and exclusive photos! Running about 80 pages, the magazine will feature a full-color cover with black and white book stock insides. It gives the magazine that vintage feel, much like the old school Hot Rod and Car Craft Magazines that were the original inspiration. It will be a limited edition run of 2500 printed copies, as well as available for digital download and print on demand. Among the articles you'll get a \"from the pits\" look at the annual Yolo County Demolition Derby,  a behind the scenes look at the life of producer extraordinaire Kim Fowley, a short history of the custom car phenomenon from the '60s known as Zingers, and a chat with the creator of the wildly popular Lady Luck Tattoo Convention. Gearhead also sits down with Jake \"The Preacher\" Cavaliere, frontman for the long-running gear-grinding rock and roll band out of Los Angeles The Lords of Altamont. \u00a0And finally, the last known interview with Famous Monsters of Filmland creator, Forrest J. Ackerman.  There will also be lots of cool underground record reviews, movie and book reviews and lots more cool stuff for hep cats and kittens.\u00a0 Does any of this sound\u00a0interesting or fun? Got yer mouth watering for these and other cool pics and stories ? Then please help me get the scratch together to bring this baby to print!\u00a0",

  "Hello Friends, My name is JR Renusson and in 2019 I will be opening up West Michigan's first All Vegan Food Truck: Faux. \u00a0Our mission is to reduce the world's dependency on animal products. \u00a0We will play a role in this by creating food that both vegans and non-vegans equally enjoy. \u00a0Faux will offer burgers, chick'n and fish sandwiches, grilled cheese, appetizers, along with shakes, cookies and more. \u00a0The entire menu will also be available gluten-free to insure that everyone is welcome. Having been vegan for over 10 years, it can sometimes be exhausting trying to find food that my wife and children will enjoy while also being vegan. \u00a0I've been working on this concept for a few years and I believe now is the time to let it loose. \u00a0Veganism has also been growing among all demographics as people are looking to either improve animal welfare, reduce their impact on the environment, and improve their health. Our end goal is to have Brick-and-Mortar Fauxs dotting the map all over the midwest but we will be starting with the humble food truck. \u00a0We need to raise approximately $50k to open up and are launching this campaign to hopefully get close to half that amount. \u00a0The money from this campaign will be used to purchase a used truck. \u00a0Then with our own funds along with some additional investments, we will outfit the truck with the necessary equipment, attain the required licenses and have enough working capital to launch in the Spring of 2019. I will use my passion for veganism, plus the knowledge I've gained through owning two vegan food businesses over the last 5 years, along with help from a seasoned restaurateur and other trusted advisors to bring Faux to fruition. \u00a0I have a culinary degree from the Secchia Institute. \u00a0I've created vegan menus for multiple restaurants and have created vegan product lines for national companies. \u00a0I have been preparing my other two vegan businesses (Bit Baking Co. and Cheeyeah) over the last year to be able to operate with minimal involvement from me so I can focus all of my attention on Faux this year and for the years to follow.",

  "This project, a month of art making in New Mexico, is about painting and drawing development. I have had many influential teachers over the years, and one of them was Donna Bruton. She told me that the most important piece of advice she could give was to paint every day. I was unfortunately never able to tell her before she died how much impact her education had on me. \u00a0 This time will allow me to fully focus on creating paintings and drawings. The schedule that I have set has me completing one painting per day. I will be alternating between 3 different types of painting. \u00a0 1. Observational painting, where I look directly at real things like plants, and paint them. \u00a0\u00a0 2. Fusion painting, a technique where I take source material from a book of smaller drawings that I have done in the past, and combine them into one painting. 3.\u00a0Abstract painting, where I use techniques of painting like gradients, and then spontaneously improvise in a jazzy style.\u00a0\u00a0 I will also be completing drawings in colored pencil. These are the smaller and faster counterpart to the larger and slower paintings.\u00a0 With your support, I will be able to have a full month to focus on working on these paintings, and developing painting technique and theory.\u00a0 For a selection of my previous work, please visit my image site or play the video above.

  "Bio My name is Kevin Boylan. I first studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\u00a0(PAFA) in Philadelphia as a Painting Major for two years. I discovered the  Florence Academy of Art (FAA) in my second year at PAFA and decided to continue my education there. I took a year off to work and saved everything to cover my first year in Florence studying at FAA. The next two years were spent going to school off and on while working to pay for the tuition when scholarships weren't enough. It's been a long hard road but I'm currently finishing my third and final year of FAA's program and expect to be back home in the states this summer. \u00a0 The Hudson River School Fellowship For those of you not familiar with the Hudson River School Fellowship, it's an annual prize for young painters who pursue working from nature. It's modeled itself after the tradition of the Hudson River School (a 19th century romanticism American art movement). It's put together by The New York Grand Central Academy\u00a0and takes a chosen handful of artists to experience three weeks of painting, lectures and talks by other artists. I've been accepted for this year's Fellowship.\u00a0 Why I need Kickstarter With help from FAA (The Florence Academy of Art) I've been able to complete my education, but not without serious sacrifices. I've received an excellent education but I've had to take time off to work and poured all my savings into finishing school. The Hudson River School Fellowship is a great way to mark the end of my schooling, get involved with artists from my home country and give me enough work to have my first show.\u00a0 The Fellowship has a small participation fee of $100 and the students are responsible for their own supplies and food.  This is where Kickstarter comes in. If successful this project will allow me to attend The Hudson River School Fellowship, have the supplies to draw and paint everyday while there, help with transportation, buy groceries for meals, and put together a small show exhibiting work from school and the fellowship.\u00a0 Thank you for your interest and support in my aspirations. A lot of you have already supported me in my journey and education, even aside from this project, I just wanted to say thank you.\u00a0 Follow my progress at the Hudson River School Fellowship on my blog www.KevinBoylanArt.Blogspot.com\u00a0",
  "After a decade in the outdoor industry as a ranger, educator, guide, and retailer, I am ready to launch a portfolio of outdoor goods that address the accessibility and sustainability needs of the outdoor industry.\u00a0 Since I was kid in scouts, I lusted over the top of the line backpacks, mess kits, and pocket knives, but growing up as a first generation POC, I didn't always have access to the best gear. As I replaced my aging, simple gear for new technical gear, something was missing. Working for a large retailer informed me about the ethics of the large companies pumping out gear, and exposed me to the waste of the increasingly fast seasonal refresh. I saw the serious enthusiasts and crusty dirt bags who designed all of the classic gear, responsible for opening the out doors for most of us, be replaced with the fashion industry's approach to manufacturing and design.\u00a0 Accessibility is an after thought, a point I had to confront recently as I tried to update my bike components and was looking at a price tag more than the bike was worth. Support me in filling out the empty bottom end of the outdoor industry with quality, affordable goods made in Minnesota by hand!\u00a0 I know, birds are so pass\u00e9, but hear me out: icterids, or the blackbird family, are a great symbol of what I want my portfolio to represent: thoughtful tools built by and for those who exist on the fringes of the outdoor industry. I think of my operation as a form of brood parasitism: I am salvaging the excess material production of large companies to create gear for those looking for affordable gear.\u00a0 Let's face it, this is going to be a year of cutting back and looking for alternative solutions to daily problems, but don't let that keep you from using quality gear! Here's what I am doing and how you can help. I am setting out to create a line of simple and affordable backpacks and bags, among other experiments, that prioritize cost savings over bells and whistles. I will be using dead stock (material that is no longer wanted by the fashion/outdoor industry, sold at ~1/4 original cost) as the foundation of the line and sourcing quality notions ( hardware: buckles, thread, strapping, etc.) to incorporate serious functionality. The line will be made by hand in Duluth on my lovely Sailrite LSZ-1.\u00a0 Each design will prioritize functionality and relevance over flair and features, in other words just what you need and not what you don't.\u00a0 Current offerings: I'm weary of vapor ware, you should be too. This is why I am starting my funding request with small wallets and building the portfolio up slowly. One major aspect of preserving the value of my goal is keeping myself on track and producing rewards and designing the next offering in a timely fashion. I am a student of the lean, kanban, just-in-time models of production and will keep labor time down by streamlining specific runs of goods as they are funded.\u00a0 I have already made the initial investments in my business and have the materials and tools for the launch of this kickstarter, your contribution is funding the development of the next product in my line.\u00a0My funding goal of $250+ will buy the necessary yardage and appointments to design and produce my next line: storage cubes and two backpacks.\u00a0 The biggest challenge for me as a designer is building a logical portfolio to bring to production. I have been brainstorming ideas for years, but I probably shouldn't launch that tent for river guides just yet! If this campaign is funded, \u00a0I will be able to launch a small range of gear organization cubes and one or two backpacks. Beyond that, I'd like to have a line of bike bags (panniers, handlebar, and basket bags) and share my knowledge and designs with the DIY community, after all, we are all beta-testers and the best gear is customized to our individual needs.\u00a0 Thank you for checking out this project and contributing if you can, I hope to support your outdoor gear needs!\u00a0",

  "I am so very grateful for all of your support in reaching my first goal! I now have the funds to pay for the recording fees for the Nashville album. Now we are ON TO THE SECOND GOAL: $15,000!\n\n\u00a0 At $15,000 I will be able to pay the production (printing) and mastering costs of the album. This is a crucial part of fundraising for this album. If I don't have the funds to actually pay for copies in-hand, there isn't a physical album. So, I humbly and gratefully ask for your support to reach my second goal. This album will be a pinnacle in my career and I'm so very thankful that I have friends surrounding me who are willing to help me create it! Thank you. Thank you! THANK YOU!\n\n - Chad ORIGINAL MESSAGE: I have wanted to make a Nashville record since I began writing songs, but not just your typical \"let's go down to a Nashville studio and record some songs in recording factory\". I mean one backed with creative clout and steeped in roots/Americana sound alongside the best players in the business. Now, after 19 albums, I finally have that chance!\u00a0 I was contacted last year by producer/drummer Ken Coomer (Wilco, Uncle Tupelo) who offered to produce and play on my next album. Ken has been part of projects for Billy Joe Shaver, Steve Earle, Will Hoge and many others. \u00a0Needless to say, I was excited to get started! With the generosity of friends I have been able to record the first half of the album. It is going to be AMAZING! Guitarist Kenny Vaughan (Marty Stuart, Lucinda Williams, etc) joined the sessions along with bass player Dave Roe (Johnny Cash, Dwight Yoakum, John Mellencamp). John Lancaster (Gary Allan) also added some amazing keys and organ playing to my songs. Here's a snippet of the \"Matters of the Broken Heart\" rough cut from the new album: You get the idea, right? This album will be killer. But it won't happen if I don't come up with the funds to record the second half of the album. I sure would appreciate if you would help me make this album a reality! I'm seeking $10,000 to pay for the remainder of the recording fees. Please peruse the perks on the right hand column - there are some great things you can earn by being a donor - such as my extreme gratitude. I am so very thankful for any donation you can make! And also, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE share this with your friends and family. You can make a big difference in the success of this campaign! Again, thank you so very much! I look forward to sharing the new album with you in the future! - Chad",
  "STRETCH GOALS - Even though we've reached our goal of $3250, you can still be a part of supporting \"Fighting a War\".\u00a0\u00a0 Any additional funds will be used on finishing the recording process (my actual expenses will be a little over $4000 after everything is mixed, mastered, and duplicated) and are much appreciated.\u00a0 If we reach the stretch goal of $4000, ALL SUPPORTERS will receive:  All of the songs have been written and recording is just about complete.\u00a0 I'm so excited about how all of these tracks are sounding. It's more \"me\" than anything I've ever done, but to finish the job the right way, I'm going to need your help  There are a lot of costs that go into making an album.\u00a0 Although I'm self-producing this record, I'm certainly not doing everything by myself.\u00a0 I've lined up an incredible team of musicians and engineers to be a part of this project. That list includes: Quite a list! In addition to this, there are the costs involved with album design (I've commissioned an original painting from local artist Tony Sobota) and CD duplication. Here's the good news.\u00a0 I've been able to save up and pay for the recording of this project on my own.\u00a0 The record is about 95% recorded at this point.\u00a0\u00a0 All the money we\u2019re raising will go to pay for MIXING and MASTERING the record and also will go towards paying for CD duplication.\u00a0 Mixing and mastering will be handled by some of Nashville's best and will ensure that the record sounds fantastic.  I'm so excited to release another record. I really believed after my last record in 2006 that I was finished. For all intents and purposes, I was done.\u00a0 I quit writing and I quit playing shows... but for whatever reason, God wasn't finished with me quite yet.\u00a0 After an unexpected burst of songs came in 2013, I knew that I needed to get these out into the world.\u00a0 I am grateful for those of you who have supported my modest little music career over these last 10 years.\u00a0 Every kind word has been an encouragement and a blessing along the way.  I'm turning 40 on October 30th.\u00a0 My goal is that with your help, we can get this album released right around that time.\u00a0  With gratitude,  Greg",
  "I've been working on 2 bird-centric projects over the last 10 months which will both be a part of my MFA thesis exhibition.  One project Impact is composed of large scale (44x65\") photos representative of the moment when birds collide with built structures. Many of the birds were found while walking in downtown Minneapolis or St.Paul for the Audubon's BirdSafe program during migration season. Birds are photographed intact and turned over to the Audubon society for collection and data entry. The second project DIY Bird Populator is a participatory exercise in rewilding and considering the consequences of loss.  Both project, at their cores, are concerned with an interconnectedness of species and the ways in which space is shared. Your support of my project through Kickstarter will help to offset costs of printing and presenting on a large scale as well as for having large, professionally made, print runs for my participatory project, DIY Bird Populator.

  "Photography is what got me into guiding. On my tours I attempt to have my clients leave with not only life long experiences but photos they are proud to share. In 2018 it became obvious that the Valdez Glacier ice shelf was entering its end of life phase and I began to document its breakdown. What I thought would be an 6-10 year processes, quickly became a 2 year metamorphosis punctuated in a single cataclysm. On July 7, 2020, the over mile long Valdez Glacier ice shelf calved into thousands of pieces. This is the collection of photos from the first time I saw Valdez Glacier, through my years of guiding the ice shelf and glacier, to its demise. I would like to get this collection in print because there's something special about a piece of history you can hold on to. In the near future, even before my children finish high school, Valdez Glacier Lake will no longer have icebergs and these days will be just a stories of once when. I want to offer people the chance to see how beautiful it was. Your contributions help preserve and share that story. The book is 9\" X 12\", hard cover, 200 pages, and has over 250 photographs.",

  "Feminists have never hesitated to dissect and attack art whose misogyny offends and repulses us. But what happens when we fall in love with the work of a musician, writer, or painter we see as anti-female? Do we rationalize our cognitive dissonance away, turn our back on the offending artist, or find a way to embrace the film or story that moves us while acknowledging what disturbs us about it? How does our attraction to misogynist art complicate our relationship to both the artist and feminism itself? When we asked these questions earlier this year in our call for submissions for It's Complicated, we received an overwhelming response, both from contributors and those eager to see the project come to fruition. Although we originally intended to publish a single anthology of feminists' personal essays on loving misogynist art, it soon became clear that the potential subjects were endless and the range of approaches to them broad. Many writers told us they'd spent years thinking about their fraught relationship to a particular artist or work. In kicking off the project with a series of handmade, themed zines culled from the excellent submissions we received, we hope to start an ongoing cultural conversation about the uncomfortable yet influential role that misogynist art plays in our lives.\u00a0Over the next several months, our plan is to expand It's Complicated into a book and create a website where even more contributors can publish their writing and readers are invited to participate in discussions on the topic.\u00a0The money we raise from this Kickstarter will fund the creation of two limited-edition zines: Totally Crushed Out, themed around the writers' teenage love of a problematic artist, and Identity Crisis, focused on contributors whose appreciation for a certain artist leaves them torn between their feminist values and some other aspect of their identity. To design the zines, we are working together with Birds of Lace, a small feminist literary publisher.\u00a0After they are designed, the zines\u00a0will be printed by the DIY-minded printer\u00a01984\u00a0Printing\u00a0using\u00a0quality materials.  TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR IT'S COMPLICATED #1 and #2: It's Complicated Zine #1: Totally Crushed Out!

  "For my exam project, i have to make an horror movie. We have been focusing on this topic all throughout our classes. I am a big horror fan myself, and i have been watching almost all horror movies, and all i now need is YOU! I have the idea to make a danish version of a \"found footage\" film. In Denmark there has only been 1 \"found footage\" film ever. We have the perfect scenery. Creepy old forests, castles, mansions and other creepy areas. My idea is: A boy and his smaller sister is on a roadtrip with 2 girls. Their car gives up and the backpacking trip they were going on, starts sooner than expected. They have no GPS, NO cellphone signal and only each other. Lost in the huge forrest they encounter voodoo, old danish folklore and a creepy \"entity\" that just won't leave them alone. They end their journey by an abandoned hospital, hungry, confused and with amnesia. They are less people than when they began. But what did actually happen in that forrest? \u00a0 Only the tape reveals!",
  "Debbie and The Devil is an indie horror film which tells the\nstory of Debbie Jones, a five-year-old girl who makes a deal with the devil\nhimself after witnessing her entire family die in a freak accident. At\nseventeen, Debbie must meet her end of the bargain: A murderous task involving\na beach house and Debbie\u2019s classmates. The goal is to make a truly entertaining\nhorror film that plays with genre conventions and throws out tiresome clich\u00e9s\nwhile also having a darkly humorous, surrealist tone. We have all seen the\nmovie where a bunch of kids go to some secluded place and get picked off by\nsome evil person or thing, so instead of laboriously going through the motions,\nDebbie and The Devil approaches the story from an angle rarely seen in\nmainstream horror films: It is from the perspective of the slasher, that, and\nit\u2019s meant to be fun. The\nmajority of horror films are, quite frankly, cynical cash grabs. They are made\nby committee, and usually the end result is a lifeless and a bit depressing\nexercise in separating teenagers from their allowances. Debbie and The Devil is\nmeant to be a lively, fun,\u00a0 and\nshocking (in a fun way) experience. It is a movie made with midnight movie\nmadness in mind. Tailor made for the following audience groups: horror lovers,\ncinema lovers, lovers on dates and lovers of fresh, exciting cinema. Most\nhorror movies, and, lets face it, movies in general, are painted by the\nnumbers, Debbie and The Devil is a mad frenzy of a horror film, meant to make\nthe audience giddy with excitement and disbelief. While the list of films and\nfilmmakers that have inspired Debbie and The Devil could fill a large book,\naside from the obvious influences like Tarantino and Eli Roth and Scorsese and\nboth Anderson\u2019s, Debbie and The Devil is strongly influenced by slasher films\nand Italian Giallo movies like Argento\u2019s Suspiria and the works of Mario Bava\nand Lucio Fulci. If you took every horror film and put it in a blender and\nadded a dash of Dragon Ball Z and a pinch of Monty Python, you would get DEBBIE\nAND THE DEVIL! So please donate to see this wild piece of cinema come to life!",
  "A little bit about myself. My name is Krista and I am a documentary photographer whose work focuses on landscapes and social issues across the globe. In 2018 I attended Kingston School of Art in London and received a Bachelor's degree in Photography. My projects aim is to engage people within the beauty and reality of the natural environment that surrounds them.\u00a0 You can find more information about my previous projects on my website https://www.krista-gurcka.com/ or on Instagram www.instagram.com/krista.gurcka About the exhibition.\u00a0 This is a documentary project on the environment and how the impact of natural phenomena such as volcanic activity and pollution have changed the communities within Indonesia. This is not just about the beautiful country that Indonesia is and the amazing landscapes that it holds, it\u2019s about the communities that live there. Photographing their struggles, laughs and smiles as well as their hard work to earn a living in order to be able to take care of their families. \u00a0 The aim within this project is to educate people on issues that the locals have to live with each day due to the constant changes of the environment and geological impact the constant activity of the volcanos brings.\u00a0 With so many natural disasters happening all over the world, from tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic explosions, wildfires to sandstorms and flooding. I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge these global issues and find new ways for man made structures to work together within the landscape and improve the living of communities that are impacted by these factors.\u00a0 This project is very important to me because I set myself a task to launch my own personal first solo exhibition about something I am passionate about, with the hope to be able to positively influence everyone that comes to my exhibition about global issues and ways to overcome them.While enjoying the beauty of a two week long documentary project that explores the landscapes and communities of Indonesia.\u00a0 In order to make this happen, I need your help! As I am funding and running this project completely on my own, I kindly ask that you guys help me achieve my goal for this year, as I believe great things are done together. Furthermore, the big aim of this project is to come together, work as a community and make a difference for the better. Therefore with your help, my project can have a stepping stone to achieve more and impact people on a bigger scale towards the future.\u00a0 If you believe in my project and the aim behind it, please go and support. About the exhibition This exhibition will include roughly 10-20 pieces of A4 to A2 size prints, all covering a varied range of documentary images of the volcanic areas of 'Mount Bromo' and the 'Ijen Crater'.\u00a0 Following by a hard cover photo book, which will include research about the volcanos with further imagery and information gathered from the locals about their everyday lives in these conditions.\u00a0 Below I have included some of the photographs which will be displayed in the gallery and the photo-book so that you guys can see what to expect from the show.\u00a0 The Funding.\u00a0 The money raised from your donations will include the cost of the rental of the gallery space which is \u00a31,200 for the week and \u00a3500 for the costs of printing and framing the images on the finest quality paper.\u00a0 Lastly, I would like to thank anyone who's supporting my project and I hope you enjoy my images and the project itself and will be able to take back something new for yourself and a story to tell others.\u00a0 Kind regards,\u00a0 Krista",

Also, I wish to raise awareness of the risk of vanishing cultural heritages in the islands, like collecting bird eggs, raising faroe horses, agriculture and fishing traditions etc. Many people don\u2019t even know where the Faroe islands lies and the destination is still quite unknown for many travellers. As part of the project, I will hold photographic exhibitions at various locations around the world.\u00a0 I expect the first exhibition to be shown in Paris, France in early 2020 and further on in Copenhagen, Denmark as part of a campaign promoting tourism to the Faroe islands. Supporting the project My Kickstarter backers have the option of receiving a fine art quality print of one image in the book or, a limited edition Coffee Table Book.\u00a0 Another option for the Kickstarter backers is to choose among various pictures on my website martinjohansen.com/gallery and order a print of 35 euros, in order to support my work and book project. My Background My name\u2019s Martin N. Johansen, I\u2019m originally from Denmark. My passion for the great outdoors and wildlife led me to become a nature photographer. For the past 28 years, I have specialising in photographing landscapes and animals around the world, on every continent, from New Zealand to Antarctica, France to Yemen. My photographs have appeared in many publications and have also been exhibited both in Europe and in the United States. Beside exploring the wild areas of Greenland and Iceland, I have been travelling widely in the Faroe Islands since 2008. Over the years, I've been adding many images to my archive. Recently, I collaborated with both danish, german and french magazines and published my articles and photo stories about the Faroe islands. What will my project involve ? My project have already involved lots of time and energy - more than 10 years and numerous trips to the Faroe islands.\u00a0 I expect to finish the final pictures end of october. I will then start editing and work on the lay-out of the book in collaboration with a graphic designer. Additionally, I will be adding illustrations in the book and expect to complete the final lay-out and illustrations early or mid-novembre, 2019.",
  "Hi! My name is Sarah and I\u2019m a wife, mother and Disney fanatic living in the SE of England. In the past 18 months I\u2019ve got into the Disney pin scene, building up great relationships with traders and sellers alike.\u00a0 Last year, I decided to dabble with creating my very own pin and after a tentative start, it sold out within a matter of months leaving me chomping at the bit to release another. I enjoyed the entire process, from spending hours creating and tweaking the design to get it just right, (waiting for the physical product was excrutiating though as I\u2019m so impatient,) managing and setting up my own online shops, promoting and finally, packaging them up and sending them off to their new homes. I loved reading the positive feedback (all of which can be found on my Spookyloupins Etsy page) and seeing the tags on Instagram. Marie seemed like the perfect choice as the starter, for what I hope will become a mini series featuring several other Disney cats, because she is absolutely adorable (and sassy.) The addition of the daisies is a personal nod to my favourite film \u2019Alice in Wonderland.\u2019 I wanted something playful and fun. Thank you so much for even clicking on my project let alone potentially pledging. Any amount helps towards the goal and I am so thankful for all the help you can offer! \ud83d\udc9c",

  " As a little girl growing in Puerto Rico, I would to go to the market with my mom. First stop was produce.\nShe would get green peppers, onions, cilantro and quite a few other vegetables and herbs to make her sofrito.\nMy mother was the oldest daughter and third oldest of ten siblings. She had allot to do with the raising of the younger siblings. She grew up in Ponce Puerto Rico, the south side of the island. Her family, very poor. She learned at a very young age to cook utilizing local harvested ingredients as well as herbs from her mothers garden and had a passion for it.\nUpon returning from the market, she would place all her vegetables and herbs on the kitchen table and start separating them.  I remember as if it was yesterday the essence of the aroma of the fresh herbs. The table covered, I could not see the tabletop.\nYou see, her sofrito was so award winning with friends and family, she would make bulk amounts to share it with everyone.\nMy mother  passed away a few years back and my father passed a couple of years after her. When my brother and I went to their home to clean it out, The first thing  I new I wanted to find was mama\u2019s recipe box.  After reading some of her recipes i came across her \"SOFRITO\" recipe.  It was then that  after all these years of following what I thought was her recipe (she had three different recipes), I was missing a couple of key ingredients. So, I went to the market, bought all the things on her list (for all three different recipes). Came home, made the recipes and I was overwhelmed at the difference in taste. I now understand how she would use one of the three with different dishes she would prepare.\nI have partnered up with one of New York\u2019s finest executive chefs, Chef Jim Donahue, who is also my husband. Chef Jim was so impressed with my mother\u2019s sofrito; we began to come up with recipes for other products, So you will have to stay tuned in.\nWe are committed to providing only the freshest product.\u00a0\n Cheers,\u00a0 Sharon And Jim www.mamassofrito.com",

  "A bit about why I want to make this album... I've been writing and performing these songs for the past two years now, and after every performance, I get asked, \"Where can I download your music?\" And I never have a good answer. The songs are about telling stories and talking to the people listening. Shared experiences and personal relationships. I've tried to sit down and do simple recordings on my own, but I was never satisfied with the outcome, mostly because it lacked human connection and the songs seemed to pale in comparison to live performance. But. At the beginning of this year, I decided that I wanted to do something bigger with my music. Something more than one night at a bar or theater. Something that I could give to people, because ultimately that's what it is, a gift. A bit of myself that I want to share with anyone that's willing to listen, because I have a feeling that the listener will relate. So I needed to figure out how the music could translate from live performance to simply audio, because those are two very different things. One night at a dive bar in the east village, my friend Lorenzo Wolff convinced me to let him produce my album. (it didn't take a ton of convincing...) Through his studio, Restoration Sound, I'll have the opportunity to work with other musicians, who will help me create a fuller sound, and engineers, who will mix and blend the sounds so that there is balance. It will be my songs heard in a way that has only ever existed in my head, where they are always much bigger and more complicated, even though in reality they are just little things. It is going to take so much work. And time. And talent. Which is why I need to raise money. Work, time, and talent should be compensated. The money raised will go to pay the musicians that play on the album, and the engineers that put such meticulous work in finding that perfect mix. It will pay for studio time and for the time that Lorenzo puts into crafting other instrumentals and gorgeous harmonies to accompany me. It will pay the artist who creates the album cover and then the press that actually prints the album itself. The money you give will buy the meal I feed the musicians as we go into a twelve hour day of recording, because dear me, they need to eat. You see why I need your help? The amount that I am asking for is the bare minimum required. If we raise more than that, that means the album will be that much better. If a song desperately needs a harp, that extra money will pay for that harpist. So please empty your pockets into this kickstarter. And please tell your friends about it. I promise they'll want to hear the music. I don't know much, but I do know that it is good.",
  "Hooray and thanks so much! \u00a0We made our goal! \u00a0You can still get the great deals listed on the rewards page for two more days, and the money will still go to production of the cd. \u00a0The full cost will be around 12,000 if all \u00a0goes as usual, and if I can cover even more of the expense, I'll be very grateful and promise to put it to good use. \u00a0Moonshine, Lime and Sugar started with this song at Clifftop last year!

You also may have heard some of my original songs and tunes on past albums with the Avant Gardeners band and my own previous solo recordings, such as No Gravity. \u00a0Having just moved to Asheville, NC, and passed through unexpected life changes, i find that my songwriting has sprouted new wings and I'm so excited to be in the studio recording them with my favorite musical partners, the hyper talented guitarist, Bert Carlson, world class percussionist Loren Oppenheimer, and everyone's favorite bass player, Ralph Gordon, with guest appearances by Dave Bartley on mando and guitar and George Paul on keys. \u00a0This project swept me away at a time when funds are quite limited, so I'm asking friends and the dance and music community I'm lucky to be a part of, to help me out with this kickstarter campaign. By basically pre-ordering your copy of the CD, I'll be able to complete the project this summer and hopefully have a recording for you this fall. \u00a0There are also some other great rewards, so check it out.

  "Kickstarter asks to talk about our project as if to a friend. But my friends already know about this project. A bunch of us are behind this project.\u00a0 We love the cronicles of Amber, the books written by Roger Zelazny, from which also came a great Diceless Role Playing Game.\u00a0 In the past there has been a fanbased magazine about Amber. The Amberzine. And also fan made spinoffs like Trumpcall. \u00a0A while ago the idea started to brew among a group on facebook to start a new magazine.\u00a0 Nowadays it is so much easier to reach the fans, the writers of fanfiction, the artists and the rule creators. \u00a0So we want as a group of fans to start a new fanzine for the chronicles of Amber including \u00a0the Diceless Roleplaying system. We already have enough content to fill up the first issues. And there is more coming in.\u00a0 But we need some start up money for a decent editing tool and of course to have the issues printed and send out through the world.\u00a0 So fans of Amber, join in and spread the love for Amber and Chaos.",
  "\u201cThe term \u2018gig economy\u2019 refers to a general workforce environment in which short-term engagements, temporary contracts, and independent contracting is commonplace.

  "I wanted to make a short film that would at first lull audiences in with a sense of safety, and then slowly pull the curtain back to terrify audiences and ultimately leave them shocked and disturbed by the ending, which I believe to be quite chilling, and that will all be achieved without using any words. It's all in the visuals.  This film is\u00a0to be directed with grace, and simplicity. It's a quiet horror film, and only becomes bloody in its last moments. It's a pure example of a tension builder. I prefer scares that don't hammer you over the head.  Horror is my bread and butter. It's a genre I respect as much as anyone would respect their favorite genres. I specifically use homages to classic babysitter in peril films like, \"Halloween\" and \"When A Stranger Calls\" (the original).  People\u00a0will be afraid to walk home afterwards. I want them to be terrified to go home to their empty houses. I want them to think twice about answering their phone.  The film has already been cast, and we've done several table reads and will be starting with continual rehearsals, blocking, choreography, and effects tests right up until the start of shooting on August 9th.  Put simply, the things that I'm seeking by starting this Kickstarter are things that myself and my crew need to make this much more than a low budget short film. Costume rental,\u00a0better lights, better sound equipment, top of the line effects kits for some of the more visceral scenes\u00a0(we're going practical).

  "WHAT WE\u2019RE UP TO:\n   We\u2019re the Bread and Butter Band, and we need your help. We have a whole full-length album written, and have demos done of all the music. We\u2019ve recorded three of the tracks in the studio already, and we\u2019re ready to do the other 9! \u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019ve already put hundreds and hundreds of hours into creating this music, and recreating and practicing and recreating and performing it. We\u2019re now ready to share it with all of you.\u00a0 WHY WE NEED YOUR MONEY:  Did you know it costs more than $500 a day to record in a professional studio? During our first studio experience, we tracked three songs a day, and then took another day to do vocals on those three tracks. And then it costs the same amount to complete all of the post-production work with engineers to mix, and then subsequently master the album. When mixing for an album, it takes even longer than tracking. \n   This puts us at approximately $10,000 just to complete the recording process. It took us a year to save the $2000 we spent in the studio on round one, and we\u2019d like to complete our album sooner than 5 years from now. \u00a0WHAT TO EXPECT:\n   If our project gets funded, we plan on recording our album in the fall and winter of 2014. \u00a0We're not asking for you all to do it all by yourselves, we're planning on raising the other third of the total cost. That means you\u2019ll have a copy in your hand within a year from now if you make a donation. And that means we\u2019ll be able to use it to book festivals and tours that take us near your town next summer!

  "I am very excited to be having the chance to be in the studio while my song, 'Where Is The Love' is recorded. I have selected the very fast-rising and awesome singing duo, 'Tenasie' to do the vocals. Tenasie Bowe and Matt Kyler are two of the most talented young artists on the Nashville music scene today and are quickly being recognized as one of the next big things in Nashville!  The song, 'Where Is The Love' was inspired by the loss of one of my friends, Chuck Juba. Chuck was a high school friend with incredible musical abilities and I always thought he would go on to be a famous musician - his gift was just that great. Years go by like they do, and people lose track of old friends and as such I lost track of Chuck. In recent years the advent of social media has allowed many of us to re-connect with old friends and relatives we thought we'd never see again and so once I joined Facebook I set out to find all my old classmates of Arundel Sr. High School Class of 1980. I was shocked to learn eventually that Chuck has passed away after a decades long struggle with drug and alcohol addictions and long periods of homelessness in 2008. It took me a while to even comprehend the circumstances of his death and to this day I still can't understand it.... The song is an expression of my grief and I wrote it to make people more aware of the issues of addiction and homelessness that affects so many of our fellow citizens...

  "Hello friends, family, and friends of friends and family! I have been making music for over 25 years. Almost EVERY time I finish a performance, people come up to ask me: \"Do you have any CDs for sale?\" Sadly, the answer is NO. It takes quite a bit of money to produce a CD! Well, now is your chance, fans of David Bryan! If we are able to raise these funds together, then I will be able to\u2014for the first time\u2014capture a performance with a high quality PROFESSIONAL recording (which shall be made available on digital download). This will not only allow you to carry my voice around in your Ipod wherever you go, but also then allows me to submit for consideration to play in various venues\u2014as well as for music festivals all over the country. All money raised for this project will go entirely to help further my musical ambitions. Many people have told me over the course of my life that I have a beautiful voice. This praise is very gratifying, but often overshadowed in the face of the financial difficulties that this musician faces. (EVERY MUSICIAN has encountered such financial difficulties at one point or another!) That being said, after paying for the recording, every dollar contributed towards this project will in some way serve to create and sustain a path on which I can continue to share this wonderful gift which has been given to me: my voice. I am more excited about the possibilities for this particular concert than any other I have previously envisioned, as it is a tribute concert to my all-time favorite musician. Please help me to make this dream come true.  Thank you kindly for your consideration. DAVID BRYAN   Addendum: I know much of this campaign is rather VAGUE. This sounds very bizarre, but due to numerous circumstances out of my control, I can't give any more details here about this particular concert! If you want to choose the \"digital download\" reward, but want to first know what you're getting (or if you want any info about the project at all), please contact me here on kickstarter, or at davidbryan32@yahoo.com.

These two adorable borb fronds come as a pair - that's right, two enamel pins together!! \u00a0The demand for Pigeons to be added to the family has been insane and so I'm super happy that I'm now getting the chance to do so. ADOPT OF PIGEON PAL NOW!!! \u2022 You will be paying a lower price for pre-ordering the pins through Kickstarter! They will be \u00a37 in my shop and at conventions! \u2022 You will be getting extra Kickstarter-exclusive goodies such as the super cute stickers\u00a0 \u2022 Kickstarter is a very flexible platform - you commit now and pay later! This lets you manage your funds a lot better, and also gives you the ability to edit your pledge at any time, meaning you can increase, decrease or cancel it at any time until the campaign ends! \u00a0Once the initial \u00a3450 target is met and the campaign ends, the Pigeon designs will be able to go to print. Unlike my last Borb campaign, there are no other designs being added, as I am taking part in the Make100! The aim here is to get 100 Pairs of Pigeon Pals out to Backers! \u00a0Have you done this before? Yes! This is my second Enamel Pin Kickstarter and I have had a successful enamel pin Kickstarter campaign previously. Check out my previous Borbs Will the pins have custom backing cards? Yes! For this kickstarter it will be a large decorative backing card to accommodate both pigeon pals What clutch will they have? Because of the size it will be one clutch but hopefully with a rubber clutch When will I be charged? You will not be charged for your pledge until the campaign has been successfully funded. So you can pledge now and wont pay anything until the beginning of February. Will I receive both pins? Yes! this campaign is for a pair of pigeon pins What if I want more than one Pair of Pins? As I'm limiting this campaign to 100x Pairs to keep in line with the spirit of Make100, I have capped the tiers. Because of this there is only one option currently to add one pair. However, at the end of the campaign depending on availability, I might be able to do add ons. I will keep this in mind. How long will it take for me to receive my pins? As long as there are no delays with the manufacturing process, they should reach you sometime in April. I'm hoping earlier, but I'm giving myself a grace period for any delays. Once the pins are with me I'll be checking for any imperfections and then attaching the pins to backing cards and cutting stickers. I run my business on my own so you'll need to be patient with me once they arrive ^^;; Shipping times are estimated at UK: 2-4 days Europe: 7-14 days USA, Canada, Australia and the rest of the world: 14-21 days. N.B. These are estimates. I am based in the UK so please allow at least 21 days if you are outside of Europe What are the shipping charges? UK - \u00a32 for 1st Class Royal Mail Everywhere Else - \u00a34 for untracked international standard I've decided this time to keep the postage low as to not skew my goal total. It's difficult to gauge how much extra is needed for shipping for these campaigns and so this time I have kept them low at standard shipping. It's also more affordable for international backers - however, this means it will take longer for items to arrive. if you would like to upgrade to tracked be sure to add \u00a35 to your pledge Why Kickstarter? Why pre-orders? I've wanted to design and have produced enamel pins for a long time now but the up front costs are quite pricey. Funding through Kickstarter is easy, simple and allows flexibility for backers. Will your pins be available in your shop/cons? Yes, hopefully if I can get enough made, any left over will go into my shop and to sell at cons, but they will be at the higher price of \u00a37 a pin I have a question that wasn't answered here! Can I contact you? Sure! Feel free to DM me on here or over on my social medias :)",
  "Why Paint 100 Blue Face Paintings & Give them Away? Hi there. I'm Anna aka Bunny Glue. I'm an artist based in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Back in February I painted a blue face in acrylic on canvas. And then another. And just one more. Then I said to a friend, \"I'm going to paint one hundred of these.\" She shrugged and said, \"You're crazy.\" And so I painted until I dreamed blue faces. And it was amazing.\u00a0 By June 25th I had finished painting one hundred. Now I have 100 paintings that need homes. Couches to live over. Other people to admire them. And I need money to buy more paint and canvas. They need homes. So here's what I decided to do: 1. Give away 50 Paintings.  2. Swap 20 paintings for Karma. 3. Make a little pocket change (aka paint & canvas money) from choice. It's not as complicated as it sounds.\u00a0 Shipping to US/Canada included in basic shipping pricing. I'm happy to ship internationally, just contact me and I can figure out any additional cost based on your location. All of the money raised will go to art supplies, developing art projects and studio costs.\u00a0My funding goal of $600 covers the cost of canvas for the project which is about one quarter of the total project cost when you factor in the other supplies (paint, brushes, glassine, protective foam etc) and shipping for the art that is involved.\u00a0 What are the paintings like?  You can see the paintings and pick out your favorite here: http://www.bunnyglue.com/blue.html Each painting is a 12 inch square one inch thick canvas suitable for easy immediate hanging. The paintings are in acrylic and most of the paint used is Kroma artist grade (some of the early paintings were student grade paint) and all of the paint used is light fast. Each painting depicts a blue face. The sooner you back the project, the more likely you are to get the painting of your choice! Preferences will be prioritized based first on reward level and second based on when you backed the project. Other ways to help?\n\u2022\tLet your friends know about this project.\n\u2022\tLike me on Facebook.\n\u2022 \u00a0Follow me on Twitter. Thank you.\u00a0 You can see larger versions of the paintings at\u00a0http://www.bunnyglue.com/blue.html\u00a0but here is a quick preview",
  "Over the next year, I will be traveling across Michigan to hike more than 300 trails, all while documenting my travels through photographs. My goal is to share some of the most beautiful and remote places in Michigan, some of which can only be reached by foot on a hiking trail. Throughout my journey I also plan to inform and educate people across Michigan and beyond, about the importance of wildlife and nature conservation. To assist the Michigan Wildlife Conservancy in their efforts, I will be donating 10% of the proceeds from the photo book, after its published, to help ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy the outdoors.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, not only for me, but for all of us to experience Michigan in a way that so few have been able to thus far. Join me on my mission to bring this breathtaking photo book to life, so that those across the US, and the world, can appreciate the wonders of Michigan that I have been lucky enough to appreciate my entire life.  Michigan is one of the top trial states in the nation, with well over 650 hiking trails. Although I will only reach less than half of those trails over the course of a year, I hope to bring to life the remaining trails in the years to come.\u00a0",
  "DEMO. After the September 9th VZNBRAND launch, we have branched out and began working on and trying new things. VZNBRAND is entirely quality driven while maintaining superior design and concept, this is directly translated into the two part magazine that is \"DEMO\". DEMO is non-profit a summary of our love for everything. Initially, we wanted to do one magazine which focused on our own inspirations, creatives, and culture but as everything we do, it has snowballed into something else. It is with our pleasure to say that so far, nobody has turned down articles, interviews, and appearances in our magazine. This blessing is now allowing us to make this into a two-part publication, where we can focus on making this the best possible final product that can deliver all it is set out to.\u00a0 Both editions will release at the same time, and contain different artists, creatives, and cultural influencers. At this rate we have confirmed the artists and articles below, and have many others in the workings.\u00a0 DEMO Part One - Confirmed DEMO Part Two - Confirmed We are working on adding more people every day and we will provide the most balanced magazines that will surely shake up the journalism market. No alteration, no corporation. Pure content, pure culture.\u00a0",

  "Hi! I'm Audrey of Maintaining Mediocrity and together, we're going to take a tour across the great land of Ooo. Before we begin, please remember to keep your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the vehicle at all time. What's a Kickstarter? Kickstarter is a crowdfunding source where you help the creator bring their visions to life! In this case, a series of magical enamel pins. Think of it as a pre-order, but with extra benefits! Backers will receive frequent updates on the status of the pins during and after the campaign, a first look at the finished products, and most importantly, super super discounts!\u00a0 Why pledge? The prices listed for the Kickstarter are the cheapest I will ever be offering these pins. If you're fast enough to snag an Early Bird tier, you'll be getting a single pin for just $11- that's $4 cheaper than retail price! Standard tiers are still discounted at $13 per pin. All leftover pins will be sold in my shop for $15 each. Additionally, you will not be charged until the end of the Kickstarter. You can adjust your pledge higher or lower (or even cancel your pledge altogether) throughout the duration of the campaign. For more details on how to adjust your pledge, scroll down to Pledge Adjustment. All of the current Day and Night pins will be hard enamel, gold plated, with two back posts for double security. These will be heftyboy pins spanning 2.25\" across! As these are Day and Night sets, the pins are designed to be worn in pairs of 2 (as shown below). I've designed them to fit together in any combination, so you can wear a day and night set of one kingdom, or mix n match your own pairs! Now let\u2019s take a look at the designs! In addition to the Day and Night pins, I've also included my snail mini pins in the campaign. At 0.75\" across, these super tiny, kinda rude pins are the perfect size for discreet middle fingers (and they're great as board fillers, too)! For the Kickstarter only, these snails will be $5 each (retail price $7) and available in 6 colors: pink, blue, yellow, purple, green, and LICH (glow in the dark). Please add $5 per snail to your pledge and in the survey after the campaign, you'll be able to select which color(s) you'd like. At any time during the campaign, you can adjust your pledge higher or lower. Remember: you won't be charged until the Kickstarter ends on Sat 1/25 at 11:59 PST. For early bird backers: please manually add +$11 per pin to your current pledge. For standard tier backers (non-early bird): no math required! Simply select the new tier and Kickstarter will automatically adjust your pledge accordingly. To add a tiny snail pin: for both early bird and standard tier backers, please manually add +$5 per snail to your current pledge. To add a banana guard pin: for both early bird and standard tier backers, please manually add +$9 per banana guard to your current pledge. January 9 - January 25: Kickstarter campaign February - March: pin production! Please keep an eye out for updates which will contain the first look at these pins during and post production. March - April: if all goes smoothly, the products will be delivered to me and I can send them all out to you! Funding during this campaign will go towards: 10%: Kickstarter fees 30%: shipping supplies (mailers) and shipping rewards to backers 60%: pin production and backer cards",
  "\u00a0Who doesn't love pinnipeds?! These 4 pins represent some of our favorite mammals, whose survival all depend on the oceans we love. Okay, so they aren\u2019t ALL pinnipeds but, for puns sake we are rolling with it! We hope you wear/display our pins as talking points for these species! As always, wear something that means something. <3 If our project is successfully funded, we will send out reward surveys to our backers! The reward surveys will allow you to choose your pins! :) If our project is not funded to the $500 goal, you will not be charged and we will not receive funds for this project. This Kickstarter's initial funding goal is $500 USD. This will help us produce all 4 hard enamel pins as well as help to cover backing cards, Kickstarter fees, taxes, and shipping costs/supplies. Though $500 USD doesn't cover all the fees, it will help us off to a great start!\u00a0 Once the Kickstarter has ended and backer surveys are completed, all pins will go on to production! Production takes an estimated 5-8 weeks. Estimated timeline (if we reach our goal early, we will update this!): How do I pledge? Just click the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button on the campaign page or scroll down the page to select a reward tier! Do I get to choose my pins? \u00a0YES! If our project is successfully funded, meaning we reach our goal of $500 USD, we will send out surveys to all backers asking which pins you would like! \u00a0The reward surveys sent after the campaign ends will allow you to choose your pins! :) When are backers charged? If the project you\u2019re backing is successfully funded, your card will be charged when the project reaches its funding deadline. If the project does not reach its funding goal, your card is never charged. What forms of payment are accepted? You can use a debit or credit card associated with Visa, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, or American Express. Discover and JCB cards are currently only accepted for US-based projects. Kickstarter does not currently accept Maestro or Visa Electron cards. If using a pre-paid credit card, please make sure that the card has a value of at least $1 more than your pledge amount.

  "Gallows Bound would love to introduce themselves into the world of vinyl pressings, unfortunately the rising cost of this service versus the rising demand on the companies offering the service has created an unusually high cost transferred to the band wanting to release their music on the medium. It is no longer a secret that bands (local and national) rarely make enough money to provide them with the tools necessary to spread their music as far as they can and with being able to offer multiple mediums from today's contemporary download cards and CD's to yesteryear's cassette tapes and vinyl records, we as musicians are able to reach a broad variety of listeners and collectors who may never have heard our music simply because of the device they prefer to experience it with! Thank you for looking and for considering your donation to our project!",
  "Hello there! I'm Kirar, and I'm the tiny creator of K-Poppin' Pins. I've always loved doodling, and recently I've decided to take the leap to make my drawings into enamel pins! I've self-funded my first three pins to start my small shop out, but I'm hoping I can expand in the future. \u2665 You can check them out here on\u00a0my Instagram! Whether you are a certified Orbit or just love magic potion bottles, these pins are sure to give that starry-eyed feeling when you put them on! These potion-themed pins are inspired by the solo music videos of LOONA's Odd Eye Circle members: Kim Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry. Thank you for checking out my Kickstarter! Even if you're not planning on pledging, please share this on social media if you like the designs so that we can be closer to making them a reality together! \u2665 All pins are hard enamel and gold-plated. The back has 2 pin posts with black rubber clutches and a \"K-Poppin' Pins\" backstamp. \u201cThis is Eclipse, I can't keep my eyes off, so will you be with me continuously?\u201d\u00a0 An eclipse-themed elixir, featuring an eclipse with continuous love! (Or the squiggles off of Kim Lip's shirt, you decide!) A sweet little betta fish swimming through the stars in a jar? What's not to love? Go singing in the rain with this pin attached to your raincoat! Or not, I won't stop you. ;) A cherry love potion? A mirror portal in a potion? You can bet your buns that it's all that and more! Ah-ah-ah-imagine what would happen if you drank it! (Please do not drink your pin.) Funding for this project will go towards production, packaging, and delivery of the pins! If the project is fully funded, backer surveys will be sent after the project to confirm shipping addresses and which rewards you want. Please double check your shipping address to avoid shipping delays and reduce the risk of your package getting lost! All packages are shipped via the U.S. Postal Service. All USA orders will include tracked shipping. International orders will be shipped with tracking, but the tracking details may not update (usually after it reaches your country) depending on your country's postal service. Please note that you are responsible for any taxes, fees, or VAT associated with receiving your item if you are outside of the USA.",
  "Hello! My name is Stefanie and I'm a freelance cartoonist. I've been working in artist alleys on and off for the last few years, and I want to make the great leap into doing enamel pins. Recently I made my first pin, and it was a big success! I want to make another for the Make 100 here on kickstarter, and I knew exactly what i wanted to make. For a long time I've always enjoyed drawing animal skulls, and for this I wanted something related to where I currently live: California. BEAR SKULL AND POPPIES will be a 1.5\" gold hard enamel pin in creme, golden orange and accents of green and white. I will be doing a limited run of 100 for these pins.",
  "To start out 2020 I have a trio of unrelated cat designs. \u00a0I have several larger more cohesive 'collections' that I want to release this year, so solo pins like these either need to have very short KS campaigns or be grouped together like this. \u00a0(I have another unrelated design that will be getting the one to two week treatment.) I completely understand that these may have different audiences so don't feel bad if you are only interested in one of these designs! My kids love for me to tell bedtime stories. \u00a0These stories often star their stuffed animals. \u00a0They have this little set of kitties that they love dearly. \u00a0One multi-chapter story involved a ninja kitty who trained their kitties as ninja so that they could team up and help him defeat an evil sorcerer. I designed 5 separate Ninja Kitties, but have chosen to have Snowflake as a ninja made into a pin. \u00a0Who knows, if this one is well received I may try to do the others at a later date.\u00a0 If you have ever simultaneously owned a cat and a laptop this design likely speaks to you. \u00a0Kitties love warm cozy places to nap and as we all know, if kitty fits, kitty sits! There are two things that are certain in life, death and coffee. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Late in 2019 my kitty of 14 years passed away. \u00a0I actually thought she was going to pass in 2017, so I was glad to get the extra time with her. \u00a0I wanted to do something as a tribute to her passing but given her rough personality a kitty with wings and a halo just didn't work for me. \u00a0I ended up designing this Kitty Reaper. \u00a0As for the coffee cup, well I like coffee. \u00a0Maybe the reaper decided to take a little coffee break in 2017. \u00a0 Here's to you, Lily!\u00a0 \u00a0My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. I am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins. \u00a0Many of my previous designs are available for sale through my online shop, frostdragondesigns.com. All of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers. I love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives. Every pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!",
  "I plan on completing a 50+ piece series depicting the abundant wildlife of my home state of Montana. The animals selected will encompass the majority of Montana's mammals, birds, and fish. The stylistic manner in which I will approach these works, is a new, still developing technique that blends realism and cartooning. This strategy allows me to capture each animals personality, while accurately depicting its real life colors, markings, and textures. I find this style not only teaches the viewer about the biology of the animal, but also draws the viewer into a personal relationship with animal. My inspiration for this series came from my flagship painting attached to this project, the \"Bored\"-eal Owl. Budget Breakdown The first\u00a0expense of this project will be canvases. I intend to somewhat match the animals actual size to the canvas size, therefore canvases will range in size from 2x4 in. up to 4x6 ft. I\u00a0stretch my own canvases\u00a0that are over 16x20 in. in order to save money.\u00a0 $100 for wood for frames, $50 for \u00a0raw canvas, $50 for smaller canvases =$200 The final expenses for this project includes acrylic paint, spray paint and acrylic medium. Using large canvases and the vast number of pieces in this series will require a lot of paint. The acrylic medium allows me to capture more depth, while enhancing color. $40 for acrylic paint, $40 for acrylic medium, $20 spray paint (background texture) =$300.00 \u00a0If you have any questions feel free to contact me at a.grensten@gmail.com.

  "Well, hello there! \u00a0 Thanks for stopping by. \u00a0We're so glad you found us! \u00a0We're really hard to find, given that you can barely see our shop unless you're within 20 feet, standing in the middle of the street! \u00a0;) \u00a0 That's why we're doing this. \u00a0We sorely need signage that sticks out and grabs attention, but we're spending all our money to make chocolate - AMAZING VEGAN CHOCOLATE - which really solves all of the difficult problems in life! \u00a0 But, if nobody discovers our shop, then nobody buys our chocolate, then the world is one less vegan chocolate maker... which, we're hard to come by! \u00a0Please support our little fundraiser so we can get noticed so we can spread the message that vegan doesn't mean boring and gross. \u00a0 Here's what we're looking to do: - Install a perpendicular sign that sticks out so all the the cool folks on Elmwood can see our shop from the next block, and make it their next destination! \u00a0 - Fix up the big brick \"artwork\" wall outside our shop. \u00a0We already have landlord approval to paint over the present art and we want to put something up that is equally as awesome! \u00a0We're hoping to paint a very cool triquetra and install a small sign that our shop is just inside. \u00a0 - We also want to install new outdoor lights (those are way more expensive and BIGGER than you think!) so we can really command attention once the sun sets. \u00a0Currently only one of the outdoor lights work and they are both broken and dilapidated. \u00a0 - Lastly, we'd love to get some attention grabbing sail signs that we can put outside our shop for special events or bring with us to festivals and markets! \u00a0We want them to say \"vegan\" and \"chocolate\" so we can be noticed from way far away! \u00a0 THANK YOU. \u00a0Thank you for saving our planet. \u00a0Thank you for loving animals, and loving people, and sustaining the earth. \u00a0Thank you for enjoying our great chocolate. \u00a0",
  "Harnessing the amazing power of chia and hemp seeds (and a love of puns), Naked Hippie Snacks bars are made with the highest quality organic, gluten-free and vegan ingredients for a delicious and healthy snack on-the-go.\u00a0 \u00a0 Before now, it's been quite impossible to find a vegan protein bar that was free of soy and gluten and that tasted good. Naked Hippie Snacks is one of the first snack bars on the market that uses\u00a0hemp seeds as a plant-based protein source. And it's delicious! The High on Protein bar combines hemp seeds, peanuts, figs and a medley of seeds for a taste that is reminiscent of a PB & J sandwich. The 56g bar clocks in at 250 calories, 6g of fiber and 10g of protein. It really is the best tasting, most natural protein bar out there! In addition to our vegan protein bar, we make a line of vegan snack bars that are just as healthy, but not as high in protein. These bars come in the following flavors: Off The Walnut,\u00a0which tastes like an oatmeal raisin cookie; Fudge N' Coconut,\u00a0a titillating trio of fair-trade, vegan dark chocolate, tart cherries and tropical coconut; Apricot Zing,\u00a0a healthy remake of a cranberry orange muffin; and Banana Bliss,\u00a0our twist on a vegan banana cream pie. Each bar is made with 10 or fewer ingredients, which even your kids can pronounce and understand. The base of the snack bar features organic, gluten-free oats, organic chia and flax seeds, and organic maple syrup. Next, we add slightly toasted\u00a0nuts, organic and un-sulfured dried fruits, and maybe some vegan, fair-trade dark chocolate or organic coconut, depending on the flavor. And unlike other bars on the market, Naked Hippie bars contain absolutely no soy, no gums, and no ingredients labeled \u201cnatural flavors.\u201d\u00a0 Naked Hippie bars have gone through over two years of experimentation and taste-testing to ensure that they are not only more flavorful than any other bar, but also offer more balanced nutrition. Each ingredient is hand-picked for its health benefits, even our sweeteners. Here are our stats: each 52g bar has 250 calories or less, 6g of fiber, 6g of protein,\u00a0at least 1600mg of Omega-3, 12g of sugar from organic maple syrup and dried fruits.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"I absolutely loooove your bars! I tried one a couple of days ago at Romancing the Bean and I've been obsessed ever since! *heart eyes emoji*\"-Rebecca S. \"These bars are so good, I ate them all.\"-Jenna T. \"It\u2019s crazy! I\u2019ve come to realize I\u2019m addicted to these bars. If somehow I get too distracted and don\u2019t have one when I should\u2026I suddenly crave it and have to reorganize my priorities!!!! They taste good and ARE good.\"-Terry G. \"I LOVE these bars! I was given the opportunity to try the bars with the drizzled chocolate on them and felt my chocolate craving satiated. The fact there are no flour products whatsoever in any of the Naked Hippie Snacks makes them a perfect choice for those who need to be gluten-free in their lives. I\u2019m a chocolate lover with a massive sweet tooth and all the snacks take care of my cravings, yet are so much more healthy than a candy bar or cookie! Awesome job!\"-Kathy A. \"These are amazing for protein bars, The texture is good, and the flavor is perfect to me. So many protein bars have a heavy flavor or are sweet, this one avoids both. I never thought I would find a protein bar I liked.\"-Sheryl H. \u00a0 Chia seeds Containing a larger amount of omega-3 fatty acids than salmon, chia seeds are also very high in fiber (40% fiber by weight) and contain up to 14% protein by weight. They are high in antioxidants and studies have found that they may improve cardiovascular risk factors in Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0 Hemp seeds Considered the most nutritious seed in the world, hemp seeds are a complete protein with a highly concentrated balance of protein, essential Omega-3 and 6 fatty acids, and vitamins and minerals such as Magnesium, Vitamin E and Zinc. Flaxseeds A tablespoon of flaxseeds contains 1800 mg of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, an ingredient needed to carry out normal bodily functions. The daily consumption of flax may also play a role in preventing diabetes and lowering the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u00a0 Oats Organic, gluten-free oatmeal is unprocessed, high in fiber and rich in protein.  Among its benefits are the stabilization of blood sugar levels to gently pace your body\u2019s nutrition absorption rate and the removal of bad cholesterol.\u00a0 Almonds A single serving of almonds has nearly 50% of your daily recommended Vitamin E intake. This vitamin has been shown to reduce the risks of cancer.\u00a0 Maple syrup In addition to being incredibly delicious and vegan, organic maple syrup has recently been discovered as a super food, much like broccoli and blueberries. Research from the University of Rhode Island has found that maple syrup contains compounds that may help manage Type 2 diabetes, prevent cancer and reduce inflammation. The 54 compounds in maple syrup all work together to create a natural sweetener that inhibits enzymes from converting carbohydrates to sugar and provides the body with essential vitamins and minerals including zinc, manganese, B2, biotin, calcium, Vitamin A, and many more.\u00a0 \u00a0 According to the Harvard School of Public Health, Omega-3 and Omega-6 are essential fatty acids, meaning they are required by our bodies to carry out vital functions, like building cell membranes in the brain and keeping bones strong. The problem in the Western diet is two-fold: we don\u2019t get nearly enough Omega-3 fatty acids as we need and we consume way too much Omega-6 in the form of soybean and corn oils found in many fast food and overly processed foods. Human bodies require no more than 4 times as much Omega-6 as Omega-3 fatty acids, but our current diets are filled with over 40 times as much. \u00a0Naked Hippie bars contain a 1:2 ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6, that when paired with a more balanced daily diet, closes the gap between the two.\u00a0 \u00a0 For the past two years, Naked Hippie Snacks has been operating as a Cottage Food Kitchen business, meaning that we make the bars out of our home kitchen. Under the Cottage Food Act, we can only sell in Los Angeles County. We have been successful locally, selling out at coffee shops, grocery stores and artisan food fairs. Everyone who tastes these bars absolutely loves them.\u00a0 While producing these bars at home and selling them in LA has been a great way to start out and gauge people's interest, it has been difficult to earn the capital we need to expand to a commercial kitchen. We want to produce in a commercial kitchen so we can ship nationally and share our healthy and delicious snacks with everyone.\u00a0 The funds we receive through this campaign will go toward three aspects of the business. It will fund rent and staff at our own commercial kitchen, the purchase of specialty, medium-scale equipment for production and packaging, and promotional materials and efforts such as distribution, trade shows, marketing and sales staff. Rather than sharing a kitchen with other producers, we would like to produce out of our own commercial kitchen so we can control and prevent contaminants such as animal products, gluten, soy, etc. Start the year off right with healthy, vegan snacks! If your New Year Resolution is to eat healthy, our bars will help you stay on track. Some of our rewards include a custom-designed Naked Hippie Snacks T-shirt. JUST BECAUSE OUR SNACKS ARE NAKED DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD BE!\u00a0Cover up your naughty bits with our T-shirt that's fun, fresh and vintage-inspired. Here's a little peek at what it looks like: \u00a0",

  "We have embarked on an exciting project to record our debut album (12 songs in total) with past and present members of the band. Years of playing, writing, laughing and performing all coming together to create an unique and eclectic album. We have funded the project ourselves this far but we've hit a block in the road. These things are expensive!!! The money you pledge will be used for mixing, mastering, duplicating, distributing and marketing our songs. We have 12 musicians in total including guest vocalists all with a different tones and qualities. We are from different musical backgrounds and walks of life but have joined forces to make a transatlantic, ericana vibe with lots of off-beat quirky zaniness. Its a celebration of the life and times of Wookalily. It's been a great experience to make this music and we hope you all get to enjoy it as well. We are using Millbank Studios in Lisburn and the much sought after and talented sound engineer Michael Mormecha. \u00a0 A word from Michael...\"it's the first of it's kind to come out of Northern Ireland and it's been really fun to make\" www.millbankstudios.net www.facebook.com/wookalily www.wookalily.com",

  "Hi! Thank you for taking a minute to check out the official VURRITO\u2122 Kickstarter!\u00a0 VURRITO\u2122 is the first of its kind; a whole-food, plant-based, fast-casual restaurant. VURRITO\u2122 sources only fresh, local and 100% Vegan ingredients. We intend on opening the fist VURRITO\u2122 location in Providence, RI. Oh, and did we mention? We\u2019re going to change the world! So picture this - you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re tired, maybe you're on your lunch break and don\u2019t have much time. You want something quick but don\u2019t want to sacrifice quality. You want something good for you but don\u2019t want to sacrifice flavor. You want something that\u2019s going to taste great and make you feel good inside and out - you\u2019ve just walked into VURRITO\u2122. \u00a0 \u00a0 VURRITO\u2122 is going to change how the world eats. We understand that the best dining experience always starts with locally sourced, fresh ingredients. The food looks amazing and the aromas are captivating. There are flavor profiles throughout the dishes and you leave feeling good about yourself. Our focus is for every guest to have that experience - to have the opportunity to make a choice that is healthy, sustainable, familiar, delicious, cruelty-free, and environmentally friendly. \n\nEach dish on VURRITO\u2019s menu is made up entirely from whole-foods and vegetables. We\u2019re talking sweet potatoes, eggplant, portobello mushrooms, peppers, avocados, summer squash, black beans and corn. Even our salsa, rice and desserts are fresh and unique. \n\nThis is Mexican inspired cuisine - there are no limits.\u00a0 It's VURRITO\u2019s goal to exceed your expectations when you choose to visit us.\n\nThe current \u201cquick and easy\u201d options are not good for us and we know it. They leave us feeling sick and unsatisfied. The problem that exists here is that there are no alternatives to this fast, cheap, low-quality food that has saturated the market. With this \"quick and easy\" food comes artificial ingredients, harmful additives, and pesticides. Add in growth hormones, antibiotics, and the mass bred, mistreated animals and you have a recipe for disaster. Only now are we starting to realize that animal agriculture is one of the largest, if not THE largest contributor to global warming. It doesn\u2019t have to stay that way. People are waking up and realizing that it\u2019s time to fight back. It\u2019s time to take control of the food we produce and consume. We must move forward as human beings and we must focus on ourselves, generations to come, and on our planet. It\u2019s time to make a difference. It\u2019s time to eat what\u2019s right! We need your help. We know VURRITO\u2122 will be successful. The only thing left in question is WHERE do we start. We\u2019re asking for $28,000 to help get the doors open on the first VURRITO\u2122 location. Our end goal is to be everywhere. This is not just about us. It\u2019s about everyone. It\u2019s about you, it\u2019s about supporting the farmers we buy our produce from, it\u2019s about our local community, it\u2019s about our health, it\u2019s about the millions upon millions of mistreated animals. It\u2019s about our planet, it\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right. VURRITO\u2122 is the future. Will you help be a part of it? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "My name is Vladlena and I have decided to challenge myself and produce 30 Watercolor paintings during 30 days. I will try to do 1 painting per day. The paintings will be painted on A4 size 300GSM watercolor paper with high quality watercolors. Will be signed and dated in front and at the back. I've started painting in 2010, when I accidentally discovered the talent in me and my friends started telling me that I do paint well. I mainly concentrated on acrylic paints, but then I discovered watercolors and fell in love with them )) I am constantly experimenting with different styles, so that  get the feel of paints. I enjoy vibrant colors and bits of fantasy. Please have a look at some of my watercolor works: There are many more, you can find them on my DevianArt page: http://vladepas.deviantart.com/ You might have questions what is the \"Secret Collection\" that I mentioned in the Rewards Section. I will explain: The \"Secret Collection\" - is the collection of 15 watercolor paintings in A5 or A4 format. They feature the style that I have recently come up with and nobody has seen it yet. If you want to be the first one to see it - WELCOME!\u00a0\u00a0 )) That's my story! I am very excited about this project and want it to be completed very soon )) I will greatly appreciate your support. Keep an eye on the updates.  Also, if you have any ideas of what you want to see being painted, let me know ) Thanks!",
  "Baseball. Stories and poems have been written about it;\u00a0 Movies have been made\u00a0of it.\u00a0 And the one thing they all have in common is the baseball field. Even though the dimensions of every baseball field are specifically regulated and exactly the same, featuring a 90 foot infield square, every ball field is decidedly different. These old ballparks are like cathedrals in America. We don't have big old Gothic cathedrals like they do in Europe. But we got baseball parks.\u00a0 ~ Jimmy Buffett I, like so many Americans, have a deep love of baseball. It started when I was a kid and my parents took me to ball games and I have never been able to shake it. When I go to a game, it is like a spiritual experience\u2026.each ball park a unique church. I want to capture the individuality of the 30 major league ball fields on canvas \u2013 a painting of every field. \u201cBaseball, it is said, is only a game. True. And the Grand Canyon is only a hole in Arizona.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 ~ George F. Will  So far I have had the good fortune to see ball games at 16 of the 30 ball parks currently being used by the teams of Major League Baseball. And while I do have a few favorites, I like them all. I am pretty sure other baseball fans feel the same way I do about going to a ball park.\u00a0Baseball fans are passionate about baseball and have very definite ideas about any changes that are made to our fields.

Each painting will be at least 16\" x 20\" and most will be 18\" x 24\".\u00a0 Because of the way I paint I will probably produce some smaller baseball themed paintings based on other images I have of the parks and of some scenes at the park.\u00a0 I will document the entire process with information on each park as well as photos of the painting process in a catalog (book) featuring all the finished paintings.

  "Dear Community, at first of all, sorry for our bad english.  We are three young men from Germany and have a big dream, which we would like to imagine. First, a few words to us: We called Philipp, Axel and Dominic and come from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany. We are 20 and 21 years old. We are all three avid nature lovers and at the same time absolute sports car fans. Our dream is to hold special places and moments of our earth with photosensitive material and to share with the entire world through various social media sites. Specifically, we would like to make videos with a drone from most beautiful places on earth. Moreover, beautiful and high-resolution images of landscapes and said locations. As we mentioned above, we are even extremely large sports cars fans, we have created a blog or a Facebook page and post their daily new pictures of special cars, which we of course have photographed themselves.

  "I have three new paintings that I\u2019m really excited about and I want to create a run of prints of each of them.  The printer I\u2019d like to use is Joseph C Woodard. They\u2019re a family run \nbusiness- which employs local artists and the sons and the daughter of \nthe original founder. They have a large offset printer and they\u2019ll be \nable to make beautiful (18\" x 24\") poster size prints. The printer will use\n 80 pound acid-free paper that contains 10 percent post-consumer \ncontent- the paper is FSC certified and archival quality and the inks \nare vegetable based.  I'll ship your prints rolled in protective acid-free paper and placed in a sturdy cardboard tube. Other rewards include: These cards measure 4.25\" x 5.25\" each. I'll package all nine up together and ship you the bundle of them.  These large postcards measure (5\"x7\"). I'll sign the back, add a stamp, and mail it to you.  Both the greeting cards and postcards are made using offset printing. The paper comes from trees harvested under the Sustainable\n Forest Initiative. It is also FSC (Forestry Stewardship Council) \napproved, processed without environmentally harmful bleach and \nchlorine agents, and made from 100% post-consumer \nrecycled fiber. How do I specify which prints I want? Once the campaign is over and the prints are finished, I'll send you a quick survey via Kickstarter. You'll specify on the survey exactly which print(s) you want.  How do I give you more information for delivery?  On the same survey where you specify your reward- you'll also be able to fill out your shipping address, apartment number etc.  Thank You! Thank you taking the time to watch the video and read through this. And thank you for your support!",
  "I hope you find the prospect of this idea as exciting as I do. I love to draw, but I want you to push me onwards. Every \u00a31 donated gives me 1 more minute to work on my painting.  This is going to be a series, based on its popularity, and I'll be exploring a variety of media (this one being a painting). I'll be producing these pieces of art with your backing. The more you back, the longer I'll work on it. Keep me busy!  If you donate enough, you'll get to have some creative input. At the end, you'll all get a copy of the artwork - whether it's a printable digital copy, a life size print, or you may well be the owner!  The location for this piece will be in the hidden gem that is\u00a0Home Park, in Surrey, near Kingston Upon Thames, UK. Historical deer hunting grounds for Saxon Kings, the descendants of those deer still inhabit the parkland. I'll try and capture a couple in the painting (not in real life, you have to be royalty, and I'll end up in the tower of London or something). Get me started, you control the painting! Get interactive with your backing!",
  "\u00a0\u201cLluvia de Peces\u201d (Rain of Fish) is a phenomenon that is said to have taken place annually for more than a century in Yoro, Honduras.\u00a0It's believed to have started with Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel Subirana, a Spanish Catholic missionary who visited Honduras from 1856-1864. Upon seeing so many poor people, he prayed for three days and three nights asking God for a miracle to provide the people with food. It has been raining fish ever since. The fish are all about six-inches long and are completely blind. Even stranger is that these particular fish are not found in any of the surrounding bodies of water.  Each painting is a visual representation of a particular story with the colors, patterns, clothing, animals, people, and architecture from that region.\u2028\u2028 I begin each piece by researching the oral literature and imagery, and then creating a loose drawing of the key characters. I then draw the images in chalk onto a black canvas, building upon the colors in layers to add depth and vibrancy. The black background creates dramatic shadows that i really love.  Every story has a lesson, moral or societal mores for children and adults alike. Stories help us remember who we are, where we came from, and even what the future could hold if we repeat the same mistakes. Many of my paintings tell the story of poverty, power, greed, and love. The lessons are, I hope, timeless. Television and other cultural forces have diluted storytelling as a tool of communicating, learning, and healing, and I want to make people curious about the stories of Central and South America. I want people to become curious again about story, about culture, and about people. The funds raised during this campaign will go toward purchasing art supplies for all of the pieces, securing a gallery for the event, creating Kickstarter rewards, shipping, packaging, project management, media development, taxes, etc. Here are the reward images that will be offered in various sizes: Thank you so much for checking out the project! I hope that you'll partner with me in creating this exhibition and please spread the word! -Laura Blaker",
  "Hello! My name is Peggy Seymour and I'm from London. I am a self-employed jewellery designer/maker/seller by day and, unknown to most, a portrait artist by night.\u00a0 I hid my secret identity quite effectively for over a decade but have finally decided to take my painting seriously and pursue my life-long dream of making a living out of art. To cut a long story short, I had a traumatic art education which basically crushed my confidence and the desire to paint and draw right out of me. As a result I totally lost my way artistically and didn't pick up a paintbrush again for another ten years. During that time I found other ways of venting my creativity through design work of various kinds but it never truly felt like me and I never really stopped thinking about painting. It has always been my big \"what if?\".\u00a0 So, fast forward to now. I've conquered my fears, picked up my paintbrush and actually applied paint to canvas. Now I'm ready to show the world what I've got. This is where you, dear reader, come in. Juggling my art with trying to bring in a decent wage is super-difficult. As a self-employed person I am entirely responsible for my own income. Right now, when I'm painting, I'm not earning anything and with every painting taking upwards of 30 hours to complete, progress is slow and money is tight.\u00a0 On top of that I'm completely unknown. I have no fans, no following. I've never sold my oil paintings before. I'm a total rookie. Art with My Heart is a project designed to keep me painting, develop my skills as a portrait artist and share what I am learning whilst doing it.\u00a0 I believe the best way to improve my painting is to paint. Every time I create a new piece I learn something new and stretch myself further. I've already learnt so much since I started painting again but I desperately need your help to keep it going.\u00a0 With your support I want to create 12 brand new portraits of humans against black backdrops. I love painting people, especially against black. The light and dark contrast is extra intense and the skin colours really pop. There's a sort of silence about it. With no noisy distractions in the background you can just focus on the awesomeness of the human form and all the emotion it can convey. It's really very beautiful. But that's not all! I want to share my learning process with you. I'll be taking work in progress photographs of everything I do and writing notes on my painting technique discoveries as I go along. All this will be available through a backers only blog and in much more detail in a PDF\u00a0Method Book which will contain in-progress shots, close-ups showing every tiny brush stroke and, if I can work out how to make them, links to time-lapse videos of me actually painting.\u00a0 I'm completely self-taught and the process has been very frustrating and lonely but, if you'll allow me, I'd like to share everything I know with you. Every portrait I create as part of this project will be included in my Catalogue of Work PDF along with the ones I have already created. It will be like an exhibition in electronic form. The process of creating each portrait will also be documented for my backers only blog and PDF Method Book. The portraits from the \u00a3125 reward will be kept by me as a starter portfolio to approach galleries with. Portraits from the \u00a375, \u00a3250, \u00a3475 and \u00a3500 rewards will, of course, be shipped straight to their owners on completion. They will be shipped flat, just so you know. Your support will enable me to pay for: Rewards: I am offering the following super-special rewards in return for your pledge. Have a look to the right for full details and estimated delivery dates. Please note that the Catalogue of Work and the Method book will be emailed to you at the conclusion of the project so I can include all the portraits I create. I'm thinking this will be some time in December 2013. I am so happy to be painting again. It's a scary feeling to finally share my art with the world but it's also joyful and exhilarating.\u00a0 Portraiture is the very best thing I know how to do and the opportunity to create art full-time would be a dream come true for me and would allow me to find where I left my painting career, pick it up and run with it. Remember, that without your support I simply cannot do this. If my project does not reach its \u00a33,500 goal I will get nothing and I will be very, very sad. Do something amazing with your day. Become a patron of the British arts and help me realise my dream at the same time. This one will also be available as a choice for all postcard/print rewards. Thank you so much for taking the time to read about my Kickstarter project. Please help me spread the word by sharing it with others if you can.",
  "Cast Party Nightmare is a short \u00a070s-80s style slasher film, that follows a cast of high school grads. After their final theater performance, they decide to get a few motel rooms to hold their senior cast party before each going their separate ways.\u00a0Little do they know that they're being picked off one by one, while they're distracted by their interpersonal conflicts.\u00a0 \u00a0A screenwriter wrote our script and we're also currently working on some digitally drawn posters inspired by 1970s and 80s Horror Movie posters. Almost everyone working behind the scenes of this film is a college student, or recent high school graduate. \u00a0And we were fortunate enough to have a screenwriter write our script. \u00a0 Shooting for the film is set to take place in June 2021.\u00a0 This is an all-or-nothing fundraiser so if we don't reach our full goal, we will not be able to go through with our project \u2014 so we've got a lot of work to do. The funds of this film will be going towards:",

  "2020. A year where the unpredictable became the predictable. We all have woken up to shocking headlines week to week, sometimes day to day, and there was one news story that really caught my attention and imagination: Several prisons across the United States started releasing \"non-violent\" inmates in an effort to stop potential outbreaks of a virus that was spreading world-wide. According to many sources, some violent inmates slipped through the cracks and were released.\u00a0 I immediately knew I wanted to make a horror film based loosely on this development. \u00a0For decades, I've had my own unique and terrifying approach to a film I love dearly: John Carpenter's \"Halloween.\" All I needed was an original and very grounded angle to get into the story of the night HE came home.\u00a0 And now I have one. Michael Myers killed his older sister when he was six years old on Halloween night. No motive. No emotion. No remorse. Dr. Samuel Loomis was placed to help Michael and try to understand him. However, Dr. Loomis has an ability he is mostly unaware of: He can reach into other's minds and spirit. He can see things about people that they can't see for themselves. What he sees in young Michael's eyes is summed up as pure evil.\u00a0 Through the years as Michael has grown, he hasn't spoken a word. He hasn't caused any fights, has never had behavioral problems and just stares at the wall. Several attempts to move Michael into a psychiatric facility have been unsuccessful because of Dr. Loomis's insistence. This is the \"one success\" that Loomis claims when it comes to Michael.\u00a0 Suddenly, Loomis finds himself in a horrifying situation. The prison that Michael has been locked away in for nearly twenty years is releasing qualifying inmates. This action is to reduce prison population to avoid potential spread of a deadly virus that has been sweeping the globe. Based on his behavioral reputation, Michael Myers has been selected and set free as he is now considered to be a non-violent threat to society. A person with a troubled childhood but a clean seventeen year prison record.\u00a0 Feeling the crushing weight of guilt for preventing Michael from being relocated to a psychiatric facility -where he would have never been released- Dr. Samuel Loomis rushes to Michael's hometown of Haddonfield to warn the citizens that Myers is on his way. Most importantly, to locate a young woman named Laurie Strode and revealed who she really is and why Michael is coming for her. How does this doctor know the carnage Michael is seeking in Haddonfield? Dr. Loomis once saw into the mind and spirit of Michael Myers.\u00a0 A part of him never escaped. \"The Shape of Halloween\" is being filmed in and around Salt Lake City, Utah. This is where the theatrical sequels \"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers\" and \"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\" were filmed in the 1980's. Our production will be filming on the very streets of those two films, bringing a really special connection to our fan film and the actual \"Halloween\" film legacy. There will also be several building and other locations used in our film that appeared in those sequels.\u00a0 The script is terrifying. To say that we pulled out all the stops is to say you only read the first twenty pages. It is so much more than that. Beneath all the mayhem that unspools over the course of our story, we silently dig into the psychology of Samuel Loomis, Laurie Strode and the characters that populate Haddonfield. We reach deeply into the emotions of the characters as they navigate through the thrill ride that is \"The Shape of Halloween.\" \u00a0\u00a0 Production is scheduled to start mid-October for a release early next year. With the funds we raise from this campaign, we will be investing solely in new and updated film equipment so the film can be made and brought to life the best it can be. I'm Brett James Bishop, the writer and director of \"The Shape of Halloween.\" I have been a huge fan of John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" since I was a kid. In my teens, the game was upped by the \"Scream\" films and I have been making small horror films for friends and family since high school. Finally ready and excited to branch off on my own within the world of horror films for the world to experience, I want to kick it off with this personal vision of a story that I've had in my head for decades. A new perspective of the night HE came home.. The story of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode has always fascinated me. Not to mention the story of Dr. Samuel Loomis and Michael Myers. I'm a writer that loves to find and explore the WHY of the story and characters. \"The Shape of Halloween\" is far from a dumb slasher flick. There are story elements that might even surprise you that we present.\u00a0 I am also very excited to bring together a very diverse cast and crew that will represent equality across the board. My work previous to this project was a fan film in 2016 titled, \"Batman: Sins of the Past\" that broke out to global praise. I am also a published writer, producer and actor. I've been studying film for the past decade, primarily the past several years.\u00a0",

  "\u00a0 \u00a0Hello PlayStation 4 fans, thanks for taking a look at our project. Since its release a little over 3 years ago, the PlayStation 4 console has gone on to shift over 40 million units and captured the hearts of all PlayStation fans new, and old.\u00a0 At PlayStation4magazine.com\u00a0we take pride in serving this community with well researched and written news items, reviews and features. As a result our online PS4 magazine has continued to grow from strength to strength. The interest we have seen in the service we provide has led us to believe that our readers would be better served if they could access PS4 mag on their mobile devices. A PlayStation 4 Magazine app would make the content our readers love the most easily available to them at the tap of a button.\u00a0 As the site is currently run by volunteer contributors dedicating their time, we decided to turn to the kickstarter community for help. Please support our project and help us build the best PS4 news app anyone can find on the iOS and Android app stores. If achieved, our goal will be used to purchase the software and technical help required to create the PS4 Mag apps. Our promise to all our prospective backers is that the PS4 Mag app will always be free to download and use for those who wish to do so. The plan is that once the PS4 Mag app build is complete, we will either be partnering with a media company that can distribute the applications on iOS and Android app stores and platforms or using a 3rd party solution to create and manage the apps ourselves. The route that we take will depend on the pledges secured in this campaign. Going forwards, any revenues raised through advertising will be used to hire paid contributors and cover any operational costs. Sony is continually innovating and improving the PS4 gaming experience with hardware such as the upcoming PlayStation VR Virtual Reality system and many more titles lined up for the console. Our goal is to be able to share the journey with you all the way, on the favourite browsing device of your choice!",
  "Bitchtopia Magazine was started as a college project, looking to give feminist voices a platform to educate. We've shared important literature, interviewed inspiring women, published moving art, and offered up a feminist prospective that readers could relate to. You may be asking, why change it?\u00a0 Though Bitchtopia has seen immense success since its inception, it's time for us to graduate. Each of our contributors, editors, and social media mavens have worked extremely hard and have seen so much personal growth. It's only fair that our publication grow with them. Rose Water Magazine will still be feminist. We hope that our art and commentary through the feminist lens will trickle down and nurture and educate our readers. Rose Water will be intersectional, thought-provoking, and creative.\u00a0 With more funding, we will be able to hold workshops for our current and new contributors and also offer them compensation for their published work. \u00a0 Our funding will also be used to compensate our editors and social media team. We also hope to have more live events in our future, and have opportunities take this online community of smart feminist folks offline. Mostly, we're excited to continue our journey in harboring a positive place for people to create art through the feminist critique.\u00a0",

  "Vector Penguin would like to bring a new set of banner pins to life. With your help we would like to fund 4 new banners to add to our current selection of pins. The main goal is to cover most of the production on 4 main colors: yellow, red, green and blue. The individual pieces will be .6 inches tall, and linked together with 6mm rings to create a 4 inch long pin. With a post on each side, these pins make great collar accents or can be used to decorate your bag or jacket. Please find the Rainbow Banner Pin below for reference. Upon request, Book Blue will unlock at $700 with an alternative metal option for those that have read the books and know what I'm hinting at. :) Copper metal will be used in place of Bronze (which is not available). If you would like to help fund the project and snag a copy of either the Rainbow or Patriotic Banner Pin, add $15 for each of these banners. If you would like to grab an additional House/Team banner but do not wish to change your pledge amount, please add $14 to your pledge. Money will be allocated as follows: 60% for production, 30% for packaging and shipping and 10% for Kickstarter fees. $500 does not cover the complete cost of production, but will help a great deal.

  "Three nights ago I sat down and started rehearsing some songs I have been working on with a\u00a01950's Patrician Harmony\u00a0guitar that my father-in-law, Hank Mackie, gave me this past Christmas. \u00a0As each song lead in to the other I felt this connection in how the songs were relating to each other. \u00a0I began scribbling down the order of the songs I was singing and realized I had just sang 9 songs in a row, in an order I had not intended, but I was for certain it was the track list of what is going to be my new record..... I am about to record one of FOUR new albums set to release in 2014. \u00a0This one happens to be the GWM (Graham Wilkinson Music) SOLO/Acoustic record I described in the above paragraph and I would greatly appreciate you chipping in whatever you can to enable me to duplicate and print all the cd's i'll sell at shows and send to radio stations. I want to reiterate that the only use of these funds will go to the cost of actually printing up & packaging (duplicating) the cd. In 2014: #1. \u00a0I have plans to record a full on Country record, with local songsmith and best bud, Drew Smith, as the Producer. \u00a0(more details on that coming this Spring!) #2. \u00a0I also plan to release the album I recorded with my side project, Mother Teresa,\u00a0this past summer called - \u00a0\"God, The Devil, & Other Favorites. #3. \u00a0Finally, I am gearing up to record & produce another GWM album - FULL BAND!

If you have any questions please ask me.\u00a0 Ryan Dave Rhodes Things have been moving forward very fast, so much so that the initial 8 billboards CBS was going to give us for this project wasn't enough and I talked them into letting us artists have more. Which is amazing. More art spread around the city during Mardi Gras.  Right now we have an artist from Amsterdam, Ontario, Australia's \"Top 20 Photographers\", Art In America's \"Who's Who List\" from Florida, two from Brooklyn, Sante Fe, and more. Feedback and conversations over the phone with some of the artists reps have been more than positive and encouraging as I push along making this happen for everyone.  I've attached a letter of recommendation from the executive that I have been working with and developing this arts program with. I have about four billboards left and a dozen artists still interested. ",
  "Hey y'all! I'm starting a new underground, DIY publishing company based out of my van, which is also my home. \u00a0I've run underground presses before, and i LOVE helping artists, writers, graphic novelists, and other create types spread their work. \u00a0I'm interested in stories that go against the grain, stories that illuminate lives most people do not have access to. I'm going to create thematic zines, for example, one theme will be Weird Sex, and another will be What to do With your Labia: an Off Grid Guide to your P*ssy I'm also going to hold open submissions for artists who want their work published. Then I am going to construct the zines, print them, and distribute them. I think the best way to end ignorance and fear based living is through getting to know folks who are different from us, and the most enjoyable way to access other people's lives is through art. \u00a0 I want to publish poetry, prose, fiction, creative non fiction, comics, graphic art, rants, philosophy, memoir, photography, and other art by people whose voices are not dominant. \u00a0I want genderbending, queer, punk, anarchist, homeless, migrant, vagrant, oppressed, dissident, marginalized, countercultural, questioning, angry, celebratory, weird, intersectional feminist, immigrant, native, indigenous, otherised voices to have a platform to share their work. \u00a0I want to create a safe space for these stories to be told, for people to be seen.\u00a0 There are some wonderful things happening on the fringes of (and beyond) heteronormative society.\u00a0 Don't you want to know what those crusty kids with their dogs do for fun on a tuesday night, when they're not hanging out with a cardboard sign outside your liquor store? Aren't you curious about the tattooed waitress who scribbles drawings on a napkin while she's waiting for your onion rings to come out of the oil? There's a lot of bad sh*t going on in the world, and art is the vehicle to understanding. \u00a0Good art is revolutionary. \u00a0Good art compels us, makes us think, or feel, or see from a different set of eyes. \u00a0 I come across a lot of amazing misfits in my world wandering, and i want their voices to be heard.

  "Before I even get started, I want to instantly make this thing tangible to you. So before you read any farther, click here to open up the digital Preview Edition of Freelance Magazine. Pretty cool so far, huh? Now, how about a little of my background that lead me to this project (which can be HUGE with your help!). I am the former Publisher and Editor of three nationally distributed magazines -- Handmade Business, Smart Retailer, and Fired Arts & Crafts. So yes, I know magazine publishing inside and out. No novice here! With the proper funding, I can and WILL make Freelance Magazine explode! And for those of you that think magazine publishing is dead, take a look at the below excerpt from a recent\u00a0Harvard Business Review\u00a0article: It\u2019s true that magazines in the U.S. were more profitable in the pre-digital age because of the fragmented broadcasting market, but they do make money today. Magazine consultant Jay McGill estimates that profit margins in the industry have dropped off from a stellar 20\u201325% to a more earthly, but still healthy, range of 12\u201315%, which is pretty close to the average for the S&P 500. In fact, publishing giant Hearst recently reported record-breaking ad sales for its September issues.\n\nSamir Husni, Director of the Magazine Innovation Center, also points out that in recent years publishers have taken concepts from other media platforms, like All Recipes, HGTV, and Food Network, and turned them into successful print brands. You see, it's all about the niche, content, and marketing when it comes to producing a successful magazine. You build your subscription numbers by finding the right niche, producing high quality content, and strategically marketing it. Then make your real money from attracting advertisers who like your niche and distribution numbers. The great thing about the freelance market, is that it consists of over 53 million people in the United States. So that means, as a magazine that caters to the success of freelancers, our target market is over 53 million people! Yep, 1 in 3 Americans now work as freelancers in some capacity. Our market is HUGE! If we can only get this magazine in the hands of 1% of American freelancers, that will give us 530,000 subscribers! That, my friends, is a HUGE magazine that will pull in tens of thousands of dollars per single full page advertisement within it. Can you see where I'm going here? Even if we reach only .1% of the market, we're working with 53,000 subscribers which is a VERY successful niche magazine. But of course, I want this to be mainstream. And with your help, I can make it happen! Now beyond all of this, I have also launched a website called limelance.com\u00a0which is a marketplace for freelancers and employers to connect on available freelance jobs. Better check that out too! My business plan is to constantly cross-promote the magazine with the online marketplace, and watch them both explode in numbers. You may have noticed the full page ad for LimeLance in the magazine's Digital Preview you clicked on earlier. As the little boy in Sleepless in Seattle said, they are MFEO (made for each other!). So here's where you come in. To properly launch this thing to the freelance world, I need... well... funding. Producing, marketing, printing, and distributing a high-scale magazine isn't cheap. But I'm going to make is ridiculously easy for you. For contributing to this project, I will instantly make you a subscriber to the magazine. So basically, you're subscribing and funding the project all at the same time. For $25, you get 12 monthly issues. For $50, you get 36 monthly issues. For $100, you get monthly issues forever.\u00a0 My plan is to get the first issue out the door in January 2016. With your funding, I can make it happen! Maybe you're not even a freelancer. But guess what? After reading the magazine every month, you might just want to dive into the freelance world. You'll definitely learn how! So let's get this thing rocking. In a year or two you'll be able to brag that you were one of the founding partners of Freelance Magazine. :)\u00a0 Thank you so much for your time and consideration.",

We have also thought of a way to help provide tips, stories, and advice about love, sex, and relationships from experts as well as people with personal experience every month on your smartphone and tablet...for free!  This is Love 360: The Magazine!  Love 360: The Magazine will focus on three topics, and doing those very well.  Every month, we will publish an interactive publication for your smartphone and tablet about love, sex, and relationships.  The difference from Love 360: The Magazine and other publications is we will publish stories, tips, and advice from everyday people like ourselves as well as experts in the study of love, sex, and relationships.  How?  We will provide a crowdsourcing platform at Love360Mag.com in which you can ask and answer ANY question about love, sex, and relationships.  We will also provide a section in which you can submit your relationship stories that we may publish in Love 360: The Magazine (with your permission, of course.)  If you have something you want to get off your chest, you share it in True Confessions  that we may also publish (again, only with your permission.)  Including our interactive polls, topics from the internet, advice from experts, and so much more, our mission is to understand relationships and to answer the question \"What Is Love?\"  Love 360: The Magazine is run by two experienced individuals in both digital publishing and life who are dedicated on the subject of relationships.  H.D. Campbell is an accomplished editor and publisher whose credits include digital publications such as We, The Otaku: The Magazine and Untitled Track Magazine.  H.D. is one of the co-founders of Beryllium Media.  Reginald Belfort is top-tier programmer who holds both a BA in Visual Arts and a BS in Computer Science from the University of South Florida. With his perfect combination of art and technology, Reginald maintains the technical aspects of Love 360. He is also one of the co-founders of Beryllium Media.  And we cannot forget about you.  You are the primary factor of the Love 360 community that will help build the foundation of understanding relationships through your experiences and stories.  We need your help.  Our online crowdsourcing platform, Love360Mag.com only has a few questions asked and answered.  If you have a question to ask about relationships, love, and sex, as well as some advice to offer from your own experiences, visit Love360Mag.com to help the cause.   Also, sign up and join the community so you can follow your asked questions or your answers from others in the Love 360 community.    As for Love 360: The Magazine, we understand that this is going to be an uphill battle tackling the concept of love, sex, and relationships as well as publishing an interactive magazine which will include audio, video, html, and other mechanics that are still new to the publishing industry.  To help us with his cause, you can pledge anything -- from the cost of a music CD all the way up to a $2,500 sponsorship.  And for just $25, you can play a more integral part by joining our editorial board. We\u2019ll manage the board through Love360Mag.com in which you help select stories and articles that will appear in Love 360: The Magazine. Publishing has rarely been put in the hands of the readers in this manner, so you\u2019ll be joining an experiment that may revolutionize the industry as well as help others with love, sex, and relationships.   We\u2019d love it if you pledged. We\u2019d love it if you told your friends. We\u2019d love if it you join Love360mag.com and help us find the answer to the question \"What Is Love\".  Because we believe helping relationships is a just cause \u2014 and we hope you do too.   More questions? Leave a comment here or email us at Love360@berylliummedia.com.   For updates on the project, you can find us on Twitter @love360magazine or connect via our Facebook page. ",

  "I believe that I present flowers seeds and a collage of found objects in a way that is new and exciting and with stunning results! \u00a0My work looks like Renaissance art - it doesn't really look like plants at all it is mystical- I use borrowed equipment to photograph flowers seeds and plants to create stunning dark moody images the camera I currently borrow is only 5megapixels which means I am very limited to the size I can enlarge my work to - I believe these images need to be large scale wall art and wallpapers but to create this I need to photograph with a high megapixel camera and also a decent computer and Photoshop to edit my own work. I \u00a0studied horticulture last year and have a passion for studying plants up close especially Western Australian natives. \u00a0Through my photography I hope to enter competitions both here and internationally to show the world how amazing plants and flowers can be. The camera that I would buy if I could raise the money is the new Canon 5D series which has the largest megapixels and a computer and Photoshop to edit my work on I eventually would like to design wallpapers/cushions/scarves etc really I can do it all with the right equipment ! I have an 80year old shed that would love to restore so I can turn it into my studio - I grow the plants I photograph in my large native garden my 5 yr plan is to open my studio and the garden to the public so they can enjoy my art and the garden \"do what you love - and you'll never work a day in your life\" I absolutely love my art and my plants - I am passionate about Western Australian natives which are the best in the world ! And want to share my art and my garden - I just don't have any money to bring this dream to a reality - with the help of kickstarter I hope that I can progress with my vision. thank you\u00a0",
  "Multiple/Universal Curated by Christian Berman and Hans Baumann A group show in NYC THIS WON'T HAPPEN WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT! Featuring works by Lani Asuncion, Hans Baumann,\u00a0Christian Berman,\u00a0Jon Blank,\u00a0Ted Gahl,\u00a0Field Kallop,\u00a0Karl Larocca,\u00a0Kristen Schiele Please help us fund this group show in NYC. \u00a0 We need funds in order to cover the basic rent and staffing costs of an exhibition space in a well attended manhattan or brooklyn venue, as well as the food and drinks for the show. \u00a0This show will provide the beginning for possible future collaboration with the gallery, as well as an amazing opportunity for these emerging and productive artists to showcase their work.\u00a0 For you RISD folks, this is a great way to support several alumni. \u00a0 \u00a0 Thank you to everyone who has shown interest!!! The following is an abbreviated version of the prospectus for the exhibition: Mulitple/Universal This show deals with the role of art and abstraction as a universal engine for self-differentiation and also universal communication in the age of the internet. The work by this group of artists navigates the visual landscape by using material experimentation, simple geometries, color play, etc. in a way that vividly illuminates individual preference and experience.  Under another light, these works exhibit the connectedness of a universally vibrating network.  The underpinnings of this curatorial effort lie in the basic study of quantum physics, and especially in the idea that we live in a time where humanity is approaching a confluence between a tangible, electronic universal consciousness (the internet), and a still vague but growing understanding of the way that energy and consciousness might be drawn from a universal field. How are the constant easy access to information and the shifts away from a mechanical, linear view of the universe affecting abstraction?  From what I've seen, abstraction in painting has been moving towards a practice that combines both the modernist desire to define the universal and the expressionist urge to explore what moves us and defines us as individuals; contemporary painting is increasingly an unabashed celebration of color and chemistry which uses universal language to simultaneously engage with and escape the saturation of technological communication.\u00a0There is a clear sense that none of the works in this show could have been made at another point in history.  The works are not only constructed and influenced by digital technologies; they are created with the knowledge of instantaneous presence in the timeline of the universally accessible digital world.",
  "Im creating this kickstarter to fund my next short film. We plan to film up at bear lake in Rocky Mountain National Park. We are asking for $825 to be able to provide winter gear to our crew and actors. Things like hand warmers, and winter blankets. We also need money for a film permit, and gear that we can take into the freezing weather. \u00a0Our film will be shot with professional grade gear. Such as a Black Magic Cinema Camera, and our lovely Rode mics. As a filmmaker this is going to be one of the hardest films to pull off. Filming in the winter within a forest is a filmmaker dream for me. So Im super excited for the snow. From the moment I first call action.

  "\"Portraits of Promise\" - One Hundred Portraits of American Teenagers,\u00a0\u00a0is a series of oil portraits of teenagers painted from life. \u00a0The models each posed for 4 hours. \u00a0The paintings are done in a method known as \u201cAlla Prima\u201d, which is a direct, expressive painting style, and literally means \u201cat once\u201d in Italian.  Alla prima paintings are completed in a single session, during which the artist tries to capture the feeling and  psychology of the subject as well as an accurate likeness in a limited period of time. In these paintings, each completed \"wet-on-wet\" in a single session; the methods used are those I learned studying under Nelson Shanks at Studio Incamminati, the school he founded in Philadelphia. \u00a0This series had its genesis in my desire to to paint portraits from life, and to explore different ways to paint expressively. \u00a0I also to wanted do something different, something less formal than traditional portraiture, and to work with subjects who might not otherwise have their portraits painted. At a certain point, it became apparent that this project had become \u00a0a sort of \"historical document\" by which the viewer could experience today's teenagers, not only through how these young people look, but also through their thoughts, feelings, aspirations and dreams, which are incorporated into the project. \u00a0Each portrait is accompanied by quotes from a questionnaire the teenagers were asked to complete, in which they share their concerns and hopes for the future, as well as practical \u00a0advice to other teenagers. \u00a0The paintings, accompanied by the models' statements, will be exhbited under the title \"Portraits of Promise:\u00a0One Hundred Alla Prima Portraits of American Teenagers\". \u00a0I also plan to publish a book about my experience of this project, \u00a0which will include photographs of the paintings and the model's statements about life, as well as my own thoughts about painting this series. I began the paintings in September, 2010, a week after my youngest child left for college, and completed \u00a0118 paintings by June, 2012. Painting this series helped me to process my feelings about my shifting role as parent, mother and wife, entering the next phase of my life without my children at home. Embracing the young people who posed in this series was a wonderful way to ease though this transition. \u00a0They lifted my spirits, and sustained me through over 100 paintings. \u00a0The funds raised here will be used to purchase \u00a0frames in which the paintings will be exhibited. \u00a0Should additional funds be raised, that money will be used to underwrite the costs of publishing the book of this project. This series of portraits has been a true labor of love. \u00a0You can follow this project on my blog at www.natalieitaliano.blogspot.com. \"Portraits of Promise:\u00a0One Hundred Alla Prima Portraits of American Teenagers\", will be exhibited as part of a group show at Gloucester County College in Sewell, NJ., opening September 9, 2-4 pm, 2012. \u00a0The exhibition \u00a0will continue until October 17, and will be the first in a series of planned exhibitions of \"Portraits of Promise\".\u00a0",

  "\u00a0My name is Jessica Newton and I'm the New Zealand artist behind the brand Dust & Dandelions. This is my first ever Kickstarter campaign! I have wanted to do this for a really long time and it would be great if you could support this project. I recently had a single one of these pins made for my friend (see picture below) and it was so cool I thought everyone needed one of these in their life! \u00a0I have been wanting to get some badges made for a while and these eco-friendly wooden pins seemed like the perfect fit. They are sustainably resourced, use far less energy to manufacture than traditional enamel pins, and produce more detail in the printed design. There are 5 different designs available. If\u00a0you are one of those people who struggles to decide, don\u2019t worry. You can pledge now and choose a design later. I will be sending out a survey where you can pick which ones you want. During this campaign, I will be offering multiple pins at a cheaper price. You can also purchase an A5 print of the pin of your choice this will be limited to during this Kickstarter only. Example of a Previous Wooden Pin Design\u00a0 Timeline Shipping NZ Backers - Your pins will be sent out Standard Post around 3 days. Pledges over 5 pins will be sent out courier post. Backers outside of New Zealand - Your pins will be sent out Standard International Post. Being based in New Zealand the post can be a little bit dear the good thing is though there is flat rate so ordering 1 or 5 pins doesn't affect the postage cost. I always get proof of postage for everything I send out to minimise any issues :)",

  "Our product is unique in that we use no preservatives, fillers, gums or binding agents. No need to google our ingredient list. This simple fact sets our product above all other plant-based milks on the market. There is NO CARRAGEENAN in MALK! Carrageenan is used as a thickening or emulsifying agent in most almond milks currently available on the market. Carrageenan has no nutritional value and can harm your digestive system and is banned from food products in many countries. It's our mission to provide the cleanest, most nutritious and yet delicious milk alternative to everyone! We have come to a point where we need to ramp up our production in order\n to meet the demand for our products. We now have an opportunity to \nprovide MALK to multiple states starting in May and soon, globally.  This is where you guys come in! With your help, MALK can\n add new machines to the existing production line increasing our ability to fill \norders. MALK is the cleanest product available on shelves and we want\n everyone to have the opportunity to purchase it. We want MALK to be in a grocer near you by the end of 2016, no matter where you live! How we will use the money: One way that we can reduce the price for our customers is by taking the most expensive part of our process in-house.  We don't use any heat during our process. We use HPP to extend the shelf life of MALK. HPP stands \nfor High Pressure Processing. This ensures that you, the consumer, receive all of the vitamins and\n nutrients that mother nature intended. This is the most costly part of our production process, from distribution to the facility to paying for the processing, but it is necessary for us to provide you with a TRULY CLEAN plant-based beverage. As a stretch goal, any extra funding will go towards the goal of purchasing this very expensive yet highly important piece of equipment to keep the entire process in-house.  \u00a0REWARDS!! Enjoy a White Russian made with MALK! We call it a Christopher MALKen.",
  "Hi! We are Christine and Alexandria. Our dream is to open a bakery cafe specializing in Vegan, Paleo, and gluten free desserts where someone can come to a cozy, quaint environment and enjoy a homemade vegan brownie and\na cup of coffee, or a Paleo cupcake and a fresh juice. Our cafe will specialize in homemade specialty desserts that you wouldn't normally find in the average cafe, while still offering traditional desserts. All the baking will be done in the cafe and in small batches.\u00a0 More and more people are going out to socialize only to discover that it's really difficult to find somewhere to get specialty desserts like Vegan, Paleo, and gluten free.  The non-traditional\u00a0community, specifically Vegan, is one of the fastest growing communities in the food industry and the baking industry is not keeping up. Our cafe will help fill that gap. What will our caf\u00e9 look like?\n \u00a0We really like the idea of using re-purposed materials like wood pallets for walls, shelves and displays and Mason jar for drinking or filled with twinkling lights to create a magical mood. \n Imagine walking into a caf\u00e9 where people know your name and favorite dessert. Imagine sitting near a sunny window enjoying your favorite slice of pie and a cup of coffee. Imagine sitting at a cozy table sharing a warm vegan brownie with a loved one. Imagine the smell of warm chocolate, cinnamon, and apples filling the air as you surf the web or socialize with your best friends. \nImagine ordering a Paleo cupcake and being told it\u2019s already been paid for by our \u201cPay it Forward\u201d wall. A wall where a customer can pay for an item in advanced then pin a note on the wall that sets the rules for the recipient. Like \u201cthe next person wearing a flower in their hair gets a vegan chocolate chip cookie.\u201d At the Sweet Obsessions Caf\u00e9 you can experience all of this and much more.\n Whats the buzz? \"Your vegan desserts are the best in the Hudson Valley and even the city. Keep up the good work\" - Winston \"Since eating Paleo I didn't think I could have a dessert again. Your cupcakes are amazing. Thank You\" - Dave \"I can't believe these chocolate chip cookies are vegan and gluten free and the best part is they aren't rock hard\"- Sharon \"My daughter is gluten free and has never had a cream puff, now she can have a cream puff. Thank You\" -Barbara We've done our research, We've done our baking and now it's time to do this bakery cafe.This Kickstarter will allow us to equip and open a specialty bakery cafe in the best possible location to make for a successful business. We'll see you in the cafe!",
  "We are shooting to be the standard in the plastic food service\nindustry which has not made many strides to improve healthy alternatives to the\ncurrent offerings.\u00a0 That means that if\nyou are Vegan, Vegetarian, Kosher, Muslim or just plain heath conscious,\nchances are the food storage containers, utensils , wraps and so much more\ncould be causing you harm. Premier Group Intl. is dedicated to serving this\ncause by offering our 100% guaranteed harmful chemical free containers. Our\nintention is to market to the organic markets, i.e. Whole Foods, Sprouts,\nWegmans etc.\u00a0 While concurrently selling\nour product on our websites and through distributors to the general public and\ncertain religious groups. Our plan is two-fold: Gain the interest of food outlets that\nsell healthy and religious food products like those mentioned about while\nadding other prospects as well. Eventually when we can meet the needs of high\nend stores like Wal-Mart, Costco and BJ\u2019s with the kinds of quantities they\nrequire we will present the product.  PGI has invested over I million dollars to this cause and\nnow needs the funds to produce our food storage containers in larger\nquantities. We have produced sample sets in our manufacturing plant in\nConnecticut and are simply awaiting more funding to get production in high\ngear.\u00a0 We have our molds hung and are 100%\nready to hit the go button-all we need is funding! We also have a marketing plan to go into various newspapers\nand magazines, websites and Social media outlets to get the word out about the\ndangers of ingesting animal byproducts, BPA and GMO\u2019s. We have noted the rise\nin all kinds of diseases in the past 50 years to epidemic proportions and while\nwe have no scientific evidence as to the harm of these harmful chemicals, we\nfeel\u00a0 \u201cwhy take a chance\u201d!  Our challenge it to go to market quickly even though at this\ntime we have \u201cno competition\u201d and see none on the horizon. Our backup plan is\nto have the company continue operating even when competition sees the value in\nour products.\u00a0 There will be two other divisions\nof PGI: 1) ERC Corporation which will test other companies products to ensure\nthey are 100% free of harmful chemical to one part in billions and 2) offer \u00a0our brand of polymer called Pur-O-lyn to\ncompanies that want to produce 100% chemical free plastic. Alternatively, we plan to expand our offering to the\nhealthcare industry which will include items like blood bags, inspection\ndevices, medicine containers and anything made of plastic that should not come\nin contact with the human or animal body.",

  "Update: I'm funded! I will hold true to my promise to video the painting progress from blank canvas to finished book cover. I'll also update with photos of myself shopping for painting supplies, putting the book together, etc. Thank you for joining me on this adventure. I plan to have fun with the whole experience and I hope you will too!  The above painting is what I'm wrapping up now (not yet finished, but closer than it was when making the project video), for the \"Touched by War\" exhibit. It is not related to the COVERT COFFEE project, but is a painting sample for you to see my art. I will begin the COVERT COFFEE project after I receive my kickstarter funds and purchase the canvas, new paints, and new brushes (I am so destructive with brushes and have to buy them frequently!). As described in my project video, the subject of the COVERT COFFEE project is a coffee cup, blood, and a woman's head of hair (not the silly image of the \"horror coffee\" in the book trailer, that's just for comedy!). \"Hilarious & Revolting\" Book Trailer for COVERT COFFEE is in the Updates section (please click Updates tab and scroll down) - reminder, this is not how the painting will look, see above. COVERT COFFEE sampler is also in the Updates section. Read the first two chapters & get HOOKED! COVERT COFFEE is book #5 of the SWmysteries. More information: I expect this painting to be completed in July. So why did I put the estimated delivery date as \"September\" for all of the backer rewards? September is the public release date for COVERT COFFEE and the guarantee (as close as possible to a guarantee anyway) of having books in hand. However, I am likely to get my hands on pre-release copies before the public launch. I will keep all backers informed. Items like prints of the painting could be sent out as early as July because those rewards involve the painting itself and don't rely on the book being formatted for print and e-book. If I\u00a0exceed funding\u00a0I can use the funds to order more books, and/or hire a publicist to help me get my work out there (something I really wish I could do!). I will update frequently on the project to let everyone know what's going on. More rewards may be added if funding takes off in a delightfully surprising way.",
  "Hello Kickstarter Community!! My name is Nick Boettcher and I am from Peoria, IL. \u00a0I met the lovely Paige DeChausse in March of 2011 while she was putting together her blues-based rock band. \u00a0 Since then, our lives have been a quilt, woven together with the threads of songs. \u00a0With this collaboration, we do our best to warm those around us. \u00a0Some songs are playful, some can be painful. \u00a0Some are uplifting, and some bring us down, so that we may keep others company when they are in the depths of their hard times. In September of 2013 we moved from Chicago to Austin to be near my ailing father. \u00a0That process has inspired songs and driven us to write and record our first original EP. \u00a0Nick Boettcher and Paige DeChausse (lovingly known as Nick & Paige) We are working on our\u00a0Self-Produced\u00a0EP and are setting up our\u00a0Winter Tour from Austin, TX to Chicago, IL!!! We miss our friends, fans, and family in the Midwest, so we created this venture to make it possible for us to Finish the EP\u00a0come back and share our music and lives with all of you! We need YOU as backers to cover the production costs of the EP and Tour support! The funding will help support the production cost of the EP, travel expenses including fuel, food, and lodging, and performance production costs.  This is a big undertaking to travel across the country the second time in 4 months to reconnect with the community that supported us in our adventures to Texas.

  "*Visit my YouTube Channel\u00a0and SoundCloud page to hear songs! Hey Friends! Welcome to my Kickstarter page. I'm so excited to have the opportunity to join forces with you to make my very first EP. Let me just tell you a little bit about what led me here and how I plan on doing this with your help. I've been performing since before I could remember (I literally have no recollection of my first performance at age 2.5). I grew up in South Dakota playing anywhere they would have me, whether it was opening for grandstand acts with my guitar or singing at nursing homes for $20 and a Thanksgiving turkey. \u00a0Anyhow, I moved to Nashville when I was 19, which is when I started writing with the big kids and learning what it really meant to be an artist. \u00a0 Shortly after I moved, I found a great writing partner with whom I had an amazing creative connection. His name is Leland Grant, and we formed a duo called \"THE LiNE.\" We were fueled by a wonderful songwriter/friend/mentor who is still responsible for many of my songwriting choices today. For the next two years, I put every ounce of my creativity into writing songs for our project. Leland and I had the privilege of being on Team Xtina on season 2 of The Voice. It was full of challenges, and also some of the greatest moments of my life. No matter who you are, it's incredibly inspiring to have Christina Aguilera show you how to sing something while she's standing three feet from you.\u00a0 Though our time on The Voice didn't end how I wanted it to, it did lead me to a simple conclusion - I needed to go back to being Hailey Steele.\u00a0I started writing for myself again (it sorta felt like I was starting from scratch) and signed a publishing deal with BMG Chrysalis Nashville, and I've been writing like crazy ever since. I've always stood by the motto \"may the best song win,\" and have made my best effort to bring that to the table with my music.\u00a0So that's my story, and now here we are.\u00a0 The reason I'm doing a Kickstarter is because I want this project to be funded independently so that I own the master recordings...no label, no publishing company or anybody else owning anything. It's just me and the people who like my music deciding what to do with it.\u00a0 Every little bit helps. I'm asking for $10,000 as a goal, but every dollar I receive will count towards what it takes to make a quality 5-6 song EP. I am really focused on making these recordings sound great, and that's never cheap. Here's where your money will go: studio time, musicians, producer, mixing/mastering, marketing/promotion, printing/pressing of physical copies, video, design and photography associated with the EPK. What's in it for you: I've created a list of incentives that will make this fun for backers on every budget level. Knowing me and knowing my music are interchangeable, so I want to give you the full experience and keep you as involved as possible.\u00a0 I'm so excited to be able to share my music with you. Please spread the word about this project to your family, friends, co-workers, etc. I can't wait to see what we can do. THANK YOU! -Hailey",
  "Hey y'all,  \u00a0This is Dallas, and we really want you to be a part of, COME ON, our first studio recording! You heard \"Trouble\" and the song\u00a0\"Come on\", if you watched the video. These tunes are years in the making, and I actually wrote many of them while playing guitar/bass in Adam Hood's band. I have 10 additional\u00a0songs that we would like to record.  \u00a0We are planning on\u00a0making a record with Les Nuby (Vulture Whale) @ his studio\u00a0in Homewood, Alabama,\u00a0and we\u00a0are actively seeking the means to make this happen. Our expense is broken down into seven major areas: studio recording costs,\u00a0mastering, duplication, artwork, reward fulfillment, shipping, and\u00a0paying musicians (for horns, pedal steel, etc..).\u00a0 Please consider making this record with us, and thanks for checking us out! \u00a0",
  "In Amazonian Equador, deep in the rainforest on the banks of the rivers, live indigenous Huaorani people.  This authentic culture exists largely unchanged from their ancestral roots \u2013 dependent on the land and forest for survival.  I will be traveling by canoe deep into their jungle (via the Shiripuno and Cononaco Rivers) to meet, photograph and document three sustainable and cooperative tribes - the Noneno, Cononaco Chico and Bohanamo Huaorani. \u00a0I hope to not only create a photographic archive of their existence, but seek to understand the Western behaviors that threaten it. \u00a0 I am an award-winning photojournalist by trade.  My passion and talent is in expressing the human condition.  My goal is to capture the spirit of the Huaorani - to photograph their warriors, their children and everyday lives because the opportunity to experience them is sadly fleeting. \u00a0Acres\u00a0of sacred forest are lost every day to mining, oil drilling and deforestation.  Illegal poaching threatens the balance of the ecosystem.  Encroachment creeps closer and closer to protected borders with each setting sun. \u00a0They are, so to speak, an endangered species.\u00a0 I intend to raise awareness of these issues by publishing an illustrated book.\u00a0 I have personally financed the airfare, room and board in Quito. \u00a0I have also paid for all rural transportation including bus and primitive airplane transfers. \u00a0Additionally, I funded all expedition expenses, including necessary gear and a tribal guide, out-of-pocket. \u00a0Funds raised through Kickstarter will be used to purchase an upgraded and more rugged/weather-sealed Canon 1Dx and 24-70mm lens for the expedition.  When my goal is met, I will donate my Canon 5DMKII and 24-105mm lens to the local high school photography class.\u00a0",

  "I am wanting to start a Picture Blog and possible Video Blog of the rides and journeys i take around Nottinghamshire whilst out riding locally around where i live.Nottinghamshire is beautiful place, home of Robin Hood, The Lace industry, The oldest know pub in the world, the major oak, Lord Byron, Ada Lovelace, Nottingham Forest, a massive network of caves, acres and acres of woodlands and open countryside, various outdoor parks and a massive amount of wildlife and colourful plants.When out cycling i see many varied and wonderful things but due to budget restrictions i can only take a certain quality of picture, therefore i would like to propose opening a website of my own (this will come out my own pocket) and take pictures and videos of the many things i see around during my days out.I am classed as humourous so will try to add entertainment to the videos where possible without ruining the main essence of the video, the pictures will be all serious, quality pictures of everything Nottingham.These pics will also be uploaded to Faceboook, Twitter and Instagram under accounts i already use (@InfectedFred), i already get many comments about my eye for taking a good picture in a couple of nature groups and by friends but have also been told the quality of my image is my letdown.This is due to using my phone for the pictures, therefore i ask for pledges to help me buy a good camera (Canon DLSR or something alike) and a GoPro for filming the footage from my handlebars whilst out riding.I will be Geo-tagging all photos and adding map views of where the rides have taken place and where video footage was taken.",

  "Cisco is a local promoter in the underground club scene, but the party is about to end. As EDM music consumes the dance crowd at an illegal show, rave-girl Catrina desires the euphoric high of \"Molly\" that Cisco previously introduced to her. While dancing on stage, Catrina collapses from an overdose. Her older sister, Sophia, holds her in her arms, but Catrina succumbs to the dark veil of death, leaving Sophia and her friends to mourn a life cut tragically short.   Almost a year passes and Sophia honors Catrina's life on Dia De Los Muertos (The Day Of The Dead), hoping to connect with her spirit and find some closure. As tradition dictates on this sacred day, Sophia decides to build an ofrenda (a ritual altar) with the guidance of Victor, an elderly Brujo. He warns Sophia that under no circumstances can she allow the ofrenda to remain unfinished or the consequences for Catrina's soul could be dire.   Sophia invites Catrina's friends, including Cisco, to take part in building the ofrenda. As usual, Cisco turns it into a party. As everyone drinks and parties, an evil presence, the Lady of Dead, intervenes, allowing unholy entities to escape Purgatory so they can consume the souls of the living. Cisco is the first to be possessed and he dutifully leads Sophia and their friends into the spiritual abyss embodied in a dilapidated hospital rumored to be haunted. In order to escape their horrific imprisonment in the hospital, the tortured souls of Darkness crossover the threshold of the living and hunt down Catrina and her friends one by one.  With the doorway opened to the other side, Sophia learns that her sister was not who she thought she was\u2026 but can she save herself and her friends before they are possessed and their souls lost to dark dominion of the Lady of the Dead?  We want to bring a new horror character known as                                             \"The Lady Of The Dead -Catrina\" ! She is classy and she is deadly and she has been around for a very long time, you're just not paying attention! Well now you will! Classic scares and suspense is what we need to bring and we will with your help.  We want to entertain while creating jobs for people at the same time. We are a family of producers, friends and artists. This not just a one shot idea. If we succeed with this project, it will enable us to continue making the other great films in our creative collective. And that helps continue to empower independent film and create even more jobs. Big corporate studios are not the only way.  Alternatively, small independent micro-budget films do not mean they are cheesy or bad. Some of the most successful and iconic horror films came from the independent film community. If we got rid of the movies no one wanted to make, it would leave a giant hole in the horror genre landscape. Movies like \"Blair Witch Project\" and \"Paranormal Activity\" completely changed the game. But they would not have happened if left to the studios to decide.   We are not backed by a studio. We are not backed by a bank, or investment consortium. We are just a great group of film-making friends who want to scare the living crap out of you.  And through this amazing crowd funding resource, we have the incredible opportunity to directly connect with you -- the fans who love scary movies; the actual people who buy tickets at the box office; the ones that spread the word of mouth; and the ones that keep the genre alive in an increasingly formulaic, comic book-driven world. Did we mention SCARING THE CRAP OUT OF YOU!? Just making sure. All too often the box office pressures and insane costs of the Big Movie Industry service the corporate bottom line. Maybe that's why horror movies nowadays have abandoned their grass roots and their prime directive? Relying excessively on CGI (Computer-Generated Imaging aka digital special effects) to create screams of terror. We don't. We keep it real. A touch is OK, if needed, but that's only if needed. We call it \"practical scare authenticity\" - meaning we only want to use real world strategies to scare you. And we have Proof of Concept. Think about this, the Godfathers of horror movies, the iconic classics like George Romero's \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"The Exorcist\" all created fear with this incredibly effective practical approach. You do not need a computer to create great characters, good acting and a skin-crawling, cover your eyes environment. We are all about authentic, real fear.   Do we not love Halloween? Practical scare.  Do we not love Halloween Haunts and Mazes? All Practical scares Who doesn't love sneaking up and scaring a friend? Practical scare. My name is Alfonso Flores Jr.  I am a devoted single dad and an independent film maker. I am grateful for the unique opportunities in the movie world that I have been given. And I do not believe in wasting them. I did not go to a coveted film school. I do not have movie industry parents or a trust fund. I'm a regular, blue collar, hard working guy who learned movies by LOVING movies. Given my background, movies are, in so many ways, my salvation. I've lost count of how many movies I have watched. And my favorites have always been horror films. I will never forget watching             THE EXORCIST and THE HOWLING. Scared me witless! Couldn't sleep alone for a week. And, I loved it. Years later, imagine how incredible I felt getting to be an extra in a real Hollywood movie! Sounds corny but it's the honest to God truth. So even while supporting my family working 70 hours a week, I found a way to carve out a small slice of time to stay involved in movies -- wearing any hat I was asked to because no matter how insignificant the job, I believe the best way to learn is hands on. That's me. Roll up my sleeves. Sweat of my brow. Nothing wrong with it, but I'm just not a text book kinda guy. I just do it. And it took me a long time to work my way up. And finally, a few years ago, I was rewarded with the opportunity to be a Producer on an indie film entitled \"KILL KAPONE\" (currently out on DVD,out on REDBOX in the fall and VOD outlets!). So I've being doing my movie thing and along the way in life, as always, you meet some really cool people. You know, the kind of people who just \"get\" what you're into creatively and you become friends outside of working on set. And sooner or later, someone says \"We should\u2026\" and it all begins. That's pretty much how I met the people in our movie. Our collective team consists of veterans in film both in front and behind the lens spanning over 35 years, makeup professionals, effects makeup artists & writers all with the same mindset to bring Los Muertos.  We've got a bunch of years experience doing this but we're far from household names or \"connected Hollywood insiders\".  Now it is time for us to use our experience, our knowledge and our passion to make a kick-ass horror film.  Your support will not only make the film come to life, you also will have the unique opportunity of being part of the team itself. As a supporter, you will have a front row seat to the making of a real, \"old school\" horror film and the satisfaction of knowing you personally helped us make \"Los Muertos\" COME TO LIFE.  We have been extremely fortunate to cast the talented actor NOEL G. His career spans 20 years and has appeared in film and TV shows such as the mega-franchise hit FURIOUS 7, the incomparable THE WALKING DEAD, and the critically acclaimed TRAINING DAY and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.  We are also fortunate to have the talented Dyana Ortelli who's career spans as early as 1970 in television and film with such titles as La Bamba, American Me, NYPD Blue, CSI, & Curb Your Enthusiasm to name a few. Dyana's improvisational skill and timing were essential for her key role in Los Muertos.  Alongside Noel and Dyana, we have a great cast of talented, really enjoyable and skilled actors with tons of credits as well as some newcomers bringing raw talent!   All of them were handpicked to create an ensemble with the perfect chemistry and attitude to bring our vision to life.  Los Muertos is an American independent horror film laced with the legend, myths and folklore of Dia De Los Muertos and The Lady Of The Dead. All the traditional elements are uniquely integrated into a compelling modern story that we are confident will scare crap out of you.    Location: Our film began shooting in November of 2013 at the Linda Vista Hospital, formerly known as the Santa Fe Railroad Hospital. It was erected in 1904 and rebuilt in 1924 after a massive fire. Due to its high mortality rate throughout the years, Linda Vista was shut down in 1991. It was considered one of the most haunted locations in Los Angeles until it was completely remodeled by a real estate developer shortly after we finishing filming the hospital sequences. It now Senior Housing. We're very proud we were able to fund shooting at this location before this insanely terrifying location was lost for all time. Seriously, shootinghere was beyond creepy. We consider it a badge of honor we can count ourselves as one of the very last films ever filmed at this historic site. ADDITIONAL FILMING LOCATIONS: (SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA) throughout L.A., Orange County, Whittier and San Fernando Valley.  Los Muertos is a horror film hybridizing the real world locations of Oren Peli's films, the classic elements of the Gothic ghost story and the traditional motifs and characters of Dia de Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) and the legend of The Lady of the Dead. These ancient celebrations of life and death were observed during the time of the Aztecs, with rituals and offerings to connect our world with that of the dead. We delved deeply into the rich history of this celebrated holiday and added our own backstory to explain its \"true\" origins. We love that Dia de Los Muertos provides the inspiration for our title and we intend to fully exploit its connection to the far more familiar scary holiday called All Hallows Eve (Halloween). At the center of the Day of the Dead traditions is the Aztec goddess Mictecacihuatal, aka the Lady of the Dead. She is the template for the demon who hunts down our heroes. All these rich cultural and traditional elements provided an extremely solid foundation to build a unique contemporary story, a different story, a truly skin crawling story that makes you think and makes you scream! Catrina (above) played by newcomer Kari Shaw shows how ones life is more than meets the eye. One of the great hallways of Linda Vista Hospital that gave us the perfect filming location. No one will hear you scream! The authentic feel and look was given to us at every turn, including the Old Records Room which contained REAL old medical files dating back to the origins of Linda Vista Hospital \n\"Michelle\" played by newcomer Jaclyn Michelle Snoeberger a.k.a Playboy Live's model, \"Vikki McGuyver\" enters the point of no return Sierra Reyes (Kill Kapone , Haunted Maze) kept her composure during the many scenes wandering the creepy dark halls that lead to the hospitals morgue.",

  "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After surviving colon cancer in the summer of 2014, I came to realization that poor nutrition is a major contributor to development of cancer.\u00a0 After long and thorough research on cancer prevention, I eliminated chicken and beef from my diet, focusing on plant-based foods as one of my sources of protein.\u00a0 I noticed that many dishes lacked flavor and majority of protein sources were soy-based.\u00a0 Most people are aware that 99% of soy sold in the US is genetically modified.\u00a0 I couldn't take a chance by exposing my body to GMO products, so I decided to experiment with various organic plant-based protein sources and came out with currently patent-pending, delicious recipe for high-protein content, organic, plant-based sauce. This sauce can be added to any dish, vegan or otherwise, to increase the flavor and daily protein intake, without jeopardizing your health.\u00a0 It contains no artificial ingredients and has a high-nutritional value.\u00a0 It is 100% Non-GMO and vegan friendly.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The funds will be utilized for manufacturing and to ensure that our products stay true to the original recipe, which contain no artificial ingredients, no preservatives and is organic/Non-GMO.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe are creating healthy, natural food products for people that care about their health.\u00a0 Our products will be free of additives,\npreservatives, and common GI irritants like corn, soy, dairy, providing millions of people who have these sensitivities with healthier options. We also plan on donating a percentage of our profits to cancer prevention education.  We would like to raise $20,000 for:  Product development and testing for more delicious sauce flavors.

  "One lovely December morning, I woke up with an idea to buy a pair of thigh boots. That's right, yes! I live in Geneva and the winters here are very cold ! \u00a0 Now I'm addressing to you ladies: Have you ever tried to buy a pair of thigh boots ? After many and many trying, same observation:\u00a0 Personnaly measuring 1m81, the thigh boots just turn into knee boots. Our mission is to create a shoe's accessory that will fit to any woman's shoes and transform it into a beautiful pair of thigh boots. All this, with trendy collections, adapting to all budgets, all body shapes and above all, to each woman.\u00a0 In addition to the trendy collections, a web app will also be developed to allow customers to create their own accessories if their minds were to turn to creativity.\u00a0 Yes ! Pimp'up deeply believes that every woman is unique. Pimp'up expresses and believes in true values: A free and independent woman, strong and elegant. We have designed the collection that we would like to wear every day. This means that depending on the range, each woman will be able to find the accessory that suits her. Or create it! A Vegan range has even been designed, to be able to offer the same products to everyone, while respecting everyone's ethics. Size : 3 types of size: S, M, L and the custom-made. Because each woman deserves a special attention, our labels are composed of a secret pocket where a personalized word, signed by my hand, has been slipped, especially for her. \u00a0Because wearing Pimp'up is much more than dressing your leg or wanting to be trendy. Wearing a pair of Pimp'up is joining a community. A community of strong and independant women capable of moving mountains! You will never be alone again! And if you are a little down; this word will remind you of it. Because it will have been written especially for you and only for you. A web application will allow customers to create their own accessories thanks to a big database of materials, things to customize. Simple and effective, it has never been easier to create for express your personality.\u00a0 Our accessory is manufactured in a small but very famous Italian workshop of 20 craftsmen, in the region of Marches. Area known for shoe making.\u00a0 This world-renowned workshop also produces parts for major international brands. Our materials are finely selected and/or directly manufactured on site while respecting an eco-responsible production line. \u00a0We visit and study all our suppliers, to make sure that they correspond to our values. Because we sincerely believe that the use of the highest quality materials is the basis of an excellent accessory. We also have 100% Vegan materials, which will allow us to offer the same products to everyone, while respecting everyone's ethics. We believe in uncompromising quality. By eliminating intermediaries, not using resellers and by talking directly with you, we are able to offer an accessory of impeccable quality, at a price that can be adapted to all budgets, depending on the range. All accessories are finely inspected by us before each shipment. From the beginning, our objective was to offer a beautiful stylish feminine shoe's accessory, which fits all shoes, but above all, at a great price. The fact is that we don't have to buy the entire shoe, to adapt to any shoe allows us to do this. Indeed, the accessory adapts and re-invent your pair. The fact that we are also in direct contact with our customers without intermediaries or resellers also allows us to offer you a quality product, without costing you a fortune. Whether you go to work in a skirt or trousers suit, jeans or even a little black dress, the accessory is as versatile as it is functional. A dinner with your beloved? We remove the Pimp'up to let us see your legs. Reinvent your look as simply as a hello! Choosing your color:\u00a0We will send you a survey after the campaign ends where you can make your color selections.\u00a0 Reaching $50,000 in funding will allow us to create the entire collection but above all to make all the images, videos and whatever we need to create and develop our e-commerce site. Reaching $100,000 in funding will allow us to create and develop our web application. Because yes, Pimp'up will also be fully customizable. This will allow our customers to create their own unique accessory, just as they are eveyday. Reaching $150,000 in funding will allow us to make a big global launch, with wild fashion shows organized in 10 cities around the world. Scandalous, pioneering, innovative!\u00a0 If I reach 150,000, I will post prototype drawings for celebrities (which for me are the spirit of Pimp'up) saying that every 5000 more I make the prototypes and send them to the star and that it will then be on sale in September. 5000 also for packaging Fashion designer and always on the lookout for the latest trends, I love being feminine and stylish even in the freezing cold. What could be better than a beautiful pair of boots with a sweater dress for a trendy look? I've never been able to find a pair that can be beautiful, suitable, not vulgar, and without being horribly expensive! I created Pimp'up to solve this problem. With the fit and waterproofness of a shoe, Pimp'up adapts, keeps you warm and guarantees you a confident look, with a wide variety of choices to represent you. To each her own Pimp'up! Our mission is to dress your leg, dust off the shoe's world and allow you to reinvent your pairs without having to buy new ones. Over the past year, we have produced 8 prototypes. At each step of the process, we learned valuable information. We have refined, redesigned and are now delighted to use what we have learned to really launch Pimp'up with the help of the Kickstarter community. We spend a lot of time in our workshops, working with the staff and preparing our accessories to perfection. We have established a partnership with a workshop that manufactures items for some of the world's leading brands. We are only an hour away by plane, and when the accessories are finished and ready to go, we will pick them up directly. The possibilities of evolution for Pimp'up are endless! We could think about creating collections of hats, gloves, dresses and even shoes for our accessories in the future! Pimp'up will soon become the essential that every woman will have in her dressing room just like the little black dress or the eternal little pencil skirt. We expect the Pimp'up accessory to be ready for shipment, for Kickstarter orders, in November of this year. For the realization of the collection and the launch of the e-commerce site, we plan a launch in the beginning of december. We coordinated our different partners; from the workshop to the different suppliers, from photographers to web designers, to make this possible.",
  "Update: Book page sample Each page layout will be slightly different with \nrespect to the painting composition. The text is floating around the \ntree to create a perfect balance. A lot of time and attention will be \nspent in making these pages. We'll come back with updates here and on \nwww.onceuponapaper.net In nooks and corners  Cold remains:  Flowers of the plum Well, I need your help to gather all my paintings of trees and birds and create a Digital Book. I have a good forest here\u00a0onceuponapaper.etsy.com, and I want \u00a0to create a bunch more trees, to cover the broad range of the luxurious color combinations and shapes that nature and myself can produce. The Digital Book , a PDF file, will be viewable on your computer or mobile device. I will start working on it as soon as the the project reaches it's funding goal, and then keep adding the new paintings.\u00a0 What you get as rewards when you pledge is only original watercolor works. Plus of course, the PDF Book. Three sizes are available for the paintings: small ~8x10, medium ~12x17 and large ~18x24inch. They will be produced based on the pledging order, first come first served. \u00a0For the original paintings you are allowed to suggest a color your painting should be based on. \u00a0It will all be taken care with the survey sent at the end of project pledging \u00a0time.\u00a0 When I layout a tree, I am searching for a prototype and archetype, and for the most relevant and exciting to our human brains. Not an easy task, but so teasing to me.\u00a0My trees give joy, positive energy, color to the walls, oxygen to your brain, and make your friends jealous. I\u2019ll make trees and their inhabitants, \u00a0- birds. Two symbols of earth and flight, of rooted and freedom, of building and occupancy. It started a few years ago, out of my professional architectural design research. As an architect you always need to sketch your plans with a pencil, and many times, your spaces start looking like bubbles following some structure. From there, it all deviated into these paintings. I guess I always loved trees with their amazing crowns and structural forms. And who doesn\u2019t? Thanks for reading this, and for those willing to join,\u00a0please follow my\u00a0progress at\u00a0onceuponapaper.net\u00a0 Why not making an app: There are also compatibility issues. The odds of an application no longer running correctly are greater than that of there not being any option to load a specific kind of media file on future hardware. Also, it's easier for me to build this myself and more cost efficient.\u00a0 A $5 dollar for shipping costs would be very appreciated - thanks.",
  "Hi! We are THE SEA THE SEA, Chuck e. Costa & Mira Stanley,\u00a0a harmony-based, electro-acoustic, indie folk duo. During our just-over-two-years as a band we've been incredibly blessed not only to be able to make our living by touring and playing music, but to have had the opportunity to meet so many of you! We could not have accomplished what we have so far without you. Thank you. As some of you know, earlier this year we flew across the country to record our very first album together, LOVE WE ARE WE LOVE, with the incredible folks at\u00a0Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, CA, \u00a0produced by one of our favorite people/artists/producers, Todd Sickafoose, with additional fantastic musical contributions by:\u00a0Matthew Szemela,\u00a0Adam Levy, Jonny Rodgers, Theresa Wong, John Santos, & Jordan Glenn.\u00a0The album has been finished for a few months now, and we are SO PROUD of how it turned out. Not only does it sound great, but the incredible creative minds at The Made Shop made it look beautiful as well. Check it out: See how they made the artwork, here: We've been holding off on an OFFICIAL release so that we could take some time to assemble a knowledgeable, experienced promotional team, additional artist collaborators, create an informed, logistically sound release plan, as well as to save up some of our own funds to contribute. Those pieces are in place, ready for a February 25, 2014 release, so now we're ready to give our debut record a proper send-out into the world! But, first, we need your help... We've had some really incredible financial support from friends and family during this process, but for the most part we've covered the costs of recording our album, existing promotional materials, and a significant portion of what will be our promotional campaign on our own. We feel really good about that, but we also know that with your added help, we can do SO MUCH more! Plus, we're strong believers in the power of community, and we love the idea of this project belonging to all of us.\u00a0 The minimum amount we need (beyond the funds we've saved)\u00a0to cover the costs\u00a0of our official US Release which will include a\u00a0publicist to manage all publicity regarding the US release of LOVE WE ARE WE LOVE,\u00a0radio promoter who will send copies of and elicit interest in the album during it's release, high-quality photos for press/media consistent with album branding, video to coincide with album premiere, website updated to align with album branding/artwork, and manufacturing of 1500 CDs\u00a0is $6,500. Anything we're able to raise beyond $6,500 will go towards further creative content and merchandise.\u00a0 Total funds already in place = $13,500 of $20,000 total budget. The remaining costs of $6,500 break down like this: $1,500 (of $1,500) - CD manufacturing $1,000 (of $5,000) - videos $1,000 (of $1,000) - photos $1,000 (of $4,000) - radio $500 (of $500) - website $2500 (of $8,000) - publicist *Not included: 5% kickstarter fee + 3-5% amazon processing fee.

  "I've been working really hard for the last 4 years trying to finish these songs. A lot of them are ideas that I had sitting around the house for years that I kept kicking at until one day they smiled back and allowed me to write them. They were written all over the United States, from Alaska, to Oregon, to Colorado, to the Chihuahuan and  Sonora Desert to my front porch in Austin TX.  It takes me years to finish a song. I wish they came easier but that doesn't seem to be how it works for me. I'm really excited that I'm able to make a new record and I get to share it with you. I'm recording about fourteen songs and putting the ten that I feel make the album complete on the new record. Of these fourteen, about five of them I co-wrote with some of my long term friends and co-writing partners, Ron Scott, Gregory Alan Isakov, Marc Brenton and new to this  group of writing friends, Robby Hecht.  Making a record is extremely expensive, after studio time, printing CDs and t-shirts, musician fees,  mechanical royalties fees, radio promotion, artwork, mastering, the total comes out to about $ 8,000. I have a dream of being able to hire a company that does Press Promotions but that is another $2,500, So I'm just sticking with the $8,000 for now, but it would be amazing if I could get enough pledges to raise $10,500 for press promotions.\n",
  "The short film 'Skinner' will revolve around a psycho clown named Skinner that owns/works at a gas station off the turnpike in the middle of nowhere. Skinner doesn't take kindly to rude people and will SNAP... hard. 'Skinner' will be a dirty, gory, fucked up film made for horror lovers, my favorite people out there! The idea came from my binge watching of Rob Zombie films and I love how his movies are always dirty and messed up and I wanted to make something with that style; what's better than having a lunatic clown star in it?\u00a0 Rob Zombie, if you are reading this, you are a boss.\u00a0 Anyways, thank you so much for supporting me if you do, even a penny would be great. All proceeds will go to the making of the film that will start production in a few months. If you support, you will be thanked in the credits!",
  "Think \"Blair Witch Project\" type of film. My main characters have read the book \"They Cypress Hills Series\" and have become obsessed with this book. They realize that the book is actually based on a real place, and real people. They plan on doing a video shoot and interview people around the town to find out if the story in the book really happened.\u00a0 I have people already lined up and ready to do this project, I have locations searched out as well. I plan on using mostly raw video for most of this film. I need the extra funds for incidental purposes, as there may be some places that want to be paid for location use. As well as any legal issues that may arise during production.\u00a0 The book itself is real and yes, I based my story on a real place and real people, I thought it would be a fun and scary film to make and I have most of the characters that are in the actual book lined up and willing to shoot this film for free and share profits at a later date. How great is that?? Free actors free locations??? Possibly next Blair Witch Project in the making.\u00a0",
  "Thank you for pausing to read about my project!\u00a0 I am a 30 something female with a passion for cute, sweet things. I'm happily married to a fantastic guy that still makes my heart sing after many years together. Recently, we've fallen on hard times, and have been forced to pursue new options for supplemental income. I won't go into any sob stories - because negativity is never good! Wash away those bad vibes!\u00a0 Instead, let us focus on the positives and the fantastic reasons behind this project! These scrubs and body products come from ingredients right in my home - though with your help, I hope to expand to even more deliciously exciting ingredients! All of my scrubs are entirely edible (I'm not telling you to eat them, of course- because think of the sugar high!) and include animal and child (and adult!) friendly ingredients from Sugar to organic Extracts and some elements in between to give them some extra zing! I have been making these fun lip and body scrubs for some time, and have been known to give them as fabulous gifts to friends or family. The idea came to me that perhaps someone out there might enjoy them, also - so here we are! The goal is simple and reasonable, I know times can be tough for everyone and I do not wish to be greedy when there are so many other wonderful projects in addition to mine! I reach for enough to purchase more ingredients for the scrubs, as well as more to expand my offerings! Any and all supplies would be covered if my goal is met, from jars and packaging to ingredients and giving back to the community! What makes my project so special? \u00a0I would like to pledge to donate 20 jars of my sugar scrubs to local women's shelters for meeting my goal - with an additional amount to be donated in a stretch goal. There are many worthy places here that assist women in getting back on their feet, and I would love to offer some light to these women. Nothing makes me feel better on days that I am down than a good bath with some amazing bath and body supplies! You are amazing and I am blessed that you have read my story and considered my project! Thank you so much! http://kickingitforward.org",

  "With plenty of tie to spare we've reached our initial goal! \u00a0So as promised we're releasing a second single off the album. \u00a0Listen to the link above, but keep reading: there's plenty more we'd like to do for this album so we've added some stretch goals: \u00a0\u00a0 Stretch Goal #1: $7000\n\n\u00a0 If we reach $7000 we will attend the Folk Alliance International conference in Kansas City this February. This conference is an annual gathering of music industry professionals and musicians from all over the world and an amazing opportunity to expose our album to countless new fans and industry insiders at record labels, festivals, venues, and agencies. Added Rewards:\u00a0If we reach this stretch goal ALL donors of $20 or more will also receive a signed copy of our debut EP Risk Not Your Soul . ALL donors of $50 or more will receive Risk Not Your Soul plus a signed copy of our second EP Schemes.

We will then send you photos of your stuffed animal at all the sights! Imagine seeing Mikey the stuffed Monkey enjoy Stonehenge, The Cliffs of Moher, and the Brandenburg Gate!\n Once we received our first 20 contributions, we released this single \"Broken Things\" as a sneak peak off the new album. Thanks so far everyone for all your support! Tumbling Bones is an original and traditional folk group based in Portland, Maine. \u00a0They make their music with nothing but acoustic instruments, tap shoes, and most of all, their voices. Founding members Pete Winne and Jake Hoffman began playing together 10 years ago when they were randomly assigned each other as freshman year college roommates. As Tumbling Bones, they have toured the U.S. and Ireland meeting many of you good folks along the way -\u00a0but they are yet to make their own full-length album!\u00a0 An opportunity arose last spring when they joined forces with newest band member Kyle Morgan, a multi-talented songwriter, singer, and guitar player. Armed with three-part harmonies and Kyle's original songs, this September Tumbling Bones went to Great North Sound Society, a farmhouse-turned-recording studio in the woods of Maine. We, Tumbling Bones, think we produced something pretty great. \u00a0But we're going to need your help to finish the job.\u00a0While the songs have already been recorded, we still have $5000 in finishing costs ahead of us. \u00a0We still need to: - Mix the songs ($900) - Master the CD ($700) - Pay our side musicians ($900) - Manufacture the CDs ($1200) - Publicize the album ($1000) - Ship CDs overseas for European tours ($300) Please help us meet these costs so that we can make our first full-length album.\u00a0Also, as our campaign ends December 19th, you can choose the option to give your reward as a holiday gift to a friend. By December 25th we would email your friend a thank you card notifying him or her of your contribution. \u00a0Then, when the album's ready, your chosen reward (download, CD, dinner with the band, etc.) would be sent to your friend (at an address you provide). \u00a0 Thank you for supporting traditional acoustic music. We look forward to personally thanking you for your contribution.",
  "I would definitely say that I was born into a musical family. My dad is a musician who plays a lot of instruments; my mum sings; and my older sister and brother are both very musical. My grandfather's nickname was 'Singer' and my great-grandfather was a multi-instrumentalist too. I guess there\u2019s no escaping it. Music is in my blood. It should have been no surprise then when I quit my studies at Sixth Form and decided instead to pursue a career in music. But it did come as a surprise. Originally, I had intended to finish my A-Levels and then, do the music thing. But \u201cdestiny calls.\u201d And sometimes it calls at what you think is a really inconvenient time. However, with enough time passed to look back in retrospect, you can see that it was actually the perfect time. I was born to do this music thing! I\u2019ve been writing songs since I was 9 (let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve had mooore than enough time to get better at songwriting) \u2013 and after quitting my studies, I wrote a lot. I was in a sticky situation where I didn\u2019t know how to do the thing I most loved to do and, though it really hurt at times, I\u2019m glad for it or else I wouldn\u2019t have learned a valuable lesson in patience, faith and hope. \u00a0(\"Change\" - written last month using random words people gave me. Free download at soundcloud!) \u00a0(\"Usually, I Don't Listen To The News\" - Telephone box performance I did last month for K2.AV. Free download at soundcloud!) (\"Black Hole\" 2012 demo, which will be on the album.) (\"Stumbling Block\" 2012 demo, which will be on the album.) Two thirds of the 12 songs on this album weren\u2019t written during that particular time, but the reason I've put them all on the album is because they share a theme: passivity. The state of being passive. Sometimes it\u2019s a good thing to be passive, to deal with situations peacefully or to take a backseat; being inactive gives you some time to relax and reflect. And at other times it\u2019s not so good to be passive \u2013 sometimes you're letting people walk all over you, sometimes you\u2019re just being lazy, and sometimes you're lacking a lot of self-confidence and belief. I have experienced all of these things and so it's no surprise that they have found their way out of my system into songs of their own. That's the beauty of it! These songs have already helped me through some really difficult times; who knows whether they'll end up one day helping you through some of yours? If not, ah well. I hope it's nice to listen to. It really is not hard to make an independent album these days. Affordable technology makes it very doable. But it is hard to make a quality independent album these days for that very same reason. Lack of proper facilities, lack of inspiration, lack of direction and motivation have been obstacles that I\u2019ve been trying and failing to overcome in recent years. Well, I'm now full of inspiration, I now know the direction I'm going in, and you all have been my motivation throughout this time... so I'm thinking, actually, maybe the best way to get these songs out there is with your help. Just the fact that you like and believe in my music alone means the world to me, and whether you pledge, share the project or encourage, your support means the same. The funding will provide studio time and musicians to play on some of the tracks: there will be strings and a little harmonica! It will pay for the album artwork and design, some snaps, packaging, replication and distribution \u2013 the physical album comes with a nice booklet including the lyrics, \nartwork and photos as well as the credits, which will have all of your \nbeautiful names in it! When it\u2019s all done \u2013 you get the finished product. In order to do all of this, I need \u00a32,200 \u2013 that's \u00a3300 for studio time, \u00a3400 for the musicians, \u00a3250 for the artwork, design and photography, \u00a31000 for the packaging and replication of the CDs, and \u00a3250 for the other rewards. But from the overall budget, i.e. the \u00a32,500 or more that is raised, Kickstarter takes 5%, payment processing fees take from 3 to 5%, and then those deductions add VAT. So they'll take around \u00a3300 if we reach the funding goal, leaving me with just about the amount I need. If we don't reach the funding goal, you don't pay anything, which is great, but there also won't be an album... which isn't so great. I really hope and believe we will fund this thing! It will only take a few months to complete the project and that\u2019s exactly the reason I\u2019m getting my butt into gear and doing this now. I have no time for dilly-dallying \u2013 now is the time to do this. I\u2019m excited! I\u2019m aiming to have an album in your hands and ears by February 2014. Yes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m setting a release date for February 2014! As well as the album, there are other rewards too (as mentioned), such as access to the UK tour dates (yes, there will be a tour!), access to an online show (which I'll do before the album's release, in December or January), t-shirts with lyrics and artwork printed on them,  you can hire me to come to your house for an acoustic concert, I can use my hand and a pencil and draw a portrait of you\u2026 I\u2019m not that terrible an artist. And a few more. For all the rewards including CDs and things I'll be mailing to you, the mailing costs are included in the pledge amount, except for those outside the UK. There may be more pledges for some of the rewards, like the t-shirts and mugs, than I've anticipated and thus calculated into the budget, so if we raise more than the funding goal (which is absolutely possible) that will help to take care of those extra costs! Well, for one thing (as I just mentioned), I'll have more things listed in the rewards to create and fulfil, so the extra funding will take care of that. And if there's enough left over... Basically, I will plough it all into Passivity, in whatever way I can. What I've listed in the budget is just what's necessary to produce the album; there's so much more legwork to be done. I want to take this album further than I'm even able to imagine, so whether I end up playing a tonne of gigs in my hometown or doing a couple shows in another country, I'm going to be far from finished when the album is complete. That's the scary and exciting part. If you have any more suggestions for other rewards and things we could do for Passivity once it's done, I'd love to hear them! I'll be keeping you updated throughout the funding period and (if it's successfully funded!) all throughout the making of this album. Get ready for a lot of videos and a lot of blog posts. As much as I love to create music, and as much as I love to do that by myself, in my room, lost in my own little world inside my own head, I love to talk to people. Music is how I talk to people.\nIf you\u2019re interested at all in what I have to say musically, cool - I'm going to work my absolute hardest to get this music to you. It would be great if you could help me out by sharing this project and spreading the word. Let's do this! Take a look at the rewards to the right and pick whatever you fancy. With so much love, thank you.\n",
  "Hello from Magpie Sketches! I am super excited for my very first enamel pin Kickstarter! Who is Magpie Sketches? I'm a cute and spooky, queer Northern Arapaho artist that sells merchandise inspired by witch aesthetic and video games! Every sticker or fan art I create has bright colors, sparkles, and a hint of spookiness. I started in 2014 with my Etsy shop selling lolita head bows. I've had a comic published in Monsterpedia 7, an anthology made up for local Seattle artists last year. Since then I have been breaking on to the convention circuit with my unique designs and art! Why Kickstarter though? I decided to launch this cute, sparkly Illuminati inspired pin project in hopes to release even more pins in the future (and believe me when I say I have so many ideas). Kickstarter is a greatway for me to gauge interest in enamel pins, as well as a fantastic way to fund production costs. Enamel pins can add up very fast, so thank you in advance for your consideration to my campaign! There are 4 pin designs, 1 lanyard and 1 sticker sheet in this mini series! Product Details I have made one pin before, and the turn around was pretty fast. However, since I'm producing not only pins, but lanyards and stickers as well, I estimate that shipment will begin this December 2019! Timeline Shipping Shipping costs are a flat fee per area! $5.00 within the USA and $15.00 to the rest of the world, regardless of how many pins you order! Previous work My first pin, \"Horror Eau de Parfum\" is available on my Etsy. Kickstarter updates will be made through the Kickstarter platform, however I have tons of fun posts on all of my social media platform! Follow me on any or all of these for art, info, and more!",
  "Welcome to my Kickstarter campaign MYSTIC NATURE - my latest designs I've created in the last months. The designs combine my love for nature with a touch of fantasy and mystic. Isn't there anything in nature we will understand fully? It's just so many little pieces in there that work together at its perfection and we won't ever know how the biomechanic system works - there might be a sense of mystic in it. We all enjoying the magic animals and plants, there is always something magical & adventureous about nature. So why don't you support this campaign! Let me show what I can offer you, my friend and traveller. \u25cf Come, traveller! Nature is inviting you to stay for a moment. There is a natural mystic blowing through the air. If you listen carefully now, you will hear. \u25cf The initial goal of this campaign is to produce three hard enamel pin designs MASK, MUSHROOMS and MICE. The stickersheet will be unlocked in between and will be free for every backer as an extra for the support. For the stretch goals we will have four more designs and an illustrated postcard. You'll be able to pick the designs you want at the end of the campaign when the surveys are sent. If more designs become unlocked, they will become available for your choice! Each pin will come attached to a 9mm x13mm backing card with an exclusive design relating to the pins. The print color will be slightly shiny for a decent effect. You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time before the campaign is over.\u00a0 If you would like more pins, please add additional \u20ac11 per pin (for normal and early bird tiers) to the amount that you've already pledged OR change to a higher reward tier.\u00a0 If you would like to get postcard please add additional \u20ac4 to the amount that you've already pledged. To change your pledge amount, click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button. Then click the \u201cChange your pledge\" button and increase your pledge by the total of the add-ons you want to add. For example, if you've already pledged to the \"Six Pins\" tier and you'd like to add two extra pins, you need to add additional \u20ac22 to your pledge without changing your rewards tier.\u00a0 To change your pledge tier, click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button. Then click the \"Change your pledge\" button and select the \"New reward tier\".\u00a0 You'll be able to pick the designs you want at the end of the campaign when the surveys are sent.\u00a0 Help spread the word! This is my first campaign on Kickstarter, so I don't have any lovely supporters yet. That's why sharing means just as much as pledging! Share it for example with someone who might like the campaign. Thank you for your interest and support for this project! This really means a lot to me.\u00a0 If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me via email/messages or instagram/twitter @aglyra | Mail \u00a0(hello@aglyra.de) Find me on social media: \u00a0Instagram | Twitter \u00a0to stay updated in future.

Backers will be responsible for these costs, if there will appear any.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Funds will be received after about 7-14 days. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It will take about 1 to 2 weeks for the pins to be shipped to me For every pin the production of it will cost roughly 650 Euro to create. This includes manufacturing fees and shipping from the factory. All remaining funds raised will be used for the backing card production, shipping to backers, materials, and fees.\u00a0",
  "Hello friends, I'm Robbie of \u00a0Robbiekun Inc. I am currently running this Kickstarter due to the success of my first pin. Shortly after I sold the majority of the pins, people started asking \"When are you going to make more?\" Honestly, back then I didn't have an answer... But I do now! This is my first Kickstarter and I will feature 5 of my favorite One Piece waifus as enamel pin designs. Boa Hancock, Nami, Nico Robin, Perona and Shirahoshi. I hope we get to unlock them all!\u00a0 Pledging contributes to the production cost of these pins, and all additional stock left over after backer rewards are fulfilled, will go on my Etsy Shop after the Campaign is over. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By pledging, Backers get a discounted price and freebies.\u00a0 Thank you all for your time and consideration~\u2665 My pin designs is based off of my first pin which featured Nami being captured or sold in a slave auction. (Or, she probably sold herself for some extra Berries!)\u00a0 Reaching the initial goal of $550 would unlock the first pin in 2 variants. There will be 3 variants per pin design, Regular and Glitter Rare and GOLD Raw. If all designs are unlocked/funded, that would make a total of 15 pins available!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Disclaimer: I do not own the One Piece characters portrayed above, the rights to these characters belong to Funimation and Eiichiro Oda.\u00a0 *sticker art is currently under development* August: The campaign commences. September: The campaign ends on 9/14/19. Once it ends, all pledges are collected and cards are charged. Then, I will get the backer reward surveys set up and sent out.\u00a0 PRE-ORDERS: From Sunday, September 16th to Sunday, September 29th Pre-Orders will be available on my Shop. *These will be full price!* Why Pre-order? Because I do not plan to order stock specifically for the store. So if you want a pin(s) at the best price possible, Kickstarter is your safest bet. Then, Pre-orders are your last chance to guarantee a pin(s). October: It will take around 2 weeks for Kickstarter to release the funds raised to me. Once I get the funds, Manufacturer shall be contacted and production will commence. Production usually takes 2-3 weeks with about a week of transit time for the pins to arrive to me after being shipped.\u00a0 October/November: Pins arrive. I will inspect them and review everything to ensure quality, before packing up rewards and send them to their backers. Note: This is a preliminary timeline. Production errors or Delays (if any) will be addressed to you guys/taken care of Immediately. I shall update my backers throughout the whole process on Kickstarter and my Instagram.",

  "CLOSE ENOUGH EVERYONE! ALL PINS NOW UNLOCKED*! (*As long as we stay above $1000 till this Kickstarter ends in 20 hours.) If there were any 3-4-5-or 6 of these designs you wanted NOW is the time to bump up your bid to have all the designs of your choice! These rewards reflect some great savings as well- with the set of 6 pins averaging only $9ish per pin. With all the tricks we've pulled in these pieces you know that's a great deal. We should have samples shipping to us on Sept. 20th and we'll be able to post pics shortly after. This also moves up our delivery timeline if everything continues as it has been. THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE, and wish us luck in these last few hours. <3 - Kendra\u00a0 (Fade in from black- the scene - somewhere in Williamsburg, Virignia, where a purple haired girl waves to the seated audience.) Hello film, kitsch and monster fans! I'm Kendra, the gallery manager at Quirks and The Sideshow Gallery. With my bestie (and gallery owner Jenn) we've started designing our own range of pins and brooches and dubbed our brand \"Lipstick and Chrome\"! We have a passion for collecting enamel pins and acrylic brooches, so these are our focus. We know we need the support of like minded and passionate friends to help us on our journey and get the wheels turning. \u00a0I had the \"killer\" idea to design a pin collection based on vintage horror movies and pulp classics - you know, that campy stuff! (I'm actually a wimp, so this is as horror as I get.) I reached out to friend Kelly of Kitschy Delish and she helped us whip up these excellent designs. (She is stellar, please check her out on Etsy!)\u00a0 So without any further \"previews\" let's sit down and enjoy the feature presentation....\u00a0Lipstick and Chrome Presents STARS OF THE SILVER SCREAM!\u00a0 Once we hit our goal we'll be ready to produce our first two pins! The Vamp is lying in wait to pounce the next man who strays from his path. The coffin lid will swing open to expose this deadly vixen on our final design. Now Dracula is the king of horror movie camp and this collection would not be the same without him. The Kiss of Dracula is our enamel ode to him. One of my favorite things about this collection is we've designed the backing cards to feel like vintage movie posters completing the \"Silver Scream\" vibe. We have a few sparkly ideas for many of the pieces in this collection- we can't wait to show you the prototypes! Starting with your $20 donation you'll be able to add both The Vamp and Dracula pins to your collection.\u00a0 Have time for another flick? We hope so, because we'll unlock King Kong at $750 and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman at $1000. (Should we cross universes and make her \"snack\" wear a red shirt? Shout out to all you Trekkies.) We're also hoping to have enough capitol behind this project to upgrade our King Kong Monster to move up and down the skyscraper. TRICKS- we want to do allllll the TRICKS!\u00a0 The last two stars of this kitschy horror pin collection are Bride of Frankenstein (with glow in the dark hair) and Slasher (victim and knife chained piece). These pieces will unlock at $1250 and $1500 respectively. I might really have a thing for our Psycho inspired Slasher pin, so I hope you're all keen on the Midnight Matinee! \u00a0 So now you've seen them all- our first (I hope of many) Lipstick and Chrome enamel pin collections! If you want to see more of our gallery work behind the scene- where we've supported and presented the work of hundreds of artist over the years check us out on Instagram or online. We're a very VERY small team who have big ideas and we're thrilled to meet you. www.kinksandquirks.com On Instagram we're @Lipstickandchrome @kinksandquirks @shopthesideshow THANKS!\u00a0",
  "Vegans Deserve Convenience An estimate 2.5% of Canadians eat a vegan diet. A much larger percentage eat some form of vegetarian diet. Prominent animal rights activist Gary\u00a0Yourofsky says there are 4 main reasons people eat animal food products. One of those reasons is CONVENIENCE. And that's the main focus on this project. While we care a lot about food quality, and providing tasty, nutritious food, we don't aim to be the leader in these areas. Our main goal is simply to try to offset the advantage in convenience that animal-based food products currently have in the marketplace.\u00a0 Vegan Lunch Delivery Our goal is to use technology to make eating at least 1 vegan meal a day really simple, affordable and just plain easy. Our menu will be small but provide enough options that you could eat lunch 5-days a week from it without having the same combination of meals twice. We will provide an online ordering system and delivery within the downtown of Vancouver for maximum convenience. In addition to same-day ordering, we will also offer an order schedule. This will allow our customers for instance to preorder lunches 2-days per week for an entire month.\u00a0 Food Freedom Delivery Food Security VeganCafe.ca is partly about delivering food to vegans. It's also about helping non-vegans make the transition. One way we plan to help in that effort is through our Food Freedom Menu. This menu is a selection of affordable, simple vegan foods which we will distribute for free. A portion of all our sales will go to support this program, and we will also seek volunteers to minimize the costs to support it. We hope to deliver thousands of free vegan meals to people in need of food security throughout Vancouver and in doing that, help educate recipients about eating vegan.\u00a0",
  "It started when I was a little boy.. A love not soon to be forgotten. Once I had my first bite I knew that this was meant to be. Sweet, savory, greasy goodness. Pizza, as it is known worldwide, is a hot commodity. The ancients made pizzas out of grains and lamb. Since then it has evolved into something more edible. Many people have tried to create the most delicious pizza. Some have come close. Some have settled for less than average. However, few have achieved the perfection of a perfectly proportioned, thoroughly cooked, loaded pizza. This my friends, is my goal. To make THE perfect pizza. The fate of my hunger rests in your hands. We can do this.\u00a0",
  "I am a worship leader, a voice/piano instructor, singer and songwriter and have spent my life performing and preparing others to perform.\u00a0  I met Producer Brandon Bee several years ago when he was producing an album for my student Holly Starr.\u00a0 We have been friends since.\u00a0 Having the chance to work with him now is an incredible experience, a joy.\u00a0 We have spent 6 months so far working on the album in short bursts as I have had to travel to Utah where his studio has been to record.\u00a0  It is a labor of love.\u00a0 The songs we selected for the album come from my life.\u00a0 There is worship, of course, but there are songs of overcoming grief, illness and yes even anger, songs of nostalgia and songs of hope.\u00a0  3 times I made the decision to lay this down and stop working on the album.\u00a0 3 times God used people and circumstances to tell me ~ keep going. I know now that this is what I am supposed to do.\u00a0  We still have another recording session or two to complete, this time in Seattle WA so I will no longer have to leave my state and have the travel and lodging expenses so much.\u00a0 Phew!  Once the recording is completed it is out of my hands and goes to mixing, mastering and ~ I don't know what all!\u00a0 I know I still need to get the cd cover artwork &/or photography done and I plan to include a liner in the case to tell some stories for each song.\u00a0  Brandon says this is not the usual album.\u00a0 He says I am \"left of center\".\u00a0 He says this is a \"Concept\" album.\u00a0 It is life in song.\u00a0 My life.\u00a0 The human condition if you will.\u00a0 I do not write songs for the sake of songs.\u00a0 I write emotions for the sake of sanity.\u00a0 It just comes out in songs.

  "Welcome, people! I am making my first album after evolving as an artist for ten years. \u00a0I need your help to make it happen and I am excited to take this journey with you as listeners and friends. I've spent my life exploring the world of theatre, artists, education, and music. \u00a0In all my wanderings I come across people. People who stimulate each other to connect and to create. \u00a0Communities with a palpable desire to grow and revive. \u00a0I'm happy to say I've been swept up in it all and find myself surrounded by projects and dreams that truly bring people together through the arts... That said, I seem to have neglected my more solitary art in the process. \u00a0A songwriter never stops writing permanently. \u00a0Maybe a long dry spell, but the songs are there, lying dormant. \u00a0Fans have\u00a0encouraged\u00a0me to invest in my own music and make it known to the world, but I couldn't\u00a0wrap my mind around so much work to serve myself.\u00a0 Then, someone did it for me. \u00a0Lis and Lon Williamson of Gatorbone Records swept in and invited me onto their label. \u00a0This changed everything. Breathing life into those words reminded me that these songs exist for YOU, the listener. \u00a0Once I get it out, my need is met. \u00a0It is you, the audience, who then stands to gain from a possible connection with one of songs. \u00a0I was humbled and encouraged by my time spent in the studio and I can't wait to share the songs with you all. The album, maiden voyage, is sometimes abstract, sometimes narrative, sometimes soulful, but always autobiographical. \u00a0For better or worse, each song is directly inspired by different people in my life. One track, \"Elijah\" is about a people's experience which wove indelible threads in my foundation as a person. \u00a0\"Into One\" is spoken to a person with which many of us have had a dialogue. \u00a0Others are fictional portrayals of peoples' lives which provoked me to write. \u00a0There are love songs, too. \u00a0All of it, I suppose, paints a portrait of me as a person. \u00a0 I need $3000 to get the record on its feet. \u00a0Check out my incentives and see what you can do. \u00a0Thank you for your interest and faith in me! \u00a0I look forward to connecting with you through song.",
  "Disclaimer: The image on this project isn't directly tied to Duality. It is a representation of the artist Thea Magerand who will doing the cover art and other illustrations that will show up in the backer rewards. I do have her permission to use the posted image. Given my love for loops, we'll loop back around to Thea, a little further in. <end> Introductions: Hello there! I'm Jonathan but feel free to call me JT! Most of my friends do and we're to be friends right? I would like to -kickstart- things with a \u00a0thank you. Thank you for finding your way here. Regardless of your time or experience here, I appreciate you stopping by! Title: Duality Dissonance Genre: Psychological Fiction, Fantasy, Allegory Audience: Contemporary Adult Book Blurb: Duality Dissonance is something like a braid. You follow one strand of the braid which keeps pace with EV\u2019s (Envy\u2019s) adventure. He gets drawn into a conflict alongside the other sins and their aim is to save what\u2019s left of their world. As EV tries to understand what brought their world to its post-apocalyptic state, he begins to see another strand\u2013psychological trauma. When EV stops believing that their efforts are beneficial to the world, he finds himself standing in opposition to former friends. Now, the only way for EV\u2019s new beliefs to survive is to stop his former friends from accomplishing their goal. Will he be able to stop them or will he become just another casualty in a world that is beyond saving? Your Participation: I will be providing open access (Via Google Document) to the first chapter by June 3, 2022 so you can have a better idea if this project is something you are interested in supporting. As you will undoubtedly see elsewhere, I want your participation. I dabbled on Reddit for a time and I found a few really great people that made recommendations for my writing. That is where the collaboration side of this project comes from. I know the value of having varied viewpoints look at a thing. You will see things differently than I do because you are looking through a lens different from mine. Duality is a great story by itself but I know that it can be so much more if I allow you to be a part of it. \"Every man I meet is my superior in some way, in that I learn from him.\" Ralph Emerson I will be providing different levels of access to the story depending on your backing Tier. The majority of the tiers will give you access to a Google document where you can either read or comment on the story. I may have different documents for commenters but I would prefer to only get negative comments from my contributors, and by negative, I am referring to constructive criticism. While, I do enjoy positive remarks, that can't be used to improve the story because it's a reinforcement of what is already in place. I may have two different documents for this, allowing one to be for showing love and the other one to help shape the story by pointing out grammatical issues or helping me clarify things for you (the reader). Regardless of the level of input, I still plan to bring in an editor. I don't have plans for a Tier that will provide access to the entire story and I will need a professional set of eyes to verify continuity across the entirety of the novel. Sample: Here is a view only link to Chapter 1 so you can see if this is a story that you would be interested in. \u00a0While I will be updating the links that are a part of the Backer Rewards, I won't be editing this document. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZTpLpnzw1VUaUzQhhq8YdMGWu5-ZW98idnvWy9btM4s/edit?usp=sharing Funding Usage & Backer Rewards: This project will be running through late July (60 days). I plan to upload into KDP after editing. I anticipate sending to an editor in mid July. I realize that overlaps with the run of this project and may be sent in while backers are still commenting on the beta reading but I'm wanting to have a reasonable turn around on the physical rewards. When I upload to KDP, I understand that I will receive a proof copy and then I will suggest or approve that proof. From what I've read, it can take close to 3 weeks for me to receive the physical books that I send then send out as the backer rewards. Additionally, my artists doesn't start on my book cover and concepts until August. I suspect that the eBooks can be sent in late August but the physical things will likely be sent out in September. A large portion of the funding (approx. $4,000+) will go towards editing. Another significant portion will go into the concept art, producing the physical copies, and shipping. As it says in the Tier V reward, I really want to put more into that tier so additional funding will likely be channeled into that. Given that this project is of a collaborative nature, please feel free to make recommendations on the backer rewards. I will consider altering them but once backers have put money into a tier, I can only add to them at that point and won't be able to substitute anything. So if you have a suggestion, it's best to offer those early on. My Progress: This project is about Duality Dissonance and I am in the process of completing its rewrite. This story is capable of standing alone but I also have a continuing storyline that I plan to work on after this one. There are 2 subsequent novels planned, along with an additional story about a supporting character that spans the Duality books. That story is a prequel to Dissonance and is a bit of an origin for that supporting character. I started rewriting Dissonance in Dec of '21. I took a short break for March and I'm now approaching the concluding moments of the novel. This rough rewrite is sitting just over 75,000 words and I will be pushing it over 90,000 before I consider it to be approaching an adequate length. I'm going back and forth between revising, world building, and progressing the closing chapters. It should take me about 2 weeks to push above 90,000 when I'm focusing solely on progressing the late chapters. I know the details of those chapters from the draft so I just have to fill out the rewrite. My projection is based on my work during my last deliberate progression where I progressed 11,000 words over 4 days. I'm not concerned or stalling the progression, I'm just alternating my tasks each week. I progress the rewrite one week, revise early chapters the next, and then focus world building/map making on the 3rd week before revisiting chapter progression again. This is not a new story for me but it will be for you. I initially put this story concept together a few years ago. I stepped away from the draft because I was ill-equipped to convert my imagination into a novel that was approachable for others. I believe I have fixed that though and I'm here to invite you to participate in the finalizing of this project. I don't intend to do frequent progress updates on Kickstarter but I will be making regular ones on my blog. Feel free to check there if you want a more current update. I know that interacting on multiple platforms will bog down my story progress so I may implement a schedule for Kickstarter updates if they get too involved. Maybe once a week? Regardless of the interactions here and on the google documents (backer rewards), I will maintain a higher tempo of updates on the blog. Goals/Intent: This story will happen regardless of this projects performance but I have 2 goals here. Another part of my reasoning for stepping away from my draft was because I felt like this story belonged to more than just this would-be writer. It is my belief that this story will be important to a great many people out there and it is my hope to find some of them here. So my first and primary goal is to establish and reach some of the audience that will be passionate about this story/storyline. I want to find them and I want to include them during the finalizing of this novel. My secondary goal is to fund this project. The majority of the funding will go towards editorial work and the artwork that Thea Magerand will be completing for me.\u00a0 The recommended timeframe for Kickstarter projects is 30 days but I am running this for 60 days due to my primary goal and Thea's timeline. Thea is pretty popular so she won't be working on my project until August. This project will close at the end of July \u00a0which will lead into my artist getting to this project. Of course, that means that the art won't be completed when the project ends and I will have to find out a timeframe from Thea. The performance of this project will impact the amount of art that I need from Thea though so I will just have to provide updates as the project goes on. Interactions: There are the obvious interactions within the backer rewards and also your ability to recommend alterations to those rewards but I also have a blog that will facilitate further interaction. I started the blog in May 2022 with the intent of mapping the course of this story. \u00a0There, you can find an about me section, get regular updates on story activities and see things regarding my personality and strengths. \u00a0I mention the personality/strengths bit now because it is related to where this is all going. Both my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (INFP) and my Strengths Finder 2.0 paint me as something of a bridge builder...and -that- is what this is ultimately about. I'm building a bridge. I want to bridge the gap between Duality Dissonance and the people that it will be meaningful to. If you find meaning here, please feel free to get involved and be a part of it. I would be delighted to have your collaborative spirit! You will also find character bios on my blog and you are welcome to ask them questions. Their individual bio will give you more information and they will respond to you based on their knowledge within the first 3 chapters. Currently (6/4/22), only EV and Wrath are posted but I plan to post the remainder by 6/13 which is within a week of launch. Lust will be the last one posted and while you can read on him, I request that you don't try to talk to him. I realize that is only going to encourage more people to try but he can't speak so I really don't see that being very interactive! lol I'm going to try and disable comments for that post but I'm not sure if that's a feature. Thea Magerand This is the artist that will be working with me on some story art, including the novel cover. Here are a couple of links to some of her work. This will give you an idea on what to expect: https://www.artstation.com/ikaruna --Oh gosh...I just realized that she uploaded new things in here \ud83e\udd70 https://displate.com/ikaruna --My vision for the Duality art is a similar vibe to this collection: Norse Mythology Illustrated. We have talked about it and the plan is for Duality's art to have that similar haunting feeling. My personal favorite in this collection is \"Ragnarok is Coming\" It's Ba' Dass. *cough \ud83d\ude0f So yeah, I don't think there is any more to say about Thea other than showing what she can do. She's awesome and I think we have a lot of similar artistic tastes. She will undoubtedly bring a lot of value to this story.

  "I've got a new record and I'm this close (hold your thumb and forefinger about half an inch apart) to finishing it. Recording and mastering are done, and this project is to raise money for production and packaging. There Are No Secrets In This Town is 11 songs inspired by an oral history interview of a Terre Haute \"madam.\" The woman was in the business from before Prohibition to the '60s or '70s, and she spoke about so many fascinating characters she had met, as well as about politics, society and other matters. She talked about everything but sex, in fact. As I read it I thought, \"These people would make great songs.\" So I started writing. The songs about love and loss and lust and industrial accidents and vets coming home from the war and there is even a song about shoes. Fred Grittner produced and recorded the album and also performs and sings on it. He took a one-microphone, \"live\"-in-the-room approach and it turned out great. The record also features Karl Burke on bass, Lonnie Knight on guitar, Amy Brockman on harmony vocals, Bob Nordquist on harmonicaand Erik Brandt on accordion. Don Arney in Terre Haute did the mastering. I think we came up with a darn-fine record, and now I want others to hear it. If we make the goal, we'll be producing the record with a two-panel sleeve. Depending on how much over the goal we reach at the end of the 30 days, we may go with a four-panel sleeve, which would allow more room for art. A record sleeve should be arty. Speaking of which, I've already chosen the cover art. It is a great photo by the renown Chicago photographer Art Shay. He shot it while on assignment in Terre Haute for Life Magazine back in 1958. I saw the photo while doing some research for the record and thought it was perfect. I was able to track down Shay (he's 91 now) and his archivist and the three of us negotiated a deal for the use of the photo. I'm pretty excited about it. ",

Every contributor will be able to download \"Age\" in its entirety before its physical release date in April. Contributing more funds to the project will include unique gifts such as obtaining the album in Vinyl form, typed lyrics from Johnny Lewis, and also having the opportunity to receive limited prints of original oil paintings by Johnny (see examples below). At the $500 level, donors will receive all of these gifts, including an actual original painting (if they WANT it! ) Johnny Lewis' musical background is not that of the ordinary Folk Artist. Stemming from Minneapolis, MN, Johnny moved to Colorado in 2008 to pursue electronic production for a number of touring acts including The Larva Ink, Lizzo, Bokonon and many more. Accepted into the festival community, Lewis opened extensively for national acts such as The Flaming Lips and EOTO. After tirelessly working for his electronic acts, Lewis came to terms with his obsession for acoustic music, which in turn, drove him away from production and into his passion - writing songs. Lewis melds the timeless north-country sound of acoustic guitar with unique lyrics and electronic ambiance, replanting the poetic verse into a timeless songwriting style for a new generation of listeners. Johnny Lewis now resides in New York City where he studies Poetry at The New School.\u00a0 All contribution levels play a major roll in the creation of this record. This record will be built by friends and family and is here to give everyone the opportunity to show their support towards modern American acoustic music! Let's dance on these avenues.

  "Turner on\nWood: Blending Beauty & Ecology & Community UPDATE - This project was mercifully successfully funded some hours ago. However, if you were still considering donating to this campaign, please do so! The more funds available, the more money we have to work with - insofar as materials, unexpected expenses, etc.  In addition, we were hoping to incorporate more of the general county action in terms of video work, blogging and documenting more thoroughly IE incorporating what we do here with the larger artistic context.  We are still receiving donations here till about 10PM EST. Thanks!\n \u00a0INSPIRATION \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nmuch as any other painter, J.M.W. Turner inaugurates the modern use of color\nand composition. \u00a0He is arguably as\ninfluential as Vermeer was earlier. \u00a0His landscapes and seascapes mix montages of terror and\ndelight, pathos and transcendence into single canvases.\u00a0 Moreover, he has always stirred my\nsoul and fired my muse.\u00a0 Since\nrelocating to Appalachian North Carolina, the thought of doing something\nsimultaneously to honor and reconfigure Turner\u2019s brilliance has become\nsomething of an obsession.\u00a0  I carried my copy of Turner at the Tate with me everywhere,\nuntil finally my mother and my husband ganged up on me.\u00a0 Their challenge: \u201cDo something with\nthis; go to Kickstarter, and plead with the world for help in achieving your\nvision.\u201d\u00a0 So here I am. RATIONALE \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\none of the first Romantics, Turner quite clearly articulated a defense of\nnature against the depredations of humanity.\u00a0 He showed the power and fury that nature, especially the\nsea, might unleash at any moment.\u00a0\nHis canvases also depict the interconnections that bind people to each\nother and to the natural world. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\nof these elements of Turner\u2019s approach, two hundred years old, seem apt today,\nas society\u2019s mastery of the cosmos seems almost complete at the same time that\nour lives hang on our ability to balance our own needs and pathways with what\nthe universe permits.\u00a0 Reimaging\nTurner\u2019s oeuvre thus seemed both aesthetically and philosophically sound. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nwell, I had begun to collect beautiful pieces of driftwood, some of which\nseemed ideal for luscious oils and sweeping compositions.\u00a0 On my own, intrepid if uncertain, I\nbegan to reconfigure Turner at the Tate\npiece by piece. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three\nsuch panels into the breech, however, I ran out of Prussian Blue.\u00a0 I\u2019m nearly out of Liquen Lite, two\nshades of yellow, and several other tubes of paint.\u00a0 I\u2019m low on paint thinner, and I used my last gesso on the\nplanned fourth Turner panel.\u00a0 I\nhave obtained ten of the ninety three panels necessary for completion, yet each\nof these came at a cost of ten dollars or more. While I believe in what I\u2019m doing,\nand offer the work that I\u2019ve completed as evidence of its validity, I need\nsupport\u2014at a minimum what I\u2019ve requested here on KickStarter, to continue with\nthis.\u00a0 I am praying that others see\nsomething of the value in this that I do. PROCESS \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basically,\nthe funds that I seek will pay for all my supplies, all of the \u2018canvases\u2019, and\nthen let me hire someone to help with bringing the pieces to market.\u00a0 I am hopeful that such a consultant can\nalso help me to prepare to do a video about the project and a catalog, but that\nis after the completion of what I propose here. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basically,\nwhat will happen by the middle of February, after this drive for assistance is\nsuccessful, is that I will have purchased all of my paints and supplies.\u00a0 I will also have ordered all of the\nremaining wood pieces, sanded, finished, and prepped with gesso on one side.\u00a0 The money to pay for them will be\navailable too, praise be. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then,\nbeginning on February 15th, each day I will paint exactly one of the\nremaining ninety images, seven days a week.\u00a0 By May 15th(it\u2019s a leap year!), therefore, that\nphase of work will have finished. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At\nleast twice a week, on Sunday morning and Wednesday night\u2014and perhaps more\nfrequently\u2014I will blog about the whole project.\u00a0 Partially, this anticipates my desire to create a video and\ncatalog presentation later; in part, though, it also serves to keep my supporters\nin the loop about my progress, trials and triumphs, and so forth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\nalso intend to do at least one brief video while I\u2019m in the thick of\nthings.\u00a0 I can\u2019t promise this, but\nit is my intention; I\u2019m pretty good about keeping my word to myself.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally\nat the beginning of May, I will tap my Atlanta and WNC networks to find someone\nappropriate to help me with marketing and presentation. I already have several\nleads in this regard. For the most part, this will culminate the project.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexception is that I will only have delivered most of the \u2018gifts\u2019 attendant on\nmaking a donation here.\u00a0\nBenefactors who have made more substantial gifts will receive all they\nare due by two months after the completion of the final panel. FOLLOW-UP No society has long survived\nwithout an artistic potential, a cultural nexus.\u00a0 My hope is that this program permits me to participate in\nresuscitating a grassroots capacity for artistry.\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\npart of my thankfulness at this privilege, I intend to make a video of what\nI\u2019ve done, as a kind of \u2018how-to\u2019 and primer about such a process.\u00a0 I also want to reach out to other\ncreators in the aftermath; the video will help me with this.\u00a0 Artists need to find a way to express\ntheir power in ways that go beyond craftiness and beauty, or at least, that\u2019s\nmy sense of things. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly,\nI will, as a result of my retaining a consultant, have at least the rudiments\nof a plan for taking the Turner Reproductions to town, so to speak, and to\nproduce a catalog of the work that both presents the images in another medium\nand acts as an additional outreach and engagement tool for reaching and\nnetworking with other artists. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nany event, I vow this much.\u00a0 Anyone\nwho helps me to achieve my vision here will find my door and my heart always\nopen.\u00a0 One of my heroes is the\ngreat Paulo Freire.\u00a0 He said that\nthe essence of humanity was being willing to have an equitable and heartfelt\nconversation with another person.\u00a0\nSo, to all who respond here, thank you and don\u2019t be strangers.\u00a0 We should be talking about all of this\nand whatever else suits our purposes.",
  "Mexico is a diverse country that has been shaped and is being shaped by its mestizo culture (indigenous and Spanish European), its traditions, its Catholicism, its clash between urban and country, its poverty, its recent growth and many more factors.

  "I was working on my homework and I came across a quote from the prophet Jeremiah, and I was blown away! It made me think about life and what I was going through at the time.

  "The Scottish Mountain Wilderness Calendar 2015 will feature a set of images of some of Scotlands wildest and most beautiful natural landscapes captured by the artist on numerous trips into the country's remote corners. As the 'Natural Light Gallery' title implies, the artist never uses mood changing filters to alter the atmosphere of the scenes he photographs, and each view has thus been faithfully captured (often requiring reaching very remote and exposed areas at rather unsociable hours) and reflects the true feeling of the moments. The Scottish Mountain Wilderness Calendar 2015 is the culmination of the artists desire to relaunch his self-published calendar range. In 2011 he produced his first Scottish Mountain Wilderness calendar for distribution in the UK. With the difficulties of breaking into the established market for such products coupled with a turbulent financial period it proved to be non-cost-effective to continue the following year, despite numerous requests from individuals who had purchased the 2011 issue. This relaunch will dispense with the intermediaries, allowing the artist to offer the product for a reasonable price without needing to produce a large print-run. Printed to the highest standards using sustainable materials, the \ncalendar would make an excellent Christmas or birthday gift, not to \nmention a fine personal purchase for anyone who loves the wild \nspaces this beautiful country has to offer.

  "In the new supernatural thriller\u00a0Lazy Susan, a new horror icon will be born. Susan is an evil twin like no other. And we want you to be part of her cinematic legacy. But first: 1. Why am I qualified to make the next great horror film? This past year, I've had the pleasure of sharing past projects in a documentary called HEART ATTACK: The Early Pulse Pounding Cinema of Kelly Hughes. It played at film festivals in London and Portugal.\u00a0 But it was at a screening at the Thin Line Film Fest in Denton, TX where I met two of the future stars of Lazy Susan. Local filmmaker and actor Chad Withers introduced me to Rubber Gloves Rehearsal Studios. It's a bar/nightclub that features Denton's most cutting-edge bands. And that night he was filming a nu-millennial punk rock band called DEEP Throat. And their lead singer, Taylor Kimbrough, was so electrifying, I knew I had to come out of retirement and create a new project to showcase her intensity. 2. Why the obsession with evil twins? The idea for Lazy Susan came from my love of evil twins. And movies like David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers where one actor plays both twins. Years ago, I created a twins episode for my TV show Heart Attack Theatre. And the episode was called Sisters. It involved a psychic nun and her adulterous twin sister. And it was the first time I attempted to film an actress playing a scene with herself, using a stand-in to make it look like two distinct characters. I had such a good time with it. And have always wanted to do a similar effect on a bigger level. So this is my chance with Lazy Susan. 3. How did we get such a great cast? Fate! 4. I love horror movies. Will I get a copy of Lazy Susan when it's completed? Of course! Most of the donation options include a copy of the movie as a reward. So choose one of those, and you're good to go! 5. How will you spend my donation? We will put the money into audio and visual gear to give us the best production values possible. And will run a tight ship to make sure we finish on schedule, and create a special piece of cinema that everyone is proud to call their own! 6. How do I donate? Ready to give us a pledge, and call yourself a Movie Investor? All it take is a few clicks. We would love for you to join the team, and be part of the Lazy Susan experience.\u00a0 Just choose your donation amount in the column on the right, and it will walk you through the process ------> :) We really appreciate your support. And can't wait to share Susan with you when we're done. Let's create a new horror icon! Thanks. \u00a0http://www.kellywaynehughes.com P.S. I'll be promoting my upcoming book, as well as Lazy Susan, at Crypticon Seattle May 23-25. So if you're in the Seattle area, stop by my table. And I can give you more details about the project...",
  "Every time I fly into a reasonably large city at night I try to get a window seat. If it's a clear enough night I watch the view as we land. At first it looks like a nervous system. Clumps of lights connected by thin strands. As you get closer to the ground you start to see other shapes take form against an inky black backdrop. I have often thought about making paintings of this experience, and now I am.  I will be doing a series of paintings in all sizes based on this vision. In addition this will be my first series to have limited edition prints. I plan to have some sort of show of the paintings at some point, but before I can set that up I need to have some paintings to show. Right now I just have a few small ones, and the large two panel painting above that I made last year and have already sold. This is where the backers come in. I started out doing miniature paintings, which doesn't require a lot of space or a lot by the way of supplies. I have also recently decided to take on painting on a more full time basis, and have made the necessary adjustments to my day job hours to make this possible.  Part of the funding will be used for adequate lighting for my studio. Right now I can only paint by the window during the day. I am also in sore need of some new, larger, brushes, a larger portfolio to transport paintings, and if possible a better easel that will not fall over with a stiff breeze. There will be a significant outlay for scanning and printing service for the limited editions. Lastly part of the money raised will be used for basic business expenses such as establishing a website, accounting software, business cards, and promotional post cards.  What you should know as a backer: All limited edition prints will be cut to bleed (no white border), signed and numbered. The actual number of each edition will depend in part on the number of backers in each level. All original paintings will arrive on a gallery wrapped canvas, with matte varnish, and wired ready to hang on your wall. All backers, regardless of donation level, will receive one each of any promotional post cards that are produced for this series. As soon as I have any sort of show, open house, or reception lined up I will add an update with all pertinent information and invite each backer personally.\u00a0 Thanks for checking out my project! It can only succeed if other people know about it, so if you like what you see please share this page with your friends. ",

I'm looking for $1000 to help offset the cost of getting 200 of each of my new designs made! Please note that to cut down on packaging waste, unless you REQUEST backing cards via the survey, they will not be included. \u00a0 Backing cards are only really useful for presentation (ie if you intend on giving a pin as a present), so if you're going to open up your package and stick your pin directly on your jacket/board/etc, there's no point to having a backing card at all. \u00a0 When I receive the bulk order of pins, they are all individually bagged to prevent scratching - I will be leaving the pins in these bags unless you want the backing card! \u00a0 (Please see the picture below if you're not sure what a backing card is.) (Or if you don't want to wait until the kickstarter is over, you can always nab them on my storenvy site! )\u00a0 \u00a0All pins will be shipped in bubble wrap mailers. I'll be placing the order for the pins before the kickstarter even wraps up, so you'll be getting your pins very quickly! \u00a0They will start shipping in September. \n \u00a0\u00a0So! In conclusion: Buy some pins to wear and inflict your deep dark love of puns and other nerdly things on all who dare gaze upon your lapels!\u00a0",

  "Hi! We're Felix and Fancy and we're creating enamel pins.\u00a0 In the world of Pokemon, these creatures are more like pets than anything. The concept of Pokemon shaming came from imagining beloved Pokemon in the same position as your German Shepard, wearing a sign after crashing through a door after running at it at full speed. Now you can imagine what kinds of crazy situations your Pokemon might get into.\u00a0 The first two rewards include a long standing favorite, Pikachu, as well as new fan favorite Wooloo. We've created another set of Pokemon pins of Pichus wearing the various hats available in the Pokemon universe. This time, we have chosen to expand the amount of Pokemon as well as offer a load of pins to choose from should each goal be reached.\u00a0 Our Pin Tiers are as follows! Each pin from these tiers will measure 1.5\" or 38.1mm at its largest point. Initial: Pikachu and Wooloo Locked! Litwick and Rowlet Locked! Trubbish and Skiddo Locked! Inkay Locked! Zweilous Locked! Drifloon Locked! Biggest Shaming! 3\" or 76.2mm pins COMING SOON! \u00a0How to choose your pins: Kickstarter cost Breakdown!

  "Novel Horizons is a Texas based Publisher of Original English Light Novels dedicated to bringing high quality and enjoyable stories into your hands!\u00a0 Established September 2020, we've picked up multiple works and are working on continuing to expand our lineup with high quality stories. Twitter Discord Server Official Website Why Kickstarter?\u00a0 We find Kickstarter to be a very reliable and safe way to gather pre-orders and gauge interest in a series and/or project. The funds from this campaign will be used to print physical copies of Azure Wing Volume 1 along with merchandise. Funds will also go toward covering editing costs and formatting costs. Otherwise, Azure Wing Volume 1 is complete so we expect the wait time from campaign end to receiving the novel to be fairly short! Book details:\u00a0 Volume 1 of Azure Wing is estimated to be approximately 300 pages. Making it our beefiest book to date.\u00a0 There will be two versions of this novel released:\u00a0 A 5x7 softcover copy which is the standard edition with full color cover and a synopsis back. There will also be a 5x8 hardcover variation which will be the Limited Edition with alternate front/back artwork. Conceptualized in the early 2000's, Azure Wing started off as a young middle schooler's story that was written in the boredom of class.\u00a0 Starting with the creation of \"Fenix\" and \"Sylvia\" as his partner, the two characters went through many incarnations before ending up in what one may consider a story.\u00a0 But it wasn't until the year 2016 that \"Azure Wing\" , after countless rewrites and hundreds of tossed pages, became the epic, action tale it is.\u00a0 Following a successful campaign to become a visual novel, the project was eventually met with a series of unfortunate events that drove the developer under.\u00a0 Azure Wing has since been picked up to become a full fledged Light Novel in order to tell the story of Fenix and his journey due to the overwhelming support from the community to see it continue.\u00a0 Rewritten, upgraded, and revived, we are proud to present to you \"Azure Wing\" Volume One!\u00a0 Synopsis:\u00a0 Elves, Dwarves, Merfolk. Fenix Solari had seen all manner of enemies in his time as a Captain in the Mage Knight organization. Acting as the tip of the spear that thrust into the hearts of humanities enemies during the \"Great War\". Dauntless with his partner known as the \"Crimson Flame\", he left battlefields torn asunder until the day he was captured. Trapped in a prison of eternal ice, Fenix would disappear from the war and it wouldn't be until hundreds of years later that he would awaken once more. His \"world\" existing now only in ruins or the pages of a history books. Characters: \u00a0----------Sylvia Vaeros: Valkyrie Commander and partner to Mage Knight Captain Fenix Solari, Sylvia Vaeros is known by friend and foe as the \"Crimson Flame\". Her contributions in the \"Great War\" fighting for the Human side has earned her a place in history books across the world by all.\u00a0 Feared or respected, no one denies Sylvia her place as one of the strongest beings to participate in what would be known as the bloodiest conflict ever witnessed. ----------Faelan A female \"silver-back\" Okamean, Faelan is extremely important to her race simply due to being born with the rare genetic mutation that gives her physical capabilities many times higher then a normal Okamean while also having the ability to cast magic.\u00a0 This fact alone has caused her to live her life heavily protected and created a desire to be free in her which led to her unfortunate capture by Elf Slave traders. Luckily for her, they elected to travel through a \"Lost Zone\" and the Darkened Ones are not picky with prey. ---------Alea Terja A high elf princess, Alea Terja perceives herself to embody the elven ideals of beauty, fairness, and elegance. A powerful fighter in her own right with the ability to use powerful magics that many older elves cannot, she is an inexperienced commander with dreams of living up to the legend and reputation of her father who was famously known as \"Tempest\" during the great war. ----------Salvatore Deneva\u00a0 Legendary by title alone, the Salvatore known as Deneva would create her own mark on human history by developing powerful Etherite-based tools and revolutionizing navel warfare.\u00a0 With her contributions, the water constricted navy of the Denif were capable of traveling over land, eliminating the once crippling weakness of the grand Denif Navy. Many speak of her unparalleled mastery of the rapier but none can say they've experienced it. A testimony to her fearsome strength. Sample Illustrations \u00a0Promotional artwork/Merchandise(Survey will be sent out to verify orders. Simply add to your pledge the cost of the item(s) you'd like to also get.) ----------Winter \u00a0Season Postcard Series(Limited time)(5$ each)\u00a0 ----------Parallel Professions Postcard Series(5$ each) ----------Stretch Goals\u00a0 A few extra's that we want to aim for to add just a bit more to Volume 1's initial release!\u00a0 -----4.500$ If we can reach 4,500$ then we will be able to add more illustrations to the inside of the book! We will also be adding some extra story content to the end of the book(Side stories) for readers to enjoy! That will feature their own B/W illustration(s).\u00a0 -----6,000$ At 6,000$ we would have enough excess funding to be able to spend money on developing a mini-figure of one of the characters in Azure Wing!\u00a0 This mini-figure would be unpainted and probably stand at about 4.25 inches tall. The character will be determined using a popularity poll.\u00a0",
  "I wrote Dwarfhammer because I wanted to write a book that would inspire my daughters and give young men a chance to think about what respect means - without being told how to think. I work with offenders in prisons and I am challenged when I hear the same justifications that they use for their crimes against women being repeated by men, often otherwise good men, on the outside. We need stories to deal with men's violence because, as I discovered when one man offered to knock me out in a pub, just telling men that they are sexist doesn't work. Stories help us to understand other people and their struggles and to know what it means to be a victim. Stories also give us hope and the courage to push on against overwhelming odds. Now, more than ever, we need to change the stories we tell ourselves.\u00a0 So, want to know what the book is about? Three young dwarves are cast out of their village and must embark on an epic journey to reclaim the Dwarfhammer, stop an invading horde and somehow not carve each other to pieces along the way. Tolly is fierce and deadly, but can she discover the wild talent that is within her? Luki, her twin brother, creates chaos wherever he goes but will he survive to tell his story? Arnfel, the proud son of the murdered Chief, must recover the Dwarfhammer - the ancient relic of his clan - and unite the dwarves before it is too late. Old and young, male and female, outsiders and purebloods - all must find a way to overcome old prejudices or be crushed by the coming war. At last I have written the novel, the next step is to get it published and I feel that this might be the biggest challenge of all. I want to give the book the best chance it can get and for that I need to get the novel professionally edited, commission artwork and create a website. Dwarfhammer is to be edited in October, the artwork completed in November and the final pitch to publishers finalised in December. I have chosen good people to edit and illustrate and this costs money. The editing is $A780 and the artwork is $A500+. My Kickstarter budget is $A800 to get the project off the ground. You can join the campaign to have Dwarfhammer published by chipping in for the artwork. We need the images of Tolly, Luki and Arn to fill the front cover of the book and to inspire the website. What will these three feisty young dwarves look like?",

  "I'm a photographer from Salem, Oregon and I'm looking to expand my portfolio. What better way to expand my portfolio than taking beautiful pictures of earth from up above. I plan on sending a camera 100,000 feet above the earth to capture some amazing photos. I'm raising funds to help pay for the helium, weather balloon, and tracking device. I'll share my photos with everyone who can help make this possible.\u00a0",

Up to this point I have only had a camera on my phone.\u00a0 If I had a good DSLR Camera, I could really take some great pics! Even requests! Not out to really make money just to share my photos with the world! Who knows it just might turn into something more.\u00a0 I love taking photos. This is how I capture my life and the people I share it with. It's almost a history of my life. I just want to make sure the pics last though the ages!",
  "The one thing in my life that gives me joy and makes me forget everything else is my photography. I have no training and I've been told I have a natural eye. Im a single mother of a 10 year old boy. Im also disabled and have been for the last 25 years. Once upon a time I really didnt have alot to look forward to because I battled pain on a daily basis because of an allergy to pain meds I was really given no comfort. Then a few years ago I was given a nice camera and discovered I love photography. While I took pictures the pain I was always in didnt seem so bad. I also realized there is so much beauty seen through the lens of a camera and you can capture nature's emotions in such a startling way. My love and passion for photography ended in heartbreak when a passerby stole my camera bag from our luggage as we were distracted checking in to a hotel. Im looking to replace them hopefully before the summer is over so I can get back to picture taking. My Galleries for my photography are below.",
  "Ephie & Celia Risho invite you to join them on an epic journey with their first young-adult novel Phoenix Rising, book one of The Elementalists series. The father/daughter team have worked 2 1/2 years through numerous revisions to bring this adventure to life. With the critical eyes of writers\u2019 groups, editors, artists and a supportive family they are excited to welcome you on this journey. A strange creature attacks Amber\u2019s village and burns one of the fields. Amber bravely goes on a quest to find the creature and learn how to stop it. But the journey turns out to be far more important than she ever imagined.\u00a0 This book is not only a good story about heroism, it\u2019s a great way to support young authors and readers. This platform for releasing the book is our chance to get the book into your hands where the normal publishing world has so many roadblocks. We were able to work with the kinds of artists we wanted to, and bring exactly the right kind of story at the right time.\u00a0 And we are so grateful for your interest! With you, this story becomes a shared experience we can all appreciate. As we continue to bring future books in the series to you, we can all journey together!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It all started when Celia started reading voraciously and said to me one evening, \u201cDad, we should write a book together!\u201d It turned out she had lots of ideas, and they quickly took shape. At our bedtime routines she\u2019d say, \u201cDad! Did you write the next chapter yet?\u201d To which I would be thrilled if I\u2019d made the time the night before or in between things to eke it out. As I read to her she'd correct words or ideas. \u201cNot like that, Dad, like this!\u201d She made it funnier and the characters more colorful. I recently looked back at the notes from our first brainstorming session and laughed. The story has some of the core ideas from that time, but took a completely different arc in the end, with many layers, intrigue, and the potential for at least five books in the series. After sharing it out with numerous family and friends and seeing the story grow, we took it to a writer's group. Every step it became a better book. In the summer of 2019 we found our editor, Ann Castro. Little did we know, Ann would guide us in transforming our book from its simple form into a work of art! The editing process was tough for Celia, since she was less involved, so we focused on book two. Editing book one while simultaneously writing book two turned out to be a lot of work \u2014 late nights, early mornings, writing on an iPad on business trips 20,000 feet above the continent. Now, we're finally ready to release book one to all of you! This has been one of the most rewarding things I\u2019ve ever done in my life, and we haven\u2019t even published it yet! I\u2019m excited to share these books with all of you. I see them not just as good stories, but a glimpse into what\u2019s possible. As the characters have come to life, I've related to each one of them, and they've become like friends. I admit that there was a time or two when I used the characters\u2019 bravery as examples when parenting Celia. \u201cDo you really think that\u2019s a good choice? What do you think Amber would do in this situation?\u201d LOL. I feel guilty now writing this down \u2014 using a fictional character as an example. But that\u2019s the power of a good story, isn\u2019t it? It should change our lives. It\u2019s certainly changed ours. \ud83d\ude09\u00a0\u00a0 Ephie (dad) has been writing his whole life, inspired by his sixth grade teacher to write a story every week. He enrolled in the writing program at his undergrad Middlebury College and has been writing ever since. He loves the outdoors, music, community, his family and telling stories. He\u2019s lived in Vermont, British Columbia, Costa Rica, and at the time of writing this book, beautiful Bozeman, Montana where he works in software development. Celia (daughter) is an avid book lover, and packs a novel with her wherever she goes. She developed the book idea at age nine inspired by a writing assignment. She was born in Vancouver, Canada where her first two syllable word was \u201chockey\u201d! She and her brother are being raised in the mountains of Montana, where she enjoys sewing, 4H, performance art, and visiting hot springs. At the time of this writing, not only are five books in this series planned, a whole new series is partially formed in her mind!\u00a0 Choosing self-publishing has allowed us to work with the artists and editor who we\u2019ve selected, and to release our book in the way we want \u2014 straight to you! It also has with it our own share of taking on the costs. We\u2019re hoping this Kickstarter will take the edge off of some of what we\u2019ve put into it, as well as cover the costs of buying copies to autograph.\u00a0 In addition to printing costs and shipping, the other costs have totaled about $6,000, including: Thank you for supporting an amazing story about heroism, and the young authors and readers of this book. We are sincerely grateful for your interest! With you, this story becomes a shared experience we can all appreciate.\u00a0 We would be so grateful if you would share this with your friends. The only way we can continue writing sustainably is if these books are well-read.\u00a0 We invite you to join us on this journey! We\u2019ll be providing blog-style updates which you can sign up for at theelementalists.net. Until then...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And a little laugh ...",

(Follow the project on the website blog) www.aburningmanportraitproject.com  \u201cWelcome Home.\u201d These are the first words you here when you arrive at \nthe gates of Burning Man. It is a Home like no other, transporting it\u2019s \neager participants into a world unknown and incomprehensible to \noutsiders. Participants are released from the bonds of their daily \nlives. They are free to express themselves in all manner of ways \ncreative, bizarre and joyful.  \n\tThe experience of Burning Man can be life-changing for many people, and\n is at the very least, profound and extraordinary. It is almost \nunimaginable what is created out there in a temporary city of art and \nlavish experience, literally in the middle of nowhere, in the dust, wind\n and heat. However what truly creates this event is the people. Burning \nMan is at its core an event created by incredible people willing to \nbrave the harshest of environments to bring their particular form of \ncreation and expression to the community, to truly let their hair down, \nrecreate themselves and share an experience that can be had no where \nelse on the planet. It is these people that participate in this glorious\n act of communal creation that inspired me to create \"Welcome Home: a Burning Man \nPortrait Project*.\" A Burning Man Portrait Project* is an art project including a series of \nexhibited paintings and an art book, the creation of which will be \nchronicled by a blog and a short documentary video. This project will be\n funded by your generous donations. Follow the project from start to finish on the website blog. Thank you for supporting the Arts. Project Details: (a more detailed description can be read on the website) What is a Burning Man Portrait Project? A Burning Man Portrait Project is a multi-phase art project by professional fine artist Marie Vlasic consisting of an  \n\tArt Exhibit (paintings), \n\tBlog/Website, \n\tBook, & \n\tVideo    Art Exhibit (paintings)  \n\tThe Portrait Project is a series of paintings of the \u201cChildren of \nthe Dust\u201d, the people of the Burning Man community. The people at the \nevent are very unique, not just in their commonly outrageous dress (or \nundress) but their countenance, their demeanor, is unique to the event.\u00a0\n It is my intention to focus on the individual, to capture them by \nvisually separating them from the over-stimulating surroundings by a \nwhite backdrop. The \u201cmodels\u201d will be photographed on-site, and the \npaintings will be created from these photographs during the year \nfollowing the event. A solo show of the paintings has been scheduled at \nWalker Fine Art in Denver in September 2012. (more gallery exhibits TBA)\n The opening night of the exhibit will be an event in itself, giving \nvisitors a taste of Burning Man (see website for more details)   Blog/Website  \n\tThe entire process of a Burning Man Portrait Project, from beginning to end, \nwill be written about and photographed in a blog which will be part of \nthe website dedicated to the project. Portions of the blog will be \nprinted in the book\u00a0 \u201cWelcome Home, a Burning Man Portrait Project\u201d* (see \nbelow)  Book  \n\tI will create a quality art book of the project, which will include \nimages of the paintings, photos of the preparation and the event, as \nwell as excerpts from the project blog.

  "As a child I went on many boat trips around the world heritage site on the south coast of England, known as the Jurassic Coast. One eventful day the boat was brushed by a huge, slow beast of the ocean. Natural inclination to think \"great white\" were quickly removed when my uncle corrected me in announcing it was a basking shark. Clueless, and nervous, I got home and leafed through my children's encyclopaedia to discover more. 20 years on, I am still fascinated by this graceful, harmless dinosaur of the sea and have spent many a summer in search for more sightings (with many successful trips). Now in 2014 the species is on the conservation vulnerable list, I need to increase awareness of its plight and kick start a project that can help protect it. Your pledge will go towards diving and photographic equipment that will capture the glory of these magnificent creatures. Your reward will be personal satisfaction that you have played a part in increasing the awareness of the basking shark and it's future plight.\u00a0",
  "I am a trained and licensed EMT and Fire Fighter that has looked for ways to diversify myself from others in the field. One day I took a Discover Scuba Diving class to see if that would be a route that I would want to take in my career... and then it happened.. I fell in love with it! I have never been so relaxed and happy in my life till i was under the water in that class... but because money is tight after paying the bills, I can not afford to take the certification class. My other hobby evolved photography usually the nature kind. After working for the Walt Disney Co. in and around animals, I became a fan of nature photography and all the wonders that come with it. Not only would I be able to use the training to help show the wonders of nature in photos and contribute to everyones knowledge of this eco system that is slowly eroding away.. but I can use it in my Fire and EMS career to help others in need\u00a0 This KickStarter campaign is two fold.... First its to assist me in getting certified in SCUBA and secondly to buy photography equipment that I can use while under the waves looking at the beauty that. it holds.",
  "Mal has been training for almost a year to be a dream guardian, but even still he's ill-equipped to deal with what's coming. There is a new power in the Dreamscape, an ancient force tearing through the Cloud Runners and Whispers, without prejudice.\u00a0 He shouldn't get involved, but Mal and his friends have a habit of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The mystery in the Dreamscape is going to reveal a long lost secret and will set in motion events that will lead to a dream war. \u00a0Mal Winter and the Last Titan is the epic continuation of Mal's adventures, but even if he survives, he will be forever changed. When you sleep, your soul ascends to the Dreamscape and you experience dreams. But there are Nightmares in the 'Scape, demons hungering to devour your very essence.\u00a0 Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners is our introduction to the dream world. We meet Mal and learn about the Dreamscape, the Nightmares, the Cloud Runners, and his father's connection to it all.\u00a0 It's worth noting that any reward that includes Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners will be the revised edition of the book. Although there are no major changes in this edition, it has been proofed and edited for an improved reading experience.\u00a0 Mal Winter and the Last Titan is the second book in the Mal Winter saga, but not the last. The complete series includes a total of six books; the next one titled: Mal Winter and the Lucid Eye. \u00a0 Mal Winter and the Last Titan is Danny's second book, and he's excited to share the second adventure of Mal Winter. Danny has written numerous screenplays, including one that produced a feature film in rural Australia. He's won various writing competitions and been published in some literary magazines.\u00a0 You'll always find Danny writing...well when he's not reading or drawing or playing Xbox.\u00a0 This is Danny's first Kickstarter campaign.\n\u00a0 Please see a couple of the completed revised chapters of Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners.\u00a0 View Sample Chapters Here As Mal Winter and the Last Titan is still being edited I won't share those chapters yet. But, I hope to update this page with some chapters during the campaign so you can get a sense of the story and characters and writing! We've designed the rewards to be very simple, and you can use the following chart to ensure you get the right book. All print books will come signed by the author, and all backers will get their name in the print and ebook. Shipping is not included in the above prices. So please ensure your name is correct when ordering. *Any preorder with Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners will include an updated revised version of the book. Although the story and characters will remain the same, the book has been re-edited to read better. As I'm based in Australia, shipping is a bit prohibitive around the world. However, I have calculated shipping in most cases at cost, or less. If you're shipping costs are too much, following the Kickstarter, both Mal Winter and the Last Titan and the revised Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners will be available to be delivered around the world through Amazon, Book Depository, and anywhere good books are sold. For reaching 115%, all physical book orders will get a Charli themed bookmark, with a tassel, you can see the art below. Final bookmark artwork may vary. So, why Kickstarter? What a strange choice it might seem. Well, there are a few reasons.\u00a0 1) Flexible Preorder Tiers I wanted a simple platform that would help me take preorders for my new book Mal Winter and the Last Titan. And, there weren't many that would allow me the flexibility I needed to offer the combinations I have. Kickstarter's tiered pledging, allowed me to offer what I thought might be some great ways to get the book.\u00a0 2) Maximum Reach Kickstarter is a global platform, which could mean potentially reaching new readers. What Kickstarter does is offer a chance to be seen by not only friends, family, and existing readers, but the world.\u00a0 3) Better percentages Amazon has become one of the best channels for my book in recent months, but, in all honesty, they get over half the money. Which is fine, because they're a massive international network. But it also means I typically make less than a dollar a book. (Not complaining, I set the margin really low so it's affordable!) Kickstarter only take a small percentage, so it means I can sell the books for cheaper, and make hopefully more than $1 per book!",
  "Crownby started almost a year ago today with a conversation. My little sister was in middle school at the time and I had called her to ask about how school was going. She confided in me that she didn\u2019t like being herself \u2013jaw drop. I thought, \"Here is this fiery little, redhead/bookworm/future president of the United States and gosh dang it, she doesn't know how amazing she is!\"\u00a0 I needed something to show my little sis how amazing and worthy of her own love she was. I needed her to see what I saw when I looked at her, a Queen. And I also realized she had to be the one to come to that realization. That's when I started\u00a0developing Crownby. Look, we all struggle with self love. Gosh dang, wouldn't it be nice to have something and someone to guide and support us on one of the most important endeavors we can make? Wouldn't it be amazing to support the girls and women we love by sending them a gift this meaningful? I have absolutely loved creating Crownby. I have loved being part of something so meaningful and good. Creating this program has been and still is my self-love journey. It's changed the way I treat myself and helped me conquer some tough fears. Our mission as a company is to 1) help you 'Crown your inner Queen' and 2) for you to help others do the same. When you see yourself as a Queen, we want you to turn to the woman next to you and make sure she is wearing her crown too.\u00a0 We want to invite you to join us in our mission and be part of this Queen community. I\u2019m asking you to help fund our first bulk order of programs and get some Queens crowned. We appreciate all the support and love we have received so far. We're excited to ship our first programs out.\u00a0 -Queen Adley For four months I spent my time personally researching self-love. I compiled a preliminary four weeks' worth of self-love challenges and sent it into the world to have it reviewed by therapists, life coaches, and other women and teenage girls. I wanted this program to truly make a difference for women and girls on their self-love journeys. I sent out developmental programs to friends/volunteers. I collected feedback, adjusted, and sent it out again. Finally after nearly a year of adjusting and sourcing this is our Program. Our mission is to help you build a better relationship with yourself. We do that by challenging you in FOUR different areas of self-love.\u00a0 WEEK ONE\u00a0 CHALLENGES INCLUDE: WEEK TWO\u00a0 CHALLENGES INCLUDE: WEEK THREE CHALLENGES INCLUDE: WEEK FOUR CHALLENGES INCLUDE: Here's a detailed layout and description of what we include in our boxes. Why do we need your help here on Kickstarter? Our program consists of a combination of products, packaging materials, and printing. When ordered separately or in small quantities Crownby becomes quite expensive. By ordering in bulk we lower the cost of our program significantly for our Queens. \u00a0We need your help to fund our first bulk order. Products & Packaging: We need to fund\u00a0100 programs' worth of products and packaging supplies for our our first bulk orders. Workbook Publishing: We need funding to place an order for 100 printed Crownby Workbooks\u00a9.",
  "THE STORY In the distant future, the gods have judged humanity, stripping them of their sapience. With humanity's forbidden knowledge locked away, many of the earth's beasts have risen with their own cultures and myths. Far to the north, in the great Greentide Forest, rests the remote village of Dreymoot. The squirrels of Dreymoot have been story-keepers for centuries, content to live vicariously through the gathered lore of the great continent.\u00a0 Yet one squirrel longs to leave his cloistered existence. To experience the magic and mystery that lies beyond the safety of the forest. Join Hackberry as he journeys far from his home, driven to seek his long-lost father, and caught up in a struggle for power that will shape the future of his world.\u00a0 SOME BACKGROUND INFO I've written several books in the past: some nonfiction books on spirituality and politics as well as one children's book called A Wolf at the Gate that was critically well received (and a lot of fun to write).\u00a0 I wrote A Wolf at the Gate for my son, Jonas. Back in those years, he was a cuddly little tyke. At bedtime, he'd nestle into my shoulder as I'd tell him stories. Sometimes, I'd read them. But often, I'd share stories of my own devising.\u00a0 Many of those stories featured a bold squirrel named Hackberry. As Jonas aged, the stories developed and deepened. Soon, the stories would wander away from our bedtime ritual and haunt my waking thoughts. Often, I'd find myself lost in imagination, thinking of Hackberry's world and the numerous characters who inhabit it.\u00a0 Now that Jonas is nearly twelve, I've decided that now is the time to finish my first Hackberry novel. I'm writing it for Jonas and older children everywhere\u2014for those entering young adulthood in uncertain times.\u00a0 One might think that stories about talking animals would be geared towards little children. But anyone who has ever read Watership Down knows better. Over the years, the adventures of Hackberry have become more complex and dark. No longer quaint stories for a cuddly kindergartner, these are stories that speak to the challenges of our own world. The best of fantasy (especially young adult fantasy) not only helps us escape into an imaginary world, but equips us to be clever and brave in our own.\u00a0And that requires a level of honesty about the world that, ironically, can rarely be found outside of fiction.\u00a0 ANTICIPATED BOOK LENGTH This will end up around 250-300 pages long (55,000 to 67,000 words). If everything goes well with the book, it will be the first of a series of a minimum of four book.\u00a0 INFLUENCES In a review of A Wolf at the Gate, Kirkus said that I write with \"sharp, muscular prose.\" Stylistically, that would put me in the company of writers like Melville, McCarthy, and Hemingway. It is true: I try to use words economically. I want to to paint pictures with action and context rather than furnishing my books with long descriptions.\u00a0 As a writer, though, I focus more on story than craft. A good story adequately written sticks with me far longer than an adequate story written well. In this particular case, the tales of Hackberry are heavily influenced by Walter M. Miller Jr's A Canticle for Leibowitz, Richard Adams' Watership Down, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books, and Norse mythology. I am also influenced by Tolkien and Lewis, sometimes in spite of myself.\u00a0 WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?\u00a0 We did it! The project is funded. In the past 24 hours, I've been bombarded with support for this project. To keep the momentum going, I've added some stretch goals. This will give you a sense of what any money above and beyond the initial goal would go towards.\u00a0 What's a stretch goal? From Kickstarter's FAQ: \"A stretch goal is a funding target set by the project creator beyond the original Kickstarter goal. Stretch goals as a term and a practice emerged from the Kickstarter community as a way for creators to 'stretch' beyond the initial, official goal of the Kickstarter project and raise more money (and often make cooler stuff!). Funds are collected whether stretch goals are met or not, as long as the project has met its Kickstarter funding goal.\" More money means that I can get better design help, offer a higher-quality printing of the book, and offer cooler rewards to backers. So, if you'd like to make the book even better, here are some new stretch goals:",
  " Hello friend, I enjoy making art. Perhaps \"enjoy\" isn't a strong enough word, I love making art. My life's goal is to be able to support myself through artwork and as of right now I am closer to my life's goal than I have ever been before and it feels absolutely wonderful. I need a small bit of help, though. A tiny boost. This is why I come to you on Kickstarter.    I'm here to ask for a couple of months of time. Time to create and paint and live. In return for your generosity and leap of faith, you'll receive a one of a kind piece of art I've made. In short, you would be purchasing a piece of artwork in advance. I could use your favorite colors or subjects in the painting or make it a surprise, whatever you like.   The price of the postage is included in the pledge. Here is a link to my Tumblr account. I've posted hundreds of paintings and other artworks on there as to give you a better idea of my style. Acrylics are my strong point so I use them for most of my work.    On a side note, if successful, this campaign will also allow me the time to keep creating a series of art videos which I've titled \"Arting with Jim\" . The link goes to episode 1 which is about colorblindness. I hope to expand the series to include fun projects that people can do at home very inexpensively and sharing tips and tricks I've learned about working with different materials. I hope to make them funny as well. These videos don't cost money, they just take time. Precious precious time.   Thank you very much for reading about my Kickstarter campaign. Please feel free to message me with any questions or concerns you may have. Thank you again. Love, Jimmy",
  "This is the sequel to the wildly successful Kickstarter The Empress and the Archer: The Empress' Quest book 1. I am delighted to be here today sharing this with you. I have learned a lot since last year's venture. Almost all of the work needed to get published is accomplished, all that is left is to raise the money. I look forward to hearing from people who backed us last year, and to meeting many more.",
  "We think that... everyone should smell like meat! We firmly believe that the aroma of freshly cooked bacon should linger long after breakfast and that meaty and clean go hand in hand. That's how we arrived at Meat Soap. By using animal byproducts that are typically discarded as main ingredients in bars of soap, we are looking to change minds about what \"clean\" means. A variety of fats will be rendered by our crack team of fat melters to create a rainbow of colors, scents, and flavors (but don't eat Meat Soap, no matter how tempting!) Our plan is to design and fabricate a custom soap mold to produce our collection of butcher paper-wrapped soaps. We hope to spark a lively debate about personal hygiene and meat consumption, while resurrecting the tradition of using animal-based resources to their fullest potential. We think clean people should smell like bacon, not like mint or roses. We must raise enough money to pay to for a set of soap molds from a custom mold producer out of Portland, Oregon. Once we hit our funding target we'll procure the molds, melt some fat, and develop our bars of soap. Producing the custom molds will cost a minimum of $500, so the more bars of soap people request, the lower the cost of the soap! We'll order the raw materials for our soap (assorted meat fat to render and glycerin soap base) and we'll manufacture enough soap to keep you lathered in protein! Then we'll lovingly wrap each bar with butcher paper and send it to you! Don't mind the grease stains, they add character! FAQ Is it safe?\nEr... probably? Meat Soap has not been tested on animals but we've been washing our hands with our prototypes. Since Meat Soap contains no preservatives it won't last forever, and for the love of Mike DO NOT TRY TO EAT IT NO MATTER HOW DELICIOUS IT SMELLS. What's with the stickers?\nWe want you to stick our cute piggy logo on everything. We're looking at making them scratch n' sniff to smell like bacon if possible, but otherwise they'll be awesome vinyl stickers for you to treasure! What do these shirts look like, anyway?\nCheck out PROJECT UPDATE #3. Wait - if I pledge $400 you'll buy a PIG?\nYes. We'll buy a pig through Heifer International to help make someone's life better! What happens if you don't get funded?\nThen your pledge will not be charged and Meat Soap will fade into a tragic cloud of obscurity and darkness forever. What if I'm a Vegetarian?\nWell, some of us like plants a little more than others. But you can still get some Meat Soap! That way you'll smell like meat without needing to eat it!",
  "The first two editions were held with a limited budget raised through a Crowdfunding campaign and with the support given on a local level. Nevertheless, the result was very successful and of cultural relevance, mixing screenings, concerts, workshops, and exhibition.\u00a0 Once again this year we decided to rely on Kickstarter, since we are too small to apply for institutional funds at this stage and also we want to maintain the festival completely independent.\u00a0 We decided to increase the goal we want to reach since we are working on introducing new categories and new activities to the program, developing it on three days and giving more room to music.

  "I want to go to Vermont next spring and ART my heart out. This is my first opportunity to go to a residency like this. I will be free of distractions and get to focus my work on a big project. I will have an entire month to delve into myself in a place where others understand. I will attend artist lectures weekly, have studio visits, and access to a Life Drawing Model. This is a huge step for me as an artist. I am trying to become more self sufficient - to get out of the service industry struggle. The project I want to work on involves a series of drawings. I want to create a story that will be part of an installation I make after the residency. I will experiment with fabric, found materials, and my favorite of adhesives, Hot Glue. The money will be used for the remaining cost of the residency. I received an artist grant ($850), and will be doing dishes as a work exchange($600.) Any money donated above the funding amount will be used for art supplies and travel to Vermont. If you are interested in more than one reward - bid the combined amount in the higher reward category. I will make it work: example - for a t-shirt and an animal drawing bid $85 in the drawing category and send me a comment.

  "My name is Keely, and I'm an artist who specializes in the mediums of scratchboard, printmaking, and painting. I draw a great deal of my inspiration from dreams, the night sky, and long, brilliant winters. This winter, I have been accepted as an artist in residence in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, in Norway. Svalbard is an archipelago located midway between mainland Norway, and the North Pole. It is located between the 74\u00b0 to 81\u00b0 north latitude, making it one of the most northerly places one can live on this planet. My residency is for a period of approximately two months beginning in the height of winter so that I may fully experience the polar night, and make work inspired from the dreams that spring from it. The money donated to this project would be used to offset the cost of the plane tickets out to such a remote location from my current location of Seattle, WA. Donations would also be used for art supplies, food costs, rifle rental for safety as I hike outside of Longyearbyen (polar bears are common), fees, and other daily living expenses out and about in Svalbard. Donations would be happily compensated. Small donations would be compensated with personalized postcards from Longyearbyen or Ny-\u00c5lesund. Original drawings would be given for more substantial donations (subject matter is likely to include polar bears, northern lights, and glaciers), and I would deliver full original scratchboard pieces for the most generous of gifts. I can only give out a few of the full finished pieces, because I wish to have a full body of work when I return. Any gift would be gratefully received.",

  "The Boston Underground Film Festival (BUFF) labors year in and year out to bring exceptional films from all over the world to the Boston area each March. BUFF celebrates unconventional stories, idiosyncratic voices, fever dreams, nightmarish visions, and all manner of cinematic forms, in service of an audience ravenous for an annual sensory bacchanalia from beyond the mainstream. BUFF returns to Harvard Square's historic Brattle Theatre from March 21-25, 2018 for our 20th edition, with plans to make this year's program the most insane and provocative yet, but we need the support of our fans and community to make it happen! In the past, the festival has been able to survive on the generosity of sponsors. However, cash sponsorship has evaporated over the last few years, and we rely on the contributions of generous donors to help soften the blow of rental costs, printing and advertising, accommodating our attending feature filmmakers, and creating a vibrant, welcoming space for filmmakers to connect with one another and our fantastic audience. Unfortunately, this city is not getting any cheaper for struggling volunteer cineastes who just want to show some love to underappreciated and overlooked films and filmmakers. BUFF has a successful twenty-year history of bringing fantastic cinema to an audience ravenous for a moviegoing experience outside the mainstream. We have also helped to nurture homegrown talent by creating a space to celebrate and support New England horror, animation, and independent filmmakers. Over the years, we've hosted such guests as Suzanne Ciani, Gabriel Bartalos, Jeremy Saulnier, Don Coscarelli, Bill Plympton, George Romero, Lloyd Kaufman, Frank Henenlotter, Lucky McKee, Angela Bettis, the late George Kuchar, and Mink Stole.\u00a0\u00a0 BUFF has also managed to give Boston audiences face time with such visionary contemporary filmmakers as Jason Eisener, Douglas Buck, Simon Rumley, Zach Clark, Karim Hussain, Alex Ross Perry, Anna Biller, and Ann Marie Fleming. We want this year's BUFF to continue with our tradition of bringing filmmakers face-to-face with an appreciative audience. We are reaching out to our audience to help lend support by buying festival passes early through this Kickstarter campaign. Your support now gives us the cashflow we need to bring in as many guests as we can, plus it helps us to underwrite the legendary parties we put together in celebration of fantastic films, filmmakers, and you\u2013yes, you\u2013our unspeakably incredible audience. Any form of support, great or small, is always welcome; every penny raised helps us immensely! \u00a0\"BUFF is a terrific festival! Great audience! Great staff! Screening there was a delight. I can't wait to return!\" \u2013 Don Coscarelli, Director of Phantasm, John Dies at the End \"Multiple Academy Award-winning filmmaker Ang Lee once said, 'I try to please everyone.'

  "It's my belief that stay at home fathers are underrepresented in current film and television. So I decided to do something about it and wrote a feature length screenplay called SURPRISE DIVORCE. I'm raising funds to attend the Catalina Film Festival, September 27-October 1st. It's the ideal opportunity to network with industry executives and hopefully connect with and sell my screenplay. Festival attendance and networking are the next necessary steps to successfully sell this screenplay. Several years ago I was complaining to my late father that I was not able to attend a Festival for Acting. My dad recommended raising funds on Kickstarter, and I poo poo'd it. He believed I had plenty of friends who would help when and where I need it. So I'm finally taking his sage advice and reaching out. Surprise Divorce is a story of a stay at home father/husband (Kevin) caught off guard by his wife\u2019s (Anne) desire to end their lengthy marriage. Kevin is forced to confront divorce from the perspective of a traditional \u201chousewife\u201d. Having no job or preparation to step into \u201cthe real world\u201d the screenplay follows him as he gets back on his feet, works through his pain and comes out the other side. Using therapy, laughter, and tears he makes his way through the modern world\u2019s new sexual politics. Politics that still view a stay at home father\u2019s work as not a real job. Surprise Divorce examines love, family, and divorce in a modern world that is slow to adapt to its new realities. Surprise Divorce has been quite successful on the festival circuit. To date this is a listing of the screenplay\u2019s accomplishments: \n\n\u00a0 Wins:  \n\u00a0 Surprise Divorce is a Finalist in the following Film Festivals: Catalina Film Festival, Windy City Film Festival, Short Stop International Film Festival, The Golden Script Competition, and Peachtree Village International Film Festival. It is also an Official selection in these Film Festivals: Feel The Reel Film Festival, London Independent Film Awards, Finish Line Script Competition, Oaxaca FilmFest, The European Independent Film Awards, Filmmakers International Screenwriting Awards with award notifications pending.  Any funds above and beyond the original request will support my attendance at additional festivals as well as script submissions to new festivals.",
  "With the famous fossil hunter Roy Chapman Andrews as inspiration, I too have had several different jobs at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, from administration to diorama painter to janitor! For the past 3 years I have traveled to Marfa, Texas, where I have shown my paintings and drawings at Eugene Binder Gallery. My current jackrabbit paintings are collectively titled \"No Man\u2019s Land.\" This work is influenced by the Southwest and rooted in the natural history of animals that exist in large numbers, with consideration of the unknowable nature of the animals\u2019 instinctual motives within their environment. Throughout my time working on these paintings, I\u2019ve started to consider the prehistory of environment and organism and the awesome improbable questions of our unknown future. My diorama projects and a recent trip to the South African Bushveld (a similar environment to Southwest Texas) have inspired me to look back, and learn more about the geology of the Permian Basin area. The Concept: A Collage of Past and Present During the Permian period shallow seas covered much of what is dry land in present-day Southwest Texas millions of years ago. Referencing a 1960\u2019s diorama of the Permian Sea from the American Museum of Natural History along with a diorama from the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland, TX, an invented landscape will be fabricated in the back of a cargo trailer. This artwork installation will be what I call a \u201cportable landscape\u201d and the first in the series. My goal is to connect the ancient to the present environment with the people living in Marfa, Texas, and the surrounding area, and call forth the primordial sense one feels while traveling through this land. The Construction: The overall structure will be a standard 6ft x 10ft cargo trailer centered in the gallery. Like looking through the viewfinder of a camera, a window will be cut into the side exposing an intimate underwater scene diorama. A painted ultramarine blue-green background, a three-dimensional foreground with objects and a proscenium will be constructed inside the trailer creating an ancient oasis, and offer sun-drenched viewers refuge as well as a look into the past. The seabed landscape will be barren incorporating a variety of casted and real fossils including brachiopods collected in the area. Today, these fossils continue to lie buried underground waiting to be discovered and maybe even owned! The Catalogue: The deep Southwest is often associated with journey, distance and space, survival and dehydration, borders and ownership, roadside Americana, aliens, religion, fossil hunting, crude oil, cattle ranches, freedom and exploration. An artist catalogue titled \u201cField Companion\u201d will accompany the work and illustrate a behind-the-scenes look at the artist\u2019s \u201cidea-prospecting\u201d with the intent to arouse the nostalgic and sometimes possessive powers that these ideas can evoke in people. What Your Donations will cover: -The cost of a cargo trailer (used or new)\n-Lumber and construction supplies and lighting\n-Sculpture and painting supplies\n-Printing fees for the artist catalogue What the Artist has Up to Date: - A venue: Eugene Binder Gallery, Marfa, Texas, opening date: October 8, 2010.\n- Workshop and space to complete the project including tools.\n- Labor\n- Living accommodations\n- Fossils, molds, drawings, photos, research, books (etc)\n- Completed electronic copy of the catalogue\n- Transportation",

Any other eleven-year-old kid might flip past a hand-drawn picture if they found it in a textbook. But not Drew Daley. When he discovers a detailed drawing tucked away in his science book, his entire life changes. He finds himself seeing everything differently and caring about things in a way he never did before. Drew becomes determined to find the artist, but with the list of names inside the front cover of his book as his only clue, the search isn\u2019t an easy one. He encounters overbearing teachers and bullies, broken windows and promises, and even death and destruction.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0 On top of all that, Drew has to navigate through fifth grade, where he\u2019s learning some important life lessons: Lies can be more common than the truth, people aren\u2019t always who they seem, and the most complex problems rarely have \u201cright\u201d answers. Through it all, the drawing gives Drew peace of mind and direction. But how far is he willing to go to uncover the identity of the artist? Who is the book for? In a market flooded with otherworldly elements and doomsday scenarios, Detours and Designs will appeal to readers who gravitate toward multi-dimensional characters in realistic situations. ",

My initial Kickstarter goal is larger than my previous campaigns as I hope to cover the cost of multiple pieces upfront \u2013 something that the majority of my Instagram followers also voted for! My funding goal of \u00a31500 will cover the cost of creating the Cinders castle necklace and key chain, the Beauty castle necklace and keychain, \u201cPainting the Roses Red\u201d stud earrings, Symbol of the Gods earrings and the Royal Suite jumbo keychain. This funding goal also includes the cost of Kickstarter fees and the costs of shipping products to you! All earrings will be nickel free in accordance with UK guidelines. Gold plated earrings will all be plated with 22k gold. After this initial funding goal is met, the following stretch goals are: As an incentive for pledging on this Kickstarter campaign, you will receive rewards at the discounted price of \u00a38 per item. After the campaign has finished and the remaining items are listed in the shop, they will range between \u00a310 and \u00a320. By pledging, you will receive your item at an exclusive discounted price! You will also receive your items before any of them make it onto my shop \u2013 at least two weeks before they will be available for general sale. Lastly, you will of course be helping to fund these items! Without active pledging I would not be able to fund the cost of this jewellery collection and your pledges will help to make a dream a reality! * Pledges are not collected from Kickstarter until after the campaign ends giving you opportunity to increase or decrease your pledge throughout the time the campaign is active! Pledge now to secure your items at discounted rates and pay at the end! You will only be charged after the 30th of June. If we don't reach our initial goal you will not be charged!! * After campaigning ends, you will be able to select whichever rewards you would like out of those that have been unlocked. Stretch goals can\u2019t be unlocked without active pledging so if there is a design you want \u2013 make sure you pledge! This will increase the likeliness that goals will be unlocked. To change your pledge tier OR pledge amount; click on \"Manage Your Pledge\". Then click \"Change your pledge\" - this will allow you to change the reward tier or pledge amount All pledges will be sent as standard mail (second class for UK customers, standard international mail for international customers). You will have the opportunity to choose to upgrade your shipping to first class / signed for / tracked during the reward surveys at the end of the campaign! 1. The campaign is due to end on Sunday the 30th of June. 2. After the campaign ends, Kickstarter takes around 14 days to process and send me the funds that have been raised. After receiving the funds I will be able to place an order with my manufacturer\u00a0 3. Manufacturing can take between 3-5 weeks. 4. Once the jewellery arrives to me (approx. mid-late August), I will have to inspect each piece individually for quality. Depending on the quantity funded this could take 3-5 days. 5. I will then add the jewellery to cards / in jewellery boxes and begin packaging! 6. I estimate that, depending on how many pledges are received, the packaging and sending of parcels could take between 1-2 weeks meaning all rewards will be shipped early-mid September I will always remain very transparent about the processes with my manufacturer and will keep anyone who pledges updated if there is changes in the timeline If you would like to check out my shop to see what my final products / style is like, head to:\nwww.alicevitrum.com\nwww.alicevitrum.etsy.com\nwww.facebook.com/alicevitrum \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@alicevitrumapparel on Instagram\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@alicevitrum on twitter\u00a0",
  "This August and September I plan to combine my love for painting, my obsession with bikes, and my affection for all things abandoned and unloved. The resulting contrivance? A two-thousand-mile bicycle-powered painting documentary of America's industrial leftovers, the Rust Belt. Upon completing the trip, I will compile my Rust Belt paintings and drawings into a limited edition of hand-bound books. The Rust Belt is the area in the Northeast U.S. centered around the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. Once America's industrial backbone, the Rust Belt now features deserted factories and depressed local economies. Beginning in the 1970s, this former manufacturing powerhouse experienced severe, and in some areas crippling, economic decline. Many jobs moved to lower-wage areas of the US, to Mexico, and overseas. The exodus left Rust Belt cities littered with empty factories. I will be painting and drawing every day as I ride my way from my hometown in Madison, WI, through the Rust Belt, to New York City. I am biking and camping my way through this area to keep my costs low\u2026and also because I like biking. Like many of the people in the areas I will be traveling through, I don\u2019t currently have many liquid assets, so I need some help to get this ball rolling. I will need to pay for painting and drawing supplies, the shipping costs for mailing my paintings as I finish them, the cost of the book-binding materials, and the occasional meal. In essence, by contributing to my project, you are pre-paying for a piece of art that I will complete in the course of my journey. By ordering a drawing or painting or book or another contribution incentive you can help make my Rust Belt art project possible. Thank you!

  "Hello everyone! My name is Ashley & I run Blk Magic Cat! Thank you for checking out my first kickstarter ever! I\u2019ve been making pins for over a year & have mostly self funded everything. It wouldn\u2019t be possible for me to self fund all of these babies at once & I don\u2019t want them to have to be made months apart.. So I\u2019m hoping with all of your help we can get them all made together!\u00a0 You can follow me on \u00a0Twitter \u00a0& @blkmagiccat in Instagram\u2728 I will fund Eevee myself if needed, consider him to be the first unlocked design! So the initial goal of $400 will be for Flareon, Vaporeon! I didn't want to add them all in case this flops.. $2,000 will need to be raised to fund all\u00a0eeveelutions! I will keep everyone updated when the next one gets unlocked! Shiny versions will be added when we get fully funded!! Shiny Eevee will be unlocked from the start though\u2728 Pledge now, pay later! You won\u2019t get charge until the campaign is over, so if you don\u2019t have the money now but you will then you can hold your spot! If the eeveelutions you want are not unlocked yet pledge anyway! I have high hopes they will all get funded so in the end youll be able to choose the one you want, & if not you can always back out before you are charged. I will keep everyone constantly updated on what designs are unlocked. You can also change your pledge at anytime before the champaign ends!",
  "\u00a0Hello Everyone! I'm Anashi the illustrator/designer and one-woman show behind \u00a0Eriu Studios and also \u00a0Battitude (the bat-themed etsy shop!) I'm an avid animal enthusiast with a fluffy gray cat and two crazy ferrets. I had an intense love of the aesthetically pleasing so couple that with my love of books, comics, anime, video games and basically all things nerdy and...well...how was I NOT supposed to make adorable enamel pins??? You can check out my instagrams for both my etsy shops below: \u2694 art of nashi\u00a0 \u2694 Battitude Shop\u00a0 There are 6 designs in total and there might be a few stretch goals such as vinyl stickers, and other surprise goodies, but these won't unlock until all the pins have!\u00a0 These pins will back at $9 USD and the price with rise to $10 USD each after the kickstarter if any are left! The pins will unlock at the following tiers The main goal is set at the Daenrys Pin and the other 5 designs will unlock as follows: \u2694 Design 1 (Danny)- $200 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 Design 2 (Jon)- $360 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 \u00a0Design 3 (Arya)- $520 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 \u00a0Design 4 (Tyrion)- $680 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 Design 5 (Jamie)- $840 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 Design 6 (Night King)-$1000 \u00a0**UNLOCKED** BOTH STRETCH GOALS REACHED!! Sansa will unlock at $1200 \u00a0**UNLOCKED**\u00a0 The Hound will unlock at $1360 **UNLOCKED** Cersie will unlock at $1520\u00a0 All of the pins feature: \u2694 Sizing that changes with each design (ex Tyrion is the smallest pin) \u2694 Silver/Gold plating \u2694 Hard Enamel finish \u2694 2-3 Pantone matched coloring \u2694 Double Rubber Clutch Fastening \u2694 Each character will have their own individual backing card with personal saying Although I've done my best to show true representation of the colors chosen, there may be slight differences in appearance depending on what monitor/screen you are using to view, and slight differences in how the colors translate from digital drawing to physical pin manufacture. You'll be able to select your pin choice via a survey that will be sent out if the project is fully backed within the time limit and if for any reason you'd like to change your selection before shipping feel free to message me!\u00a0 I came up with the initial idea while out to brunch with my boyfriend. We were having mimosas and discussing the Game of Thrones episodes we had just watched the night before. If you follow me on Instagram, you're aware of how popular my current ferret pins are. Well, because of that, we started discussing what Game of Thrones ferrets may look like. I started with Daenarys and one of the first things I decided was to give her mini ferret-dragons. I ended up doodling this design on a napkin and several weeks later I finalized 6 Game of Thrones Ferret designs!! Everything is ferreted over. The dragons are ferrets. Ghost is a ferret. The sword hilts are ferrets. Ferrets...everywhere... Here are some of my pins from BOTH my Battitude shop and also my Eriu Studios shop to give you an idea of what the final product may end up looking like. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2694 Late May- Kickstarter Launches\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Late June - Kickstarter Ends \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Late June/Early July- Surveys sent out\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Mid July - Kickstarter funds become available\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Mid July - Production order placed\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694Late July - Pins arrive and we will begin packaging and shipping all orders out \u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Late July-Early August- Pins will be delivered to you!\u00a0 For international backers: International parcels are shipped using a Global Advantage Program. This postage method is untracked in order to keep costs low for international backers.\u00a0 Also, please be aware that International backers are responsible for any customs fees their country may ask for, so plan accordingly! \n\u00a0 Pledging towards the campaign is completely risk-free! Payment will not be taken from you until after the campaign is finished and only if it is successful. Pledging via kickstarter helps me raise funds for the manufacture of the pins, including cost of the pin itself as well as backing cards, packaging, shipping materials and kickstarter fees (10%!) \u00a0The reason I produce a little more that necessary in quantities acts as a safety net in case certain designs are more popular than others, and so the pins can also be made available after the kickstarter has ended to the general public! Thinking about changing your pledge? You can click the 'Manage Your Pledge' button on the campaign page, or by clicking your current reward tier and then 'Change Your Pledge'! Here you can change your reward tier to a different reward tier, or you can add on an amount to your tier! Because the pictures shown on the Kickstarter are mock-ups, colors may vary slightly and, If necessary, there may be slight changes in the design to prevent manufacturing problems, but the overall aesthetic and design will stay the same. During and after the Kickstarter, it is my goal to keep things running as smoothly as possible and to keep you regularly updated both here and on my social media. \u2694 If you have any additional questions, feel free to email me at anashi.sterling@gmail.com \u2694",
  "Hello! My name is Brandon Horvath and I am a freelance graphic designer. As an independent designer and fan of enamel pins I have designed a variety of work featuring my own original concepts, some of which have been shared here on Kickstarter! I am excited to once again share a unique collection of enamel pins that with your help, we will together be able to take from concept to reality!\u00a0 Allow me to introduce to you the \u201cFestival of Deities: Enamel Pin Collection\u201d.\u00a0 The world is full of legendary tales and mythical facts, stories of colossal deities and celestial beings are told to inspire as well as celebrate these respective guardians over humanity. This enamel pin collection is based off of one such tale of the Cardinal Animal Deities of ancient mythos, themed around a festival of which they are the guests of honor.\u00a0 The celestial beings known as Byakko the Tiger, Suzaku the Phoenix, Seiry\u016b the Azure Dragon, Genbu the Tortoise, and K\u014dry\u016b the Golden Dragon are the cardinal deities of whom this Kickstarter is about, a design for each cardinal deity has been created in the form of a festival kabuki mask, much like you would see worn by attendees and displayed in booths during said festivals celebrated in Japan, except these are no ordinary masks displayed for all to see. These masks have been created in the likeness of the cardinal deities so that those attending this cardinal festival can show their support for their own chosen guardian.\u00a0 If the Kickstarter reaches it's main goal the mask of the tiger Byakko will be unlocked! Each cardinal deity after Byakko has their own stretch goal and will be selectable as a backer reward upon reaching their respective goal's! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 1: Byakko Mask Enamel Pin (Fully Funded!)\u00a0\u00a0 Byakko the Tiger and Guardian of the West is the first design that has been unlocked through the funding of the base Kickstarter goal!\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 2: Suzaku Mask Enamel Pin (Unlocked at $200)\u00a0 Suzaku the Phoenix and Guardian of the South is the second design that will be unlocked upon reaching the first stretch goal. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 3: \u00a0Seiry\u016b Mask Enamel Pin (Unlocked at $300)\u00a0 Seiry\u016b the Azure Dragon and Guardian of the East is the third design that will be unlocked upon reaching the third stretch goal.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 4 Genbu Mask Enamel Pin (Unlocked at $400)\u00a0 \u00a0Genbu the Tortoise and Guardian of the North is the fourth design that will be unlocked upon reaching the fourth stretch goal.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 5: \u00a0K\u014dry\u016b Mask Enamel Pin (Unlocked at $500)\u00a0 K\u014dry\u016b the Golden Dragon and Guardian of the Center is the fifth design that will be unlocked upon reaching the fifth stretch goal.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Backer Card Design As for the production of the enamel pin's themselves I have already spoken with my manufacturer in order to get the steps towards production ready, things like, costs, shipping, final art decisions, are all things I have been in contact with them about.\u00a0 Once the Kickstarter is finished I will be able to place the order through them and let them do what they do best in creating the enamel pins of this Kickstarter. As this is not my first enamel pin collection I am confident I will be able to reach the goals set forth through this Kickstarter! My goal is to be as efficient as possible through the entirety of the Kickstarter and especially through the production process. Any updates that are shared will be about the final produced enamel pins, sending out backer surveys, and shipping them out to you! With the wonders of social media every little bit helps in getting the word out there about this Kickstarter! Even if you can't back the project sharing it with others is a great way to help this project succeed! Updates will be posted here on Kickstarter as well as on twitter!\u00a0",

  "Local Chicago rock band Kerosene Stars and filmmaker Eden Ames are teaming up to present Indie Tangle, a brand new arts fest seeking to support and expose emerging and independent artists from all across Chicago. The festival will feature the first public release of the official \"Talk Talk\" music video which is also being funded by this project. Saturday | July 23, 2016 | 7:30PM-11:30PM Fulton Street Collective | 1821 W Hubbard St. | Chicago, IL 60622 First and foremost, this is going to be a blast. There will be music, galleries, screenings, drinks, good company... all that jazz. But the cause is important too: we artists go through hell and back to make our visions come to life. And we don't do it for the money. In fact, it often costs a lot more than we make to create our masterpieces. What makes it worth it? You. Your support, recognition and appreciation helps us keep doing what we're doing. It started with a music video-- one that we put time, money and tireless effort into. And now, we\u00a0think it deserves an audience. But finding one is not as easy as you might think. \u00a0\u00a0 When Scott Schaafsma of the Kerosene Stars got in contact with Eden Ames, writer/director/co-producer of the \"Talk Talk\" music video, an ambitious vision was born. A strongly aesthetic storyline featuring a Jekyll/Hyde femme fatale preying on a suspicious detective snowballed into the live action/animated hybrid it is now-- but it didn't stop there. After all, making the video is only half the work. The rest is getting it seen.     This is where we recognized an opportunity to not only fund an expensive vision, but also to gain an audience for it. This is where the idea of an independent arts showcase began. We're not the only ones who deserve some exposure, though. There are so many artists, musicians and filmmakers out there who are putting their heart and soul into their work. These are talented people, people with passion and determination. But sometimes, even that isn't enough to earn recognition or even a paycheck in the highly competitive world of art.",
  "The Charlie Awards Film Festival was founded by Teacher, Wayne McNanny in 1972 and is possibly the oldest student film festival in Canada. The Charlie Awards is a film competition for high school students in the KW region that helps students to discover their creative potential, build their confidence, develop leadership skills, and work collaboratively in teams. Students film everywhere and anywhere, developing a variety of story lines and plots to create dynamic, innovative productions. At the school site the student's films are assessed by a panel of judges. Two films from each school are submitted, previewed by judges and premiered to the public. This year, the films will be presented on April 28, 2016, 7:00 p.m. at the Princess Theatre in Waterloo. The Charlies are judged by media professionals who donate their time to work with the best of the K-W region's young film makers. They help our students improve their filmmaking abilities; they provide editing and production advice and consult on solutions to problems. This year is the 45th Anniversary of The Charlies Awards Film Festival. This year we would like to make this opportunity more rewarding for our students. We would like to offer financial support for placing in the Charlie's. Financial Awards for young directors will help them further develop their projects, have access to more sophisticated equipment and contribute to their future goals in post secondary studies. \u00a0We would like to thank all our judges and volunteers in advance for all their dedication and expertise in coordinating and hosting The Charlies.

  "So hey there, fellow Internaughts.. As I said in my crammed 135 character description.. I'm an Amateur Astronomer from the UK, I have been imaging the stars & planets for 2 years now. I would absolutely love to be able to move up to the next level, which includes such equipment like CCD Astronomic Cameras, Solar Filters, H-Band Filters, an EQ3 Telescope Mount (A mount that tracks the sky, making long exposure images possible) and other general Photographic tools. As of yet it's impossible for me to fund this myself, so I turn to the internet to help me in my time of need. I hope this idea captures the publics interest, I will be sending my images out to pledgers who helped me on my mission. People who pledge larger amounts can instruct me on what to image.. and those who pledge even more will not only receive the images I take & process, but will receive framed photographs, to hang around your home, images you can choose, with frames you can choose.. Basically whatever I can do to make this worth your while, I really hope to hear from some of you guys soon.Thank you so much for reading.. ",
  "I love looking at the night sky. I am already doing this but I find myself very limited with the camera and telescope that I have. If everything goes well, I will get great equipment and provide pictures of the night sky. That would include nebula, planets, galaxies and of course all the UFO's. By UFO's I do and don't mean extraterrestrials but also any unidentified objects. I have 3 objects so far. I am studying so that I can make great un-bunking references so that my pictures are truthfully UFO's. All helpers will by added to my UFO Qu\u00e9bec facebook group page. J'aime regarder le ciel nocturne. Je fais d\u00e9j\u00e0 cela, mais je me trouve tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e avec l'appareil photo et le t\u00e9lescope que j'ai. Si tout va bien, je vais avoir un bon \u00e9quipement et fournir des images du ciel de nuit. Cela comprend n\u00e9buleuse, plan\u00e8tes, galaxies et bien s\u00fbr tous les OVNIS. En OVNI que je veux et ne veux pas dire, c'est des extraterrestres, mais aussi des objets non identifi\u00e9s. J'ai 3 objets jusqu'ici. J'\u00e9tudie donc pour que je puisse faire de grandes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de sorte que mes photos sont sinc\u00e8rement OVNI.\u00a0 Toutes les aides seront ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 ma page groupe facebook UFO Qu\u00e9bec.",

Join us for three days of movies, music, games, art, authors, vendors, and so much more! We're going big this year (much like ol' Wilbur Whateley himself) and attempting all new, original programming in addition to some of the finest Lovecraftian films the world has to offer.\u00a0 But crafting such a unique experience takes some effort, so please excuse the mess and mind the gaps as we set this event up.

  "The Windsor International Film Festival (WIFF) is a cultural, not-for-profit organization whose mission is to recognize and celebrate the art of cinema by showcasing Canadian and international films and filmmakers. Through its exhibition, education, and community development programs, WIFF builds audiences for Canadian content and talent, provides training opportunities for emerging filmmakers, and promotes the creative economy of Windsor and Southwestern Ontario. WIFF is 100% volunteer organized and run. Whether it's Jen and Dorthy in the box office, Min and Alan making sure our films screen on time, Mori programming films, or Martha keeping our books in order, we couldn't bring the festival to you each year without their tireless efforts.\u00a0 The Windsor International Film Festival was founded in 2005 to raise an awareness and appreciation of the art of the moving image by bringing films to Windsor which otherwise would not be seen. Since that time, the festival has grown and expanded from 16 films, 21 screenings, and 2,705 tickets sold in 2005 to 111 films, 182 screenings, and approximately 15,000 tickets sold in 2014. Festivals and Events Ontario has consistently named WIFF one of the top 100 festivals in Ontario.  \n As a cultural, not-for-profit organization, WIFF celebrates Canadian and international films and filmmakers through its exhibition, education, and community development programs. Its unique mandate to provide training opportunities for the local film scene sets it apart from other film festivals. Programs like 48-hour FlickFest, WIFF \u2018Local\u2019, and the Short Film Program convey the grit, passion, and determination of making films, but they also provide invaluable experience for emerging local filmmakers. We want to make your experience at the festival better. We want to bring in more guests, invest in better equipment, and make your experience more comfortable. We need more money to do this. All of the revenues we make go right back into funding the next festival. By backing our Kickstarter we will have the funds to improve your experience of the festival.

  "Here it is. Our website is up! www.cinemaontheedge.com Check out the full schedule, list of venues, list of films, and statement from the directors!\u00a0 Almost there. Here we go!\u00a0 -------- After just one week, you got us to our goal! Wow. Thank you! We are bowled over by your support for the films & filmmakers, your belief in this cause, and your faith in us. We cannot thank you enough.  Since the Kickstarter launch, respected programmers from LA, SF, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, and more, have reached out and asked, can we bring Cinema on the Edge to their cities? So, we're adding new rewards AND a new stretch goal of an additional $5000 (see update #3 for details). Can you help us make this happen? We did it already - let's keep working together to bring independent Chinese films & filmmakers to NYC & beyond! (All of the money that we raise will be spent exclusively to support the Cinema on the Edge screening series in New York City and soon-to-be-announced major cities around the US and Canada.) What Is Cinema on the Edge?\u00a0 We are celebrating the vibrancy, resilience, creativity and courage of the Beijing Independent Film Festival (BIFF) by organizing the first ever \"Cinema on the Edge\" film series.\u00a0 The 2014 edition of BIFF was not allowed to happen. Organizers were detained, screenings rooms were barricaded, filmmakers and festival-goers were harassed and intimidated. With the full cooperation of BIFF, we plan to bring a version of their festival to New York City this August and September. The films shown at BIFF consistently blow our minds - they inspire and challenge us. They've shaped us to be better filmmakers, critics, producers, distributors, curators, educators, even better human beings. Our hope is to introduce audiences to the films we love by showing them at some of NYC's best museums and cinemas.\u00a0 Films in the series include: Who are We?\u00a0 We are producer/distributor Karin Chien, critic/curator Shelly Kraicer, and filmmaker/anthropologist J.P. Sniadecki. We met and became friends in Beijing, while studying, programming, distributing, writing about, co-producing, or co-directing Chinese independent film. We connected over our love of cinema. And we might not be friends without BIFF. J.P. and Karin connected while sharing a long cab ride to the artist village of Songzhuang where BIFF is held. Shelly and Karin bonded over meals while evading harassment by authorities trying to shut down screenings at BIFF. Here is J.P. talking about how BIFF affected him:\u00a0 \u201cMy first time there, I felt\u00a0I had found my tribe: filmmakers, cinephiles, artists, scholars, and students gathering\u00a0together to dive into a week of screenings, discussions, dinners, parties, music performances\u00a0and, inevitably, various encounters with the authorities. Yet BIFF remains a grassroots affair:\u00a0everyone pitches in and interactions flow easily. Our series is trying to keep that ethos alive.\u201d Here is a picture of J.P. doing a Q&A at BIFF 2012, which screened several of his films in a special program. Here's Karin, Shelly, and Shelly's partner Lisa meeting with Xu Tong, director of Cut Out The Eyes. We're in Trainspotting Cafe, a pioneering venue for independent film in Beijing. Their screenings were shut down too. Combined, we have over 50 years of experience making and screening films. BIFF has played a significant role in shaping our professional destinies, and some of our work would not be possible without BIFF. For example, thanks in part to BIFF, Karin co-founded the only distribution company in North America dedicated to releasing independent cinema from mainland China. Also thanks in part to BIFF, Shelly has been a trailblazer bringing Chinese cinema to several Western film festivals, including Rotterdam, Dubai and Vancouver, and has been able to write extensively about Chinese independent cinema. And J.P started a screening series at Harvard to showcase Chinese independent cinema, as well as write his dissertation on Chinese documentary and direct several films in China, including People's Park and Yumen, both showing in this series. This festival has changed our lives, its films have inspired us, and its community has embraced us. This series is a small way for us to support them in turn. Why We Are Doing It Independent films are not allowed to be screened publicly in China. These films are made without approval of the censors and cannot be seen in regular movie theaters. Independent film festivals offer a singular space in China for unauthorized filmmakers to meet with their audiences, and to sustain a concrete, vibrant, alternative Chinese filmmaking community.\u00a0 China's break-neck pace of change has created a class of independent filmmakers who are inventing radical new film languages. It is one of the most exciting places for independent cinema in the world. It's not the same as being there, but here are a few photos to give you a sense of BIFF. Imagine the incredible camaraderie, tight sense of community, excitement around new work, nervous tension about authorities showing up unannounced and you'll have a sense of what it was like to attend BIFF.\u00a0 Since 2012, independent film festivals have been under siege. All have been confronted with government opposition and interference.\u00a0 All but one or two have ceased to exist. All this may be hard to imagine in North America, where you can find film festivals every day of the year showcasing thousands of independent films. Since 2004, the Beijing Independent Film Festival (BIFF) has been the most important venue for unauthorized films in China. Set in the artist village of Songzhuang, BIFF was a rare space where freedom of expression flourished. But in 2014, BIFF was forced to cancel its festival following aggressive police action and physical intimidation. The films in BIFF 2014 were never shown. But they must be seen. With the full cooperation of BIFF, we are organizing a version of the festival in North America. We call the series: Cinema on the Edge: the Best of the Beijing Independent Film Festival 2012-2015. How We Are Doing it After BIFF was shut down in August 2014, our friend/colleague Kevin Lee, while discussing the situation with Karin, mused out loud, \"I wish we could recreate the festival here somehow.\" A year later, we're making that happen. We called our friends and colleagues, those interested in showing risky and groundbreaking cinema. We asked if they wanted to premiere films that couldn't be screened in China. The bold programmers of Anthology Film Archives, Asia Society, Maysles Cinema, Museum of Chinese in America, and UnionDocs said YES. We've scheduled 18 programs of enthralling, provocative, and brilliant films at 5 of NYC's best museums and cinemas. We can't wait for you to see them. But wait. We still need your help! What YOU CAN DO This is a 100% volunteer effort. We need money to bring Chinese filmmakers to the screenings in NYC, and to publish a one-of-a-kind program booklet for the series. Without dialogue and discussing, the screenings are not complete.\u00a0 Your participation will go directly to these 2 much needed items:\u00a0 1. Travel for filmmakers and festival organizers to NYC. This is 80% of our budget. Flights, hotel, and ground transportation to NYC are not cheap! If you've attended a film festival in the past, you know that Q&As and filmmaker talks are what make the screenings special. If funded, we'll be able to fly directors in to attend their screenings. Creating dialogue between filmmakers and audience is a critical part of the festival experience, and one that these filmmakers are often denied in China. 2. Publishing a program booklet to accompany the screenings. We cannot bring every filmmaker to the U.S. A few aren't allowed to travel either. This booklet enables us to include their voices in Cinema on the Edge. We have original quotes from the filmmakers and original essays from scholars. The booklet will also include memorable images from the excitement, both\u00a0onscreen and off, of the past few years of BIFF. If you can contribute, keep in mind, not one penny of the funding will go towards paying us!   If you cannot contribute, you can help by getting the word out. The more times you share this link, the more folks will know about the courageous efforts of BIFF to create, and sustain, a truly independent cinema in China.\u00a0 Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, ie nearly all Western social media, are banned in China. BIFF's website was shut down years ago. Help promote BIFF and Cinema on the Edge on your social networks with these hashtag: #WeWantBIFF and #CinemaontheEdge Independent filmmakers in China are denied an audience. Let's bring an audience to these filmmakers, and celebrate the brilliancy and vibrancy of their work.",

  "I hope you have just watched my Introduction Video to the Creative Minds Program in Cannes, France. This video took a lot of hard work (I hate being in front of the camera) and helped get me admitted into the (highly selective) program which I hope to attend. Here's the whole story: On Wednesday, February 18th, 2015 I went to an info session about the Creative Minds Program based solely off a last minute email and a gut feeling. I figured my ambitious peers would be fighting for this opportunity \u00a0(as is usually the case), but instead I was the only person in the room, which could've been awkward, but it wasn't. I mainly attended the session to find out if there was an opportunity for Financial Aid, as I knew the program would be nearly impossible for me without it. The recruiter was wonderful and let me know that there was aid available. He introduced me to the Program in depth and answered all my questions. There was just over a week left to apply, so it was crunch time, but\u00a0I left the info session feeling like it was fate. I finished my application in time and waited nervously to hear back. When I was admitted, there was no sigh of relief, but an anticipation that was almost worse than not knowing if I got in: can I afford it? I knew that without aid, the answer to that question was no. I finally received a small amount of aid, which I am incredibly grateful for, but it is still an unreachable goal for me and my family alone. And that's where I need your help. My remaining fee for the program is $2,999. The fee covers everything (food, lodging, equipment, festival access) except for Airfare, which is another $1,500 (or more) for a round trip flight. The total cost of the program and transportation - $4,500 - is an amount that I am only familiar with because it is how much my family and I pay for an entire semester at USC, and we couldn't even do that without generous Financial Aid from both the University and the Federal Government.\u00a0 There have been several opportunities that I have not been able to pursue at all due to finances, and others (like college) that I have only been able to pursue with the help of others. This would usually fall into the former category, but I believe with the help of those around me, it will not. Whether you can spare $5 or more, every donation counts and I am beyond grateful for whatever you can offer to help me reach my goal of $4,000.\u00a0 For an idea of the product, please take a look at my visual sample. It is especially relevant to this project because I made it at the Emerging Filmmaker Program - a small town version of The Creative Minds Program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSntUd5eLN0",

A lot of\u00a0women want to \u00a0do these\u00a0kind of photos but fear of family, social or \u00a0workplace \u00a0reaction are\u00a0the reason most of them don't do it.

  "It's unusual for something to affect us all but lockdown did just that. However, we experienced it in different ways. \u00a0I wanted to record my experience photographically whilst making use of what I had. I had numerous Polaroid images that I had taken in the months beforehand- images that represented scenes from my everyday life. I chose to record my experience by placing these Polaroid images in cleaning solutions and removing a few of them each time a restriction was lifted. At this time, cleaning solutions held great significance as we aimed to protect ourselves by sanitising our hands and any goods that came into the house.\u00a0 Once removed, I discovered the images had changed, just as my life had- sometimes in unexpected and beautiful ways. I continued the project through the subsequent lockdowns. I am raising funds to produce a book of these images, which span all three UK lockdowns. Funding will allow me to have the book designed and printed.",

  "Hi, I\u2019m Dan, and I'd love your support in completing Tinker Kitchen, a new maker space for food hackers in San Francisco. It's a great time to be a chef. As an engineer who loves cooking, I\u2019m fascinated by all the new kitchen gadgets and cooking techniques that have become popular over the last few years. Sous vide machines, molecular gastronomy powders, liquid nitrogen ice cream, coffee roasters, fresh pasta extruders. Each time I walk into Sur La Table and Williams-Sonoma, or browse ChefSteps and Kenji Lopez-Alt\u2019s food blog, I find fresh ideas, cuisines, and recipes just waiting to be cooked up. I enjoy cooking in the comfort of my own kitchen. But sometimes I dream of having a fully stocked kitchen, with access to professional cooking equipment that's much larger and more expensive than the tools I own. It\u2019s fun to experiment on my own, but it's way more fun to geek out over recipes, gadgets, and stories with other people who share my love of cooking. So I was inspired to create Tinker Kitchen - a maker space for food hackers to learn and experiment with cooking. Think of Tinker Kitchen as the place where you go to create awesome food, discover new cooking techniques and tools, and train your intuition to come up with original food ideas. I also want it to be a space where you can hang out and share cooking experiences with like-minded food hackers. Tinker Kitchen will build communities of people who love connecting over food. While there are many places where you can learn to cook, they're primarily scheduled classes at fixed times. With Tinker Kitchen, we\u2019re taking a different approach, based on membership. As a member of Tinker Kitchen, you can come anytime you want and hang out, practice your techniques, develop your own projects, and connect with others. We\u2019re about following your curiosity and sharing that experience with others. I'm thrilled to announce that construction of Tinker Kitchen is nearly complete. It's a 1700 sq ft space in San Francisco's Mission District. All that's left to do is finish a few building inspections and put in some finishing touches like ordering more furniture, equipment, and supplies. Tinker Kitchen is open and spacious, giving food lovers the space they need to experiment together. The kitchen is very spacious and our huge skylight gives the space lots of natural lighting. We're also restoring boarded-up windows in the front of the space. Tinker Kitchen is designed to be as flexible as possible. The front of the space will have small tables and chairs, so big groups can put them together for a communal meal, while small groups can still sit separately. We'll have all the greatest equipment, from our ovens to specialty laboratory equipment, to the dishwasher. We'll have it all. More on that below. The kitchen work tables are large butcher-block tables, so you can craft dishes directly on them. They're on casters so they're easy to rearrange for different uses like a class/demo, or a group working independently. Multiple groups can work at the same time without bothering each other. I'm a little obsessed with kitchen equipment. I want Tinker Kitchen to be a \"kitchen playground\" where home cooks can have access to the commercial machines which restaurants and specialty food makers use. Our cook line will feature multiple ovens, including a German-made \"combi oven\" with built-in humidity/steam control, commercial deep-fryer, and even a real wok range. Tinker Kitchen will have a commercial pasta extruder, at least three ways of making ice cream (batch freezer, Pacojet, and even liquid nitrogen). We'll have chocolate-making tools\u2014for tempering and making bonbons, as well as for making it bean-to-bar. And coffee\u2014from a drum roaster to a dual-boiler espresso machine. Then there's the lab equipment for modernist cooking\u2014two centrifuges (a refrigerated one and a spinzall), dehydrator, freeze drier, chamber vacuum, and a selection of the powders and chemicals you need to make foams, gels, spherify, and more. As a thank-you to our backers and members, you can help us decide what we will get next. Should we get tools to make custom chocolate molds? Or a pizza oven? Maybe a rotary evaporator to distill flavor extracts? The options are endless... you can help us pick. Tinker Kitchen membership features: Membership pricing: Daily Passes Daily passes are perfect for trying out Tinker Kitchen, or for bringing in additional guests. Pass pricing: We'll also have several courses at Tinker Kitchen, so you can come learn to cook something new. At launch, we'll have classes on: We have many more classes planned: bean-to-bar chocolate making, custom protein bar development, butchering 101, bread making, various ethnic cuisines, and more. Maybe you'd like to teach a class? Contact us! :-) Pricing: variable depending on the class, with discounts for groups and members. The Tinker Kitchen community calendar will have all sorts of activities and events for cooking connoisseurs. Join a club to cook and make new friends. Watch live cooking demos from visiting chefs. Hear guest speakers, attend pop-ups, compete in cooking competitions, and more. Small events (up to ~15 people) can happen anytime the space is open. We'll occasionally also allow the whole space to be booked for celebrations and team-building off-sites. We've already made a significant investment in Tinker Kitchen. We've financed everything from architects and building contractors, to paying rent and buying some of the equipment. Kickstarter funds will go towards: The campaign will cover all of those, plus Kickstarter rewards, and other Kickstarter costs. I\u2019m Dan Mills, Founder of Tinker Kitchen. I love everything about food\u2014cooking, the science behind it, the kitchen equipment\u2014all of it. From my childhood in Venezuela through my career in the tech industry I\u2019ve slowly expanded my arsenal of tastes, techniques and equipment, always tinkering with something new. In 2015 I started Tinker Kitchen to build an awesome maker space for food where I can share this passion with others. The seed for this concept dates back to my college days, where I had the good fortune to take a very special biology course. Maker spaces weren\u2019t really a thing back then, but that\u2019s exactly what this was: a sculptor and a bio prof had a lab in the basement to explain real-world structures and processes by building physical models. We studied biological organisms, did research, and built models to explain them. I discovered that this learning style is not only great fun, but immensely effective: I can still remember the things I learned back then, even though it\u2019s been almost two decades. I approach cooking the same way. I am not only interested in the end product, but in learning the underlying principles. Earlier last year, I had the honor of spending a month working at Chez Panisse in Berkeley. Every day, I woke up at 4.30AM, drove north for an hour, and showed up with my knives at 6.30AM. It was an eye-opening experience. On any given day, I would do everything from peeling buckets of onions, to prepping whole farm boxes of strange new vegetables (cardoons!), to butchering whole legs of lamb. Despite the high pressure environment, I was impressed by how Chez Panisse has formed a learning community that values training each other to achieve excellence. But my deepest learning was not any specific recipe or cooking technique, but a work ethic. To be a cook at the top of your game requires dedication. I could be taught all the tricks to supreming an orange, but an experienced cook would still do the same thing three times as fast with no mistakes, because they have done it over and over for thousands of hours. All this has led me to believe that in order for us to grow as cooks, it is not enough to only learn cooking techniques. We need to have a place where we can practice and a community that is excited to share our cooking journey. That place, I hope, will be Tinker Kitchen. ",
  "My name is Andrew Hoagland, but I go by the penname Law Matheson. You may remember DOSCO from earlier in the year. I spent the beginning months of 2015 studying Kickstarter and other crowd-funding platforms, what to expect, how to avoid pitfalls, and much more. I intended to continue studying and writing throughout the summer and launching KickStarter in October. By early March, however, I grew a little impatient and was willing to give it a try.\nI am glad that I did. Not because I was happy to watch my project only reach 60%, but because it taught me a lot. In a difficult way, however it was not a failure, but a learning experience. Besides, I like the hard way, and first try would have been just too easy.\u00a0 Taking from what I learned in the first half of this year, as well as my studies of my previous Campaign, I hope that you will all enjoy the new approach.\u00a0 \u00a0D.O.S.C.O. stands for Department Of Supernatural Cooperation and Organization. They are the secret branch of government that operates to keep human\u2019s from learning of Supernatural\u2019s, and to ensure that they are kept away/safe from human\u2019s, or as they are known in the book, Civi\u2019s. \nThey remain secretive and in the shadows, but operate as a Post Office as a cover to their below ground establishment.\u00a0\n \n\n The book follows a young man named Neil Matheson as he arrives in New City, Maine a (fictional) town inland from the Atlantic, but surrounded on three sides by lakes or rivers. New City is a fairly populated city as it has a community college and a prestigious 150 year old private school.\u00a0 Situated in the middle of town, off to the far right, a mile from the river that cut off its eastern shores, is a forest that is known as Branwood Forrest. If you were to Map the area from online, it would appear a pretty basic 1 square mile of woods. However, those with Supernatural genetics can travel up to 3000 miles! Civi\u2019s are simply deterred by strong magic, and are forced to turn away, believing to have had a great hike.\nThis forest acts as a Beacon for any Supe\u2019 (Supernatural) that is on its own, cast out, runaway, or simply doesn\u2019t belong anywhere else.\u00a0 That\u2019s how I was able to write out werewolves (thank god right? We don\u2019t need anymore vampire/werewolf love stories). Vampires also don\u2019t make any appearances as they have been hunted to near extinction by Civi\u2019s, and Ghosts are a myth.\u00a0 \u00a0Neil enters NC not knowing any of this, he is as ignorant to it all, as to the fact that he is about to set into motion a series of events that may never stop. What he does know is how to survive on the streets while traveling alone. \nOnce the catalyst is sparked Neil enters into a new and bizarre world, one he may never be able to leave. He meets amazing and diverse friends; he is Initiated into DOSCO and they help him to finish his High School Diploma; he finally starts to settle down, make some money and establish himself. Everything seems to go perfectly, but perfect stories don\u2019t make for good tales, and Neil is far from perfect. \nThis is only the tip of the ice berg though, you\u2019ll have to dive in to uncover more.\u00a0 This book is not intended for children 18 or younger. There are many adult themes, drug references, language, and some violence better not read by young minds. \nThat being said, for those young adults and up that love anything \u2018Supernatural,\u2019 \u2018Secret Agent\u2019, \u2018Mystery,\u2019 or \u2018Thrillers,\u2019 this book is definitely for you. Plot twists and manipulated character development is something I thrive on. Many stories are unfortunately lacking this, but consumers want it so badly!\u00a0 It has been my goal since I started this series, DOSCO, three years ago to go all the way to publication. I didn\u2019t know at the creation of it all that I would later go on and try to self-publish. Having the background I do, the fact that I am doing it the hard way is not surprising. It is much more than that though, I can\u2019t stand the idea of selling my rights over to some publishing company that doesn\u2019t understand the Universe I\u2019ve molded or the characters and problems therein. I often feel like I am not creating these characters, but rather that I am discovering them. Therefore I would never want to see someone change my characters just to make it \u201cmore marketable.\u201d\n The series is meant for young adults and up, and it deals with a lot of controversial issues, but ones that are important to the story and the characters development. By changing the scenarios to make them less \u2018risqu\u00e9\u2019 and more \u2018palpable\u2019 you lose the true essence of how the characters became the way they are and under plays the situations they get into.\nThat being said, I saw no other option than to try to market and sell it myself. Not that I haven\u2019t had some awesome and encouraging folks to help me along the way, which simply wouldn\u2019t be true.  \nEvery time I travel, meet someone new, or learn something about history, I want to include it within my book. Induction was first finished August 2013. Then in October 2014 I chopped it down 90 pages and rewrote 90 pages. All of 2015 I have been further editing and tweaking small things. I have found that the hardest part for me is the editing! I am not on here to make loads of money, that is not my intention. My goal is to have a finished book that I can then give or sell cheaply to friends and people that have influenced or touched my series in anyway. Since I was a child I have always loved imagining new and splendid worlds, and reaching others with it through writing. For that little 5 year old me, I want to try and live up to those dreams.\n\nI have always been hesitant about talking about my stories, as many are wicked wacky, but as I fleshed out my characters more, and talked to my friends more, I realized that I had no choice but to try and create a concise story of how they all came to be. I believe in this story, and I hope that you will too.\n Everything has been budgeted and estimated to the best I could. There are variables (shipping; How far away; How many rewards included?), but I have rounded up the prices so that way I have a margin for \u2018hidden fees\u2019 and insurance on larger orders.\u00a0 The Book: \tDecent Paper Back book, about $6.25 a book, minimum order of 100 = $800\u00a0 Bumper Stickers:\t100 for $100\u00a0 T-Shirts:\t6 sm, 8 md, 5 lg, 1 xl at $11 a piece = $250\u00a0 Editing:\tI have a woman in mind, however editing is expensive, for around $300 I can have her consultation.

  "Hello, my name is Samuel Konkol. I am a 16-year-old high school student and I am asking if you would support me in my mission to reach and inspire middle school students throughout central Florida. \n\nI am excited to announce that I just published my first book\u202610 Steps to a Brighter Future\u2014A Middle School Guide.\n\n There are over 56,000 public middle school students in Orlando and my hope is to be able to speak to every one of them. \n\n I believe I have an important message to share with middle school students \u00a0and since I am only a few years removed from middle school, students relate well to me and my message about the steps they need to take to realize their brighter future. \n\n My fall speaking tour is quickly filling up and through Kickstarter, I will hopefully have the funds needed to supply each middle school student with a free copy of my new book. \n\n Recently I spoke to 300 middle school students at Maitland Middle School and at the end of my presentation, every single student raised their hand to request an autographed copy of my book. \n\nIn the next 30 days I need to raise $12,000 through Kickstarter to fund the printing of my next 10,000 books. This will give me the leverage I need to continue inspiring middle school students throughout central florida. \n\n Over the next 5 months I will seek and find a donor or an organization that is passionate about the future of middle school students to underwrite the cost of the other 46,000 books I intend to print and distribute. \n\n I could really use your support because Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing funding site, meaning that your credit card will only be charged if I meet my funding goal of $12,000.\u00a0If the project falls short of the funding goal, then no one is charged. Thank you for being a part of my mission.\u00a0",
  "(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+) Over the festival's 12 year history, more than 20,000 people have attended and\nenjoyed the Latin-American feature films, documentaries and short films with us. We want your help to celebrate this year our tenth edition, to celebrate the best of Latin-American cinema here in London. Help us take over London for one week, from the 27th of November to the 4th of December, with our screenings at Tate Modern and Odeon Covent Garden showcasing\u00a0the cultural diversity, originality and\nwealth of cinematic talent that characterizes Latin America through recent film\nproductions. \u00a0We have had incredible guests attending our screenings and answering Q&As with our audience in the past, like Diego Luna, Lucrecia Martel and Carlos Reygadas among others. This year we will have 5-6 special guests attending our Gala Nights and Q&As with the audience. We are a team of 20 volunteers (and growing) focused on delivering the best Latin-American film festival in London. We do it just out of passion for Latin American cinema, and because we believe in sharing the beauty and potential that Latin American culture offers to the world. With your help we will secure the funding for our venues this November. We already have the majority of the feature films and documentaries secured, as well as the logistics for our guests. We have created great rewards for your help, from UK premiere tickets for some of our screenings to dinners with the Directors/Actresses/Actors that will come to London during the festival, as well as our own Latin-American themed party in mid-October. DLAFF is organised by Discovering Latin America,\u00a0a UK\nnon-governmental organization (CIC register No. 1106705) formed in August\n2002, composed of 350 volunteers from 25 different countries, with formal\noperations in Brazil, Mexico, Spain and the UK.\u00a0Our mission is to\nshare the unique diversity, beauty and potential that Latin American culture\noffers to the world, whilst contributing to the less privileged sectors of the\npopulation (www.discoveringlatinamerica.org) We want to give special thanks to the volunteers that created the video animation and the music, as well as the voice over for our video.\u00a0 Thanks to Carlos Felipe Galvis for directing the video, and to Kosiaco for the animation. Thanks a lot to the group of musicians that created and played the music for the video.

  "I'm starting this kickstarter campaign because I want to see The Watercolor Oracle out in the world bringing hope to people. \u00a0For the past 3 years, I've been inspired to paint abstract watercolors...for me it was an exercise in letting go and taking chances. I also began to collect messages of intuitive guidance from meditations and journaling. When I had the idea to join them together into an oracle card deck I was SO excited! Although the wisdom in these cards was originally meant for me, it's also universal, and I trust it can help whoever wants to receive it. I really had no idea how to bring this idea to fruition. Once I had finished the paintings, and gathered enough wisdom to put on each of the 44 cards, I was kinda stumped on the process of making the deck real. Sure, I could laminate each of my original paintings, or scan them and print them. But as I looked at the oracle card decks I had purchased on my bookshelf, I wanted my deck to be just as available to others, and just as professionally made. And I'm not exactly there yet. It took a ton of searching on the internet to get where I am now with production. I did find 2 affordable companies that could print prototypes in a few different sizes, and one that could print a guidebook the size I wanted. From there, I made my decision which one could work for what I needed. This included the 3.5x5 cards along with the same size saddle-stitched guidebook. I solved the problem of packaging with a blue velvet pouch, but would love to create a sturdy box in the future. Since I've spent lots of time, and some money on figuring this all out, I really just need help in running a larger print of The Watercolor Oracle! The printer is currently having major delays in turning out product, so a larger run of cards will allow me to have them on hand to mail out right away. People won't have to wait the current lengthy time which is at least 6 weeks. I'd like to place an order for 250 decks, guidebooks, velvet packages, and bubble mailers. Thank you so much for reading about the evolution of the Watercolor Oracle! Customer feedback: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I just opened my Oracle card set - the watercolor designs are exquisite! I pulled a card and it was on target.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just got my oracle cards today! My daughter did a reading and 7 cards jumped out of the deck. Every single card was something we talked about this morning. Incredible!\"",
  "Hi, my name is Ruby Mountford and I am 16 years old. I have decided to set up a magazine because I want people to be more creative. Too many people lose touch with their creative side as they grow up but it doesn't have to be the case and I think that 1999 can help start this change. 1999 will inspire others to get in touch with their creative side again. It is also a great way to showcase people's work and build their confidence. I have also noticed a lack of options when it comes to choosing a magazine which includes creative topics such as art and photography.\u00a0 As I am under the age of eighteen, my Dad is helping me to set up my Kickstarter page and I am using his account. 1999 is a magazine that aims to celebrate and encourage creativity. I have teamed up with a variety of talented contributors. Each piece of work is unique and I hope that the differences in their work will show people that there are many ways to express your creative side. There will be 100 pages full of inspiring work, which include art, photography, recipes, articles and much more. It will be available as a printed copy and a digital copy and it will be a bi-annual magazine. Your money will be used to cover the cost of printing the magazine, postage and packaging. You will also help to inspire others to be more creative. Email us at - 1999magazine@gmail.com\u00a0 Tweet us at - @1999mag",
  "This is the second year of our film festival about improving the urban experience. We're calling it \"The New Urbanism Film Festival: City Stories on the Silver Screen\"\n\n\u00a0 Visualize a walkable neighborhood: a place close to work, school, cafes, theater, recreation,  etc., a place safe for kids, with good public parks, libraries and transportation.  \n\n\u00a0 We've curated a collection of movies about people just like you working to create better urban neighborhoods.  Whether they're about urban designers creating master plans, or private citizens building small scale projects, their stories are inspiring.\u00a0 For our festival's second year, we need your help to improve and expand the New Urbanism Film Festival to deliver the message of human scaled neighborhoods to even more people.\n\nWe had a great response to last year's event, inspiring many to return to their neighborhoods and try some of the ideas they could only see at NUFF. \u00a0Your help through kickstarter will allow us to expand our advertising budget. \u00a0We want to buy ads in local papers, reach out to community and student groups, and hire a public relations manager. Our second goal for this year is to make the event more interactive and bring more attention to the idea of human scaled urban design. To do this, we need to attract more speakers to present workshops, discussions, and activities that will further inspire our attendees, and take the virtual world of film and make it concrete. So, a portion of this kickstarter fund will be used for hospitality and stipends for our guest speakers.\u00a0 Our third goal for this kickstarter is to reward filmmakers. Last year, filmmakers were invited to a special dinner, and winners won plaques and prizes.  This year, we want to reward and encourage these forward-thinking filmmakers by offering cash prizes that will allow them to make even more ambitious projects in the future.\u00a0\n To recap, our three expansion goals for our second year are\u00a0 \u00a01. Bring in more experts in the field to host workshops\u00a0 \u00a02. Broaden our audience\u00a0 \u00a03. Reward filmmakers\u00a0 Stretch Goal 1: \u00a0If we can reach $13,000, we'll be able to add a full day to the festival.  We've already received more submissions than we did in our entire first year, and most are feature length. In order to take advantage of this bounty, we need another day that would allow us to show more features.\u00a0 Stretch Goal 2: If we reach $16,000, not only will we add another day to the annual festival, we'll host programming throughout the year.  This would help grow our audience base as well as spread the message of human scale urban design. \u00a0 The 2nd Annual New Urbanism Film Festival will take place Nov 6-9 in MidCity, Los Angeles CA 90036. Submissions are currently being accepted online! \u00a0We are dividing short films into five categories for screening purposes: Architecture, Bicycling, Healthy Cities, Tactical Urbanism, and Urban Design. However, short and feature films will be considered for all applicable award categories. For more info on what kinds of videos we're looking for and how to submit, visit our website! In addition to the short and feature films that we receive as contest submissions, we will screen major motion picture feature films with a theme of urban issues. \u00a0Which ones we screen, will depend on reaching or exceeding our funding goals. Last year we screened The Garden, GDOG, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The Garden was a nice complement to our short films because we did not receive a lot of submissions addressing the relationship between food and the city. \u00a0Which we believe is a critical issue. So we were excited to screen The Garden and have the director Scott Kennedy join us to discuss the intricacies of food, the city, and politics. Similarly, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, was a fun choice because it deals with LA History in a fun way. And again, we were able to invite an appropriate guest speaker. \u00a0Diego Cardoso, of the LA Planning Comission came to the festival and presented the true history (and future!) of rail in Los Angeles.\u00a0 We will select feature films for this year's festival in the same manner: Do they complement other workshops and presentations on the schedule? Do they address an issue not covered in the short films? How will we locate and attract speakers and presenters? \u00a0In June we are travelling to Buffalo NY for the 22nd Annual Congress for the New Urbanism. \u00a0We will be screening the best of last year's films. We are also involved in local advocacy groups here in Los Angeles. Between our national CNU connections and our local advocacy efforts, we are confident we can provide a roster of guests that will prove very inspiring.\u00a0 Check out our website for a complete list of all 16 speakers and presenters we hosted at the first annual New Urbanism Film Festival. If you are still asking, what is \"New Urbanism\" here is a brief video that explains the key concepts of the movement.\u00a0 \u00a0After watching that video, we hope you are inspired to make your city a better place. \u00a0How can you do that? There are plenty of people already doing it and they are excited to show you how. \u00a0See their stories (and make them your story) by joining us at the 2nd Annual New Urbanism Film Festival!",

More than a film festival, Rooftop brings a vibrant, memorable experience to rooftops and scenic spots all over the city.  Some say that our screenings are the best thing about summer in New York.  Just ask Rooftop fan Yujin M: \n\u201cNew York has plenty of fantastic events, but Rooftop Films is by far my favorite.  Spend an evening under the stars on a graffitied rooftop of a chartered school on the lower east side with an opening performance by a local band, an awesome selection of independent films, and free beer at the after-party at a bar nearby.  The very fact that they're offering all this in NYC for $13 makes you want to donate to the organization.\u201d\n Thanks Yujin! In addition to the kind words, Yujin makes a great point: Have you ever been to a Rooftop Films event and wondered, \u201cHow can they afford to create such unique and amazing events and still charge so little for admission?\u201d\n Well, the truth is we can\u2019t \u2014 not without your additional support. \n Ticket sales from our screenings account for less than 15% of our overall budget. Even if we sold our tickets for $100 we would still not be able to cover the cost of programming, planning and producing these events in 12 different locations across the city. One of the most vital sources of support is YOU. Without memberships and donations from our biggest fans, Rooftop can\u2019t survive, which is why we are asking for your help this winter. \n If you believe that Rooftop Films is important to you, your neighborhood, your city, and the independent film community, please make a donation or become a member today. Check out all the great rewards you can earn by making a donation, and help Rooftop Films in these cold winter months so that you can join us next summer for dozens of amazing events.\n More Than Just A Film Festival \n As a small non-profit organization, Rooftop accomplishes a great deal with a small, passionate staff. Every penny we earn goes back into the Rooftop community and towards providing a quality experience for our audience and members.  We want to help you discover new up-and-coming bands and unforgettable locations, show you films you might never have heard about otherwise, and give you the chance to mingle with your fellow audience members and filmmakers after the films. We believe everyone should have equal access to the arts and it is our mission to keep these shows and these experiences accessible to all. That is why each year we add more free shows and keep our admission prices as low as possible for our ticketed events. \n And Rooftop Films does more than simply exhibit films. By supporting Rooftop you also help independent filmmakers finish their new films.  One dollar from every ticket we sell goes into the Rooftop Filmmakers Fund, and we raise tens of thousands of additional dollars in cash and services to help our alumni filmmakers to produce their latest films. Over the years, Rooftop has helped more than 100 filmmakers complete their films, including Benh Zeitlin (Beasts of the Southern Wild), David Lowery (Ain\u2019t Them Bodies Saints), Lucy Walker (The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom), Shaka King (Newlyweeds), Sean Durkin (Martha Marcy May Marlene) and Gillian Robespierre (Obvious Child, coming very soon!). \n Support Rooftop Films this winter and you help to guarantee that we will be able to continue bringing daring new films to big screens all around New York City. The more you give, the more you get. Rewards! Rooftop Films is all about getting big things done with the resources available at hand, so we know the value of a dollar.

We are never content to simply show movies outdoors \u2014 we turn our screenings into unforgettably unique evenings. Last summer we didn\u2019t just screen a documentary about a brass band -- we hosted a whole brass band festival (Brasslands). It was not enough for us to simply show a moving portrait of modern strongman (Bending Steel) -- we presented that film on the beach at Coney Island preceded by an exhilarating live exhibition featuring horseshoe bending and crowbar twisting.\u00a0 Access to the Best Independent Films and Filmmakers in the World\u00a0 In 2013 Rooftop Members got to hang out with the filmmakers and actors at the premieres and sneak previews of such films as Noah Baumbach\u2019s Frances Ha (starring Greta Gerwig), Sebastian Silva\u2019s Crystal Fairy (starring Michael Cera and Gaby Hoffman), and David Lowery\u2019s Ain\u2019t Them Bodies Saints (starring Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara).\u00a0 First Access to Surprising Sites All Over the City\u00a0 Rooftop shows consistently sell out but Rooftop members get in free and have priority entry. Plus you\u2019ll receive VIP tickets to panels, and after parties too.  You and your friends also receive invitations to off season screenings and exclusive programs curated for members only, and all of this will take place in unconventional spaces and special locations that you might never have discovered without Rooftop Films.\u00a0 If you love Rooftop Films, and want to be part of the Rooftop community, take advantage of these offers. Together we will keep building something bigger, keep our program fresh and accessible year after year and in 2014, we\u2019ll be able to go further and do more, BUT we can only do it with your help.\u00a0",
  "This project arose as the need to reinvent myself through what I am passionate about: art and nature; and as a personal pursuit to understand both the environment and the conditions we live in as humanity. As an Art student and a yoga practitioner eager to learn and improve, I am convinced that colors and shapes have vibrational frequencies that impact our emotions and contribute to create a pleasant atmosphere in our home, something especially important nowadays while in lockdown. This first study is based on butterflies, which are associated with personal transformation due to the metamorphosis they go through; they are a symbol of rebirth, of the psyche, of freedom, and peace. I have chosen 7 different models that according to their colors they represent each of the body\u00b4s 7 chakras. The drawings can be regarded as scientific illustration because they will retain the unique and incomparable characteristics of each species. As a reward and as a way of thanking you for believing in my project you can choose between one, three, five or seven drawings. Este proyecto surgi\u00f3 como un inter\u00e9s personal de reencontrarme a trav\u00e9s de lo que me apasiona que es el arte y la naturaleza, as\u00ed mismo de una b\u00fasqueda del significado del entorno y de las circunstancias que mundialmente vivimos como humanidad. Como estudiosa del arte y practicante de yoga en constante b\u00fasqueda por aprender y mejorar, estoy convencida que los colores y las formas poseen frecuencias vibratorias que impactan a nuestras emociones y contribuyen a crear en nuestro hogar una atm\u00f3sfera agradable, tan importante sobre todo en tiempos de confinamiento. El primer estudio se basa en las mariposas, relacionadas con la transformaci\u00f3n personal a ra\u00edz de la metamorfosis por la que atraviesan en su vida, y ser consideradas un s\u00edmbolo del renacer y de la psique, de la libertad y de la paz. He elegido 7 modelos que, seg\u00fan sus colores representan a los chakras del cuerpo. As\u00ed mismo, es importante mencionar que los dibujos conservar\u00e1n las caracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas e incomparables de cada especie a modo de ilustraci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica. Como recompensa y a modo de agradecimiento por creer en mi proyecto, podr\u00e1s elegir entre uno, tres, cinco y /o siete modelos.

  "I am Phalguni Bhatt. I am an Early Childhood Educator, and I love creating educating and enriching material. I've recently created an art book, a paint by number in Sanskrit. Without financial support, I find it hard to pay for artists and other labor even if we consider minimum wages. I need to hire many services that need to be paid upfront. When there is a bit of financial support, it's motivating and helps create a good quality book.\u00a0 This project consists of creating Paint by Number and Connect the Dots art book in four languages; English, Hindi, Gujarati and Sanskrit. This book is intended for age group of 7 and above with images starting from simple to complex. Theme of the book will be spring.\u00a0 With the current Era of online learning, a physical thematic\u00a0coloring book can take a bit of time away from the screen and help bring mental peace with calming pictures and colors. Additionally, it can enhance multi-lingual development.",
  "Gravity. Interstellar. The Rosetta Comet Mission.\u00a0Right now there's a lot of buzz around realistic space exploration, but it's sorely missing from one place - the young adult section of your local bookstore. Let's fill that hole in the shelf.\u00a0My first novel began with that goal in mind -\u00a0\u00a0to refocus our collective attention on the amazing possibility of space travel. That vision continues with The Rathmore Chaos.\u00a0 READ A SAMPLE HERE. Tully Harper lost a good friend on his first trip into space -- a friend that he desperately wants to find. To do that, he must journey to a very real moon in our solar system. His friend's fate, and maybe humanity's, rests on his ability to locate the Rathmore Chaos. Once there, Tully explores an alien world, battles to bring home his friend, and discovers the origins of his powers, which don't always obey his commands.\u00a0He also learns the unexpected story of the Ascendant, a myth-infused tale that I will write in the years to come.\u00a0I researched everything from planetary sciences to orbital transfers to movement in low gravity to bring real science to bear upon the fiction. Also, the story is funny when it needs to be. Tully carries with him a pocket-sized Android who spouts definitions and advertisement at terribly inappropriate times. His name is Little Bacon, and bacon makes everything better. Here's a link to\u00a0The Conspiracy Game, my first novel. Read the reviews. What you'll see is the result of my first Kickstarter, which inspired me to pursue this trilogy. Unlike the first Kickstarter, this one includes a copy of the book! (see award levels for details).\u00a0 In the coming weeks, look for an update on the cover art and a launch party. All Kickstarters get an invite! Until then, get in your pledge to reserve a copy, and thanks for your support. A FEW CHARACTERS WORTH MENTIONING: The list is long and diverse. A sampling.\u00a0 Tully Harper - protagonist - an only child from a single parent home; life-threateningly curious; received unpredictable powers when he touched a strange object in space.\u00a0 Sunjay Chakravorty - Tully's best friend - son of a Space Alliance research engineer; martial arts afficianado, human question cannon, fierce friend, and megafanboy for the pop star Queen Envy. Tabitha Tirelli - Tully's friend/crush - lives down the street from Tully; instrumental in helping Tully avoid death in space; perceptive friend; doodler and straight A student; not a manic pixie dream girl. Gallant Trackman - Archspy of the Ascendant - power-hungry traitor who sold out Tully and the world to the Ascendant; lost his hand trying to stop Tully in the first book and not happy about it. \u00a0 Mike Harper, Tully's father - stoic Space Alliance commander; discovered the Harper Device on Mars; explorer, parent, widower, fighter.\u00a0 The Harper Device - also known as the Sacred - a source of power, inspiration, hope, mystery - I cannot define a thing that is many things all at once.\u00a0",

  "Celebrate your pride by wearing it on your sleeve (or coat, or blazer, or dress, or tie, or backpack, or...)! I've always thought that butterflies are the perfect symbol for the LGBTQ+ community: once we find and embrace our true selves, we grow wings and find freedom. We are beautiful, resilient, and able to fly high! (Plus: we're everywhere!) When coming up with this project, my aim was pretty simple: I wanted to make a set of pride pins that I would be proud to wear myself. I have experience working in wildlife conservation science, and my love for nature and passion for greater inclusivity in STEM careers influenced my design choice for this series. Additionally, I wanted to create a pin line that reflected the LGBTQ+ community's diversity, beauty, and perseverance! I've put a lot of thought, energy, time, and loving care into designing these pins - I wanted to make sure they were just right. I hope you love them as much as I do! If my project reaches its goal of $1250, five pride pins will be unlocked (rainbow/gay/LGBTQ+, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and nonbinary). With every additional $200 raised, one extra pin from the stretch goal selection will be unlocked! If my project reaches its initial funding goal, I will send out reward surveys to all backers allowing you to choose your pins from the unlocked designs. If my project does not reach $1250, \u00a0you will not be charged and I will not receive funds for this project. This Kickstarter's initial funding goal of $1250 is to produce the first five enamel pins, as well as cover backing cards, Kickstarter fees, taxes, and shipping costs/supplies.\u00a0 This is a non-exhaustive selection of pride flags. I recognize with respect the incredible diversity in the LGBTQ+ that extends far beyond what is shown in the flags represented here. Please note that the selection I made is NOT indicative of favouritism or perceived value, but rather of a) budget restrictions; b) design similarity (the same number of stripes, for example, makes pins cheaper and easier to manufacture); and c) demand according to requests from existing customers.\u00a0 If this project is backed successfully, I would love to do a second wave of pins including more flags! If you have suggestions or special requests, I'd love to hear them! A special note regarding the LESBIAN flag: I have chosen to include an alternate design of this flag in my campaign, due to controversy associated with the Pink Lesbian Flag that does not align with my values. The lesbian flag selected here made its debut on Tumblr and is seen by many as more inclusive to EVERYONE that identifies as lesbian. All pins that are funded by this campaign will be hard enamel pins with gold-coloured metal outlines. All pins in the series will be made according to the specs below: Pin Specs: Please Note: The final product may vary from the mockups shown, and colours may be slightly different from those pictured. Once the Kickstarter has ended, all unlocked designs will go to production. Reward surveys will be sent out so you can choose your pin designs. Production takes an estimated 4-6 weeks, though it could take longer if there is a backlog.\u00a0 I'm crossing my fingers that pins will be on their way to new homes in time for Pride Month, but I cannot promise that this deadline will be met as production time is out of my control. I promise I'll do my very best to get the pins out to you as soon as possible!\u00a0 Estimated timeline:\u00a0 *I'll update this as funding goals are met! Hello! My name is Alena, and I am the one-queer-woman show behind Owl & Bear Studio. I am an artist and a wildlife conservation scientist passionate about widening the space for diversity and inclusivity in STEM. I'm super excited about this Kickstarter, because it combines so many of my loves! I hope you love it as much as I do - let's unlock these beauties!!! How do I pledge? Just click the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button on the campaign page or scroll down the page to select a reward tier! Do I get to choose my pins? \u00a0YES! If this project is successfully funded, I will send you a survey asking which pin(s) you would like. The \"first five\" pins, as well as any \"stretch goal\" pins that were successfully unlocked will be available for you to choose from.\u00a0 When are backers charged? If the project you\u2019re backing is successfully funded, your card will be charged when the project reaches its funding deadline. If the project does not reach its funding goal, your card is never charged.\u00a0 Other Questions? Try Kickstarter's Support page!\u00a0 Interested in seeing more of my work and following along?

  "This is my second Kickstarter campaign! YAY!\u00a0 I\u2019m hoping to make a series of pins based on my love of TEA! I didn\u2019t want to exclude coffee drinkers either so also created a coffee pin I hope we can unlock.\u00a0 Each pin will be made using a hard enamel to give it a smooth and polished finish, the pins will be approx 30mm in height and all will be made with a polished silver enamel finish. This means that any grey areas you see in the example photos will be polished silver giving them a reflective look. (Below are the mock designs) The campaign will be running for 30 days and there are 3 main designs to unlock, with the 4th pin being a bonus unlock. The first pin to unlock is the Brew Crew Pin at \u00a3250! \u00a0Each Brew Crew Pin comes with a membership card welcoming you into the Brew Crew club. \u00a0 (Please be aware that the Brew Crew is a fictional club, I am far too awkward \u00a0socialise in an actual real life club setting.) Hah! (Below is a mock up of how the pin will look in its backing card.) The 2nd Pin to unlock will be the Skull Coffee Pin at \u00a3500! It\u2018s a black and silver enamel pin to celebrate the dark soul of coffee drinkers. It comes on a skull covered backing card. (Below is a mock up of how the pin will look in its backing card.) The 3rd pin to unlock is the pastel green Soya pin at \u00a3700.\u00a0 (Below is a mock up of how the pin will look in its backing card.) The 4th pin is a BONUS unlock pin which will unlock at \u00a3850! The Kettle Pin would look good with any of these pins, maybe on opposite collars? On it\u2019s own the pastel pink cuteness would stand out on any denim jacket. (Below is a mock up of how the pin will look in its backing card.) Once the campaign has ended, if the project was successful I will then have to wait for all the funds to clear from Kickstarter which can take a week or 2. \u00a0During this time you will receive a survey from me to see which pin(s) you would like from the unlocked designs. Once the funds have come from Kickstarter I can get the proofs sent off to the manufacturer and await their arrival back to me once they\u2019re complete. The while Kickstarter process from start to finish takes around 8-10 weeks. Depending on how fast funds clear etc. I\u2019d estimate postage to be in mid-late June. There are several tiers for pledges each of which has its own rewards, Some will include sticker packs and prints which will be unique items to this Kickstarter. Below is a photo of the Vinyl Coffee Pin stickers that come free with some of the pledges. Other sticker designs will be made once they unlock in the campaign. NO MONEY WILL BE TAKEN UNTIL THE CAMPAIGN ENDS and ONLY if it reaches its total. So don\u2019t worry, no money is taken straight away. Each pin will be securely pinned to its own backing card and wrapped in tissue paper. \u00a0Then it will be placed inside a cardboard mailer with any pledge goodies ready to post. \u00a0All of my packaging will be fully recyclable. \u00a0So please reuse or recycle any unwanted packaging. PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK \u00a0ADDRESS WHEN PLEDGING, by the time the campaign ends and the pins arrive it\u2019s around 8 weeks or so in total, so please have an up to date address when pledging. If you are moving in those 8 weeks please put an alternative address where you could receive the pins. All UK orders will be sent via 2nd class postage with Royal Mail, proof of postage will also be obtained. All international orders will be sent using standard international delivery, sometimes orders can be held up by your countries customs so please bare in mind that there may be some delays that are out of my control. \u00a0Proof of postage will also be obtained.",

  "a brand new film festival for venezuela.\u00a0 The current state of emergency in Venezuela will not stop venezuelan artists contributing to the culture with film.\u00a0A new festival is born 100% Independent. As a rebellion against censorship, the Caracas Film Festival will begin online, with the objective to hold the best venezuelan films under one streaming service, the first one to share revenue for the filmmakers.\u00a0 The best Venezuelan new films, documentaries, shorts, tv shows, hidden gems, the golden era of film in Venezuela and contemporary titles, forgotten classics and musicals will all compete for cash prizes and the PANALE\u00d3N Award! (sculpted statue commissioned to a venezuelan artist).

Help us raise the money to to buy the rights of these venezuelan films and build a beautiful \u00a0place for each piece to stand among its peers in a world gallery of national treasures.\u00a0 The festival plans to hold a physical event in the year 2020 in the city of Caracas, with the launch of social programs in schools we want to encourage and help young people produce films locally and integrate the community to participate in the events that promote unity. Submissions will be open for new titles to be recognized and awarded. Submit early and have a chance to stand next to the classics that made up our film history. As the country awakens to a new day, the Caracas Film Festival opens a new window.

The Caracas Film Festival will celebrate the art of storytelling by announcing official selections and winners in October at a ceremony in New York City, to launch the platform PANALE\u00d3N and promote it among film festival goers, we will participate in all major film festivals in the world as industry representatives. The jury is 50% voting members and 50% personalities related to the venezuelan film industry and streamed live in October, 2019.",
  "Last year I borrowed a Nikon D7100 Digital camera from my good friend and fellow photographer Ryuijie. After over 50 years of photographing with film in multiple formats I quickly learned what an incredible tool the new cameras are. No need to change film for different situations, the higher sensitivity allowing the use of available light (which has always been my preference), being able to make very large photographs without needing medium or large format cameras and film. But most of all, to see the final image quality the new 10 ink printers can now produce...it's like my early days in a darkroom all over again. It's no wonder so many of the top fine art photographers today made the move years ago to this medium. \u00a0In addition, the art community has accepted the new pigment photographs as seen in auction results in recent years. A few years back a Jock Sturges pigment print sold for $40,000.00 at auction. It's well documented that these newer archival pigment photographs have been tested to last 150-200 years, if not longer. \u00a0\u00a0 My main purpose of this Kickstarter project is to get my new photographs in your hands so you can see the beauty of this (new to me!) process. After the cost of printing the \"rewards\", I will use any additional funds to upgrade my system to a digital camera and to start scanning some sellect negatives from the last 50+ years to make new archival pigment photographs from them. \u00a0",
  "I love art + I love love-notes. This project combines both. Each of these watercolors was inspired by a natural space that is sacred + alive for me: a park near my house, the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, and a plot of land my family has tended for generations. These felt the perfect pieces to bring to life with greeting cards. I imagine them being used as blank canvases for love letters, notes of gratitude, congratulatory salutations, words of encouragement, creative doodles, and/or incantations of magic and blessing. Here's the art: Each card features one of these paintings + is blank on the inside. Cards measure 4.25\u201d x 5.5\u201d and are printed on sturdy 17 pt., 100% recycled textured paper.\u00a0 Envelopes are included.",
  "Synopsis\n\n A large meteor is headed straight for Earth and 13-year old Sean couldn\u2019t be more excited.  With his father Kevin, a lead scientist on the NASA team being sent to study the impact site, Sean is going to get to travel to central Russia and learn firsthand all the secrets that the rock from outer space may hold.  It\u2019s the chance of a lifetime.\u00a0 Soon after Sean and his father arrive in Moscow, the meteorite (nicknamed Elijah by the Russians) finally reaches the Earth\u2019s surface, but instead of exploding upon impact as was predicted, the huge space rock lands quietly \u2013 and largely intact.  Sean, Kevin and the team of scientists are even more surprised when they learn that, moments before the meteorite landed, six Russian Air Force men in the area of the crash site dropped dead instantly, with no identifiable cause of death.\u00a0 Sean is soon left alone and, as he struggles to escape the dying city, he discovers that somehow the meteorite\u2019s arrival has given him strange, almost magical, abilities. He must use these newfound powers to survive against roaming gangs and find out what happened to his world.\u00a0 Want to read a sample? Check out the first two chapters.\u00a0 About the project\u00a0 Elijah\u2019s Chariot is a dramatic and adventurous novel appropriate for middle school ages and up (my adult readers especially have loved it). In writing it, I really wanted to explore what it would be like for a young boy to be all on his own in a completely foreign environment and have to figure out how to survive. Although the book is very much about the adventure, I\u2019ve also included scientific elements throughout \u2013 on meteors and some ideas of how mental abilities like telekinesis could actually work. Also, I\u2019ve relied on my personal experience of living in St. Petersburg and Moscow to flesh out the world in which Sean finds himself stranded. So, there are some possible educational elements as well as all the fun.\u00a0 The funding is for copyediting, cover art design, rewards costs and Kickstarter and Amazon fees. I already have a shortlist of some very talented copyediting and design folks and am very excited to get started \u2013 with your help!",

  "The Blurb:\u00a0With the Light, came Magic, and the Witch. As mysterious as she was fearsome, and as powerful as she was merciless, the Witch almost succeeded in ending the world until she was vanquished by a hero and his comrades. This is the legend of the Witch and the Guardian. Centuries after the nigh calamity, this legend is as much as almost anyone knows of what truly happened back then and as much of an explanation anyone has of what ended an era in human civilization. The Guild of Recorders was formed to preserve the pieces of the past and the present from being forgotten. A young, curious new recruit decides she wants to direct her own investigation of the old legend in hopes of discovering who the Witch really was and the details of the events that led to the nigh calamity. Though the young recruit may never learn the whole story, you as the reader will follow the days that led up to how a young girl named Lily became immortalized as the Witch though her name, dream and life became forgotten.

  "In the history of birthdays, Nia's 15th was the worst. Homework-loving, plan-a-holic Nia hates change, but change is what she got. In the worst way. As if the new kid at school isn't enough for her to deal with, she gets unwanted powers-which she can't control, learns that she's actually an alien and that a giant vampire-lizard has it out for her specifically. Turns out, if\u00a0these crazy kids are right, the fate of her native world rests on their shoulders, hers included. When the Ruby Sage Stone goes missing, her new friends (and her parents) freak out. One by one, people start disappearing and soon the fate of the world is on her shoulders alone. Only: she's not sure she'll buy into this. I'm going to give it to you straight... I crave good books and good stories. My mind is bursting with new and exciting ideas. Every time I turn my head, a new story is born -but I'm getting off topic. I want good books, exciting books, for me and my kids to read. I like heart-pumping action, knee-buckling romance, and gut-busting comedy, but I despise obscene content. It throws off my groove. The more I search for good books with the quality of writing that I look for, the more I am disappointed.\u00a0 So, I wrote a book. It's a dang good book too! (My Mother said so.) But, don't take my word for it, you can read the prologue here.\u00a0 This is one project, a project that has been carefully planned and cautiously implemented. With help from my experienced friends\u00a0\u00a0and from you, we can get this book into your hands (and theirs). In the form of a paper back, a hard back, or an e-book. So... I'm a go-big-or-go-home type of girl. I have had professionals read the manuscript, but I haven't presented it to an agency or any publishing house because I have reviewed the pros and cons of going through big publishing houses and have come to my own conclusion. My decision: I have actually started a company called Wonder & Lights LLC through which I want to publish good books from a variety of talented authors. In other words: I am starting my own publishing house. I'll\u00a0eventually take over the world. (But that's for another day). Right now I am raising funds to get this book off the ground.\u00a0 You may ask yourselves: \"Wow, $3,500 is a good chunk of money, where is it all going?\"-Although I would love for it to go toward a castle in Europe, I have broken down EXACTLY where the money went or is going to go (yes, some work is undone and some work has already gone unpaid-for now) and put it together for you in a nice little chart. \u00a0I would like to mention that I have an editing team who have agreed-insisted to go underpaid for this project. I personally think that the editors should have a majority of the pie.\u00a0",
  "We have a dream! To open up downtown Savannah's only donut shop, serving up gourmet donuts, craft coffee from PERC Coffee, and even ice cream from Leopold's! Not enough for ya?!? How about tons of your favorite 80s arcade games! Best your Galaga high score while enjoying an expertly crafted latte. Reach a new level in Pac-Man while stuffing your face with fluffy, glazed donuts. Squash some Q*Bert baddies while gnoshing on an ice cream cookie sandwich. It's okay to cry. Happy tears, of course. 8-Bit Donuts will be located on the campus of The Guild Hall, Savannah's premier gaming destination. The Guild Hall already boasts a host of successful businesses, including The Chromatic Dragon, our gamerpub, The Guild Hall Arena, our 18+ gamerspace, and Jolly Goblin Games, our traditional friendly local game store. With plenty of space to play Magic, D&D, or any other tabletop game your heart desires, 8-Bit will offer more than just arcade games.\u00a0 DONUTS, OF COURSE!! We plan to offer from-scratch gourmet donuts. And we're not talking about your average run-of-the-mill flavors, either.  Clegg is a donutisseur (he just made that word up) and ran a successful bakery for several years.  His ambitions are fierce! His imagination is vast!  His belly is wide! Biscoff donuts?  Scotcharoo Crullers?!  PB&J Stuffed Donuts?!  Cap'n Crunch Special?!  Dude.  There is no stopping this man! But if arcade games are what brought you here, LOOK NO FURTHER! We plan to offer all your favorite 80s arcade classics, from Centipede to BurgerTime to Zaxxon to Galaga to Robotron! (We could seriously keep going pretty much forever...how long have you got?) Even more: we hope to offer them for free with the purchase of food and drink at 8-Bit! You buy a donut, we hand you some tokens! Is that cool, or what?! Throw in craft coffee from our good friends and local coffee roasters, PERC Coffee, and you can see why this feels like a culinary dream-come-true.\u00a0 But wait, there's more!  What Savannah eatery would be complete without ice cream? Kill the heat on a hot Savannah day (which we all know is most of the year) with one of our treats that features delicious ice cream from Leopold's. \u00a0Chocolate, vanilla, and most of your favorite Leopold's flavors will be available, either as add-ons to make your donut experience even more magical, or as part of a special creation by our team of donutisans (Clegg made that one up, too). Not only that, but we'll also be featuring a CUSTOM FLAVOR designed especially for 8-Bit Donuts by Leopold's super secret team of flavor scientists.\u00a0 What makes us think we can do this? Our amazing community helped us crowd-source The Chromatic Dragon back in February 2015. \u00a0Ever since it opened two months later, our gamerpub has been more successful in its space than any other restaurant in the building before us. The Dragon offers customers console gaming and board gaming while they enjoy up-scale pub food, craft beer, and cocktails. Not to brag, but it's been called \"The Disney World of Savannah\" and \"Oh my god I can't believe this is a real thing am I dreaming?\" \u00a0We couldn't have done it without our Kickstarter backers, and we hope that together we can achieve similar results with you folks on 8-Bit Donuts.\u00a0 Check out this little video to see what kind of fun we've been up to at The Chromatic Dragon. We have less than 30 days to meet our goal to get 8-Bit open in January 2017! \u00a0Read on to learn more about what we can offer and how you can help! 8-Bit Donuts is a team effort brought to you by the amazing people at The Guild Hall. \u00a0You can learn more about us at http://theguildhall.com/team Our team is led by entrepreneurs whose experience is exceeded only by their girth! \u00a0(Actually, Chef Bret is the outlier here, but his beard is pretty fat!) Clegg Ivey - Co-owner / Guildmaster / Donutissuer\u00a0 Clegg is the man with the plan. Having founded more than a dozen companies since the late 90s- everything from tech to telecom to energy drinks to local retail- Clegg is dedicating the rest of his career to creating opportunities for people to have fun and play games. Also, Clegg loves pugs. He has, like, 14 pugs.\u00a0  Jacob Heider -\u00a0Co-owner / Technocrat / Lead Borg Was there ever a piece of technology that didn't interest the man? Not since the mid-80s, at least. A talented programmer, network engineer, troubleshooter of ALL THE THINGS, and the driving force behind the technologies that make the Guild Hall's campus run, Jacob often thinks much like the computers he so admires. \u00a0Bret Gnat - Head Chef / Culinary Rockstar Chef Bret is the genius behind the incredible menu at The Chromatic Dragon. \u00a0With 20+ years of experience working in and running award-winning kitchens in the casual and fine dining industries, Bret is the craftsman behind the amazing desserts at The Chromatic Dragon: The Cake is a Fry (funnel cake fries), Jigglypuffs (tempura-fried cinnamon rolls), and Lakitu's Cloud (deep-fried Twinkies). \u00a0Well, guess what?!?! \u00a0Bret will be bringing those amazing recipes and flavors, plus a whole lot more, to our menu at 8-Bit Donuts! \u00a0Maximus the Pug - VP, Eatsies\u00a0/ Good Boy Maximus has been a donut lover for as long as he can remember, which, in most cases, is about five minutes. \u00a0He likes actual donuts, as well as donut-shaped toys. \u00a0Maximus is not as fond of coffee, but knows a thing or two about Leopold's Ice Cream: namely, that it is delicious and he would like some, thank you very much.\u00a0 \u00a0 Funding this project gives us a real boost toward getting the equipment and renovations we need to open our donut shop by January 2017.  Our needs fall into 3 categories: renovations, equipment, and arcade cabinets.  ---Renovation--- We've had the space at 530 MLK Jr. Blvd in downtown Savannah for almost a year now, but as many downtown buildings do, this location needs an almost complete overhaul to bring it up to code. \u00a0Of course, we've already invested in making this space look like the donutisserie (another word made up by Clegg!) of our dreams. But we need your help to finish it! Without these funds, we won't be able to get this project done. Storefront Windows ($1k-$5k) Again, the cost for these will all depend on what kind of glass we can afford and whether we happen to know any local contractors willing to give us a break!  Hint, hint! Savannah's Historic Review Board is psyched for us to replace the plywood-and-plexiglass facade with a real glass storefront. \u00a0But massive panes of storm-proof storefront glass are not cheaply bought or installed. \u00a0 Flooring ($1k - $5k) Half of the space is covered in some very old black and white checker laminate. And the floors are not exactly what you would call ... level. So, the cost here depends on whether we have enough to float the floor (making it level) and what sort of materials we can afford to cover the floor. (Did a vampire take this picture?!?) It may not look like much now, but this is where our coffee and donut bar will live! \u00a0 Ceiling Repair ($500-$3k) We can patch just the hole caused by a leak from the plumbing in the ceiling (you can see it in the pic below), or we can redo the entire ceiling. The latter is preferable, of course, but costs 6 times more. Lighting ($500 - $2k) The space has ugly ceiling fluorescents and ceiling fans from the 1980s (which is sort of ironic, if you think about it) and we could replace those with more modern and inexpensive fixtures of the same size or (and especially if we can repair the entire ceiling) we can switch to recessed cans or something a bit less ... institutional. With your help, we will turn this space into equal parts \"tasty donut shop\", \"comfy coffee shop hangout\" and \"nostalgic 80s arcade\". But we can't do it alone!\u00a0 ---Equipment--- We've got a hood installed already and we have our old oven, some mixers and glazing tables from Clegg's bakery. \u00a0But we still need a variety of donut and coffee related equipment. Donut Fryer ($500-$5k) - We need a donut fryer, and the better this Kickstarter performs, the better the machine we can afford. Proofing Cabinet ($500-$1k) - We need a proofing cabinet, which enables us to set the temperature and humidity necessary to create super fluffy donuts. \u00a0Again, if we raise more money, we can get a better proofer. All the Coffee Equipment!!! ($2k-$15k) We can make it all happen with as little as $2k or as much as $15k, when you factor in the espresso machine, coffee grinder, brewers, and assorted thingamabobs. --Arcade Cabinets-- This one just comes down to what we have left after getting the space ready. \u00a0If we had unlimited funds, there is room for 12-15 arcade cabinets and cocktail tables. \u00a0Generally, each of these cabinets costs $1,400-$2,000 to acquire. Examples:\u00a0 Galaga / Ms. Pac-Man / Pac-Man (Cocktail) - $1,400 Donkey Kong / Defender / Joust - $2,000 We will need about $50,000 to finish this space. Crazy, right? We are set our goal at $10,000 for a few reasons: (1) That's what we know we need to get the ball rolling on renovation of the space; (2) We wanted to start with an attainable goal and build from there; and (3) We've got some amazing stretch goals planned that will allow us to get to $50,000, if people really get behind what we're trying to accomplish in order to make this space come to life!  \u00a0We've got some great rewards for our Kickstarter backers! \u00a0Take a look! \u00a0Pledge $5 or more Big Money. Big Prizes. I love it! You'll get a special thank you video from Clegg. Plus we'll put your initials on the High Score List on our website and in the shop. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pledge $10 or more You'll get everything from the Smash TV, plus a free donut once our shop opens!

You know what? Let's make it a baker's dozen!

Say thank you in the best possible way: with donuts! This backer level comes with everything from the Gauntlet, plus we will deliver a dozen donuts to the Savannah area police station, fire station, hospital, or EMT crew of your choice. \u00a0 \u00a0 Pledge $125 or more Dan from accounting is right! You are one of the few, the proud, the epically generous backers willing to go the extra mile down what used to be called W. Broad St. Once we send you a fake beard exactly like the one Kevin Klinkenberg used in our video, you, too, can show up at our staff meetings pretending to be \"Dan from Accounting.\" Of course, you'll also get everything included in the Gauntlet. Plus, the fake beard. Did we mention the fake beard?!? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pledge $150 or more Fight like a robot!

  "Here we are, two years on from the creation of the first Providero Tea and Coffee House. It\u2019s been a wonderful ride to this point! We come to you now to ask you to join with us again in a new adventure! But first, here\u2019s a recap\u2026.. With the help and support of our amazing Kickstarter Community, our dreaming and hard work culminated in the opening of the Providero Tea and Coffee House in Llandudno Junction in January 2014.\u00a0 In two years we have served thousands of cups of the finest tea and coffee on the North Wales coast, alongside our famous home-made cakes and locally-baked bread.  We have continued to develop a wonderful customer base of regulars, many of whom have become friends with us, and with each other.  We have served visitors from all over the world and welcomed some fascinating characters through our door - it\u2019s been a privilege to offer this hospitality in our little corner of beautiful North Wales. \n Our team of 2 (Jon and Ellie!) has grown, to include James, Emma, Jake and Bronte - these fantastic people have joined their skills with ours, to make Providero what it is today; a thriving, bustling coffee house with a growing reputation for excellence and a warm welcome. Don\u2019t just take our word for it -\u00a0we have gained a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence (read some customer reviews here) and we have the great honour of being included as the only North Wales cafe in the next edition of the Northern\u00a0Independent Coffee Guide.\u00a0 Most days, Providero is bustling from the moment our doors open at 8am, to when we close at 6pm. There is an increasing number of occasions when customers can\u2019t find a seat, and there is a queue out of the door!\u00a0 We find more and more that we are feeling the limits of our little shop. Large groups can\u2019t find space to eat and drink together, freelance workers who want to set up office for the day in our cafe don\u2019t have the space to do so. We have to turn away requests to hire out our upstairs space for meetings, as we need it for customer turnover. It\u2019s a wonderful problem to have, but we want to be able to do more to meet and exceed our customer\u2019s high expectations and needs. Many people have asked when we are going to open somewhere else - somewhere bigger? As the demands on our small space have increased, we\u2019ve realised it\u2019s time to take the plunge and open Providero number 2! This won't mean losing our Junction home, but branching out and having a second place to welcome you to. We have come across a fantastic shop in the restaurant/cafe quarter of Llandudno, which has captured our imaginations. It already has A3 planning permission for use as a cafe (which is a real bonus!) There is also a lot more space! The premises has an outdoor pavement seating area, accessible toilet and babychange facilities, and scope for a food prep room meaning we could at last offer tempting light lunch options, alongside our range of teas, coffees and cakes.\u00a0 Huge bowls of healthy salads would await you, along with a hearty homemade soups of the day and local breads. \u00a0The emphasis on our lunches would be simple, tasty, healthy food that you could enjoy in or take away with you.\u00a0 We would incorporate more brew methods for our coffees, giving you more choice and showcasing how versatile and delicious all our coffees can be. We'll have more retail products - stuff you can buy to make the perfect brew at home, or perfect gifts for loved ones!\u00a0 We\u2019d love to stock craft beers and wines and be open late on Fridays and Saturdays for you to hang out and start your weekend properly! We\u2019d open too for sleepy Sundays - Come and read the weekend paper, play board games with your family and friends or sip a coffee before taking a Sunday afternoon stroll on the Orme.  We\u2019d have a separate room available that could be booked out for private events or meetings. Ample plug sockets for laptop users, more space for groups and somewhere safe to lock your bikes. We\u2019ll have the room to host events and are already planning a few of our own. Rest assured though, our welcome, quality and ethos won\u2019t change. We were humbled and blown away by the generosity and support of our Kickstarter backers 2 years ago. To be honest it was an uncomfortable experience to be vulnerable and ask for you to give to that project. It\u2019s still uncomfortable!\u00a0 Although the cafe in Junction is profitable, there is not a lot left over after we have paid the bills, wages and suppliers. It is sustainable, but due to its size, it is limited in what it can achieve. We see it as a good thing to give people the opportunity to sow into Providero again at this important point of growth. To allow our supporters, customers and community to contribute to opening a new space from which they will benefit and enjoy. To allow people to influence and shape who and what they find on their local high-street.\u00a0 We also acknowledge that crowdfunding was foundational in what we became. It meant that a thread of gratitude, generosity and a sense of always looking to \u201cpay it forward\u201d has run through all that we have done. It shared the influence and the power to create something bright and new amongst a whole bunch of folk, far and wide. It meant that you are all part of us, and we are part of you. This concept has been beautifully depicted in our \u201cWall of Thanks\u201d artwork by Jen Mickelborough, which is displayed in the cafe. \u00a0 We\u2019re hoping to raise at least \u00a330,000\u00a0through Kickstarter.  You may not have the means or desire to pledge financially. That is totally fine! There is no obligation to whatsoever. However, if this resonates with you at all; if you would like to see a second, bigger Providero Tea and Coffee house in Llandudno, and you have the means to do so, please pledge. We would love your support and your involvement.\u00a0 The shop presently is an empty shell, with no catering facilities, just some plastered stud walls and falling-down ceiling tiles. A fairly extensive building and shop fit-out is needed to transform it into a beautiful cafe space with all the coffee and catering equipment we would require. We get the keys (therefore start paying rent) in July, and so would be on a tight timeframe to get the shop open as soon as possible.\u00a0 The good news is, we know a lot more what we\u2019re doing this time around! We have a much more realistic idea of the cost of equipment, for example. Many of our customers are already bringing useful contacts and advice for the aspects of the project that are unfamiliar to us. We have strong design concepts and are confident we can keep things on-time and on-budget. We know the full renovation and kitting out of the shop will cost more than \u00a330k. It will be more in the region of \u00a3100k with all the building and engineering works, equipment, furniture and stock required. It would be AMAZING if the Kickstarter campaign smashed this target of \u00a330k so we could keep our borrowing down and keep more of the money in the local economy and delivering on our vision for this new venture! We would love you to be a part of this next chapter of the Providero story!\u00a0Even if you can\u2019t pledge financially, please spread the word, tweet about the project, post it on Facebook! As always, ask us your questions, come and talk to us, or drop us an email. We are super-excited to turn this project into reality and we\u2019re really looking forward to welcoming you once again to our new Providero Tea & Coffee House in Llandudno! \u00a0",

According to the ajq'ij Edgar Choguaj: \"they suppose the probability and the possibility of 260 different personalities, at the same time diverse intelligences and minds, complex and ordered among themselves, as it is the nature and the universe-pluriverso with its pluriforms\". the Oxlajuj number (13) is always present for example in the 13 months of 20 days of the Cholqi'j or Mayan lunar calendar, the 13 Baqtunes, the Mayan long count calendar that marks a solar age.\u00a0\u00a0There are also 13 main joints that give movement to our body.\nThe festival and its components:\u00a0 The FICMAYAB 'takes place from 2 to 16 October 2018 in Guatemala and will have as main headquarters Totonicap\u00e1n, Quetzaltenango, Santiago Atitl\u00e1n, Guatemala City, Antigua Guatemala, Cob\u00e1n and Chisec in Alta Verapaz and the Estor in Izabal.\u00a0 The main component of FICMAYAB 'is the Official Exhibition, where the 92 selected filmworks from different parts of the world will be exhibited. In addition, parallel and complementary activities will be held as: Special Sample: Program for the exhibition of audiovisual works in addition to the Official Show. X International Communication Meeting  of Indigenous / Native Peoples: Meeting of communicators and communicators involved with the media and Indigenous / Native Peoples, in which topics of interest will be discussed, experiences will be shared and articulated actions and strategies will be traced. Political Forum of Indigenous / Native Peoples: Space for discussion and proposals on aspects of interest for Indigenous Peoples; exchange with representatives of local movements, regional struggles and communicators. Festilab: Space for workshops and practical work for the exchange of ideas and knowledge, with the presence of filmmakers, producers and artists from different regions, cultures and experiences. Community visits: opportunity to approach and exchange with local communities with whom to learn successful examples of self-determined local development. Artistic activities: Dances, music, theater, photography and plastic arts, among others. CLACPI General Assembly: An Ordinary Assembly will be held to evaluate what has been done and draw up the work plan for the next period. The venue for the next Festival and the persons and organizations that will occupy the various positions and commissions in this organization will be chosen. What will the funds be used for?\nIn order to cover lodging, food and transportation for 100 indigenous communicators and communicators from Guatemala during the 15 days of the festival. For production expenses: production of music events, medical insurance, consumables, equipment rentals, artists' fees, among many other things.\u00a0 The International Festival of Cinema and Communication of the Indigenous  Peoples is one of main activities for CLACPI, we are people of diverse organizations of several countries of Latin America, that as a network, since 1985, we made a great variety of activities of collaboration, exchange and mutual support in communication from an integral perspective, as well as in the training, production, diffusion of indigenous film and video. The activity that most characterizes CLACPI, and the one that has remained constant throughout its life has been the celebration of the International Film and Video Festival of Indigenous Peoples. This event, held on a rotating basis in the different venues of the organizations that make up CLACPI, consists of the concentration of people and audiovisual productions, which in turn entail enormous knowledge, experience and especially important messages from indigenous peoples regarding their situation , rights, proposals and struggles.\u00a0 CLACPI has 12 Festivals celebrated in different parts of the territory of Abya Yala. The Anaconda Prize should also be mentioned as an international and pioneering initiative since 2000, of an itinerant nature and of indigenous and Afro-descendant community protagonism. With your contribution you are supporting the growing movement of indigenous filmmakers from Latin America.",
  "[English below] 1. Cos\u2019\u00e8 il Fantafestival? Un po\u2019 di storia\u2026 Il Fantafestival \u00e8 il pi\u00f9 longevo festival italiano dedicato al cinema fantastico in tutte le sue declinazioni: fantascienza, horror, fantasy, paranormale, gotico e altri generi affini, con alle spalle ben 37 edizioni! Probabilmente molti gi\u00e0 lo conosceranno, ma \u00e8 giusto raccontare un po\u2019 della sua storia, per tutti coloro che non hanno ancora avuto modo di sperimentarlo in prima persona. Il Fantafestival nasce a Roma nel 1981, come diretta derivazione delle rassegne di cinema di fantascienza organizzate per il circuito Italnoleggio negli anni \u201974-\u201977 e delle grandi kermesse di cinema fantastico con le quali il Cineclub Tevere di Roma connot\u00f2 la propria programmazione a partire dal \u201975. Iniziato al cinema Clodio nell\u2019ottobre del 1981 e poi passato, negli anni, come sede principale prima al complesso Capranica-Capranichetta, poi al Barberini, al Quattro Fontane e al Savoy, il festival si \u00e8 sempre caratterizzato per il taglio popolare, indirizzato al grande pubblico degli appassionati. Le ali del pipistrello del Fantafestival hanno volano negli anni nei cieli di altre citt\u00e0 italiane, come Milano, Ravenna, Napoli, Verona e Genova. Grazie alle numerose collaborazioni internazionali inoltre nel 1986 il Fantafestival, insieme ai Festival di Bruxelles, di Sitges (Spagna) e di Oporto (Portogallo) \u00e8 tra i soci fondatori della European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation (www.melies.org). Sul palco e sugli schermi del Fantafestival sono passati i nomi pi\u00f9 illustri del cinema fantastico italiano e internazionale: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, George A. Romero, Roger Corman, David Cronenberg, Sam Raimi, Peter Cushing, Malcolm McDowell, Peter Jackson, Alejandro Jodorowsky, John Phillip Law, Rutger Hauer, Tobe Hooper, Lloyd Kaufman, Brian Yuzna, Robert Englund, John Carpenter, Ursula Andress, Barbara Steele, Dario Argento, Carlo Rambaldi, Dino De Laurentiis, Dante Ferretti, Sergio Stivaletti, Lamberto Bava e molti altri ancora. 2. Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival? La raccolta fondi per l\u2019edizione 2018 Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival? Questa \u00e8 la domanda che ci siamo fatti e che vi facciamo quando abbiamo toccato con mano l\u2019impossibilit\u00e0 di organizzare la 38esima edizione del nostro festival. La causa \u00e8 dovuta alla riduzione, fino all\u2019annullamento, dei finanziamenti pubblici, grazie ai quali finora siamo riusciti a proporre con continuit\u00e0 e in crescita la manifestazione. Un calo al quale ci siamo rifiutati di cedere, rispondendo con investimenti personali e la forza della nostra passione, grazie all\u2019affetto che da sempre il pubblico ha dimostrato nei confronti della kermesse. Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival? Ma soprattutto, che mondo \u00e8 \u201ccon\u201d Il Fantafestival? La realt\u00e0 dei festival cinematografici \u00e8 profondamente cambiata nell\u2019arco dei 37 anni di vita del Fantafestival. Da diversi anni il festival ha focalizzato gran parte della sua attenzione alle produzioni di giovani autori italiani e internazionali. Registi e produttori indipendenti di corti e lungometraggi a cui il Fantafestival ha dato spazio nell\u2019ottica di promuovere idee nuove, giovani talenti, per riuscire a metterli in contatto con il destinatario ultimo delle loro opere: il pubblico. E sono stati diversi i casi in cui un giovane filmmaker esordiente, anche grazie alla visibilit\u00e0 ottenuta con il Fantafestival, abbia poi proseguito la sua carriera fino ad arrivare alla distribuzione nazionale in sala. Ci\u00f2 che unisce il Fantafestival, i filmmaker e gli spettatori \u00e8 proprio la passione verso il cinema fantastico. Una passione che di certo non pu\u00f2 scomparire per una mancanza di budget. Abbiamo pensato che un mondo senza Fantafestival non debba esistere e abbiamo deciso di chiedervi aiuto, proprio come molti filmmaker fanno per riuscire a portare a compimento la loro opera. Chiediamo aiuto a tutti coloro che, anno dopo anno, ci raccontano di come la loro passione per il cinema di genere fantastico sia nata proprio durante le nostre passate edizioni e ai pi\u00f9 giovani che vorranno entrare a far parte del nostro mondo! 3. La 38esima edizione Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival lo potete scoprire ironicamente all\u2019interno dello spot che vede protagonisti i nostri Luca Ruocco e Marcello Rossi, girato con il supporto del regista Paolo Gaudio (premiato proprio al Fantafestival per il suo lungometraggio d\u2019esordio Fantasticherie di un passeggiatore solitario). Nel mondo reale, l\u2019assenza del Fantafestival non porterebbe alla sparizione del fantastico dalla vita di tutti i suoi fan, ma di certo segnerebbe la scomparsa di una pagina importante nella storia della cultura italiana horror, fantasy e fantascientifica. Se vorrete darci una mano a salvare la 38esima edizione del Fantafestival avrete la nostra eterna gratitudine e ci aiuterete a coprire le spese organizzative di base di questa nuova avventura che si svolger\u00e0 negli spazi del Nuovo Cinema Aquila, a Roma a Dicembre 2018.

A brief history\u2026 Fantafestival is the oldest Italian festival dedicated to fantastic cinema, covering all its sub-genres: science fiction, horror, fantasy, paranormal, gothic and other similar genres, and it now counts 37 editions! Many of you probably have already heard of Fantafestival, but it\u2019s fair to tell some of his history, for all those who haven\u2019t experimented it in first person. Fantafestival was born in Rome in 1981, following the experiences of science fiction movies exhibitions made for distribution Italnoleggio during \u201974-\u201977, and following the successful science fiction programming of Cineclub Tevere in Rome, starting from \u201975. First held at Clodio theatre in October 1981, and then in several other locations, the Capranica-Capranichetta complex, the Barberini theatre, the Quattro Fontane theatre and finally at the Savoy theatre, the festival has always been addressed to the large audience of fans. During the years, Fantafestival\u2019s bat had flown in other Italian cities: Milan, Ravenna, Naples, Verona and Genoa. Thank to various international collaborations, in 1986 Fantafestival along with the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, the Festival Internacional de Cinema de Catalunya of Sitges (Spain), and the Fantasporto (Oporto, Portugal) is among the funding members of the European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation (www.melies.org). The stage and the screens of Fantafestival have seen all the most important names of fantastic cinema, both Italian and international: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, George A. Romero, Roger Corman, David Cronenberg, Sam Raimi, Peter Cushing, Malcolm McDowell, Peter Jackson, Alejandro Jodorowsky, John Phillip Law, Rutger Hauer, Tobe Hooper, Lloyd Kaufman, Brian Yuzna, Robert Englund, John Carpenter, Ursula Andress, Barbara Steele, Dario Argento, Carlo Rambaldi, Dino De Laurentiis, Dante Ferretti, Sergio Stivaletti, Lamberto Bava and many more. 2. What the world would be like without Fantafestival? The crowdfunding for 2018 What the world would be like without Fantafestival? This is the question we asked ourselves when we realized that it would not be possible to organize the 38th edition of our festival. The reason for this is the constant decrease, down to zero, of the state funding, which in the past allowed us to present an ever growing event. In these last years we decided not to surrender to the funding decrease, compensating it both with personal investments and with our passion, thanks to the affection of Fantafestival\u2019s audience. What the world would be like without Fantafestival? But more importantly, what is the world like \u201cwith\u201d Fantafestival? The world of film festival has deeply changed during the 37 years of life of Fantafestival. For several years now our festival is focusing on independent productions of Italian and foreign filmmakers. Independent directors and producers to whom Fantafestival gave space, in order to promote new ideas and young talents, to put them in contact with the ultimate recipients of their work: the audience. And more than once, thanks to the visibility they had in Fantafestival, young filmmakers went on with their career up to have national theatre distribution of their movies. What brings together Fantafestival, filmmakers and the audience is passion for fantastic cinema. A passion which does not disappear just for the lack of budget. So we decided that a world without Fantafestival should not exist, and we decided to ask for your help, just like many filmmakers do to complete their works. We ask for help from all those that, year after year, tell us how their passion was born in Fantafestival\u2019s past editions and to the younger fans who want to join this world! 3. The 38th edition You can ironically find out what the world would be like without Fantafestival in our spot, with the organizers Luca Ruocco and Marcello Rossi, directed by Paolo Gaudio (who was awarded by Fantafestival for his debut movie Reveries of a Solitary Walker). In the real world, the disappearance of Fantafestival certainly would not deprive all the fan of fantastic cinema, but it would mean to eradicate an important page from the history of Italian fantastic culture. If you\u2019ll help us to save the 38th edition of Fantafestival, you\u2019ll have our eternal gratitude, and you\u2019ll help us to cover the basis expenses for this new adventure that will be held at Nuovo Cinema Aquila in Rome on December 2018. But this is not all: to thank you for your small or big help, Fantafestival will have a gift for each one of you. Here you can find the gifts list. 4.

  "Expedition to the Arctic Circle\u00a0 I am embarking on a photographic expedition to the western shores of Greenland along the southern edge of the Arctic Circle. \u00a0My name is Emanuel Dimitri Volakis and I have been creating black and white photographs for over 27 years. My interest in photography began when I was eleven years old. My professional career as a fine artist commenced in my twenties. I have been working full time as an independent artist for almost three decades.\u00a0\u00a0 My past work has focused on the aesthetics and achievements of humanity from ancient times to the modern age. \u00a0I have photographed the ruins at Pompeii, created an extensive body of work on the Gardens at Versailles and completed additional series on baroque sculpture, architecture and the urban landscape throughout Western Europe and North America. My photographic travels have taken me to many unique regions across North America including Yosemite, Mineral King, \u00a0the Olympic Peninsula, the northern coast of California, Zion and Bryce Canyon in the South West. \u00a0My love of the natural world and the animals that inhabit these wild spaces have been an intrinsic part of my life as an environmentalist, naturalist and activist. The principles of my aesthetics rest on four major pillars. The exclusive use of available light, sharp contrast, bold compositional elements and lastly a sense of timelessness that transports the viewer to a moment beyond the present. I will apply these same core principles on this expedition in order to create images that will capture the mystery and intrigue of this magical land beyond time. This new series will focus exclusively on the natural world and the animals that live there. I will be staging from an icebreaker class expedition ship via zodiac watercraft and by sea kayak in order to fully immerse myself in this remote environment and get as close as possible to the various creatures of the region.\u00a0 I have three distinct photographic objectives for this trip. I will be creating a series of images of icebergs and glaciers treated as architectural studies, capturing the phenomena of the Aurora Borealis, and creating a series of black and white portraits of animals living within the Arctic Circle. I will be shooting primarily in black and white utilizing traditional film cameras including 35mm, medium format and 4x5. \u00a0I will also utilize digital cameras to capture the Aurora Borealis in full color. The expedition will last 16 days followed by several months of darkroom work, photo editing and printing. I am offering open edition and limited edition photographs (meticulously hand printed silver gelatin prints and archival pigment prints) to accommodate all levels of patronage. In addition, I will be offering non exclusive digital assets (film stills, videos and jpegs) as rewards for entry level patrons. I am also offering a few unique rewards for those patrons who want to support the campaign in a more substantial way.\u00a0 If you are inspired by this endeavor and want to support traditional analog photography as an art form, please back this project so that I may create a body of work of this ephemeral place and the majestic animals that live there. Thank you for considering this project.\u00a0 A short note on the timeline for rewards fulfillment. For those supporters who would rather receive a reward sooner than later (2019 vs 2020), you are welcome to choose from a selection of images of my past work. Images from this expedition will become available over time as I develop film, scan and tune negatives and make prints in the darkroom. The process can take months (after returning with 100+ rolls of film) so patience is a must when it comes to analog photography. I will be leaving in August of 2019 for the Arctic and returning in mid September. Rest assured that I will work diligently to process and proof all the negatives as quickly as possible. The more money I raise through this campaign, the more time I can devote to completing this project with no interruptions when I return.\u00a0It is my goal to have working proofs by December/January of this year and to begin to offer images for patrons to review by the Spring of 2020...or possibly sooner. All rewards should be fulfilled by Summer of 2020.\u00a0",
  "Hello, My name is Daryl and I run a small Etsy store where I sell enamel pins and other products of my designs. Typically, I try to focus on designing and selling original characters, but I recently played through the PS3 classic Ni No Kuni and was inspired to design my first keychain.\u00a0 Here are some specifics: Assurance: All pledge money received will go straight into the production and manufacturing of this keychain. The manufacturer that I work with does require 100 piece minimum, so I don't foresee having much money leftover. If there does happen to be some funds left over, all the remainder will go toward purchasing new backing cards and other such items for packaging.",
  "Thank you for taking the time to stop and look at my campaign! I'm Sam, sole artist and owner of Little Lunar Rabbit Designs. Ultimately, the goal of this campaign is to get some pins made. To help make the project more manageable, the initial goal was a relatively low one - being only one pin. Rather than running the campaign for all 10 designs and risk not being able to fund everything, I had hoped that by breaking the project into smaller chunks, we would be able to produce as many as we could! We're now a ways into the campaign, and the original campaign is beyond successfully funded! Since we do still have some time left, I have added 4 all new bonus designs, re-released the original Crystal Bunny pin, and added on some really fun milestone stretch goals!\u00a0 The pin that started it all - my crystal bunny design! Having made this one, having gone through the whole process of making my own vector art, translating the emblem into a pin, and finally getting the finished piece in hand is what sparked my desire to finish the rest of the series. It was such a wonderful experience working with the manufacturer for this design, that I am very much looking forward to working with them on the future designs! Due to the insanely unexpected success of this campaign, this pin is now available as an add-on for $11 each, and will be available as a selection for your pledge!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For those of you who are familiar to Kickstarter, this is simply a little refresher. And for those of you who are checking it out for the first time, here's a breakdown for how things go! - Pledge your reward: Choose which reward tier you'd like to \"pledge,\" this is your own placeholder in the project funding, payment isn't due yet, so hang tight! Pledging is zero risk - you pay when the campaign ends and are free to edit your pledge at any time while the campaign is running! - Campaign runs for 30 days, goals are met, and pins are unlocked!\u00a0 - Campaign ends, you select which pins you'd like from the unlocked designs through a project end backer survey. This is where your pledge payment is processed.\u00a0 - Kickstarter releases funds after 2 weeks, and pins are sent into production! - Pins are mailed to me, sorted, and then mailed out to you! \u00a0Finally on to the fun stuff - the best part, and why you're all here - the pins!! After the campaign is over, the intent is to sell the pins at $12 each.\u00a0 As a thank you for participating in the campaign and helping me reach my goal, I've set two special price brackets for this project. The \"Early Bird\" pricing is a limited pricing option, available on a first come, first serve basis. The pins in those select brackets will be $10 each, and come with a free holographic vinyl sticker. After that, the Kickstarter exclusive pricing will be $11 each. - If you would like to pledge for more than 10 pins, all you have to do is add $11 per pin to your pledge! - The holographic sticker will also be available as a pledge add-on, which will be discussed more in the \"Extras\" section - on to the pins! \u00a0All of the stretch goal pins will be: With the campaign having been so successfully funded in such a short amount of time, I've decided to add some additional bonus designs! These designs were not originally a part of the campaign, but after much request, will now be as well! Due to the fact that they were not a part of the initial campaign, designs may be subject to slight modifications after approval from the manufacturer. Any updates to these designs will be announced as needed. \u00a0Exclusive to this project, I'm making an extra special holographic sticker! They will be weather safe, and UV coated, so you may blind your enemies with shiny moon-powered love, either inside or outside! While Early Bird participants will be getting this sticker for free, you can also pledge for it by itself, or add it into your pin pledge! The holographic stickers will be $4 each.\u00a0 You may add as many stickers as you'd like to your pledge, just by adding 4 times the amount of stickers you'd like. For example: If you'd like one pin, but two stickers, you would add $8 to your $11 pledge. It's that easy! You will be able to specify that quantity to me when you get your backer survey. Once this project is over, this sticker will be gone forever!\u00a0 Additional Pins - If you would like more pins than currently offered as a reward tier, you may absolutely add on any additional pins from the entire collection (including the Crystal Bunny pin!) for $11 each! When I send out the backer survey, you will be able to specify how many of which pins you'd like. The campaign has officially hit 10k!! I am absolutely astounded by your support for this project, and as we continue to hit new milestones, I'll be announcing new free gifts!\u00a0 \u00a0((Sample image courtesy of StickerApp, sample designs by @AskSweetCream on Twitter))\u00a0 For every pin pledged, all backers will now receive a FREE 2\" tall metallic chrome sticker to match! So if you've pledged for let's say one Mercury pin, you will receive one free matching Mercury sticker! If you've pledged for the Full Collection - Bonus Edition . . . that's right! you'll receive a free sticker for all 15 pin designs!\u00a0 If you would like additional chrome stickers, you are more than welcome to add them to your pledge for $2 each! I will have a fully comprehensive backer survey at the end of the campaign to designate how many of which kinds of additional stickers you'd like, as well as your pin selection.\u00a0 As a thank you for sharing the project for me, I'll be including a free galaxy aesthetic lanyard with every backer's pledge (please note this does not include the \"Lunar Love\" tier - only for those who are getting items shipped to them!)! \u00a0 They'll be 2 cm wide, galaxy print, with a matching aesthetic to the campaign imagery. You'll be able to put your pins on it without it clashing, or you'll be able to just have a space themed lanyard for whatever use you'd like! I know I'm gonna use mine for holding my con badges! They'll also feature my Little Lunar Bun on them, though the placement may change to the back of the neck.\u00a0 \u00a0 For those of you who do share the project, be sure to tag me (@LittleLunarRabbitDesigns on both Instagram and Facebook - if your Instgram account is set to private, be sure to take a screenshot and send it to me, otherwise I might not see it!) and be entered to win a FREE Sailor Guardian Spirit Jersey!\u00a0 \u00a0That's right! \"The Moonlight is a Messenger of Love\" design is officially unlocked as a 2 inch soft enamel, rainbow plated key chain with a matching heart shaped clasp! This bonus item is free to anyone who pledges for 3 or more pins! So. Everything looks good, you've made your pledge, and now you're just . . . waiting. Here's the projected timeline for how everything will go:\u00a0 Added into this timeline is a production buffer, should the manufacturer need additional time to complete the pins. Please keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and while I will absolutely do my best to stick to it, these are still human made items that may require a little patience. Any delays will be very transparently addressed in a timely manner. My full time job is also that of a stay at home mom, so packaging pins may also take me some time. And that's just about it guys! Thank you so much for stopping by, for your pledges so far, and for all the support you continue to give! If you'd like to help out in a non-financial way, I've created two images (square format and \"stories\" format) that you could use to share the project outside of Kickstarter! It would mean the WORLD to me if we could get to that 15K stretch goal! And if you'd like to tag me in any posts, I'm @LittleLunarRabbitDesigns on Instagram, and @LilLunarRabbit on Twitter! Thanks again!\u00a0 Square: Stories: \u00a0As I mentioned before, I'm Sam. An avid Sailor Moon fan (collector, fan artist and even cosplayer!), with a fantastical love of all things space themed. As a girl, I used to sit after school and get insanely hyped for Sailor Moon to come on, and then later that very night hang out on our back deck with my dad, looking up at the stars with our Polaris telescope.\u00a0 While my life didn't take me down the path of astronomy, I have always held the stars close to my heart, and try to incorporate them into as much of my life and art as possible. Crossing that with my love for Sailor Moon was an absolute no-brainer.\u00a0 My professional art journey actually started with Sailor Moon, as my first real series work ever completed. To date, I've drawn all ten scouts, Tuxedo Mask and Luna's human form, with more characters planned for the future. With each drawing, I created an emblem to pair with each portrait, which sparked one of my most successful lines to date. The pins here are variants of those very emblems, with a new twist, specific to these pin designs.\u00a0 To see more of my work, you're more than welcome to follow me on all of my social media platforms! Facebook || Instagram || Tumblr || Twitter || Etsy Before I wrap this up, I wanted to take a couple moments to thank those who have helped me so much throughout this project, from advice on how to start this project, to the pin production itself, all the way to annoying little design questions. I wouldn't have felt the confidence I do in running this campaign without their help. Vivian Tong || Sketchbeetle Art - Sheila Wong || Sheila Wong Design & Illustration - Salt Squad Queen || SharkCafeArt - Mellanie Chafe || LuniaraMC And lastly, my own personal cheer-leading squad - Daci, Toni, Kat, Kieran, and my husband.\u00a0 A little late, but a super important one that I missed - Santana. Without her final push, honestly, I wouldn't have thought this was possible.\u00a0 \u00a0The benefit about Kickstarter is that while the campaign is running, everything is risk free. You can change your mind not only about how much you pledge, but also if you want to pledge at all. While I genuinely hope you'll be here for the whole journey, I do understand if you need to back out!\u00a0 A couple of things to remember:",
  "Mes expositions \u00a0\u00ab\u00a0Collages & Photomontages\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0en Islande 2019 Des collages ! Voil\u00e0 plus de 40 ans que j'en r\u00e9alise. Tout d'abord sur papier, dans mes jeunes ann\u00e9es, cela aboutira \u00e0 3 expositions en Provence (France) dans les ann\u00e9es 80' qui remporteront un certain succ\u00e8s. Je pressens les potentialit\u00e9s du num\u00e9rique dans ce domaine particulier, mais je reste \u00ab\u00a0timide\u00a0\u00bb bien que techniquement toujours tr\u00e8s investi... Puis arrive la R\u00e9volution Num\u00e9rique g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, mes Collages & Photomontages reprennent depuis 2017 mais sous une forme r\u00e9solument num\u00e9rique et d\u00e9sormais en ultra haute d\u00e9finition avec des programmes informatiques extraordinaires de finesse et de pr\u00e9cision. En 2018, j'\u00e9prouve l'imp\u00e9rieux d\u00e9sir de franchir le pas : exposer, montrer, s'exposer aussi d'une certaine fa\u00e7on ... au regard d'autrui. Un plaisir et une souffrance... Le lieu sera vite choisi, l'ISLANDE, mon pays d'adoption o\u00f9 j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu plusieurs ann\u00e9es et o\u00f9 une bonne partie de ma famille r\u00e9side. Je soumets un pr\u00e9-projet d'exposition en 2018 au Mus\u00e9e National de Reykjavik qui sera rapidement accept\u00e9 : un bel encouragement ! Le th\u00e8me retenu sera : Beauty and the Beast, 21 tableaux r\u00e9alis\u00e9s en 1 an sp\u00e9cialement pour l'occasion Deux lieux d'exposition me sont attribu\u00e9s, l'un \u00e0 Reykjavik (Juin et Juillet 2019), l'autre \u00e0 Akureyri (Ao\u00fbt et Septembre 2019). Par ailleurs j'explore de nouvelles opportunit\u00e9s en Islande (2019-2020) mais aussi en Suisse et en Allemagne pour l'avenir le plus proche. La difficult\u00e9, vous pouvez-vous en douter, se r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00eatre assez rapidement financi\u00e8re. Je d\u00e9couvre l'envers du d\u00e9cor : les co\u00fbts de fabrication, de transports, d'importation (de France \u00e0 Islande), ainsi que toute la logistique aff\u00e9rente : catalogues imprim\u00e9es, tirages tests en haute d\u00e9finition, affiches multilingues, voire cartes postales en couleurs et autres produits d\u00e9riv\u00e9s... Je ne suis qu'un tr\u00e8s modeste enseignant, Artiste en dilettante d'une certaine fa\u00e7on, inconnu ou du moins m\u00e9connu du public, et n'aspirant qu'\u00e0 exposer des \u0153uvres que je consid\u00e8re personnellement comme tr\u00e8s atypiques et originales. Il ne suffit (h\u00e9las) pas de cr\u00e9er, d'imaginer, d'exprimer ; il faut \u00e9galement utiliser les techniques d'impression les plus modernes et les plus sophistiqu\u00e9es, projeter les formats (qui peuvent \u00eatre g\u00e9ants v\u00e9ritablement, un vrai bonheur), ajuster les \u00e9chelles d'impression, d\u00e9finir des profils de couleurs pour obtenir les meilleurs r\u00e9sultats graphiques.\u00a0 Il faut choisir les qualit\u00e9s d'impression, les formes, les tailles, les encadrements, les modes d'accrochage. Il faut tenter l'excellence avec de petits moyens logistiques.\u00a0 Tout cela a un co\u00fbt qui exc\u00e8de en bonne part mes moyens ordinaires : c'est la raison pour laquelle je fais aujourd'hui (et pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans ma vie) appel \u00e0 vos dons ! Vous pouvez m'aider ... \u00e0 aller au bout de ce projet artistique. Vous pouvez me permettre de r\u00e9aliser dans les meilleures conditions, ces deux expositions islandaises (publiques et gratuites) pr\u00e9vues pour l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2019. C'est maintenant, l\u00e0, presque tout de suite car le temps passe vite ! Je compte sur vous ! Vous pouvez compter sur moi.... Amicales pens\u00e9es, Michel S.",
  "My name is Artimus Wolz and I am an artist, filmmaker, and comedian who is raising funds for my debut comedy album titled 'CHAOS'. With your help, I can bring this project into existence. The concept for CHAOS came after the success of my viral comedy TikTok 'Incompedance' which satirizes the relationship phenomenon known as weaponized incompetence. After amassing over 8 million views with more than 200,000 listens on Spotify, I began planning a full length comedy album. My vision for CHAOS is a piece of art that not only makes you laugh but also provides the cathartic feeling found only when confronting your inner trauma. I want to establish a new style of comedy that pushes humor to the brink of its own destruction. To make an album that makes you laugh, cry, dance, scream at the top of your lungs and, ultimately, rejoice, by embracing the painful parts of life as a path to reclaiming power--like a lifelong fever break. \u00a0I want to create CHAOS.\u00a0 With your support I'll be able to bring this album to fruition. The funds will be used for studio time during the month of March to produce the album, marketing materials for the release, and personal living expenses during production. Targeted release date is Summer 2022.",
  "Food\n Happens: A Teaching Garden will provide an environment where all are \nwelcome to come and learn about where our food comes from.\u00a0\u00a0 Where? Lyndhurst, New Jersey on a cement patio behind a commercial space on the main street. Why do we need the donations? \u00a0What will they be used for?\u00a0 We need to buy many items for the garden from the straw bales that will be the foundation of the garden since we have a cement back yard, to soaking hoses, a repair that just materialized - fixing the outside water spigot (which broke with the deep freeze we had this winter) the seedlings (organic and GMO free) the support brackets for the climbing plants, gardening tools, rain collection barrels, lady bugs, some soil, gloves for the volunteers, and the list goes on. We also want to give each person that is receiving food for their family from the local food pantries a free copy of the recipe book Good and Cheap - How to eat on $4/day by Leanne Brown along with some produce from the garden as well as cooking lessons and nutrition education and so much more.  \n\n\u00a0 We need to separate the space from the neighbors property so we will need to build a fence which we want to make a living fence with wooden pallets and landscape fabric. Soil in along with more plants will fill the vertical pallets which will make every possible area available for food production. Here are current photos so you can appreciate what needs to be done and where the donations will go. Since it is all cement - the straw bales are a perfect option - and will show others that there are work a rounds, affordable ones, that are available.\n\n\u00a0 Why is this needed? It all\n started when the creator of the garden project and founder of Weight \nWellness Center was doing a nutrition intervention at an elementary \nschool for first and second graders.\u00a0 She was discussing different foods and held up ripe, red tomatoes.\u00a0 She asked the class what they were.\u00a0 \"Cherries\" exclaimed one girl,\u00a0 \" Apples\" said another, \"Zucchini\", \"Limes\" ... many answered were offered but none of them correct until finally a child yelled out, \"Tomatoes!\"\u00a0 That \nalone was bothersome. Then she asked where they came from. \"Shop Rite!\"\u00a0\n was the resounding response.\u00a0 This was when it became apparent that \nchildren, especially, need to connect with the food on their plate.\u00a0 \nBut adults have to be on board too to make this happen! There\n is an overweight and obesity epidemic in this country.\u00a0 The CDC states \nthat, \"If left unchecked, Americans born after the year 2000 will be the\n first generation of Americans to die at a younger age than their \nparents.\"\u00a0 WOW.\u00a0 Connecting families to their food is one step towards \nhelping to address this epidemic.  Research findings published March 2015 in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes found that of the 9,000 children they studied 40 \npercent did not have good cholesterol levels, almost none ate a healthy \ndiet regularly, and 30 percent were overweight or obese.\u00a0 If a child starts off with a healthy diet and active lifestyle, he or \nshe is far less likely to develop chronic, expensive diseases that can \ntake years off a productive life. More than 90 percent of children got too little fruits and vegetables, according to the report. Discussions about food, cooking at home, limiting sugary beverages, teaching children about food sources,\u00a0\n including them in food shopping and meal preparation are some \nthings parents can do to introduce these concepts to children from a \nyoung age.\u00a0 Food Happens: A Teaching Garden will be a way to make this happen. The Food Happens: A Teaching Garden project will help community members get back to \"playing in the dirt\" and\n understanding how much effort goes into producing one red tomato, from \nso many aspects.\u00a0 Then, when finally experiencing that moment when a \nripe tomato, warmed by the sun, is picked, sprinkled with a little salt \nand bitten into; As those warm juices run down a forearm, it all comes \ntogether!\u00a0\u00a0 \"Garden\n Angels\" have already donated a standing garden bed so people with back \nor joint troubles, those in wheelchairs, anyone that can't bend or kneel\n can still participate.\u00a0 A shade canopy has also been pledged, and an \noutdoor portable garden sink too!\u00a0 This is important because the garden \nwill be made available to the Special Angels Recreation program for \nchildren and young adults with Autism. Fragile X, Down Syndrome, \nCerebral Palsy, ADD, ADHD and other different needs.The location is ADA \ncompliant and accessible to all.\u00a0 Straw bale planters will be featured predominantly and will complete the \nspace. Weight Wellness Center\u2122 will donate time in their teaching kitchen to continue the education. \u00a0By providing cooking demos, tasting events and more, they\n will fully engage the participants in making the most of the garden \nbounty in ways that are easy, delicious, nutritious and budget friendly. Surplus from the garden will be made available to local soup kitchens through the Rock and Wrap It Up\u2122 food recovery program. The passion that we have for all things food\u00a0is abundant and will be shared free of charge! \u00a0That is the biggest reason why we need the funds - so we can provide all the services and surplus FREE OF CHARGE with the help of your donations!",
  "David Mack and Riley Reid have been friends and collaborators of mine for years. The beauty of a relationship predicated on creative collaboration is that every interaction can turn into something bigger.\u00a0\u00a0 David and I constantly bounce ideas off one another, and this initiative is no different. The three of us sat in a small room covered in cats, and wondered whether we could collaborate on something both compelling and hyper focused, playing to each of our strengths. Photography is a curious art in that it is infinitely repeatable, especially in the digital age. I've always been interested in ways to circumvent that.\u00a0 My first book, Temple of Art, showcased art painted onto portraits of the artists by the artists themselves. This project explores that idea via the medium of a single subject;\u00a0a photographic canvas with Riley as the ineffable foundation for David's original art. David will create 100 unique ink paintings on top of an 11x14 archival photograph of Riley; no two prints will be the same.\u00a0 They will all be original, collaborative pieces of art. Staggering models Dominique and Jiz Lee, together with the unassailable David Mack. David brought his own definitive style to my portrait of Dominique, so the final cover of this LTD book is an amalgam of all of us. Each of the 100 books will be signed and numbered, and will also include an original sketch by David, and the 8x10 metallic print!\u00a0",
  "To date I have published six monograms, coffee table books composed of my photography, male figure studies with a sexy and sometimes erotic edge. My first monogram, Masculinity was released through a small publisher and in limited quantity. The book sold out within a couple of years of its release, and since then I have received many requests for a re-print or a second edition. \n\nIn this second edition I have made small adjustments. Weaker photos have been replaced with stronger images. However, I have been careful to use only images from the same photo shoots represented in the original book or of the same time period - my earliest work. This second edition is about 90% original to the first edition. At first I was going to print it as a soft cover, but when I received my printing quotes, going hard cover with a dust jacket made more sense. This second edition will be the same size as the first, 13.5 X 10.4 inches, the standard size of all my monograms. It will be 128 pages with a full retail price of $99.\n\n Collector\u2019s Edition \n\nA special edition will be available in a limited quantity of 250 copies. Over the years I have been perfecting these Special Editions, and I now print an image on top of the clothbound cover, which is stamped with foil lettering. The book will fit into a slip case, which is also clothbound with foil lettering. The book will be hand stamped, hand numbered and hand signed.  Below is a sample of my Collector\u2019s Edition from 2016. Please note that there is just one book for this project as opposed to the two-book Collector's Edition from 2016.",
  "\"Just Get There\" is my first young adult novel. Normally I write 18+ horror, heavy on the zombies, crime, and thrillers. In 2015 I wrote a short story called \"The Treehouse\" for a charity anthology called \"Bite-Sized Offerings: Tales & Legends of the Zombie Apocalypse.\" All the proceeds of the book were to help a friend whose daughter had to have open heart surgery. \u00a0The book is still very popular on Amazon and all the proceeds are still going to help her with the ongoing medical bills. My friend (the one the charity was for) suggested I turn \"The Treehouse\" into a full-sized book. \u201cYou have to do it!\u201d she said to me. Several years later I started it, and several years after that I finished it. I've tried to get it published and met with some problems. I submitted \u201cJust Get There\u201d and it was accepted immediately to a small press for publication. Books are published in order, based on when they are accepted and there were two books ahead of mine. Unfortunately, right before my book was to be worked on, the company closed down. Since I believe there is a reason for everything, I pushed on and kept searching for a home. I went on to submit to another publisher and was accepted, only to have that publisher fold as well. I thought I might self-publish, I have in the past with my collection and short story series, but the cost of editing and formatting a full-size novel is more than I can afford right now.\u00a0 Your help can make this happen! \u201cJust Get There\u201d It's summertime and the kids who live on Indigo Street are hanging out at their treehouse like they do every day. But today is different. The zombie outbreak has started and now they are trapped in their treehouse alone. While their parents' struggle to come together and rescue their kids, the children do their best to survive. Once they come together, they escape the city where they face new challenges. \u201cJust Get There\u201d is a young adult book that follows a group of children, and their parents as well, at the beginning of a zombie outbreak. It will take skill and ingenuity to stay safe, but these kids prove they have both.",
  "What do you get when you cross a creative singer-songwriter, a master instrumentalist and arranger, and a genius in recording, mixing, and mastering? You get \"Junglecorp\". We are three guys - Andrew Grumelot, Dan Bacon, and Ryan Aughenbaugh - and together we create a new album every 4 months. Each album is based off a different theme given to us by Ollie Collins, the Artistic director and founder of \"Monkey With A Hat On\" and \"The 10 Minute Playfest\". The next theme is \"Fire\" and boy do we have a story for you! It's a parody of the failed music fest \"Fyre Festival\" from 2017. We record a new CD and perform a live show 3 times a year at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland OR. This will be our 4th album and each time it gets bigger and better! \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Promo from a previous Play Fest, \"Science\" Junglecorp first assembled when they met \u201cMonkey With A Hat On\u201d, a theater company that creates live and local theater in Portland, Oregon. Three times a year the Monkeys release a theme and the next one is fire. Anyone can be a part of it whether you would like to write a play, act, direct, or help with sound, music or lighting, and all you need to do is volunteer! Junglecorp, the Monkeys\u2019 house band, creates a musical story made up of 8 songs to help transition each play. \u00a0 Ryan Aughenbaugh, our experienced studio man extraordinaire, works with his professional studio equipment to capture all the tracks. Then he mixes those tracks into a super cool sound. After that we have our artist, Michelle Baldwin, create some sweet album art for us and then send it to my absolute favorite CD fabrication company, Atomic Disc, out in Salem, OR for printing. This all takes about two weeks and in the end we will have a kick-ass album. The CD/digital release will be available June 6th, 2019. \u00a0 Every member of Junglecorp is passionate about music and performance. We are dedicated to entertaining you with awesome music and fun stories. We put our heart and soul into each project, and we don't stop until its great! Support local musicians and keep Portland dancing! We love you all, and we hope that you will help us create this awesome memory with you, \"Fire Fest\" the album. \u00a0Some of the rewards John Betty And The Heartshakers - Denial (Official Video) Friends and associates",
  "My Own Private Hollywood (or MOPH, for short) is an independently owned film festival that travels from city to city exhibiting short and feature-length films and movies from creatives all over the world--although, for now, we're limiting submissions to those from the U.S.  Each year, we select projects that are fresh, illuminating and unconventional enough to not only showcase the producers' talents but also tell original stories and captivate new audiences.  Our objective is to not necessarily push creatives to Hollywood but pull \"Hollywood\" to them by allowing individuals to start their own production companies and improve their local economies.\u00a0  Our mission is to enhance the marketing, distributing and merchandising opportunities for creatives worldwide, allowing them to successfully enter the entertainment industry without facing adversity, prejudice or nepotism.  We feel that if \"unknowns\" display their works in venues and arenas outside the internet, they can penetrate more markets, capture wider audiences, discover merchandising opportunities not yet realized and obtain greater recognition.  Their bold endeavors might even influence other hopefuls to pursue their dreams as well, ultimately allowing aspiring moviemakers to lead better, more fulfilled lives.\u00a0  You can learn more about MOPH or submit content at http://events.the1613s.net/moph/.  We plan to host MOPH in one of Seattle's theaters, colleges or interior settings.  At the site, a patron may pay $5 for a single ticket and at least $1 for a food or drink item.  The ticket pays for his/her admission to the event, from the moment of receipt to the end of its course.  If you receive a forever ticket, you can attend MOPH for free once a year.  This ticket doesn't pay for concessions--although we do offer vouchers for that--and CAN'T be transferred or sold to another individual.  Upon entering the screening room, our staff will validate your ticket, allowing you to exit and return to the site if needed.\u00a0  50% of revenue generated from ticket and concession sales during the event, sans the Washington state sales tax, will be equally disbursed to all creatives whose content appeared in the festival.  These payments are their royalties.  The other 50% will go to MOPH itself.  The payee of a royalty is the individual or company that submitted the featured content.  If the payee receives more than $600, he/she/it will be required to complete a W-9, after which he/she/it we receive a check of his/her/its earnings and, after the start of the new year, a 1099-MISC, which the IRS requires both parties to file.\u00a0  The amount a creative receives in royalty is determined by the number of products sold.  For example, if 200 $5 tickets and 400 $3 snacks at an event with 20 individuals or companies exhibiting content, each creative will receive $55, whether or not he/she/it attends MOPH.  Because your pledge buys you a ticket, 50% of it will also go to the creatives.  The other 50% [of your pledges] will go to MOPH, used for the expenses listed below.\u00a0  Creatives whose work is chosen to appear in MOPH will receive an email [from us] asking if he/she/it would like to display a resume and headshot at the site.  We plan to invite not only patrons but also local filmmakers, TV outlets and other such people in the [film/TV/media] industry to watch our creatives' content, review their materials and converse with them.\u00a0  Creatives may also showcase and sell their own merchandise, such as DVDs, toys, T-shirts, etc., promoting their or other people's work.  Merchandisers keep 100% of the income they collect [from their sales].\u00a0  After the film fest, we plan to host a mingle session where creatives, industry insiders and patrons can chat and network [with each other].  We'll have more confirmed info about MOPH's site location, the movies we've chosen [to appear], and everything else by June 30, 2017.\u00a0  We'll use OUR portion of your pledges to purchase the things and people needed to host, manage and execute the event.  These necessities include but are not limited to: We plan to run the film festival [in Seattle] during July or August of 2017.\u00a0  Sometime after MOPH 2017, we plan to exhibit and distribute our creatives featured and non-featured submissions on the official 1613 Productions website, which is still in development.  Here, users can watch, download and purchase copies of their favorite MOPH content.  The launch of this site of course depends of the success of the events.  If MOPH 2017 shows promise, we'll start constructing the 1613 Productions site sometime after January 2018.  We\u2019ll keep everybody informed of its progress via or Facebook (http://facebook.com/gomoph), Twitter (http://twitter.com/themophevent) and Google+ (http://plus.google.com/114569763683513917816/) pages.\u00a0  After a few years, again, depending on MOPH success, we'd like to produce a film/movie showcase featuring everybody's favorite content to appear on Netflix, Hulu or even cable TV.  Each season's showcase could coincide with the previous year(s) content.\u00a0  A:   What is a forever ticket? Q:   It is a personal laminated ticket a single recipient can use in any city at least once a year.  One could use it year-after-year or hold on to it until MOPH visits a region close by (go to http://events.the1613s.net/moph/about.php#cities to see the cities we plan to visit).  The ticket contains ten (10) slots, one of which to be stamped per event.  After it's been exhausted, we'll automatically send the ticket holder a replacement ticket [to be used for another ten years].  If he/she/it decides to no longer participate in the forever ticket program, he/she/it can inform us before the ticket's expiration date and we'll immediately cease future renewals.",
  "\"As a transaction, taking a photograph sounds free and easy, but like most things, quickly complicates. The currency of Carl Martin\u2019s pictures is the cash of curiosity; time well spent in the presence of a new neighbor, in a friend\u2019s backyard. Earnest, ongoing delight in discovering a new way to witness what\u2019s familiar.These are pictures of persistent freshness.\" - Michael David Murphy My practice for over twenty-five years has been to acknowledge and elevate existing culture using the intersection of subtle human gesture and a built social environment. Say, a casual side glance, a slight shifting of weight on one leg, the fold and tone of a particular arm, or the slight body twist and raising of face just over the shoulder to engage a viewer, within a sub or urban setting. I think that artists create moments with perspective and gesture to define a new entity. I believe that these entities can speak to our humanity and experience as human beings and communicate a link and alignment within ourselves to others.\n The work in this book spans the decade of the 1990\u02bbs to about 2001 or so. During that time period I was lucky enough to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship to support this project. There are several bodies of work within this project that have amalgamated as a single entity, which, as I write this, has no overarching title. The collections within the work, all made in Athens, GA, are specifically: Men Of Georgia, Towards Salvage, Elevator, Downtowners, and Systems of Organization. The smaller bodies of work within the project represent different conceptual approaches to the culture of a small town; I would try to convince myself that I was \u201cdoing something entirely new\u201d only to realize later that my stance was very much the same, looking at the same material with a slightly different framework. It was like peeling an onion, different layers but the same onion, and not from a traveler's perspective, but as a working member of the community. I hope the amalgamated body of work speaks clearly about the experience of being human and communicates a link and alignment within ourselves to others. The goal has always been to \u201cconstruct\u201d an image, almost like a building, from the raw elements that we find in our community. My thoughts are that this structural framework would give an image a sculptural presence, a little bit of power, that could allow it to reach an audience and hence allow the subject a rightful due of attention.\n I am thrilled that this edit from these bodies of work is now being published as this book, simply titled Carl Martin, by Fall Line Press, based in Atlanta, GA in 2018. Thank you immensely for your support, we truly cannot make this book without you so every donation makes a difference! Carl Martin: The Book Details Publisher's Note: \"The Carl Martin photographs, taken in Athens, Georgia, over a span of 25 years is a meditation on the nature of what it is for a human being to see and be seen \u2013 how do we present ourselves to the world and how is that presentation received \u2013 what does it mean?  Ultimately this is not a document that is specific to a place or time. It is more akin to a universal canvasing and inventory of the human condition in the ordinary.  Yet this plain, clear taking-in with a camera and film places us in closer touch with the quirky, transcendent living presence of Carl's Athens, Georgia, neighbors and friends than you might have ever have imagined possible. We feel we are looking through Carl\u2019s eyes. And we are amazed. Supported by a Guggenheim Fellowship these photographs found Carl and fortunately they have now found us all.  A beautiful, truthful portrait in almost 60 pictures of  our time and place and people.  Fall Line Press is grateful to have a hand in moving this book into the world and we are grateful to our friends on Kickstarter for helping us make it happen.\" William Boling Publisher,\u00a0Fall Line Press \u2014 Atlanta, Georgia 2018 Please Join Us We hope you, the Kickstarter community, will help support the Fall Line Press publication of this book of photographs.

  "I've been offered the opportunity of my first solo exhibition for my fine art photography.\u00a0 It will take place at Shaw's Arts Cafe in Blackpool from 2 March 2018 for six weeks. I shoot exclusively on black and white film and print using processes from the Victorian era such as cyanotype, salt print, van dyke brown and kallitype. As a final year Photography BA(Hons) degree student at Blackpool and the Fylde College, a solo exhibition will contribute enormously to both my university work and potentially begin my career as a creative practitioner.\u00a0 In order to turn this opportunity into a\u00a0reality I need to raise the money to: On display will be highlights of my various experimental photography from the past twelve months. If you're able to support this opportunity I will be extremely grateful.",
  "I am an author with several years of amateur fiction-writing experience and professional nonfiction-writing experience. I write, edit, and produce both fiction reviews and writing advice videos on YouTube on a weekly basis, but my dream has always been to write fiction professionally. If this Kickstarter campaign succeeds, I will have realized that dream\u2014however briefly. For this Kickstarter campaign, I plan on writing a YA novel about Iliana Rostov, a young girl who has recently begun her freshman year at high school. Iliana loves to be popular and the center of attention, but her guilty pleasure is that she also loves to read old books. This passion of hers leads her to an old bookstore, really just a hole in the wall of a strip mall, and while there she discovers that its proprietor, James Mayfield, is a practitioner of real black magic. This fascinates Iliana, and so the rest of the story will be her learning black magic as his part-time apprentice. The setting for the novel will be a fictional city in the American Midwest. The format will be mostly episodic, and so the book will consist of loosely connected short stories that will build to a climax in the final section. Each section will focus on a different aspect of magical theory, a different magical danger or threat, and a different opportunity for Iliana to grow and mature. The main hook for the novel is that I will be referencing real magical practices that people actually use to this day. That means stuff like Hermetic demon summoning, alchemy, kabbalah, Tarot readings, and auguries. You know all those conservative parents who worry that Dungeons and Dragons leads to Satanism or that the Harry Potter books teach witchcraft? I want this novel to be their worst nightmare. However, I also want the book to be instructional without being dry and to teach wholesome life lessons about the value of friendship, the usefulness of a broad education, the need for self-reflection, and so on. The sum I'm asking for will go in its entirety to pay for my living expenses so that I can work on the novel full-time. Last year I managed to write a 70,000-word novel in under four months, and I believe I can do so again. Since the book will be episodic, I estimate that each episode will be around 10,000 words and thus consist of between 5-10 stories. While I would be perfectly happy if this project somehow reached its initial goal, if a miracle happens and we exceed the goal by $1000 it will enable me to continue writing for longer; I will therefore add one more story that I originally planned to the book and open one more story prompt for someone to claim. In the unlikely event that pledges keep coming, I will continue adding stories for every $1000 extra. The project image was contributed by Kyle Pearce via Flickr and CCL: https://www.flickr.com/photos/keepitsurreal/11698524166 The following novels (written by me) are currently available on Amazon's Kindle marketplace: Practical Wizardry The Golden Assassin The Silver Stone The Iron Prince Skye Flight To give you an idea of what I can write, the following excerpt is from Skye Flight and is written from the perspective of a six-year-old girl. After the meal, Marty started teaching Nella some new spells. He said it was because she was the best person to cast spells now that he couldn\u2019t use his hands. That made her happy, but it didn\u2019t make her surprised. Her mommy always told her she was good at learning quick, and her daddy had so much trouble flying when all he had to do was pretend to fall up or sideways. She still liked flying in a plane more since she could relax, but magic was getting more and more fun now that she was learning all the things it could do. The first rule was that you always had to touch the thing you wanted to cast a spell on. But you could get around that a little by casting spells on the air and then moving the air. It made saying the spell harder and cost more argen-ton, though. You could also put a spell in a stone and then throw the stone at someone, but doing that cost a lot, too. So if you could do something by touching it, you touched it. The second rule was that you had to think about exactly what you wanted when you cast a spell. If you thought about anything else, bad stuff happened. Stuff like people blowing up or turning inside-out, or rooms lighting on fire. Nella knew Marty wasn\u2019t just trying to scare her, because he looked scared too when he told her about it. Maybe that\u2019s why he was a scaredy sheep? Because he saw someone turn inside-out? She almost asked him that, but then she remembered that her mommy told her how questions like that were rude.",
  "The Oak House is a coffeehouse, craft beer, and wine lounge located in the heart of downtown Elon.

  "ABOUT THIS PROJECT: Choose\nYour Favorite Photographs! Traditional Silver Gelatin Photographic Prints \u2013 A Century of Photographic Tradition\n\u2013 100 Years of Permanence Crafted by Hand in the Analog Method of the 20th Century\nMasters My 50 year Journey in Photography \u2013 Kickstarting the Future! Have you ever visited a museum photography exhibit and\nviewed an Ansel Adams or Edward Weston 8\u201dx10\u201d image made by contact printing,\nthat is, direct printing of an 8\u201dx10\u201d negative onto photographic paper to make\nthe positive image? For example, Ansel\u2019s \u201cHalf Dome\u201d? Or possibly Weston\u2019s\n\u201cNautilus\u201d?  The exquisite detail of these beautifully composed images is\nunsurpassed, the range of tonal values is exceptional, and after many decades\n(some for nearly 100 years), these prints have maintained their original beauty and\naesthetic appeal unscathed by time.  \u00a0 How did the masters\ndo it?  \n\nOnce the subject matter was contemplated and decided, many\nof these great photographs were made with an 8x10 view camera, one that exposes\nimages on 8\u201dx10\u201d negatives and captures TONS of detail. They were often contact\nprinted, that is, directly printed through the negative onto 8\u201dx10\u201d\nphotographic paper while in contact with it, that is, a 1:1 image transfer with\nNO enlarging involved. (Weston did this exclusively.)  \n\nThere is simply no higher resolution method to print an\nimage with all of its detail. Please\nsee the video (by Jen Scovern) and the detailed process description at the end.\u00a0\u00a0An 8x10 negative can also be enlarged, though the 8x10 size conveys a feeling of\nintimacy with the subject matter while affording comfortable viewing.  \n\nThose silver gelatin prints were processed to achieve\narchival status: Extensive washing and many were toned with selenium (not brown\nsepia, BTW). That\u2019s why they still remain as beautiful as the day they were\nmade.  \nYour prints in this\nKickstarter project will be created with this same aesthetic emphasis and time-proven\nphotographic craft.  What do you get? You get hand-crafted, 8\u201dx10\u201d analog silver gelatin contact prints\nwith beautiful tonality and image detail taken by me with an 8x10 Deardorff\nview camera.  They are hand-printed by me on double weight, fiber based,\nglossy photographic paper in my darkroom.\u00a0\nAfter selenium-toning, each print is processed to archival longevity, mounted,\nsigned, titled, and over matted to 14\u201dx18\" on high quality mat board.  Note that the final image size is approximately 7\u201d x 9\u201d,\nplus or minus a bit - it varies because contact images are cropped by trimming\nthem. They are ready for you to frame. There is NO digital anything about these\nprinted images.  This project offers a choice of six different images.\nThey\u2019ll look outstanding in in your house, apartment or office. Or make a great\ngift! These are the six images\nall taken by me from which you can choose:  1. Apple Tree: Taken\nin August 2007 on a very windy hilltop in Colrain, MA. A strong storm was\nmoving up the east coast. Had to wait for a lull between gusts to do the long,\n2 second \u00a0exposure with fingers crossed. The\nold tree feels like it still has its own energy.  2. Two Chairs: I\nhad planned to make a portrait of the owners of our cottage in Johnson, VT the\nprevious day in August 2008, but it poured rain. They had to leave and there\nwas thick fog the next morning. So I made this image of the two chairs in which\nthey would have sat.  3. Ed and Maureen\u2019s Hands: A few years ago I assembled a \u201cGathering of Hands\u201d\nexhibit. My then elderly neighbors sat for a photo in May 2005. Their hands\nnestled together naturally. The exposure was 35 seconds long and to my\namazement they were utterly stone-still.  4. Cornfield: In late August 2014 I was setting up for a different scene when an acquaintance pulled\nover and said I should turn around and look across the road. The once blue sky had\nabruptly changed and was full of drama. The corn rows had their own quiet wave\nhappening. This was part of a 38 image series called \u201cTwelve Summers in\nColrain\u201d. The corn rows have not been re-planted since.  5. Horseshoe Crab: An ancient ocean dweller. Part of a series\ncalled \u201cPhysical Intimacy\u201d. Found the shell on the beach on the North Shore of\nMassachusetts some years ago. Taken December 2016. 6. Frank Lee Laundry: In Natick, MA, this laundry has been in business\nfor many decades. The image was taken from across a busy main street while\nstanding in the driveway of a gas station. The gas station owner was very accommodating.\nAfter asking a just- parked truck to \u201cplease, please\u201d move and waiting for the\ntraffic and parade of Halloween teens to briefly clear, I made this single\nexposure in October 2014.  Who am I?  My photographic career began after receiving a box camera as\na gift in about 1963 (I still have it! \u2013 check out the photo). Over the years I\u2019ve\nprogressed through all major formats that encompassed mediums of both color and\nblack & white. Photography is now well integrated into my life.  Please visit my website for a broad overview of my\nphotographic pursuits: https://charlesfendrock.wordpress.com/ Nothing for sale there yet \u2013 Kickstarter supporters get\nfirst dibs! Today my favorite medium is the 8x10 Deardorff large format view\ncamera using black and white film, closely followed by B&W in both 20x24\nUltra Large Format (no kidding) and 4x5 Large Format, but those are other\nstories for future Kickstarter projects!  \n\nUsing the Zone System, the 8x10 camera produces an image of\ntremendous clarity and range of tonal values.  \u00a0 \n\nIn college I had the great privilege of studying photography\nunder Minor White, a quiet, humble man and great photographer and teacher.\nMinor completely changed my view of photography. Richard Albertine, another\nunderstudy who recently passed away, took the above photo of Minor in 1971.  \n\nAt that same university, a few decades later, for some years\nI volunteered to give students large format and darkroom workshops. It was\nhighly enjoyable.  \n\nNow it\u2019s time for a change. A further goal of this\nKickstarter project is to \u201ckickstart\u201d my second career, my future, this one in\nphotography. Photography has been an important part of me for over 50 years and\nthe time has now come to bring it up in front with this project. This is my\nfirst Kickstarter, bringing to others what I\u2019ve immensely enjoyed all of my\nlife: beautiful, carefully hand-made, virtually permanent silver gelatin\nphotographs in the tradition of the great 19th century photographers.\n \n\nIf successful, others projects are in the works, all of\nwhich involve traditional but way bigger-than-life photographic mediums, some\nliterally, and some conceptually.  What\u2019s does the process involve? \u00a0 \u00a0 Making these prints involves using both hands and standing\nup all day in dull orange safelight \u2013 there\u2019s no selecting a file, running an\napp & clicking a mouse, then grabbing the image off a printer. Have a look\nat the pictures. That\u2019s an 8x10 negative in the front, BTW. The process quick-guide\ngoes like this:  Develop\nthe Negative: Already done for these Kickstarter Images. But in a nutshell:  In total darkness run the negative through\nDeveloper, Stop and Fixer.  Wash thoroughly in water.  Rinse in distilled water + photo flow to avoid\nany water spots and hang to dry.  Exposing\nthe Photographic Paper: Place the negative into the contact printing\nframe \u2013 mini-vacuum ALL dust first! Put the photographic paper behind the negative\nand close the spring back of the printing frame \u2013 I use the old Century contact\nprinting frame in the picture.  Make test exposure(s) to understand and\ndetermine the exposure and contrast requirements to achieve the range of tonal\nvalues originally visualized.  This is the\ncritical step and can be a meticulous and time consuming effort. Make the final exposures on fresh sheets of\nphotographic paper performing any dodging and burning of specific areas on the\nprint as determined by the test exposures.  Processing\nthe Exposed Paper: Run the exposed paper through the Developer, Stop\nand Fixer baths with proper times.  Wash thoroughly. Treat with fixer remover (also called hypo\nclearing agent).  Wash again thoroughly.  Tone with selenium to enhance the blacks, subtly\nshift the tonality, and make the print quite permanent. (Note: Selenium toning\nis not sepia toning, which produces a\nbrown cast and softens the overall image tonality.)  Wash again and re-treat with hypo clear.  Wash very thoroughly for final archival\nlongevity.  Squeegee each print gently back and front and\ndry overnight.  VOILA! NOW\nWE HAVE A DRY, UNMOUNTED PRINT! Next\u2026 Spotting\nand Mounting the Print:  Look at each print very closely and spot-out any\nminiscule white spots that were caused by residual dust flecks on the negative or\npaper using a really tiny brush and spotting solution, matching the tonality of\nthe area being spotted. Use of a magnifier (and bifocals) is recommended.  Attach the dry mount tissue to the print back\nwith a tacking iron.  Trim the print to properly crop it and make the\ndry mount tissue an exact fit.  Carefully position the print and tack two opposite\ncorners of the tissue to the mat board.  Run the print through the hot dry mount press. Finishing\nthe Print:  Title, sign and date the print mat.  Attach the over-mat \u201cwindow\u201d with hinge tape Package the print into the protective sleeve and\nmailing carton.  How well does this\nelaborate process work?  \n\nBelow are two images: I made the Wood &\nSteel Abstraction in June 1973 on an industrial back street in Cambridge, MA. I\nadmit that it\u2019s only 44 years old. But the image is still as beautiful as the\nday it was made \u2013 a pretty good start on a century. The second is an elegant\nprint of my Grandmother\u2019s wedding in about 1918. We\u2019ll never know how it was\nprocessed, but for a photograph to stay so magnificent for 99 years is no\naccident. Your handsome prints from this Kickstarter will equally withstand the\ntest of time.  \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "Hi there! Thanks for checking us out! Let us introduce ourselves first! We are Mycotech, a biotech startup company based in Bandung, Indonesia that dedicates ourselves to saving the world by using one of the Earth\u2019s most overlooked resources \u00a0\u2014 mushrooms. When we started our business in Bandung in 2012 as gourmet mushroom producers, we realized that there is so much more to mushrooms than meets the eye. We initiated our research by using what limited resources we can find \u2014 our mother\u2019s pressure cookers.\u00a0 What started as menial experiments quickly turned into one of our most explored research. While looking into the fast-growing infrastructure development in Indonesia, we discovered BIOBO, a mycelium board composite that uses no harmful chemicals as binder agents. Our mission? Delivering sustainable & affordable material from renewable resources \u2014 designed in style. #sustainabilityproject Now, we are excited to introduce to you the technology that can definitely replace animal & petroleum-based leather \u2014 Mylea\u2122\ufe0f! Textile is one of the most toxic industries in the world, and leather-processing is a very dangerous contributor to this business. When more people are interested in fashion, the consumption of bags as fashion items are also rising \u2013 and more animals are slaughtered. Almost one billion cows are killed each year, not counting the rare animals going extinct because they are being hunted for their skin.\u00a0 Between the tannery and the dye house, leather also receives multiple applications of chemical preservatives, colorants, stiffeners, and modifiers - chemicals that are dangerous to the environment and human health.\u00a0 Indonesians have already developed sophisticated biotechnology for the culinary department - one of them is Tempeh! Now, it's time to explore the possibilities! Tempeh, the traditional Indonesian dish, is made by combining white soybeans with fungus named Rhizopus oligosporus. The fungus's mycelium binds the soybeans together and made them solid. If you haven't had this delicacy, you're definitely missing out. However, we're more focused on how the mycelium binds the soybeans together \u00a0\u2014 and the method is what first inspired us into creating & developing bio leather that we named Mylea\u2122\ufe0f!\u00a0 #notleatherbutbetter Mylea is one of the products we present to save the world. It is the answer for questions thrown by the ethicals in the fashion business.\u00a0 Instead of making it to be eaten, we make it for fashion. And instead of soybeans, we recycle agricultural waste as growth medium. It\u2019s not leather, but it\u2019s better! #veganleather #notleatherbutbetter #savetheenvironment Unlike regular leather that needs to be dyed numerous times, Mylea\u2122\ufe0f can absorb dye faster & better, resulting in cheaper production cost & more vibrant colors. Oh, we're only using natural dye extracted from leaf, roots, and even food waste to add colors to Mylea. Trust us when we say the colors are much more unique. \u00a0So, why an alternative to leather? The regular one's just as good, right?\u00a0 Well, while the two are strong & sustainable, one uses extravagant number of resources, and the other needs only a few days & some water to grow & cultivate. Need the comparison, complete with numbers? Here's one for you. #environmental\u00a0 The numbers are great and all \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0but does it actually able to work like leather would? Instead of telling you all about it, we'll just show you what we've done with Mylea. Meet our newest collaboration work and the first wooden-mushroom watch to be made \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0the Pala X Mylea Watch. Collaborating with Pala Nusantara, one of the most prominent wooden watch maker in Indonesia, is a step to the right direction to save the world and maximizing the use of resources while saving them at the same time. Our watch is the perfect company for people who move about the world, and it's always nice to keep tabs on our necessities. And no worries, the Mycelium strap works just like regular leather \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0only greener! For you who prefer the classic pen-and-paper method of keeping notes, our traveler's journal is the one you need in your hands.\u00a0 We joined forces with Vitarlenology \u2014 local Indonesian book designer, crafter, and binder \u00a0\u2014 to create this beautiful, luxurious, and easily-customized journal to be with you every step you take around the Earth. While jumping from one location to another, don't forget to keep your cash & cards on hand. Carrying a thick, heavy wallet might not be efficient enough for you, so here we present a solution for you agile folks.\u00a0 The result of our collaboration with Cavcraft \u2014 local Bandung leather artisan \u2014 is a Mycelium Card Wallet that's small, concise, and can fit up to 4 cards \u00a0\u2014 plus room to spare for your cash & coins.\u00a0 \u00a0Have we mentioned that it's small enough to be hanged around your neck & still look cool?\u00a0 It's the perfect thing to complete your casual-work look!\u00a0 Thank you for supporting Mycotech & helping us create a sustainable future!

  "Hey, I'm Liz and i'm the creator and owner of The Snarky Company. I'm a photographer, artist, pin maker, and this is the third Kickstarter i've launched. I've worked as a freelance photographer, lived abroad in England, \u00a0traveled around Europe photographing different countries, I have a full time job at a rad tech startup, I own a pin company, I have both a bachelors and a masters degree, and my baking skills are Great British Bake Off level. All of that sounds really great on paper, but what that paper doesn't tell you, is that I struggled through hours and hours of work, and frustration, to accomplish those things...i've got ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. First and foremost, ADHD is my main squeeze, anxiety and depression are a result of living with ADHD. As is common with girls and women, I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until later in life. When a psychiatrist first said \"My professional opinion is that you have ADHD\", I just didn't believe her. I was a good kid, did marching band for 8 years, I did really well in school, and I was at the top of my class during my undergrad \u2013 surely she was mistaken.\u00a0 I researched the f*ck out of ADHD. The more I read, the more I realized that I carried the same misconceptions and ideologies that the general population does. I thought ADHD meant that you had trouble concentrating or sitting still. What I learned is that everything about ADHD is so complex, that it borders on being incomprehensible at times. Even the term Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is misleading and incorrect in describing what it is. The symptoms, the brain chemistry, the cognition, the neurological and genetic theories, are so far beyond \"not being able to pay attention\". \u00a0Every time I did research, and read about other people's stories, it was like someone was telling a story from my life.\u00a0 I studied film and media theory for my undergraduate degree, so for my master's degree I chose the Film, Photography, and Media studies program at Leeds University in England. One of the best things about studying media, is that it is so pervasive, that you can study pretty much any topic. The concentration of my master's degree was studying the representation of people with mental illnesses, and the associated stigma, through media, from the 19th century to the present (talk about getting really niche. I studied everything, from how people with mental illness were represented, to associated stigmas and their detrimental effects to all of society, and even what happens in the brain of a person with a mental illness, when they consume media. This resulted in a 42 page thesis and a photo essay that took a look into the small and intricate cues of my \"disorder\". Getting a post-graduate degree with ADHD was arduous, but at that time, I did it without stimulant drugs like adderall, and I graduated with honors.\u00a0 One of my dreams in life is to give a TED talk on ADHD, breaking down how the ADHD brain works, and what life is like living in a world where your brain works differently. I would gladly sit here and debunk whatever misconceptions are out there, but then we'd be here for years. This is just my story, but the whole campaign isn't just focused around ADHD. Needless to say, mental illness, mental health, and stigma are topics that are very near and dear to my heart. I have wanted to create this project for a very, very long time. You'll find that the first 9 pins of this project focus only on ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. I am aware that they are not the only mental illnesses that exist in this world. In fact, there are a multitude of different illnesses, disorders, and conditions. Mental health is unique to everyone, so I can only speak from my own experiences. While I would love to branch out and make pins for other illnesses, so that everyone feels heard and represented, I don't feel like I can interpret an illness that I have not experienced or lived through. I don't feel that I have that authority.\u00a0 While these pins are based off of my experiences, my hope is that maybe you'll find a pin that you can also relate to. If any of these pins resonate with you, remember that you're not alone, because I, as well as millions of other people, have gone through the same struggle. We may experience our illnesses in our own unique ways, but there are some common stigmas and experiences that we have all had to face. I also understand that some people may disagree with what I have to say, and that's totally cool, no one is forcing you to pledge to the campaign.\u00a0 When I was first diagnosed with three mental illnesses, I felt guilty, selfish, like I was a burden. I didn't want to believe it to be true about myself. I went to therapy, tried some medications, and kept it all on the down low. Then over the course of 6 years, in my early adulthood, I went through experiences that were traumatic for me. Soon after that it just kind of clicked for me. I was sitting in my room and out loud to myself I just said \"This is so f*cking dumb. I didn't choose this, my mental health problems are not my fault. Why have I allowed other people to dictate how I feel about my own life?\" It may have just been something I gained from age, or from some empowering sociology classes in college, but my best guess is that I came face to face with one of my deepest fears. Ever since then I have been 100% percent honest and open about my mental health, and the fact that I take medication and go to therapy. I realized that if you can just be a genuine person, and communicate honestly and openly to others, you'll learn that there are so many other people fighting the same fight, that have the same fears that you do. When someone stigmatizes you, for whatever reason, they're exerting power over you. This doesn't mean that they're always doing it maliciously, sometimes it's out of sheer ignorance or lack of knowledge. When I was younger, if someone called you a slut, it was an insult. If someone were to call me that today, i'd probably find it funny and laugh. It's a good example of a word that carried a stigma, and instead of fearing that stigma, overtime, women just took ownership of the word. We started speaking out about slut shaming, and about how women should be able to be open about their sexuality. Women took ownership of that label, and once we owned it, we took the power back.\u00a0 If someone tells me i'm being over emotional, I say \"yeah? so what. What's wrong with showing emotion?\" People don't know how to respond to that because then they have to admit, out loud, the unspoken rule that we always have to keep our emotions in check. A really sh*tty ex once called me crazy and erratic when I became emotional and anxious, from discovering his unfaithful activities and compulsive lying. Needless to say, that relationship did not last, and it has been over for some time. When we first got together, I had failed to see the red flag when he told me \"his ex had depression and emotional problems, and that she was crazy\". Recently, we had contact where we got on the topic of our relationship. He told me that he couldn't be calm and faithful when someone, (meaning me) was so volatile. Ironically, I had never even raised my voice at him, until I found out what he was doing behind my back. Let me interpret what he was really saying, \"I was unfaithful, and I didn't like your emotional and behavioral response to that, so that justifies my unfaithfulness.\" He tried to stigmatize my ADHD by saying I was erratic. He used my ADHD and anxiety as a scapegoat so he couldn't be held responsible for the pain he had caused me. At that time in our relationship, I had responded with a completely unapologetic emotional response. Did I take the high road, probably not. I said some terrible things out of anger, and did a few things out of pettiness. A good amount of time has passed since then, but from our last encounter a few months back, it's clear he hasn't changed. Many people have asked why I stayed so long. He had his own mental health issues, addictions, and vices, and for the longest time I was patient, forgiving, and I made every attempt to be understanding and to not stigmatize his issues...but I was not met with the same compassion. Indeed this is a long story of an ex, that involved so many more factors, but the importance here, is that this was the most traumatic time that anyone had ever used a mental health stigma to manipulate me, shame me, and take away my power. For a long time I was angry that I let someone do that to me, I felt weak, like I wasn't the strong, independent woman I wanted to be, but it was the most pivotal moment in my life. It was the moment I realized that if I just took ownership, than my ex, or anyone else, could never have that power over me again. I owned the stigma he tried to place on me, I took the power back, and I became a stronger, more empathetic, and caring person.\u00a0 When this Kickstarter meets its base goal, the first three brain pins will be unlocked. All pins after that will be unlocked when they hit their \"funds raised goal\". The pins will first be sold at an early bird price of $8 per pin, however, there are a limited quantity of early bird spots. When the early bird spots are gone, each pin will sell for $10 each, unless noted elsewhere. This campaign involves 20+ pin designs. More pins will be uncovered as our funding increases.\u00a0All pins in this campaign are hard enamel, unless noted elsewhere. *Please Read\u00a0 The Once Daily pin is the first time we are experimenting with new materials. The left side of the pill will be filled, by hand, with a special epoxy. This is so we can create the look of a pill with one colored half of the capsule, and the other side clear. We've ordered a test batch of these pins from the manufacturer, because I personally will be filling each pin with the epoxy. If the test does not work, and we realize this was a bust, we'll still produce these pins. The only change is that the clear part you see on the left will be filled with stained glass enamel. Stained glass enamel is not clear, but it does create a unique look. \u00a0The freebie pin is only included in pledge levels that include pins, meaning if you only pledged for the stickers, you won't receive this.\u00a0 *Please Read\u00a0 The Mosaic Heart is a pin that will contain stained glass enamel. The white part you see is regular white enamel, but the colored sections will be stained glass enamel. This process means that all the colored spots will be cut outs, that are then filled with an epoxy/enamel mixture. This produces an opaque look, somewhat like, well stained glass. If you hold it up to the light, the colored parts will show some light. While stained glass enamel can be beautiful, it is sometimes hard to produce, and can be risky. The color of the stained glass may vary from pin to pin, and there is the possibility of a few very tiny bubbles in the enamel. These should be minor things you will barely notice. The most important thing to note here is that this process can be expensive. If you choose this pin as one of the designs for your pledge level, it will be the only time you'll be able to get it at that price. After this campaign ends, this pin will retail for somewhere between $12-$15. If you've never seen stained glass enamel, google it, and you should find some examples.\u00a0 \u00a0*Please Read\u00a0 The rainbow pins you see above are what's called anodized, or rainbow, metal. The metal plating is a rainbow color that looks really nice in the light. Pins made with anodized metal will always be soft enamel. All pins in this campaign are hard enamel, unless noted otherwise. Below is photo of our logo pin so you can see what this metal looks like.\u00a0 \u00a0*Please Read\u00a0 The Spectrum pin will contain stained glass enamel. The white opaque part you see, inside the prism, will be a milky opaque stained glass enamel. If you hold it up to the light, some light should shine through the stained glass part. While stained glass enamel can be beautiful, it is sometimes hard to produce, and can be risky. The color of the stained glass may vary from pin to pin, and there is the possibility of a few very tiny bubbles in the enamel. These should be minor things you will barely notice. \u00a0I'm more than happy to create more label pins. I like fonts. If there is a label pin you'd like to request, please message me directly. Please message me with the mental illness, condition, or disorder, and how you think it should appear as a label. For example, if you have Bipolar Disorder, should the pin read Bipolar Disorder, or just Bipolar. Please also keep in mind that I will only create labels for another three conditions, because if I made one for every condition, we'd be here all damn day. Please don't message me with a physical illness or condition, for now \u00a0i'm only making these for mental illnesses recognized in the DSM-V. (i.e. Autism, Bipolar, PTSD, OCD, etc). I know there are some people who have qualms about \"labeling\". This pin isn't saying that your illness is all you are. I wear my ADHD related pins in hope that if someone wants to ask, i'm more than happy to answer any questions... and the next time my partner looks at my disorganized room with a smirk, i'm going to smile and point to this pin. Even though i'm only making another three label pins, this doesn't mean there that others won't appear in the future. Another note: It might seem that this stretch requires a much larger sum of funds raised to unlock. This is because even though these pins are small, they call for three seperate mold fees. Mold fees are paid only once, but they impact the cost when producing a new pin. \u00a0\u00a0 Freebie pins are only included in pledge levels that include pins, meaning if you only pledged for the stickers, you won't receive this.\u00a0 *Due to the nature of this pin and it's complexity, it's subject to change. We'll notify you of any changes made to this pin before your survey lockdown. The other day I did a rough estimate of how many pins we\u2019ll be manufacturing...and it was over 20K. That\u2019s alot of pins which means alot of backing cards. Now I know there are some of you out there who collect backing cards, some of you just throw them away, and some of you even graciously offered to not have one, but I like backing cards. I like designing backing cards, I like quality cards, and even before I launched this campaign, I was designing the backing cards for it in my head. I wanted to try something new, and having a campaign with such a high volume of pins, meant that this was the time to try it. So here\u2019s how the backing cards will work. We\u2019ll be using 4\u201dX6\u201d, 22pt stock, postcards, and each card will hold 4-6 pins depending on size. If you purchase one 1-2 pins, you\u2019ll receive your pins on a typical square backing card. If you purchase say 7 pins, then you might get 5 of them on a postcard and two on regular sized backing card. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to choose whether you receive postcards or individual backing cards, and you won\u2019t be able to specify which pins go with which cards. While buying more than 20K regular backing cards is possible, it would mean we would have to cut the quality. I won\u2019t do that for this campaign because I have a special idea in mind. Let\u2019s say that you purchased 5 pins, so you\u2019ll receive them all on a postcard, but you\u2019re really adamant about a single, regular sized, backing card, because maybe you want to give one pin as a gift. In this case you\u2019ll be able to purchase a single backing card in the add-ons section for 25 cents a piece. (also take note that freebie pins come in the regular factory bag and not on a backing card) After this Kickstarter campaign has ended, Kickstarter will collect the funds for your pledge level. If your payment is declined, Kickstarter allows you 7 days to \"fix\" your pledge. If you miss the 7 days, you will still have the opportunity to reinstate your pledge through your BackerKit survey. After these 7 days have passed, we will send you a survey from a pledge manager called BackerKit. This survey will first ask pledge level questions, this is where you designate which designs you want. Once you've finished your pledge questions, the designs you've chosen are automatically added to your item list. After pledge questions, you'll go through an add-ons section (sort of like an exit through gift shop situation) Add-ons are optional, and do not affect the items from your pledge level. We haven't posted pictures yet, but here are some things you can expect to find in the Add-Ons section. - Stickers (both sticker packs, and individual stickers) - Locking backs - Pins from previous campaigns or what we have in stock at that time - Any extra pins you might want from this campaign Keep checking back, as i'll soon add the sticker design mockups.\u00a0 Below are the first four stickers for the add-ons section. There are more to come, and not all are just sticker versions of the pins. The stickers range in size from roughly 2\" - 5\".\u00a0 It's hard to show what a holographic overlay looks like on a sticker mockup. It's essentially and overlay that reflects back a full spectrum of rainbow colors when you move it around in the light. Below are holographic stickers that Snarky Co. has made in the past.\u00a0 What is an Add-On Stretch Goal?\u00a0 The reason we use a pledge manager like BackerKit, is because it allows us to create more comprehensive surveys, and streamline our shipping process. BackerKit has a feature called an Add-On Stretch Goal. For my first campaign, I had an idea for a t-shirt design, but I didn't know if anyone would actually want to buy it. So I contacted some screen printing companies, priced out t-shirts, and then added it to the add-ons section of the survey. Three people ordered it. Whenever you manufacture a product, there's a minimum order quantity. The minimum quantity is usually the product at is highest price. To have t-shirts printed, I needed 50 people to order them, and that didn't happen. I ended up contacting those three people and letting know that I had removed the t-shirt from their order, and that they wouldn't be charged for it.\u00a0 The add-on stretch goal will show up in the add-on sections, and it'll have a banner that says something like \"Hey we need 50 people to make this happen\". As people add this item to their carts you can see whether this product is going to be made or not. When you complete your survey, if you add any extra items, you'll be prompted for your card details. You won't be charged when you complete your survey. You'll be charged at the lockdown date, and we'll notify you when that date is. If we don't meet the minimum quantity for an add-on stretch goal you may have ordered, then it is removed from your order, and you are not charged for it. This allows us to put out other products like patches, t-shirts, and key chains, to see if people actually respond to them. It's essentially a fail-safe, if we like a t-shirt design, but then find out no one else does, we aren't stuck manufacturing 50 t-shirts because only one person ordered it.\u00a0 We are still talking to manufacturers to work out pricing on all these items, so we don't have a price estimate at the moment. What we do know, is that we are offering add-on stretch goal items at a discounted price to Kickstarter backers only. If you pre-order these items after the campaign, you'll order them at full price.\u00a0 Below is a somewhat blurry photo of a chenille patch. The red and light green are the chenille, which is a soft fuzzy material. The seeds and stem are done in embroidery, and the black outline is felt. Chenille patches are often what you see on varsity letterman jackets.\u00a0 \u00a0T-Shirts During the Kickstarter campaign you can pledge a monetary amount in any of the pledge levels. Your money won't be withdrawn from your payment method until the end of the campaign. Funds will only be collected if we meet our goal.\u00a0 After the campaign ends, your funds will be drawn from Kickstarter, and then you will be sent a survey to pick out your rewards and add your shipping info. We will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to send out surveys. There will also be an add-ons section to your survey, where you can add on extra items, such as sticker packs, locking metal backs, or additional pins.\u00a0Payment details will be collected in your survey to pay for any last minute added items.\u00a0 Once the funds have been released from Kickstarter I can start production! Once orders have been locked down we have a no refund or return policy. After orders are locked and funds are secured, production orders will be placed and paid for. The amount of funds determines the quantities that we need to fulfill this campaign. We will only offer refunds for extenuating circumstances or if you rewards were damaged in transit.\u00a0\u00a0 Shipping for your pledge level will be collected on Kickstarter during the campaign. This project is only shipping to the following countries:\u00a0USA, Canada, The United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland.\u00a0 If there is another country you'd like us to consider shipping to, please contact us directly. We will attempt to see if we can arrange to ship to your country. Shipping fees for other countries have not yet been determined, but when you contact us we will give you an estimate.\u00a0 Pledge Level Shipping is a fixed rate that is based off of the amount of pins in your pledge level. Keep in mind some pledge levels have as little as one pin, and some pledge levels have as many as 20. We will be using the U.S. postal service for shipping.\u00a0 United States: $4 - $10 Canada: $11 - $25 United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland: $15 - $25 If you choose to purchase extra items in the add-ons section of your survey there may be added shipping fees. Any extra shipping fees are based on the weight of your package, for example, adding a sticker pack has no additional shipping fee, but adding another four pins may have a shipping fee.\u00a0 When shipping internationally we will make every effort to properly fill out customs forms. We will abide by your countries customs and shipping laws, which means we will denote the package value as the cost of your order, and mark this as merchandise. Please do not ask us to change the value of your package, or mark it as a gift. We are not responsible\u00a0if your country holds your package and requires extra payment to release it.\u00a0 Below you can find the estimated timeline for this project, as well as the funds breakdown.\u00a0 Keep in mind that July feels like a long ways off, but for our last two campaigns we shipped well before the estimated ship date. Our first campaign was supposed to begin shipping in February 2019, and instead we sent out our last 20 orders in February. Our second campaign was set to begin shipping in April and we started shipping the first orders in the last week of February, and the remaining orders will all be sent out in mid march. We've consistently shipped early so far. We can't make any promises for this project because sometimes with crowdfunding there are unforeseen circumstances, but if all goes well like the last two campaigns, you should get rewards before July.\u00a0 Snarky Co.

  "I am a young graduate girl who over school wanted to start getting known. I attended a artistic college course for 5 years and now I intend to give in the world what I am worth, in my own small way. I offer people hand-made works using mostly an abstract style. I really like working big, often using panels that exceed 2 meters in length .. I like to create works that have their own particularity and for this reason I tend to never make paintings that differ in colors and shapes. I thank you in advance if you want to help me by purchasing one of my works and for this I hope to get you the work as soon as possible",
  "If I\u2019m going to open a bakery, I want to have something inclusive for all! My name is Martin a baker and my company is The Bakery Outlet, based in Warrington England. I am a father of three autistic children with additional needs and I\u2019ve witnessed them and my younger brother who is also autistic being persecuted in the street or facing limited opportunities due to their disabilities. Prior to the COVID pandemic, I worked in the travel industry, and as countries closed their borders my job disappeared overnight. At home during lockdown I wanted to teach my 3 autistic children some life skills, I taught them how to bake a good cake and I began giving away my bakes to raving reviews. I have done intensive research I have also spoken with my children\u2019s schools and I discovered that when autistc children get up to school-leaving age, the opportunities available for them are restricted. Many young autistic young people are enrolled in courses at college which they lack interest in, while many others isolate at home and may suffer mental health difficulties.\u00a0 I plan to renovate the upstairs area and use it as a training center to offer placements to young people and adults with additional needs and allow them the comfort of learning at their own pace as well as having a deep sense of belonging to the team. The training would potentially be affiliated with a college and would provide each graduate a recognised qualification, each candidate would also be supported in to paid employment at my bakery or within the catering industry. \u00a0 I have the premises, passion and dedicated to change the lives of young people in Warrington, my bakery school will help create the bakers of tomorrow and In the future, we would look to expand our number of stores allowing us to reach more communities and help more young vulnerable adults. HOW FAR, SO FAR? You deserve to know, if I am asking for your dedicated support, you need to know how I've been fairing on my own. In the past 18 months, I've built a home-based business utilizing a basic Etsy site, and I've completed over 250 orders on Etsy, during which I made, packaged, and delivered over 300 cakes. My cake business is thriving, and I frequently export cakes to the United States, Canada, Germany, India, Saudi Arabia, and Australia. In the last month, I have received three orders from customers in Australia. My reputation has grown, and I'm now doing a lot of local work, which has allowed me to develop new baking skills and expand my product line. Our Etsy Store Rated 5*! Actually, my first online order came from France and my next one was from Los Angeles. And before I knew it, I started running a global online business. I found that people were buying cakes from my left, right, and center so I started making alcohol versions which flew off the shelves and it kept going from there I have reached a point where my home is overtaken by my bakery items and I am out of space, I am in desperate need of commercial premises. With commercial premises, I could take my business to the next level. In a nutshell, I am attempting to pursue my lifelong dream of creating a community bakery that is world-class, exceeds everything locally within the town, and at the same time help humanity in a very significant way by improving the lives of young people and adults with additional needs, no compromise. THE PLAN If you're in my home community, one way or another, you must have heard of this campaign but if you are just catching us for the first time, you may love to know that my local newspaper \u2018the Warrington Guardian\u2019 recently featured my story which was available in the printed copy on January 27th, 2022 and can also be viewed on their website https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/19865741.bakery-outlet-will-open-knutsford-road-latchford/ The sole plan is to help improve the lives of many young vulnerable adults. I have sourced, secured and now the legal tenant of retail premises in the Latchford shopping village in Warrington.\u00a0 I really hope I could completely renovate the shop and turn it into Warrington's only traditional independent bakery offering cakes, pastries, pastries, sandwiches, baked potato, hot rolls, cold rolls, whilst offering several training opportunities to young adults with additional needs. Once established, I would open late at night at weekends and launch our night-time bakery and hot food delivery service throughout the Warrington area, I would look to partner with Just Eat or Deliveroo. ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE Since launching my campaign a fully qualified Occupational Therapist has contacted me offering her professional assistance with the young people on placement. Imagine being traumatized from the experience of almost every interaction with other people going wrong, misunderstandings, misinterpretations, missed jokes, confusing instructions, failed references, over and over and over again. That\u2019s my experience of autism with my kids. When they vocalize, they are persecuted in the street and so many times people mock them. It\u2019s really upsetting. SO TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND. The shop requires renovation, revamping and upgrading downstairs.\u00a0 After renovations are complete, downstairs would be filled with counter fridges and heated glass units at the front customer facing and behind the counter would be a food safe preparation and storage area. Once renovated the rear food preparation area would be used to prepare deliveries and hot food. Once renovated the electrics would be fixed and made safe, the cleaning area would be a clean safe area for staff to wash their hands and equipment. We would look to install a dishwasher in this area. Once renovated upstairs would be used for preparing all the baked items sold in the shop, while being a training area for the young people on placment. A number of changes are required in order to make the available space a safe space for young people. \u00a0 Once renovated the cake preparation area would be a clean food safe area with plenty storage.",

We want to create a fun energetic space for you to explore the Game World. \u00a0Alot of kids come home after school, throw their bags down and get straight onto their games, Alone. We want to change that. We want games to be a social tool. \u00a0A safe space for kids to hang out. Instead of your kid coming home to get on his game alone in his room, he/she has a place with other kids to socialize and team up with. Also to give all kids and teens an equal opportunity to play the same games. Games are a very common talking point for kids to make friends. But can be very expensive. We will also offer free board games and a free game TV for kids who just want to hang out or cant afford the full amount. (Put anything in the donation bucket you get 30 minutes. Once a time a day.) Donation are put towards a new game, voted on by the Gamers.\u00a0 \u00a0The idea is to have a few newer and a few older gaming consoles for pay to play $5 an hour. \u00a0We will Host tournaments, pay to play, \u00a0every so often to really bring people in. They can also can opt into being in a tournament from home online with us.

The funds raised on kickstarter will give us the opportunity to lease a space, buy furniture and couch covers. Cleaning supplies for all the controllers. A cash register. We will also buy the few game systems that we have not already acquired. After all these first initial items are purchased, \u00a0We will have everything to completely run this business. Insurance, space rent amd monthly bills. I will pay. I will be working a part time that will supplement any needed funds for replacements. My husband works hard to pay our home bills so anything I make I can put straight into upgrading sytems, buying new games and prizes. \u00a0We are a very tight nit community and I feel this could completly thrive. This could thrive anywhere.\u00a0 Video games are so diverse. They bring all kinds of different \u00a0people to a common place and\u00a0We want everyone to have the same opportunity. \u00a0Try a console you may not be able to afford. Try a game before you buy it. Have a place to hangout after school.\u00a0 We have few really nice spaces for lease I could easily turn this dream into reality with a little bit of help. My son and I are very much into the gaming community. This just feels so second nature and easy to exicuted. \u00a0Every single penny I make from this will go right back into it. I really want this to be succseful and have big hopes to pass it on to my kids. \u00a0I appriciate the time you took to read this. It means the world.

  "What we want to create: a community grocery store that make sustainable living more accessible to our community in rural Alaska and cares for its employees as its most important stakeholders How we plan to create it: How we\u2019ll share it: We will connect Alaskan farmers, artists, makers and entrepreneurs (F.A.M.E.) to their local economic ecosystem. The Mindful Living Collective will restructure a capitalistic enterprise, making space for the pursuit of livelihood through an inclusive marketplace. Participants will build community resilience by forming relationships and encouraging collaboration. How we\u2019ll use the money: We will use the money to move into, remodel and set up our new space. These costs quickly add up to $100k+ which is why we need your help!

We get more mileage out of our revenue by sourcing Alaska-made first, the closer to home the better. This slows down our dollars as they travel around our vibrant small business community. (what it will be/tangible) We aim to provide a one-stop grocery option for the discerning consumer. Between these two women-owned small businesses, we have developed a reliable customer base, brand loyalty and increased our capacity significantly. With this crowd-funded leap of faith, we will expand upon our present offerings which include Once we are settled in the new space, we will supply value-added products made in-house, commercial kitchen rental/use, small event space rental, whole foods cooking & other practical types of lessons. (what will we do to make it so) Also- the ask. We have maximized the use of our 800 square feet of retail, kitchen and storage space over the last year and significantly increased capacity will allow us to be a viable grocery option for our community\u2019s future. With our focus on building a vibrant & strong community supply chain and connecting stakeholders to their local food economy, we are designing a corporate template that includes a sustainable financial model.

  "OUR STORY In our 2019/20 season, we met the need for accessible classical performances in Delta. High-quality performances could be experienced in your beloved neighbourhood without passing through the tunnel or going downtown. Great interest among the community showed potential for an annual Delta series. It's been a tough two years, not just for us but all over the world. There were doubts whether the 2021/22 season was the right time to return to Delta, but we wanted to bring the comfort and joy of music to people during this challenging time. Though our audiences have been small, we have received heartfelt gratitude for our performances. While we have enjoyed our intimate community this season, the reality of the financial need to sustain the Delta series is increasingly pressing. Many former audiences have expressed their intention to return in 2022/23, but we need concrete financial support to ensure we can present the series from beginning to end. We are running this pre-sale subscription campaign to secure the funds we need to present the Delta series starting in Fall 2022. THE PROJECT In addition to the government funding that we receive, VCMS requires a minimum of $40,000 in pre-sold subscriptions, donations, and concert sponsorships to put on the Delta series in our 2022/23 season. If we do not meet this goal, the Delta series will be held off until at least Fall 2023, and all subscriptions, donations, and concert sponsorships will be fully refunded. This pre-sale campaign will run until July 23, 2022, to give us enough time to lock down the season lineup before October. If the goal is met, next season will consist of five Friday evening concerts at the South Delta Baptist Church from October 2022 to May 2023. YOUR CONTRIBUTION VCMS can continue to present chamber music at the highest level of artistic excellence accessibly in Delta with your support. Your contribution provides for a portion of artist fees, travel and accommodation, and venue rental. Make a tax-deductible donation towards the Delta series by pledging over $20 above the subscription cost. Your support in the growth and development of artistic excellence in Tsawwassen will pay dividends in the years to come. Help bring the Vancouver Chamber Music Society back to Delta in the 2022/23 season by committing to a season subscription today. Sincerely, Kevin Park Artistic Director",
  "'Beginnings' will be the debut EP of the Finegan Viscardi Duo featuring folk music from the UK and Ireland in different contexts. This will not only mark the beginning of our duo's career but also the beginning of an exciting collaboration between music and the visual arts. While this EP will be available on traditional streaming platforms, we will also collaborate with visual artists by attaching QR codes with links to our music to one of their works. Each artist will pick a work which they feel has a strong link to the music making it a true collaboration of the arts. As both of us have grown up in artistic households, this collaboration has personal significance and value, making it a truly exciting project.\u00a0 As the modern age progresses we are using CDs less and less and streaming platforms more. This takes away the physical and emotional connection we had when we bought our first CD or Vinyl. This collaboration will bring back this connection to music and the arts. Further collaboration on this EP includes a new commission by composer Anne-Marie O'Farrell, and being joined by guest artist violist Martha Campbell.

  "\u00a0 \u00a0 I have been a photographer since 2003 accumulating well over 100,000 photos of beautiful women across the country. My plan is to release a series of ART NUDE and NON-NUDE ARCHIVES featuring a few of my favorite models so that my fans can enjoy some of the beauty I have been lucky to capture over the years. I have always enjoyed capturing the raw natural beauty of everyday women, that are not always professional models, but for a moment in time want to be that muse for others in the world. \u00a0 \u00a0 People are tired of seeing the stereotypical over-photoshopped, airbrushed model. DAKOTA breaks the mode of what society has told us a model should be in weight and height. No longer do we need to subscribe to that stereotype. DAKOTA displays a lot of confidence and energy in front of a camera, surprisingly so, since this is her very 1st shoot EVER. A true natural beauty in every sense of the word. \u00a0 \u00a0 Take the journey with me with each campaign, each book will provide a new brick in the foundation to help build a new company of photo and videography. Thank you for your pledge and your interest in my works. \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "Pinzle is a publishing company and a art agency in Korea, which launched the art subscription service for the first time in the world. By applying the IP licensing method, Pinzle is not only changing the conventional art market which has been retained by a simple distributing system, but also creating a new culture in which more artworks can be created and consumed.\n\n Pinzle is a German-based word which means \"style\". The style of each artists reveals their experience and philosophy. Pinzle publishes a magazine and a large artwork print featuring artists\u2019 unique style every month to deliver their life and philosophy.\n\u00a0 Pinzle's mission is to constantly discover amazing new artists and make it easier for people to access wonderful works of art in the world. And, this funding project is our first step towards the global market to grow into a global publishing company & art agency. Freshen up your daily lives and space with new artwork that we deliver every month. Pinzle is a new way of experiencing the lives of artists and their paintings. Every month! There will be a new artist, a new life story and a new picture. The enjoyment of art can be difficult to do for many reasons. Some of these reasons might include not having enough time to visit places that display artwork, or financial reasons, after all \u00a0purchasing fancy artwork can be quiet expensive. Whatever the case may be, the enjoyment of art should never be compromised. It should never feel like you're trying to obtain the Mona Lisa or visit the Louvre Museum. You can enjoy art with Pinzle more casual way. It's nice to hang a picture up on a white wall so that it grabs all the attention, but also it looks very nice when leaned up against a corner. As far as the picture goes, it could either be placed in frame or be stuck onto a wall using tape without a frame. The concept is similar to how people enjoy books, movies, and streaming music, through easy access. Everyone needs a change of scenery and space at times. Look around you now. Isn't there something desolate about walls and space that's colorless? Why not boost the morals of yourself and your loved ones with colorful paintings? It is also a wonderful experience for children to grow up around colorful works of art. The artwork will be inside the kraft tube along with a magazine that will explain the painting, and also about the artist. If you take the new picture out of the tube and replace it with the previous month's picture, you'll conveniently save space and time. You'll also feel a sense of refreshment with the new picture. And, the pictures are available in A1, the large size. It's large enough to fully appreciate and transform your space. Every month Pinzle magazine will talk about a artist and their artwork. They are mainly young artist around the world, who are grabbing a lot of attention for their works. To find artist who are very inspiring, we focus on current trends, and also seek advice from other artist associates. It's not always easy to do, but in order to gain a more thorough understanding of the artist's life, and to experience it first hand, we'll fly to the cities where the artist are located. The conversations and interviews we have with the artist will be made into a magazine along with pictures that are also taken. The magazine will be distributed along with the artwork. For several months, we visited fascinating artist in Japan, Europe, and the U.S., and as a result we have accumulated a lot of great artwork and many interesting stories. Even within just one piece of artwork, we feel that a great part of the artist's life and inspiration is shared. Saddened by the fact that, magnificent works of art, get looked at as mere images, we put together a variety of works, and content with deep meaning.\u00a0 The most prominent work of an artist is chosen and printed in a A1 large size, called \"Pinzle print\", and will be delivered along with \"Pinzle magazine\" which is the artist's story documented in the magazine and \"Pinzle Film\" is the story of the curation journey. \"Pinzle magazine\" is shipped securely in the kraft paper tube with \"Pinzle print\" and to take a look at the \"Pinzle film,\" you can visit our website at www.pinzle.net, and also through our official Pinzle channel on youtube and vimeo. Fund-raised from our backers will be used towards artwork contents and production. Any excess amount will be used towards the curation journey and for the copyright agreement with the next artist. We will strive to bring color to the daily lives of many people with works of art from different artist that we hope will inspire.\u00a0 \"Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life\u201d - Pablo Picasso\u00a0",

is to create a better world, and it is a better world with a stronger you in it. Make sure you can follow your dreams, because every time you get stronger, the world gets stronger. You have so much to share, so much knowledge that is locked up inside of you that is waiting to shine and illuminate others and if you are afraid this will remain hidden. There is no need to be afraid anymore, salvation is here. Please back up my Kickstarter campaign and you will receive insights you have never read before. My own personal journey from being afraid, to reaching \u201cnirvana\u201d\u2026 A state of Bliss. The universe IS infinite, it is saying that you probably heard before. Could have been on the radio while you were driving your car on your daily commute and paying attention to the road, could have been active, lectured in your class at university or on an episode of discovery channel on tv, perhaps in a book, not unlike this one where they mentioned the \u201cpower\u201d of the universe can help you, or destroy you. It depends on how you perceive it. No matter where you heard about this phrase, it is true. The universe is infinite. This is a strong statement because the difficulty is IF the universe is infinite, how we can measure infinity? We can\u2019t, there is not a tool or person that can give you a number what infinity is unless you consider the symbol of the number 8 or most commonly known as the infinity symbol \u221e \u00a0An endless loop or endless circle. However, even if infinity cannot be measured, it can be felt. And through this book I will attempt to upload the information from my mind to your mind, so we together can use the power of the universe to our benefit and co-create an amazing future for humanity. I challenge you to perceive the following: infinity is true, this also means there have been an infinite amount of \u201cbig bangs\u201d. The original idea that our Father/Mother/ GOD/The Creator had. This also means that if there was an infinite amount of beginnings, there are also an infinite number of endings. As the universe starts with a big bang, it will eventually \u201cDie\u201d or \u201cEnd\u201d in a way that is violent & peaceful at the same time, perhaps in a supermassive black hole that will suck anything of the universe inside of itself, ending up with\u2026. Nothing\u2026. And from nothing, ALWAYS comes something. You see, the end of the universe is not the true end, it is an endless loop, the universe creates itself, and the universe ultimately ends itself. As you are part of the universe, If you have a problem in your life, this will not be the end of your life, it is just another beginning of something wonderful. Dearest tribe, my fellow light seekers. Know that the world has lost its way and we together can remind earth and its inhabitants that we will no longer idle. We will act. In this book, I will share my personal story about how I reached what is referred to by the Buddhist belief as \"Nirvana\". An ultimate state of bliss, happiness & love for this world and all the energy that is contained within every living and/or seemingly static thing.\u00a0 After a very hard time in this world, especially now during the Corona epidemic, I know this world deserves the truth about what we are. The truth that we are all connected and that we are all one. This book will carry one of the many answers life can give you to find true heaven on earth. And I am grateful to be able to share it with you. Please find below 2 excerpts from the book as it is written: We are one, it is not something I hope to be true or believe to be true, it is something I know to be true. My purpose with this book is not to change you believe or religion. It is simply to show a different approach of thinking that can alleviate or even fully remove any pain or discomfort you might be experiencing. You are amazing, YOU are beautiful, and you WILL be able to change any circumstances in your live that is causing you negative perceived emotions. Because even though you do not believe in us, we believe in you. Simply because we are you, and you are us. My intention with this book, we are creatures of bliss that often get lost in comparison. It is time to move mountains, it is time to wake up now! -The Author ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The reason I started this project is due to the Corona Virus my main source of income dropped away. I already financed the book cover, and have about 48 pages already written.\u00a0 What I plan to do with the money is to hire a professional illustrator as well as approach publishers. I have already investigated 2 publishers that are willing to print the book by demand. I am hoping to provide the best quality money can buy to make sure as many people in this world that are interested to read the book. Are able to read it. I hope you able to support me with this quest, I will promise you I will not disappoint. This book WILL happen. And with your support, this book will have amazing illustrations and a captivating way to grab your attention.\u00a0 The book will retail for 24,11 euros, so grab this amazing deal, so the price is still discounted here on Kickstarter. Thank you, peace & light shine upon you.\u00a0",
  "I am raising funds to legally start my salsa and hot sauce business here in Tulsa, Oklahoma and to sell online. I have received a lot of great feedback from my family, friends and co-workers that have bought from me. Heck, some people actually sip the mango reaper, lol. I originally started making salsa after the local grocer discontinued my fiances favorite salsa. I created a mango blend that she was hooked on. So I took some to work and a few guys wanted to try it, one chip was all it took and they were hooked. So one guy asked, can you make me a 32 ounce jar and I will buy it? I said okay enthusiastically and set off at the end of the day to start fun filled journey into making salsa.\u00a0 One flavor turned into 2, 2 into 4 and so one. The salsa sells very well, so I thought to myself \"what can I do to make it better\"? HOT SAUCE! My cousin grows all of the hottest peppers in the world locally in his garden, so I hit him up and he now supplies me with hot peppers. He does not charge me for them, but I know that he has always wanted to sell his own crazy hot salsa and hot sauce on a large scale to share his love of the pepper as well. Anyways, I would love to start a legal salsa and hot sauce business that is licensed and permitted with a place to call SevenSalsa its home. I do have a full time job, and that does make it hard to run my little salsa business from home with minimal equipment. The funds would also help me purchase some commercial equipment to make salsa and hot sauce on a larger scale as well.",
  "KALANGU- a vegetarian African art and culture caf\u00e9 in Stockholm We are: What if we could discover the richness of a continent meal by meal and through the magic touch of art? Kalangu is the caf\u00e9 in Stockholm that delves in history and memories to become a space were we gather to taste and rediscover Africa. More than a caf\u00e9 we're also a second home where you connect with new friends.\u00a0 OUR STORY:\u00a0 This is a family cooperative run by me Sumbu, with my mother and brother, and of course grandma Marthe. We are a generational example of what African migration can look like. Grandma was born during the Belgian colonial period and, despite the burden of illiteracy, is a strong businesswoman not to be messed with. Her daughter, my mother, Wumba has a passion for food and an incredible skill for cooking Congolese cuisine with Swedish ingredients (it's possible!). Me, I have a background in journalism and human rights- work and love to gather people around art and food. Lastly, but not least, my brother Bel who was born in Sweden and is passionate about baking as well as creating music with his guitar. He's also a soon-to-be lawyer and will make sure that we don't go too creatively crazy! OUR VISION: We have waited far too long to realize our dream of creating a fun and relaxed space for people to meet, enjoy themselves and eat good food, while discovering more of Africa. With the caf\u00e9 we aim to promote creativity and spread awareness of Africa\u2019s rich cultural diversity by bridging gaps between Afro-Swede communities and other groups in the society. A shared space We want to grow openness and kindness. This is an initiative grounded in inclusion and exchange so we welcome everyone- regardless of background, gender, identity or skin color. The more the merrier! We think that changes come from within and when we create together. We encourage our visitors to see the caf\u00e9 as a second home where they can hang out and take part in which events we should organize. One country and meal at a time As Africa is extremely diverse and large, we will of course not be able to represent or showcase the cultures of the entire continent. We do however hope to share some of the the knowledge, experiences and creativity found among the African communities in Sweden. Whether you have something to share or are simply interested in learning and meeting new people, you are welcome! WHY WE NEED YOU: We simply need your help to make this happen! So far the project has been paid from my humble savings but we need a stronger push than some saved coins. The funds we raise from this campaign will help us renovate the space, buy major equipment (for example a grinder, ice maker, raw juice machine etc). Your help will also supply us with some working capital so that we may employ members of our community, and give us a stable start so that we can have a sustainable future. \u00a0\u00a0 Without you this won't be possible! Thank you for your support. We promise to use the money wisely! We can't wait to serve you <3",
  "My sister and I are so excited you\u2019re here! We started Happy Things Studio to empower women in their creativity and to give you a different kind of painting party experience. We want to make sure you leave our parties with something that you\u2019re proud of, something worthy of hanging in your home\u2026 and we believe you will find art to be rather addicting once we help you get the hang of it.\u00a0 Simply put, a painting party. Excellent for special events like work parties, birthdays or bridal showers, hosted in your building or in your own living room! We specialize in hand cut, wood door signs, then hand painted by yourself with the assistance and finishing touches of a professional artist, and then finally garnished with a bow of your choosing.\u00a0(Don\u2019t worry, we bring everything you need to host\u2026 basically a portable painting studio to set up in your space, but a few extra chairs, drinks, and munchies never hurt!) 1. No canvases. We only paint wooden door (or where ever) signs. They are more durable, and you can even paint the other side if you're feeling crafty at home. (; 2. Individuality and variety. You pick what shape cutout you'd like to paint, then we make picking a design really simple! You can either reference the email we\u2019ll send you when you schedule a party, or you can creep on our social media to find a design you love! Then our lovely staff will help you achieve it!No two shapes come out exactly the same, and we like it that way! That means there are no mass productions or instructions: only one-on-one help to make sure you leave with something worthy of your front door.\u00a0 3. Professional artists at your disposal. We are there to take the pressure off of you! We can either show you how to paint something, or do it for you! You paint as much or as little as you like, because ultimately, you'll be able to hand it over to us to personalize until you love it.\u00a0 The whole point is to create an inviting space to explore your creativity and empower your self-expression. We want you to be PROUD of what you make because we believe that everyone needs to be a little kinder to themselves, and it all starts with scheduling a party then picking out what shapes you and your friends would like to paint! So help us get the ball rolling by pledging to start our Happy Things Studio! We have a lot of cool rewards so go check them out, and let's make Happy Things together.\u00a0\n\u00a0 *Seeing me cry tears of joy on a Facebook Live will be a free bonus to reaching any of these goals, it is up to y'all how intense those tears will be.\u00a0\n\u00a0 *Please see reward pages for bundles and further details *Pictures shown are mock ups of the design, not the finished merchandise... We will send pictures of the final product before shipping.\u00a0 Happy Things Studio Decal- $25\u00a0\u00a0 \nPersonalized Door Sign - $60 Yes! We are now adding Door Signs to our list of rewards, today, at our halfway mark for The Start of Happy Things Studio! Here are the list of shape you will be able to choose from for this reward.\u00a0 Keep in mind you do NOT have to do these designs exactly, but we recommend creeping on Pinterest for some inspiration if you'd like to do something different. For example, you see our circle shape? it can be a basketball, a baseball, a smiley face or just covered in flowers; It can be painted with abstract designs like shown, or in clean stripes lined with metallic gold; It can be summery or give a Holiday vibe. The shapes come to us blank, and you get to tell us how to make yours!\u00a0 You can search \"*your shape* Door sign\" on Pinterest and a variety of styles and options will pop up, or creep on our Facebook page, Linked here, to see what we've already made! The possibilities are endless! After the conclusion of the kickstarter, we will be in touch to find out what design you want, any personalizations you'd like to add, and have it shipped to you by July 1st, 2019!\u00a0 \u00a0Happy Things Studio Logo Tee- $45\u00a0 \nArtist' Coffee Mug Set- $75 \n\"Buzz Buzz\" Limited Edition Tee- $100 Our normal service area for parties will be the Tampa Bay area. That includes... If you want to host a party outside of this area, there is a travel fee depending on how far outside the radius we must go. Please send us an email at Happythingsstudio@gmail.com for a full quote and further information regarding long distance parties.\u00a0 One last thing I would like to address for the painting parties is what you're actually buying when you pledge for a party on our kickstarter. The total cost for your party depends on the number of people attending, our adult parties are $40 a person, our kid's parties are $25 a person.\u00a0 ( YES! We offer children's parties too! We call them Bumble Bee parties, but for the sake of simplicity and fundraising, we are making the deposits the same.\u00a0) The pledge you make today is your deposit to secure the date. All dates are chosen after the conclusion of this campaign. Your deposit for a party covers our cost of materials, and enables us to build up a large inventory of shapes before moving back to Florida. On the day of your party, the remaining cost per person is $30.\u00a0 We recommend that you, our lovely host, collect the $40 from your friends as they commit to coming, prior to the day of the party. This will make payment much simpler, as well as ensuring all your guests will be there.\u00a0 We will not accept personal checks for parties, however, we will accept debit/credit card payment, square cash, or just good ole cash.\u00a0 Our team for parties also depends on the number of guests, but generally consists of 2 - 4 people.\u00a0 1- Personalizers. Someone like me teaching you how to attain your design and do your calligraphy at the end. (For larger parties it will be my sister and myself... And possibly some amazing friends I find along the way.) 2 - Bow Queens. This lovely lady will be making your bow and attaching your hanger, the finishing touches of your sign. unfortunately, we didn't get a picture with all of us, but you can't miss her, she has blue hair.\u00a0 3- The Buzzer. This person runs around the party taking pictures for you on your phone or our professional camera gear to share on social media. *We will not share your face if we do not have your permission.* However, we do love a good candid shot, and well, our marketing intern, Haley, is the best. but if you would prefer to not be in the photos, she will take some super cute shots of just your sign to share. Thank you all so much for your love and support as we pursue this wild, creative dream of ours. We appreciate you reading this far!\u00a0If you can't give monetarily, but you still want to help, give this Kickstarter a share, with #HappyThingsStudio on all your socials, and make sure you tag us. We are @HappyThings.studio on Instagram and \u00a0https://www.facebook.com/Happythings.studio/?view_public_for=248677098989533 @HappyThings.Studio on Facebook.\u00a0Or if you already gave, then DEFINITELY share this, so we can reach all our goals and give you all of the happy things to wear or use in your own home.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be shy, we\u2019re all family here.\u00a0 <3",

  "Hi, my name is Rae, I'm 21, Australian, Female, and I am raising money for the completion and publication of a short story I have written. I have always been passionate about writing and have written many short stories as well as completed \u00a0a Bachelor of Arts course majoring in Creative Writing, but have only recently gained the courage to attempt a publication of my work. The money is predominantly for the publication process of the story with the majority going towards the cost of the publication package I am selecting and the rest towards the additional services that aren't included in said package. The idea wasn't particularity influenced by anything, I kind of just thought one day 'Hey, what if fairy dust was a drug?' and it kind of escalated from there. Before I go into a more succinct summary of the story, I thought that a passage I have written would provide an accurate synopsis of both plot and writing style (p.s. this text box wouldn't let me edit the format of the writing :( ).\u00a0 It was after they had finished their meal, which - much to the displeasure of the Darlings - was no more than make-believe, did Peter pull them aside, leading them to the back of the fort where a small, wooden table was located. Pulling out a crusted, treasure-like box, Peter took a key from his pocket and unlocked it. Taking the contents from the box, he placed it on the table, revealing a strange powder, lying on tissue paper. With a well-practiced smirk, deviant in nature yet charming in action, Peter placed a yellow-tinted powder onto the table before the Darlings. \u2018This,\u2019 he began, \u2018is what they call Fairy Dust.\u2019 \u2018Is it magic?\u2019 Michael asked obnoxiously, with eyebrows raised and a scrunched up face. \u2018Of course not idiot,\u2019 came John\u2019s harsh response, \u2018it\u2019s drugs.\u2019 \u2018Now, now, who\u2019s to say it\u2019s not magic?\u2019 Peter pinched the powder between grotty fingertips and let it lightly sprinkle back down, cascading in a shimmery waterfall like sand in an hourglass, catching the light just right to make it appear enchanted, \u2018Fairy Dust is magic if you believe it is. It can take you on the ride of your life, to a whole other world built just for you.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not sure. Father says drugs rot your brain.\u2019 John gave the powder a suspicious look. \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 Peter exclaimed offended, \u2018If anything it sharpens the brain, wakes it up a little, opens the faculties, lets you see things that most folks don\u2019t. One whiff and all your dreams will come true. Trust me, you\u2019ll be flying so high you\u2019ll never wanna come down.\u2019 Lucifer, you see, was an angel before he was ever a devil. If one were to look in on this exact moment in time, the catalyst for events to come, perhaps they would see a devil with an angel\u2019s guise, or perhaps a snake offering the forbidden fruit to the innocent. Most likely though, they would see a sad little boy, who never knew a good time that wasn\u2019t at the end of a blunt. Wendy could see it - the pitiful boy before her - but, whether out of infatuation or rebellion, she took the powder offered, snorted it up her nose just as Peter showed her\u2026 \u2026and she flew. Well what do you think? I'm a bit nervous since this is the first time people who I don't know will be reading it, but recently I've been attempting to leave my comfort zone and socialize more and I guess this counts since I've always been kind of secretive with my writing.\u00a0 Anyways, as you can probably guess the story is based on the Darling children who get involved with Peter Pan, who in this story is a drug-addicted teen living in a rough neighborhood. It has the majority of the original Peter Pan story, including the characters, as well as some elements from the 2003 film. The story contains drug-related themes and some (extremely) mild sexual themes and some other themes I don't really know how to classify. I haven't listed any rewards yet, but rewards would be along the lines of listing the backers of the story in the final product.\u00a0 I'm not really sure what else to say other than imploring that any who read this consider backing my project and sincerely thanking those that do. This story is kind of like my baby at this point and it would mean a lot to me to actually see it published. So yeah, that's all, here's a smiley face.\u00a0 : )\u00a0",

Before we jump into the details we would like to talk about the size of the logo on the dial.... In the first days of our campaign we received a lot of feedbacks regarding the size of the logo on the dial, mentioning that it is too big. As this is as much your project as it is ours, we are of course listening to your feedbacks.

As the name suggests, the COSC issues quality certificates for Chronometers based on a standardized measuring procedure according to NIHS 95-11 / ISO 3159. This test of a mechanical movement lasts 15 days, during which the movement's rate is determined in five different positions at three temperatures.  Only a very low percentage of all movements produced in Switzerland (<3%) are going through this procedure. Zahnd & Kormann is officially registered at the COSC and we are proud to be able to offer you the opportunity to get one of these movements, set to highest standards, on your wrist. Each movement certidfied by the COSC is individually numbered and will come with an official certificate. On 17. June 2016, the Federal Council approved a partial revision of the ordinance on the use of the name \u201cSwiss\u201d for watches (the \u201cSwiss Made\u201d Ordinance for Watches) of 1971. This revision, which entered into force on 1. January 2017, aims at strengthening the geographical indication \u201cSwiss\u201d for watches and watch movements in line with the new \u201cSwissness\u201d legislation.       \n\u00a0 At least 60 per cent of the costs of manufacturing a complete watch (as an end product) must be generated in Switzerland \u2013 Unlike previously, whereby this rule applied only to the watch movement itself. Quality control and assembly must take place in Switzerland and of course the movement must be Swiss Made.All our watches do fully apply and even outreach the new Swiss Made regulations.  IT IS REAL! With this watch we are offering you rock solid precious metal yellow, rose or white gold Swiss Made Watchespowered by an COSC Chronometer Certified Swiss Automatic Movement. The watch is produced and assembled by highly skilled professionals here in Switzerland. Sky is the limit: No matter if you would like to add Diamonds, get another precious metall, a fancy design, another special watch movement \u2013 We can get it for you \u2013 Time is YOURS! Pricing: Pricing starts at 35'000.00 Swiss Francs Delivery Time: On request and after clarification of all technical and commercial questions. Please feel free to contact us if interested - Thank you. Source of precious metals: We purchase all precious metals in Switzerland with the label \u201cOekogold\u201d, which means that it consists of 100% recycled gold. A huge thank you goes out to our partners! With out you guys this would not have been possible - Thank you very much! We, that's Roger Zahnd and Florian Kormann, two friends from Bern and Thun, Switzerand, working on our dream\u00a0of establishing our own Swiss watch brand. With successfully launching the ZK No.1 on Kickstarter in 2017, we took our first step. We started our adventure as complete newcomers to the watch industry and have developed everything we know today and everyone we know today by ourselves - and people to be honest - we love it, we have chosen this path for ourselves and it is and was worth it every sleepless night and all the sweat within the past.\nAnd the best thing is, thanks to crowdfunding, this is not only our project, it is our all project. Without all the backers from around the world, we would not be where we are today and we are super thankfull for all of the support we do get from our backers and partners.We have always loved watches and their unmistakable design combined with a high expectation of Swiss Made quality in the elaboration of materials, so it should come as no surprise that we want our own watch brand to continue to live up to precisely these values of the Swiss watch industry.\u00a0\u00a0Driven by history and passion. . .\nInspired by history and our passion for our origin, our watches will always be driven by a Swiss movement and should also be equally attractive for newbies and wathionistas due to an unmistakable design and specification details.\n. . . and a big goal\nWith the start of our own watch brand, we set ourselves a big goal right from the start:\n\"It's time for mechanical Swissmade watches to become more affordable.\"  \u00a0We are convinced that in the price categories from 500.00 - 3'000.00 Swiss Francs, where the Swiss watch industry has lost ground in the past, we can be the entry and access point to the world of Swiss Made Automatic Watches for younger people as well as for experienced watch connoisseurs. Thank you very much for all of your support!",
  "Hello! My name is Appleminte. I'm a YouTuber and artist who loves to create! I've held one very successful Kickstarter in the past and am very excited for this one!

  "About the Girls \u201cThe Girls in the Magnesium Dress\u201d met in London, while being a student in the Postgraduate Advanced Diploma Course (Anna) and Carne Trust Fellow (Valentina) at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. While in the establishment, we were coached by distinguished teachers and performers, such as Gabriella Dall'Olio, Leon Bosch, Nic Pendlebury and David Kennedy. Interested in all sorts of repertoire, focused on virtuosity and versatile sonorities on both instruments, we are an innovative and unique duo in the classical chamber music scene, creating new repertoire specifically written for the ensemble. The duo has performed in great London venues such as the Wigmore Hall, St. James in Piccadilly, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, the Old Royal Naval College, the Verdi Halls at the Royal Albert Hall. We have worked in collaboration with Salvi Harps and the Victor Salvi Harp Museum in the event \"Eccellenza incontra Eccellenza\", in La Morra d'Alba, Italy. The duo is really proud to have been selected and invited to perform at the World Harp Congress 2022 at the Dora Stoutzker Hall in Cardiff, being recognised as an innovative ensemble to be observed on a world-wide platform. Find a few of our recordings here:\u00a0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OlewfNrJLQ\u00a0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1P0ewYDBWk\u00a0 About the CD Programme During the pandemic, we have been gifted by the incredible composer Yoshihisa Hirano with his Elegy for double bass and harp, written and created especially for the Girls in the Magnesium Dress. Some of his greatest compositions come from the Anime soundtracks works, such as Death Note, Final Fantasy and Broken Blade to name a few. His work has led us to bigger reflections. What classical repertoire do we know that has been written as an inspiration of Japanese culture? What transcriptions and arrangements could be created for our duo? The answers we got were exciting!!! The Japanese word Ru\u0304tsu stands for \"roots\": we made it into the title of our album as a symbol of the deep correlation between Japan and its influence on the Western World.\u00a0 Here is the official programme of our CD, including compositions by Puccini, Ravel, Miyagi, Zappa\u2026and Valentina of course! -Yoshihisa Hirano (1971-) , Elegy -Valentina Ciardelli (1989-) , Randori suite I-II-III -Maurice Ravel (1875-1937), Trois Po\u00e8mes -Valentina Ciardelli (1989-), Igor and Igor II (hommage to Igor Stravinsky)\u00a0 -Michio Miyagi (1894-1956), Haro No Umi (The Sea in the Spring) -Puccini (1858-1924)/Ciardelli, Butterfly effect (Prospettiva Opposta) Bonus Tracks: -Frank Zappa (1940-1993), Cheepnis This is going to be technically challenging but incredibly rewarding! There are no CDs at the moment conceived with this shape, and we are very much looking forward to this adventure. The recording has been planned for the second half of November 2021, in the DV Italian Studio, we will give you regular updates on how everything is keeping up to speed. About the Funding 2021 has not been a great year for professional musicians: no performances, closed theatres and no future perspective have forced us to find alternative solutions to survive this crisis, both economically and emotionally. As a duo, we have used our lockdown months to develop and discover new repertoire, looking forward to future occasions. This is why we were incredibly touched when the label Da Vinci Records offered us to record our first CD as the Girls in the Magnesium Dress. The making of a CD with such importance requires a lot of economical support. Some of the costs include recording, mixing, mastering\u2026 your contributions will help us distribute and advertise worldwide our CD, allowing everyone to discover double bass and harp like you have never heard them before!",
  "During November of 2017, I sat down every day for a month to write the first draft of my YA mystery novel, LEAVING WISHVILLE. After two years of rewriting and editing, the book is now complete at around 75,000 words and has received critiques from over a dozen beta readers and three paid professionals. It will soon be sent to two proofreaders who will ensure that the book is in its best form. No one leaves Wishville. It\u2019s been ten years since the last man disappeared from town, and since then, no one has dared approach the border. No one except Benji Marino, a fourteen-year-old boy desperate to learn why his father left him and never returned. LEAVING WISHVILLE will be released in three formats: The release is planned for early February 2020. I created this Kickstarter with the goal of publishing a book for teens, as a teen. For the two years that I worked on this novel, Wishville was my escape. The characters, conflicts, and setting all felt so real to me. The story touched me, and I always dreamed they'd reach someone else, too. Countless hours of dedication went into the creation of this book, all with hopes of the story someday being in your hands. I'm asking for your help to make this book happen. Here's a video I filmed a little while ago! Please note that this was created before the novel was fully beta read/proofread. The published edition will be much more polished and thoroughly checked for spelling and grammatical errors. \u00a0Find more about me through my social media and website: YouTube \u00a0\u00a0Instagram \u00a0\u00a0Website . . .",

  "\u00a0Hello! \u00a0I'm Misu !, an spanish artist who loves innovation and the art revolution. I have in my hands an artistic project where I need a series of materials to be able to carry it out. As many of you already know, in the world of art, not all materials serve, since quality is essential to make a difference, because, for example, in painting, we often try to make paintings that demand a high budget that in Cases like mine are inaccessible. The paintings, the brushes, the supports, the materials that we are going to use ... Everything counts! And whoever is dedicated to it, knows perfectly that the quality of the materials make the difference and the difficulty or ease to carry out your work (especially in the cases of more demanding artists, as is my case). Good quality art material in Spain is very expensive, and humble artists like me know how difficult it is to have these materials and how hard it is to fight to get them. \u00a0The beneficiary of the donations of the campaign will be me, as the artist who will create the work. I will go to buy the materials in specific art stores that are located in the center of Madrid, Spain. The funds will be invested only in the materials, in a deposit that I have specially dedicated, only to these materials. I will need the funds for this Christmas if possible, since that is when I have more time to buy the material and create the works of art. \u00a0My purpose will be to obtain these quality materials in order to start doing better quality works, which due to my current economic situation, unfortunately prevents me from allowing it. \u00a0I really feel the need to advance in the art world, since I've been in the same place for a while now, managing as I could with the money I had. \u00a0\u00a0These are difficult economic times for me, and I will try to move forward with these new materials as well as possible. For me it would really mean a great opportunity to expand my unique and revolutionary technique, to be able to advance as an artist and create new works much better than those I already had. I just hope to get it and start as soon as possible, because I'm really looking forward to it. I hope that thanks to you, God willing, tomorrow I will become an outstanding figure that will make your work an inspiration to change the world, because I have never feared being different and I have always dreamed of changing the world through this purpose , besides getting to inspire other people to be themselves and continue doing without fear what they are doing, because art serves to open minds and transcendently liberate the soul that we carry inside, in our heart. Hopefully it will be achieved little by little, with small steps like this. \u00a0And from my heart I say, thank you very much to everyone who supports me with your donations, no matter how minimal, in this project. I really thank you very much, because your money will be really used to the millimeter to get a good cause. Thanks, again. \u00a0Attentively: \u00a0The artist who gives color to the world, Misu! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0*** HERE BELOW I SHOW YOU SOME OF THE WORKS THAT I HAVE ALREADY DONE AND OF THE STYLE THAT I PRETEND TO DO (ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY IMPROVED ONCE IN A DISPOSITION OF THE NEW MATERIALS) *** \u00a0\u00a0Name: \"The puppet\" Date: 10-27-2018 \u00a0Name: \"The chair of thinking\" Date: 21-10-18 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name: \"Freedom\" Date: 11-30-2018 \u00a0Name: \"Illusions\" Date: 2-11-2018 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*** I hope you like them, and if you support my cause, really, thank you very much !!

  "Hi! I'm Rosie. Most people who know me, know that I love talking about mental health. Working with mental health, I feel like I've picked up some neat lessons, and my favourite one is that self-care is incredibly important. The things that we deny ourselves, like time off, a good cry, a break, or the help that we need, can really mess things up. These pins are cute reminders. Little mascots to remind you - it's okay to be sad! You deserve the help! And you're already good enough, so take a break.\u00a0 The first pin in the series is a cute pup - \"You're Already Good Enough\" - possibly my favourite message of the three. If we reach our minimum goal of \u00a3250, this pup will go to manufacture and be made. This fluffy kitten will be made when we reach our first stretch goal of \u00a3500. \"You Deserve the Help You Need\" - I can't tell you how many people have insisted that other people deserve help and care more than them. This kitten knows better. Because self care isn't all fun - sometimes it's letting yourself be sad. This pin will be made if we reach stretch goal no. 2 - \u00a3700.",
  "I never thought I would write a book, in fact I only began to write due to being incredibly let down by a novels ending.I finished it and was furious! I was so disappointed in the ending that I decided even I could do better. So, I did and over the period of a year and a half, I dreamt up a novel that had it all. Naturally, it had romance, wit, an air mystery... the usual. However, I also wanted this book to be different, something that every person could see themselves included in. After months of sticky notes and synonym research I finally put together a book I was proud \u00a0of, \"Lena's encounters in Laurd\u00e0 and fellowing odd characters\". This is the tale of a young girl who was born to a mother and a much older father in a secluded mill house in the wood. Being born under the month of umbart, she was born with quite a peculiar gift, and with it she would soon find herself in an all too familiar world. Here she will meet many an odd character and find out the truth of who she is.\u00a0Most importantly she is the only hope of saving these nost unusual people from the in-between.",

Je pr\u00e9pare un deuxi\u00e8me disque qui sera un album double consacr\u00e9 aux \u0153uvres pour piano de Gabriel Piern\u00e9 (1863-1937). Il sera enregistr\u00e9 dans l'une des meilleures salles au Canada: la Salle de concert du Domaine Forget. J'amasse des fonds pour financer ce beau projet qui me tient \u00e0 c\u0153ur. Plusieurs co\u00fbts tels que: location de la salle, accords du piano, honoraires et h\u00e9bergement de l'\u00e9quipe technique et de moi-m\u00eame, mixage et mastering. Ce projet est coproduit avec la maison de disque qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise Espace 21. Tout don sup\u00e9rieur ou \u00e9gal \u00e0 30$ sera accompagn\u00e9 d'un exemplaire envoy\u00e9 par la poste quelques semaines avant le lancement officiel de l'album qui est pr\u00e9vu lors d'un r\u00e9cital \u00e0 la Chapelle historique du Bon-Pasteur le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2021. Quelques petits frais de livraison pourrait s'ajouter pour des adresses en dehors du Canada. L'id\u00e9e du disque double est venue dans un but de coh\u00e9rence et pour mieux contempler l'\u00e9volution du style d'\u00e9criture de Piern\u00e9 ainsi que sa m\u00e9tamorphose du romantisme vers le modernisme. Au d\u00e9part, je pr\u00e9voyais seulement enregistrer des pi\u00e8ces extraites des Quinze pi\u00e8ces pour piano op.3 et des Six Pi\u00e8ces posthumes. Mon ami Georges Nicholson qui r\u00e9alisera l'album double m'a convaincu d'enregistrer l'enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 de ces cycles. C'est donc avec beaucoup de joie que j'ai accept\u00e9, mais aussi quelques inqui\u00e9tudes face \u00e0 un projet aussi ambitieux. Ceci \u00e9tant dit, je crois que cette nouvelle mouture du projet contribuera \u00e0 m'apporter l'\u00e9nergie et la motivation pour le porter \u00e0 bien. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien h\u00e2te de pr\u00e9senter le fruit d'un long travail sur l'\u0153uvre de Piern\u00e9, mais tellement passionnant, qui dure maintenant depuis plus de 8 ans. ============ I am preparing a second disc which will be a double album devoted to works for piano by Gabriel Piern\u00e9 (1863-1937). It will be recorded in one of the best venues in Canada: the Domaine Forget Concert Hall. I am raising funds to finance this great project which is close to my heart. Several costs such as: room rental, piano tuning, fees and accommodation for the technical team and myself, mixing and mastering. This project is co-produced with the Quebec record label Espace 21. Any donation greater than or equal to $ 30 will be accompanied by a CD sent by mail a few weeks before the official release, which is scheduled for a recital at the Chapelle historique du Bon-Pasteur on December 12, 2021. Some small delivery charges may be added for addresses outside of Canada. The idea of \u200b\u200bthe double disc came for the sake of consistency and to better contemplate the evolution of Piern\u00e9's writing style as well as his metamorphosis from romanticism to modernism. Initially, I only planned to record pieces from the Fifteen Pieces for Piano Op.3 and the Six Posthumous Pieces. My friend Georges Nicholson who will produce the double album convinced me to record all of these cycles. It was therefore with great joy that I accepted, but also some concerns about such an ambitious project. That being said, I believe that this new version of the project will help give me the energy and motivation to carry it out. I am already looking forward to presenting the fruit of a long work on Piern\u00e9's work, but so fascinating, which has now lasted for more than 8 years. Here is the repertoire of the two CDs Voici le r\u00e9pertoire des deux disques: Disque 1 Quinze pi\u00e8ces pour le piano (Op.3), compos\u00e9 \u00e0 la Villa Medici de Rome en 1883 [circa 50 minutes]\u00a0 Suivez mon d\u00e9fi 15 pi\u00e8ces en 15 jours sur Facebook Cliquez ici !

  "The Lost Birds is a musical memorial to bird species driven to extinction by humankind. Sweeping and elegiac, it's a haunting tribute to those soaring flocks that once filled our skies, but whose songs have since been silenced. It's a celebration of their feathered beauty: their symbolism as messengers of hope, peace, and renewal.\u00a0But it's also a warning about our own tenuous existence on the planet: that the fate that befell these once soaring flocks foreshadows our own extinction. The Lost Birds will be sung by the preeminent British vocal ensemble VOCES8, accompanied by my longtime collaborators, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.\u00a0Backers will have the rare and unique opportunity to attend the orchestral recording sessions at the legendary Abbey Road Studios, as well as the vocal sessions at VOCES8's private recording facility (both in person and virtually).\u00a0And just like my last Kickstarter album To Shiver the Sky, I'll be documenting in detail each phase of the creative process--from sketches to composing, recording to mixing, release to marketing-- with frequent updates, journal entries, and exclusive live streams and video content. This album will be a gentler production than my previous works. The language will be pastoral and romantic; by turns soaring and delicate, but with the slightest whisper of melancholy. It will be a response to the noise of our times; a return to simplicity, clean lines, and the timelessness of hymns and folk melodies.\u00a0It will be a triumph of loveliness; a soundtrack for appreciating nature, and a reminder that we must preserve its ephemeral beauty while it still exists. Despite the actual cost of production being close to $200,000 we set our funding target at $50,000 because of the uncertain times that we're in. \u00a0Despite that you rallied and we hit our goal within 7 hours. \u00a0Thank you--I'm honored. \u00a0We're currently the second highest grossing classical music Kickstarter ever, and I'm hoping that by the end of the campaign we can set a new record. \u00a0So with that in mind, here are the first batch of stretch goals I have in mind for the rest of this campaign: (If we surpass these goals, then the rest of the money will just be kept as compensation for all my work.) The first part of the project will be the research; finding poems and texts to set to music, then coming up with the overall dramatic arc of the piece. After that comes months of composing and orchestration, which I'll be sharing with you in great detail through live-streams and updates. Then comes the recording. This album will use a hybrid of traditional classical recording techniques, and the more tech-heavy and modular approach that we employ in the film/game scoring world. The vocal portions of the album will be recorded first by VOCES8 in the traditional classical manner--all singers together in one room, without guide tracks, performing around a small cluster of microphones that will capture the natural acoustic of their recording space. After the vocals are done, I'll be building a metronome map around their performance, to preserve their natural phrasing and musicality. I'll then be bringing those sessions to Abbey Road, where the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra will overdub their parts. Every player will be listening to both the metronome map and VOCES8 recordings in their headphones--all while sight reading the music. Both halves of the recording will be a stunning display of musicianship you'll want to witness. Here's a rough timeline for The Lost Birds: Witnessing an album being recorded live is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u00a0It's an experience you'll want to share with your friends and family, or a story you might someday tell your children and grandchildren: that you were there, either sitting in the room or watching online, as an album you helped bring to life was being captured for all eternity. So for the first time, not only are we making all the recording sessions available to attend live, but we're also making the VOCES8 sessions available to all to attend online. All backers can now purchase the VOCES8 Virtual Session Pass as an Add-on to their primary pledge tier, and get full streaming access to the VOCES8 recording sessions (and music video shoots), broadcast live from their recording studio in the heart of London, the VOCES8 Centre. What's more, you'll be able to listen in as I produce the sessions remotely from my studio in Los Angeles; so you'll be hearing exactly what I'm hearing in real time, and follow along as I give them notes and feedback.\u00a0(For more details about the schedule and format for the online sessions, see the FAQ.)\u00a0\u00a0 For those who want to experience it live with the chance to meet the singers, The\u00a0VOCES8 Recording Experience pledge tier gives you the opportunity to spend an evening recording with them, with the opportunity for a meet-and-greet.\u00a0(I'll be producing the sessions remotely online, due to the pandemic.)\u00a0Attendance will be capped to preserve that small-group feel. If attending an orchestral recording session is more to your liking, The Abbey Road/RPO Experience is your chance to visit the legendary recording studio and sit in while I conduct the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. This premium experience is a rare opportunity to go behind those closed doors.\u00a0Attendance will be limited to maintain an exclusive experience, and you'll have the chance to join me for a private reception beforehand. To read firsthand how the entire experience is from an actual backer, see this blog post.\u00a0(For information about the scheduling of these sessions, visit the FAQ.) I've curated a collection of rewards that give the ultimate music appreciation experience, as well as some one-of-a-kind collectables and life experiences that you won't get anywhere else. Almost every item is also available as an Add-on after you select your primary pledge tier--meaning you can easily mix and match any items you see in this campaign (note: if your primary pledge tier is a digital product only, then only digital Add-ons will be available. \u00a0If your primary pledge tier contains a physical product, then all digital and physical Add-ons will be available.). On top of all this, most of these rewards will be personalized in some way: the CDs, vinyl, prints, and study scores will all be signed (and in some cases numbered), and the handwritten 'Sogno di Volare' score will be dedicated and personalized to your liking--an ideal gift for a music lover.\u00a0Here are a few samples: I'm a big believer in music's ability to be a force for good: its capacity for shedding light on darkness, and inspiring people to become better versions of themselves. All my previous albums were rooted in this philosophy: on the surface they're simply enjoyable music, but dig a little deeper and you'll discover dialogues on cultural tolerance (Calling All Dawns), musical explorations of water conservation (The Drop That Contained the Sea), and celebrations of human achievement (To Shiver the Sky). The Lost Birds will be the same. To me, an album should never just be a random collection of music.\u00a0I believe in concept albums: songs built around a core idea, with interconnected musical motifs, that tell a story from start to finish.\u00a0I approach my work like a film director: each album tells a different story, with different characters, and each with its own unique narrative and structure--but they're all told in a way such that they're unmistakably mine. My work has won two Grammy awards, repeatedly topped the Billboard charts, and has been heard the world over: from Carnegie Hall, to the United Nations, and even The Vatican.\u00a0It's been the soundtrack for many of the world's biggest events: from the FA Cup to the World Expo, and even to a landmark peace treaty signing in Mozambique. It was even a question on Jeopardy! The Lost Birds will be the next chapter in that story, and while there's no guarantee that it will follow in the footsteps of my other albums, what I can say is that this music is not intended to just fade away after a season. Like all my albums, it's meant as a piece of permanence--one that will hopefully be performed again and again in concert halls for years to come.\u00a0This is your chance to attach your name to its creation. I invite you to join me on the journey.",

  "This book for me means everything, it means the beginning of a new stage of my life. A new chapter where thousands of doors are closed and others open.\u00a0 Sometimes I think that the\nLife is a labyrinth, where thousands of adventures await you, but at the end of the day everything depends on you, your decisions, your battles, your actions. All these define us, they leave a mark for our whole lives. Live a kidnapping is not easy, it was a moment of pain, where loneliness and darkness were my only companies. They were moments of nostalgia, of weakness. I felt that my voice, my soul, and my heart had been taken from me. II would like people to read my story, to cry through the pages, to feel laughter in the lyrics, but above all, to learn that life is difficult but beautiful, and everything depends on how brave you want to be. I want everyone to learn that you can get out of the darkness, from hell, but to achieve it, I need your help. Do not forget that this book was written by the\nheart of a warrior who was not afraid to face a sad world, a world that sometimes leaves you when you need more support.",

  "Everybody loves a good trip. And no, by this I do not mean tripping on drugs. I mean the kind where you explore new places, meet new people, learn more about different cultures, and of course make memories for the rest of your life! But some trips are not easy to make, and some are far less than pleasant. You can never be sure what you will get until you decide to tread into uncharted territory. Although that may be true, that does not mean you should go unprepared and simply hope for the best. Plans have to be made, things have to be organized. So why not hear it from the people who have been there and experienced it firsthand? The aim of the following paragraphs is to clarify what this project stands for and why it was created in the first place, thank you for stopping by! As already stated this will be a guide crafted from firsthand experiences, including my own.\u00a0 My own experience was a mixture of many things.. some positive and some negative. Some of us fared better than others, both in terms of experience, fun and finances. Ultimately most of us wish we were given some real advice, honest examples and stories of those who have made this journey before us. Agencies tend to tell you what you want to hear, or what they want you to believe once you are considering to sign up for a program such as this one. And even thought there have been people who have had the perfect trip, far more did not. Some made the best of their situation, others gave up and went home. But this feels like a lot of beating around the bush, you get the idea, I do not plan to waste your time on things I will include in the guide itself. The Goal is to help out young students who plan to come as seasonal workers, a.k.a \"\u00a0J1 students \"\u00a0to the United States, young adults who might not be students but managed to attain a work visa and exchange students who would like to make some extra money while staying in the US.\u00a0 As one of these, I have had to deal with the hardships of bad organizing and being deceived for the profit of others. But I managed to pull myself together and do the best with my situation. The experience I have attained and the time I spent were definitely something I would have never imagined before I came. But if I had known better, I could have made my stay many times more enjoyable and profitable. Sometimes the right hints and tips can make all the difference! If I had come with the knowledge I have now, I could have easily made 3-4x more money (approx. 18000$ - 24000$) than I already have and struggled far less in terms of looking for a job, dealing with overstaffed cities, dealing with people who do not even consider us to be human.\u00a0 I just want to be able to pay back my debt and help some people out while I can. My first half of the program was quite the disaster in terms of employment, the reservations for seasonal workers have already reached a climax point in February 2018, as somebody who signed up in March 2018 I did not have much choice as it was the most promising place the Agency presented to us, after they declined our request to sign us up for a City of our choice.\u00a0 I would give the info. I have out for free were it not for my debt..so I thought this would be the best way to help myself and others at the same time. This will be a short guide available to everybody who desires to read it for free after the goal has been reached.\u00a0 It will include tips regarding agencies, organization of the the trip, places to go to in both terms of employment and enjoyment, things to do and things to avoid doing, overview of american culture, a guide to calculate the finances for your trip and your earnings even before it starts, a guide to the means of transportation, housing, location, packing, shopping... and many more things, such as taxes and minimum wage, as well as your rights and a detailed description of my experience as a first time seasonal worker student in the US. In short it is a guide to save you money and make sure you enjoy your stay instead of breaking you back working 16h, 5 or 6 days per week for nothing. This might also be useful to some extent when traveling to other countries, not just the United States.",

A medio y largo plazo los objetivos se ir\u00e1n ampliando. Hay much\u00edsimas posibilidades a partir de lo que ya existe. La Alpujarra de Granada es un espacio muy tur\u00edstico, pero entre los barrancos de Poqueira y el de Trev\u00e9lez, los turistas se encuentran\u00a0muchas veces\u00a0con el problema de no encontrar alojamiento e incluso con escasez de servicios. El turista local es mitad espa\u00f1ol y mitad internacional, con preferencia de turistas\u00a0procedentes de todos los\u00a0pa\u00edses de Europa, pero con gran proyecci\u00f3n mundial. Nuestro enfoque ser\u00eda hacia el turista americano y asi\u00e1tico,\u00a0que actualmente est\u00e1 empezando a\u00a0visitarnos.\u00a0\u00a0 La idea es enfocarlo, adem\u00e1s de para ampliar la oferta de turismo local, para realizar todo tipo de actividades de sanaci\u00f3n, arte y naturaleza: campus, talleres, actuaciones, exposiciones, \u00a0concursos... Tambi\u00e9n tiene una finca ecol\u00f3gica ( se puede certificar) de m\u00e1s de dos\u00a0hect\u00e1reas que se dividen en bosques de casta\u00f1os, nogales y encinas done se plantar\u00e1n especies micol\u00f3gicas que protejan las ra\u00edces de plagas que actualmente est\u00e1n amenazando los bosques y nos aporten rendimiento tambi\u00e9n (boletus real y otras)\u00a0y m\u00e1s de una hect\u00e1rea de tierra de labor donde cultivaremos la comida del bar restaurante y plantas medicinales,\u00a0de cultivo \u00a0ecol\u00f3gico y sostenible. Como atractivos tur\u00edsticos adicionales, tiene unas ruinas \u00e1rabes de un balneario que est\u00e1n bajo la protecci\u00f3n de patrimonio, con lo que no se puede actuar sobre ellas, pero limpias de maleza embellecen el enclave y lo diferencian de cualquier otro en la zona.  Otro gran atractivo es su cercan\u00eda a la fuente agria de P\u00f3rtugos, enclave muy tur\u00edstico y visitado, a un minuto a pie desde la entrada de la finca. De hecho antiguamente este establecimiento era muy apreciado precisamente por esto. Este agua limpia los ri\u00f1ones, y es indicad\u00edsima para los problemas de piel La financiaci\u00f3n va as\u00ed: - 300.000,00 euros para la compra del espacio, \u00fanico modo de acceso. - 35.000,00 para impuestos y gastos de compra - 60,000.00 para licencias, permisos y arquitecto - El resto para llevar a cabo la reforma y ponernos en marcha! esto incluye: cambio de ca\u00f1er\u00edas y desag\u00fces, luz, instalaciones, mejora de accesos, limpieza de finca,\u00a0pintura y\u00a0alba\u00f1iler\u00eda.\u00a0Estoy barajando posibilidades entre varios presupuestos, pero aproximadamente entre 80.000,00 y 90.000,00 euros.

From the vast forests of Lightwood, to the depths of Schmargonr\u00f6g, Azerim is a world we cannot wait to explore with you!\u00a0 It's difficult to see on the map below, but we've marked out Baelin's typical route he takes through Azerim. It's big. Like, really big. From Honeywood he ventures through forests, open fields and farms, deserts and mountains. But as you can see, the world is MUCH bigger - and still expanding! There is so much we want to explore within the world of Azerim, and Baelin's Route really is the first step in creating bigger and bigger stories from within it.\u00a0 \u00a0- An outline of Baelin's daily route he takes walking around the world of Azerim \u00a0We are three friends who realised we have two main passions. Filmmaking and gaming. We joined together to create what Viva La Dirt League is today. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0We have three primary shows on our YouTube page; Epic NPC Man, Bored and PUBG Logic. Together we have made over 600 sketches with no plans of slowing down. WE WANT TO MAKE MORE! MOOOOOORE! \u00a0- From left to right - Adam King, Alan Morrison and Rowan Bettjeman \u00a0We see this as a natural evolution of VLDL. We want to continue bringing 3 weekly sketches to our social pages, but the idea of creating legitimate short-films (and eventually feature films) is something that really excites us.\u00a0 Baelin's Route is the first real step in making this happen. It's going to prove to you (and us!) that we are ready to take this next step and create bigger and better projects!\u00a0 \u00a0Baelin's Route is a big step toward our Epic NPC Man feature film - which has already been written! All 160 frikken' pages of it. We genuinely believe that this short-film is the first step toward making the feature in all of its epic glory-ness!\u00a0 \u00a0- Baelin and Willow near the borders of Schmargonr\u00f6g \u00a0- Baradun and his Knights of Kalabor face down an Orcish threat \u00a0It wouldn't be a kickstarter without some prizes!! And BOY do we have some prizes!! Check out everything below (remember all prices are in NZD). Please note designs are not finalised for t-shirt / mug / tote bag / pins.\u00a0 Please also note the 'Swag Bag' reward is just a collection of the x4 limited edition items (t-shirt / mug / tote bag / pins). There is no additional bag.\u00a0 Please also also note the poster design will be revealed after the film has been cast. We'd rather wait until we know what all the characters will look like rather than guess! \u00a0We don't need to go into too much detail here. We live in Middle Earth. We are absolutely spoilt with natural beauty. \u00a0As our stretch goals above lists, if we hit $700k NZD we'll be able to get the cast / crew / props / costumes / everything down to the South Island and film in some of the most beautiful places on earth! Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. We're so excited to bring this story to life - and hopefully many more! Can't wait to share it with you!",
  "The goal of Mew Cafe is to create positive interactions between cats and people. We want to bring the awesomeness of cats to everyone in Miami, while at the same time helping the homeless cats in our community.\n\nWe are a cafe space serving high-end espresso, tea, and delicious bakery items. Our cat cafe will be home to 9 adoptable, feline friends from our rescue partners. People will get a cool place to hang out with cats and help them de-stress. Whether you come to play with the cats, study, relax, eat or even sleep we welcome you with open arms. \u00a0 \u00a0 The Cafe will have two main areas, one side will be the actual cafe area, where guest will be able to order drinks or food and sit down to enjoy it. The other area will be where the cats are located, our guest will pay a fee to enter the cat area, this fee will include an hour with the cats. Inside the cat area guest\u00a0will find different toys to play with the cats and even resting areas where you can sleep or study while you socialize with all the cats.\u00a0 To comply with Health Department Regulations, the spaces will be separated\u00a0by a glass wall. The cat area will be a clean, safe, and comfortable environment for the cats and our guests! Cats will never enter the cafe through this system. \n\nWe will have air filtration systems in both spaces. \n\nThere will also be a private cat room available for the cats to take a break from socializing and do their duties.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We will be located somewhere central in Miami, Florida. Right now we are considering either Miami Lakes or Coral Gables or Wynwood or Kendall or Midtown. But that depends on how much money we are able to raise since rent in all those places are different. We are in close contact with the City of Miami Dade to ensure we meet all standards for zoning and building permits, as well as the health department. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  We are planning on leasing a space with around 1000 SF. With heavy foot and vehicle traffic. This space will have two areas divided by a glass wall. One side will be where you order the food and the other area will be where the cats are located. We want to show you where your money is going, so we've compiled a table to show you how the funds are being allocated:\u00a0 \u00a0 We also added a timeline to help our pledges understand what happens after the kickstarter is finished. If the kickstarter is funded successfully Mew Cafe will be scheduled to open in the end of 2017, around October or November. Every one will get Special rewards for contributing to our cafe. Here is the list of all the rewards we offer. \u00a0We will be adding extra bonuses and perks to our rewards as we reach our goal. \u00a0We will be adding new merchandise to our store the longer we go, this are just a small few below. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Many more coming soon. \u00a0 Hi, My name is Juan and was born here in Miami, Florida. I always had a passion for business and animals. Ever since I was little I always wanted to help rescue animals in every way that I could. I graduated with a Business degree and I have owned a couple of small business since then.\u00a0I always had a passion in building things from the bottom up and being my own boss.\u00a0 Feel free to follow me on any of the links below to follow our progress in building Mew Cafe or if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer them.\n\u00a0 http://www.mewcafe.com \u00a0 https://www.twitter.com/MewCafe https://www.instagram.com/mew_cafe/",
  "I started Farm Fresh Prep a year ago when i decided to follow my passion for nutrition and sport. I am a one woman show \u00a0working out of a teeny tiny kitchen and i have one super delivery driver. I am starting this project to help grow and move into a bigger kitchen and have a staff to help with the growing needs of the community. I use local organic produce when available and lean proteins and some seasonal fruits \u00a0that grow here in sunny San Diego. I still have a day job a few days a week as a freelance designer and would love to be able to commit full time to my passion. \u00a0My company has grown mostly by word of mouth and referrals etc. My very first client was a UFC fighter who needed to lose 30 pounds \u00a0for his fight and we did it through proper nutrition.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Farm Fresh Prep has continued to grow, i have assisted in many more weight cuts for pro and amateur mma, Boxing, Bellator and Jiu Jitsu athletes. I meal prep for a lot of busy people who want nutritionally balanced meals. We cater to all!!\u00a0 I plan to use the funds raised to reach more people ready to live a healthier lifestyle and to help more athletes change the way they cut weight \u00a0which has traditionally bad practices and doing this all through food and education! A bigger kitchen to be able to produce the amount of meals needed and have a fantastic staff.\u00a0 I am also working on Athletic Performance program. I provided meals and assisted in the weight cut for a brown belt jiu jitsu athlete and another woman did the strengnth and conditioning , that athlete went on to win a gold medal at the Pan American Championships and an awesome successful collaboration was born. Everything is in the works and our goal is to reach more athletes with our Athletic Performance Program and offer athlete sponsorships also.\u00a0",
  "I want to create a cozy casual modern place for artists to be able to relax, paint, be creative, and enjoy themselves in my hometown. I would like the place to be wifi accessible for those who are into graphic art as I would like the place to be welcome to all artists no matter their medium. In my vision there will be a coffee bar with 6-8 stools, a few tables for artists to relax and a few tables meant for artist to be able to paint or if they want to work their own sculpture. The place will be BYOB and it will be requested artists drink responsibly as this is a community place not a full on bar.\u00a0 A mix of all types of music will play, we will have an area to put in music requests as well. It would be nice to have a room that would fit 10-15 people where events could be hosted, gallery space, or to host paint and sip classes. This place has so much potential and has always been a great dream of mine. With the help of the right people i can create a fun place that can give back to the community. The decorations will be of paintings that guests donate, and other guests can buy. There will be an area of the wall for this month's artist and their mini gallery, randomly selected from a box. The staff can give back by making appearances at local neighborhood schools and perhaps teach a painting class to the kids. With the right people this place can be amazing and grow to be something bigger! Please help me bring this dream to life!",

  "Presentaci\u00f3n: Esta empresa, es una continuidad de la puesta en marcha iniciada hace un a\u00f1o, en el sector de alimentaci\u00f3n y cosm\u00e9tica natural - ecol\u00f3gica, Todo A GRANEL, dedicada al sector de alimentaci\u00f3n y cosm\u00e9tica natural-biol\u00f3gica, preparaciones para la salud, beleza con origen natural y preparados en la tienda frente al cliente. \u00a0Productos de venta a granel en casi su total mayor\u00eda. Tras un ascendente y paulatino ascenso, partimos con nombre propio, con esta nueva exposici\u00f3n y servicio al p\u00fablico en el sector de alimentos pertenecientes al grupo denominado \u201csuperalimento\u201d adem\u00e1s de una gran variedad de t\u00e9s, especias, plantas medicinales, licores, caf\u00e9s , aceites, helados, frutas deshidratadas\u2026incluyendo productos de venta diaria como fruta fresca, pan y comida elaborada para llevar (para fidelizaci\u00f3n de clientes aut\u00f3ctonos y vecinos).Sin descartar como novedad y atractivo la posibilidad de disfrutar una degustacion de t\u00e9s, infusiones, caf\u00e9s y licores existentes en venta, con el a\u00f1adido de que los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os de la casa disfruten de un espacio tranquilo y ajeno a la labor de los mayores. La ampliaci\u00f3n del apartado de selecci\u00f3n en cosm\u00e9tica y aceites para el cuidado de belleza, asi como la realisacion artesana a medida y demanda de nuestros clientes en la elaboracion de cojines y antifaz terapeuticos. Ser\u00e1 dirigida tambi\u00e9n a toda la gama de cuidado familiar, con el fin de servir a este tipo de clientes en todas sus necesidades. En la determinaci\u00f3n por la apertura dominical estamos en estudio de poner alguna secci\u00f3n \u201cmenos contaminada\u201d que nos sirva para todo el p\u00fablico en general, prestando m\u00e1ximo atractivo en referencias resaltadas como principales. Para poder\ncrecer con nuestro proyecto necesitamos mas inversi\u00f3n, y ya hemos puesto todo\nnuestros ahorros. Tenemos varios\npresupuestos para: Equipamento frigor\u00edfico:\n35000\u20ac (c\u00e1mara, pared fresco, pared congelados, helados bio, vitrina\nexpositora) Zona infantil:\n18000\u20ac varios dispositivos educativos y system de seguridad conectado. Dispensadores:32000\u20ac\npara doblar cantidad de referencias a granel y anadir dispensadores liquido(\naceites, licores, vinagres, vinos) Laboratorio:\n5000\u20ac ( cocina industriel con obras) Taller: 16000\u20ac\nzona para organizaci\u00f3n de \u00a0cursos de\ncocina, en alimentaci\u00f3n saludable para grupos hasta 12 personas. Ya tenemos el\nlocal con el negocio abierto al publico, y va mejorando cada dia mas, pero para\nnuestro proyecto los bancos lo ven muy optimisto!!!\u00a0 Aspectos generales del sector: Como es bien sabido, el sector dedicado a la venta de productos naturales y org\u00e1nicos est\u00e1 en expansi\u00f3n, sobre todo en las grandes ciudades, donde este tipo de productos es muy valorado por sus habitantes. La sociedad actual (desde el entorno educativo y familiar) retorna y fomenta la cultura y el arte de comer con salud y equilibrio con alimentaci\u00f3n equilibrada en bienestar y salud. En restauraci\u00f3n, para diferenciarse, en sus cartas ofrecen platos de alta cocina elaborados con productos naturales y org\u00e1nicos. Clientes potenciales: Aquellos ciudadanos y vecinos que no cultivan sus propios productos y que, aun cultiv\u00e1ndolos, compran los que les faltan, quieren descubrir los beneficios de la alimentacion natural. Si bien disponemos de cifras aproximadas en la edad de nuestra clientela (30/50 a\u00f1os) se puede presumir que, en Espa\u00f1a, cada d\u00eda es m\u00e1s extendida la sana educaci\u00f3n social-familiar en concepto de alimentaci\u00f3n sana y equilibrada, ampliando la edad, cada vez en notoriedad, de 20 a\u00f1os en adelante. Tampoco descartamos al turista, que gracias a una detallada y selecta atenci\u00f3n personalizada, y con la confianza que ofrecen instalaciones f\u00edsicas, recuren nuestro servicio WEB. *www.natural-galicia.com. (abierto ya al p\u00fablico y en mejora estructural y de producto). An\u00e1lisis de la competencia: Por el an\u00e1lisis de competencia que hemos podido llevar a cabo, llegamos a la conclusi\u00f3n de que, si es cierto que existen tiendas a granel en Orense centro y capital, no disponen de las avanzadas tecnolog\u00edas de higiene y presentaci\u00f3n de las que nosotros ofrecemos, en este campo el cliente lo valora y publicita. Punto importante para nosotros en tranquilidad a fines de regulaciones de ley e inspecciones sanitarias. Lo mismo podr\u00edamos decir de las grandes superficies, que, adem\u00e1s, disponen de productos de nombre comercial y marca blanca y no siempre re\u00fanen la confianza total del consumidor final. Tan s\u00f3lo podemos dar cuenta de las grandes superficies, que debido a la gran variedad de productos que ofrecen, pueden suponer competencia para alg\u00fan producto. Respecto a los supermercados de cadena, (Mercadona, Gadis, Lidel\u2026) denominados para consumo diario y econ\u00f3mico, empiezan t\u00edmidamente a ofertar alg\u00fan producto, pero lejos de la gran variedad de referencias que nosotros podemos ofrecer. Mejoras propuestas para optimizar nuestros resultados: Podemos considerar una debilidad, la dificultad que nos encontramos a la hora de encontrar alg\u00fan producto ecol\u00f3gico con precio de venta al p\u00fablico menos competitivo que la gran superficie, indudablemente nuestro nivel de compra no es suficiente para negociar ajustes importantes en precio al ser algunos de ellos de importaci\u00f3n de pa\u00edses de la UE. como Francia o Alemania, que al a\u00f1adir gastos de transporte y administrativos resultan menos econ\u00f3micos. Sin embargo, como bien es sabido por todos nosotros cada d\u00eda las familias espa\u00f1olas valoran la cercan\u00eda y la atenci\u00f3n profesional y diaria de la tienda cercana. Potenciales riesgos: La principal amenaza, como comentamos anteriormente, es la existencia de grandes superficies, que cuentan con gran diversidad de productos y clientela asentada de la ciudad. Otra amenaza ser\u00eda los productos que en su etiquetado figuran como org\u00e1nicos-ecol\u00f3gicos y en realidad no lo son, pero que el cliente compra por precio, que suele ser bajo. Fortalezas: La principal fortaleza con la que cuenta la empresa es la relaci\u00f3n calidad/ precio de todos los productos que ofrece, Garantizada y Demostrable. Adem\u00e1s de la important\u00edsima ventaja del novedoso sistema de a granel, mediante dispensadores reglamentados para una perfecta conservaci\u00f3n e higiene del producto. A\u00f1adimos la experiencia profesional y personal por parte de la direcci\u00f3n de la empresa de m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os en el sector de alimentaci\u00f3n y trato al p\u00fablico, as\u00ed mismo la gran riqueza adquirida al comenzar el proyecto pionero en la villa de Carballi\u00f1o, donde ha podido comprobar que es una v\u00eda de negocio exitosa y con futuro .(Carballi\u00f1o se compone de una poblaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s anciana y de menor costumbre a innovaciones y cambios, sin embargo, en un a\u00f1o, ha logrado una l\u00ednea ascendente atrayendo a todo tipo de p\u00fablico y llegando a lugares rec\u00f3nditos(). El contar en la lista de proveedores gallegos, nos permite ofrecer confianza y garant\u00eda sobre todos los productos de la tienda, ya que demostramos estar cerca y unidos a nuestra tierra y nuestra gente. Al contemplar la importancia que tiene para nosotros la compra relajada y tranquila por parte de toda la familia. (secci\u00f3n de t\u00e9 y caf\u00e9s para nuestros clientes). De vital importancia para nosotros es el bienestar infantil, al cual destinaremos un apartado de ocio para que su espera no resulte alterable o aburrida. *Al estar cerca de tres colegios, una cl\u00ednica privada de salud y enfrente del edificio oficial de la Xunta de Galicia, fomentaremos la sana alimentaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de escaparates saludables, con frutas y alternativas de almuerzos atractivos. *. De Igual manera estaremos muy atentos en patrocinar deportes naturales y actividades culturales donde los j\u00f3venes tengan una referencia. Sin lugar a dudas nombraremos la\u00a0fortaleza principal y solidificada\u00a0que toda persona emprendedora necesita como parte fundamental en su punto de partida es el momento adecuado escogido para emprender y realizar un avance en su faceta profesional, resalta como base y fundamento el gran soporte familiar del que dispone en su unidad familiar para afrontar todas y cada una de sus decisiones, as\u00ed como la comprensi\u00f3n y el apeo moral e intelectual de cada miembro de la familia. Oportunidades: El aumento significativo y ascendente de este tipo de alimentaci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como la escasez de competencia, es fundamental para la puesta en marcha de este proyecto. Estrategias: A corto plazo nos fijamos en los productos ofrecidos por calidad, presentaci\u00f3n, precios y servicios de la competencia, (peque\u00f1o comercio) estudiando detalladamente sus debilidades. As\u00ed mismo en la zona en la que se encuentran posicionados, personal de atenci\u00f3n al p\u00fablico, gastos generales (suposici\u00f3n aproximada) y tipo de clientela. Con estos datos se trabaja para un impulso diario en relaci\u00f3n calidad, servicio y atenci\u00f3n personalizada, intentando cubrir todas las necesidades a un porcentaje m\u00e1ximo, incluyendo los servicios \u201cextras\u201d de las grandes superficies. *(espacio infantil, degustaci\u00f3n de producto y personal especializado). Aun teniendo en cuenta la dificultad econ\u00f3mica de nuestro pa\u00eds en estos momentos, somos conscientes de que la adaptaci\u00f3n en precios y productos unido a todo un conjunto referenciado anteriormente Pol\u00edtica de empresa: Resaltando los valores humanos basados en respeto, lealtad, humildad y honestidad como punto de partida. Con una fuerte base de unidad familiar y profesional, con un \u00fanico objetivo en la puesta en marcha a corto plazo y un s\u00f3lido ascendente continuado, el objetivo visto a largo plazo de la empresa, la motivaci\u00f3n final es consolidar nombre y firma propia con sabor y aroma de nuestra tierra, generando y transmitiendo valores a toda Espa\u00f1a y abriendo un continuado punto de ventas y presentaci\u00f3n. generando profesionales y cubriendo puestos de trabajo. Aun teniendo en cuenta la dificultad econ\u00f3mica de nuestro pa\u00eds, concretamente de nuestra ciudad de Ourense, somos conscientes de la aceptaci\u00f3n de nuestra empresa, as\u00ed como el servicio que prestar\u00e1 a todos los habitantes y vecinos basando nuestra pol\u00edtica de ventas en breves catas mediante sencillas elaboraciones con el fin de que el cliente se pueda elegir el producto que m\u00e1s se adapte a sus posibilidades.

General aspects of the sector: As is well known, the sector dedicated to the sale of natural and organic products is expanding, especially in large cities, where this type of products is highly valued by its inhabitants. \u00a0 The present society (from the educational and family environment) returns and promotes the culture and art of eating with health and balance with balanced diet in well-being and health. In restoration, to distinguish themselves, in their letters they offer dishes of haute cuisine elaborated with natural and organic products. Potential customers: Those citizens and neighbors who do not cultivate their own products and who, even cultivating them, buy the ones they lack, want to discover the benefits of natural food. \u00a0 Although we have approximate figures in the age of our clientele (30/50 years) it can be presumed that, in Spain, every day is more widespread the healthy social-family education in concept of healthy and balanced food, increasing the age, each Time in notoriety, from 20 years onwards. Neither do we rule out the tourist, who thanks to a detailed and select personalized attention, and with the confidence that offer physical facilities, resort our WEB service. * Www.natural-galicia.com. (Already open to the public and in structural and product improvement). Analysis of the competition: From the competition analysis we have been able to carry out, we conclude that, if it is true that there are bulk stores in Orense center and capital, they do not have the advanced hygiene and presentation technologies that we offer, in This field is valued and advertised by the client. Important point for us in tranquility for purposes of law regulations and sanitary inspections. The same could be said of large supermarkets, which also have products with a trade name and white label and do not always meet the total confidence of the final consumer. We can only give account of the large areas, which due to the great variety of products they offer, may lead to competition for some product. With regard to chain supermarkets (Mercadona, Gadis, Lidel ...), called for daily and economic consumption, they shyly start offering some product, but far from the great variety of references we can offer. Improvements proposals to optimize our results: We can consider a weakness, the difficulty that we find in finding an ecological product with a retail price less competitive than the large area, undoubtedly our level of purchase is not enough to negotiate important adjustments in price as some of them Imports from EU countries. Such as France or Germany, which adds less transport and administrative costs. However, as is well known by all of us, every day the Spanish families appreciate the closeness and the professional and daily attention of the nearby store. Potential risks: The main threat, as we said before, is the existence of large areas, which have a great diversity of products and seated clientele of the city. Another threat would be the products that are labeled organic-organic And in reality they are not, but the customer buys by price, which is usually low. Strengths: The main strength of the company is the quality / price ratio of all products offered, Guaranteed and Demonstrable. In addition to the very important advantage of the novel system of bulk, through regulated dispensers for a perfect conservation and hygiene of the product. We add the professional and personal experience of the management of the company of more than 20 years in the sector of food and treatment to the public, as well as the great wealth acquired at the beginning of the pioneering project in the town of Carballi\u00f1o, where it has been able to verify Which is a successful and future path of business (Carballi\u00f1o is made up of an older population and of less custom to innovations and changes, nevertheless, in a year, it has obtained an ascending line attracting all type of public and arriving at Hidden places (.) The count in the list of Galician suppliers, allows us to offer confidence and guarantee on all the products of the store, since we prove to be close and united to our land and our people.In contemplating the importance that has for us (Tea and coffee section for our guests), which is of vital importance for us, is the well-being of children, to which we will dedicate a leisure section so that the waiting time is not alterable or boring. * Being close to three schools, a private health clinic and in front of the official building of the Xunta de Galicia, we will promote healthy nutrition through healthy storefronts, with fruit and attractive lunch alternatives. *. In the same way we will be very attentive in sponsoring natural sports and cultural activities where the young people have a reference. Undoubtedly we will name the main strength and solidified that every entrepreneurial person needs as a fundamental part in its starting point is the appropriate moment chosen to undertake and make an advance in its professional facet, emphasizes as base and foundation the great family support of which Has in his family unit to face each and every one of his decisions, as well as the understanding and the moral and intellectual apportionment of each member of the family. Opportunities: The significant and increasing increase of this type of food, as well as the lack of competition, is fundamental for the implementation of this project. Strategies: In the short term we look at the products offered by quality, presentation, prices and services of the competition, (small trade) studying in detail their weaknesses. Also in the area in which they are positioned, customer service staff, overhead (approximate guess) and type of clientele. With this data we work for a daily impulse in relation to quality, service and personalized attention, trying to cover all the needs to a maximum percentage, including the services \"extras\" of the big surfaces. * (Children's space, product tasting and specialized staff). Even taking into account the economic difficulty of our country at the moment, we are aware that the adaptation in prices and products together with a whole referred to above Company policy: Highlighting human values \u200b\u200bbased on respect, loyalty, humility and honesty as a point of departure.

  "Composeher is ambitious. It might just also be unique. The project has been devised by\u00a0the\u00a0Glasgow School of Art Choir and was borne out of a recent survey by the Ivors Academy (formerly the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors) which revealed huge gender inequalities in the granting of music commissions. The survey showed that just 21% of commissioned composers within the United Kingdom are female. Composeher will shine a spotlight on seven composers by commissioning each of them to compose a choral work of around 10 minutes. Each composer will attend the premiere and participate in a pre-concert talk about the commission and the Composeher project, in conjunction with the conductor, Jamie Sansbury. In addition, a series of workshops with six of the composers will be held \u2013 throughout 2020/2021 \u2013 focusing on their work and processes. The workshops will also explore the current under-representation of female composers in the professional music industry. You may have seen the news in July 2019 that Creative Scotland has awarded part-funding towards Composeher, and the GSA Choir has committed a significant portion of its own existing funds towards the project.\u00a0 This Kickstarter campaign is to raise the required funds to pay for the lyrics in each of the choral works, a portion of the project for which we were unable to apply to Creative Scotland last year. The lyrics to be set by each composer are either pre-existing or newly commissioned texts and, therefore, we are required to pay for the rights to use (in the case of existing texts), or to commission a poet (in the case of new works). The GSA Choir is committed to ensuring that all artists whose work is being used are appropriately and fairly remunerated.\u00a0 We need to raise \u00a34000 to cover the rights payments and all Kickstarter fees. Kickstarter runs an 'all-or-nothing' policy which means if we don't reach our required goal by the end of the campaign we won't receive a penny, so please help us spread the word, share the campaign with interested parties, and join the conversation using #Composeher. Whilst we want to keep the final lyrics for each piece under wraps until the world premiere performance in May 2021, we thought we would share some of the topics being written about: Main image: composers (L-R) Ailie Robertson, Rebecca Rowe and Jane Stanley, with GSA Choir Musical Director, Jamie Sansbury.

  "I reject the negative which is normally associated with the black color. I think that , more than white, it represents a space where gesture frees itself from any restraint or inhibition and fills, or empties depending on the circumstances, the distance between the real world and the one of the art piece: it is the transit between the darkness of oblivion and life. For this reason it cannot be conceived other than a positive force after the silence of the soul. What is more silence is a necessary step to reach a different level of experience, to enter an infinite conceptual space. To be conscious of following a path that does not have a beginning or an end. To accept accidents as precious elements and fundamental elements to the making of a project that knows no limits. It is about compositions entirely based on the use of primary elements: there are audacious depths in a monochrome sheet of paper, apertures on fantastic thin geographies in which one has to let be lead from the paper itself, guided by a new network of points of reference, to be able to feel the extension and sense its vastness: sign, tint, the physicality of color are the scaffoldings on which the creative process that, settling, takes the work to its completion. My painting wants to eliminate any coloristic reference, blast the palette in favor of a single color, totalizing and catalyst, black, which appears in a series of different colors only in relation to the amount of pigment that remains on the bottom surface at the pressure that it raises or leaves it, the only concrete action. The rest develops on the plane of ideas, exists only in thought; In this is a conceptual art, a score of light-not light, full-not full, timeless. Its uniqueness and the coexistence of two elaboration models: one almost sculptural, take off color, almost print, repetition as much as possible of the same compositional and formal theme. It's a purely tragic, overwhelming painting that does not offer a scam. It is the fist of a space full of deep void, the prologue of a terrible solution. It's a dark pause in silence. The experience of a work of art is all in the reader's willingness to let go of the discovery of a new dimension of perception, to cross the thresholds that we see but that we do not dare to cross. Art, any kind of art is the liberation from subjection to the banality of our everyday life; banality no longer understood as negative quality but as an essential part of our moods.",
  "Landscapes have been a starting point, however I have\u00a0 been busy investigating my 'mark-making' & producing environmental art work alongside these ocean pieces\u00a0 since 2011, creating small semi abstract works, in a series called 'Under the Gigs!', which started at my first Cornwall Open Studio in 2013 with 'The Cribbar' & 'Spindrift.' and later 'The Summer Exhibition. \"I have created the Garden Studio from home around my small family. I feel in the past my work has been undervalued and often dismissed until the current series of Blue Planet recently. However my daughter is starting School in September, so I will be able to commit more time to my work, which is very exciting for me.\" 'The Attenborough Effect' created by the fantastic team,\u00a0at Blue Planet 2, has had such a great influence on the U.K., I am so relieved, Finally the time has come to #Bethechange and I cant wait to see what other great things will come from this..........\u00a0 I want to use my life skills from\u00a0 Previous Experiences in Education & Arts to make a difference. Adult and community teaching in Arts with hard to reach vulnerable adults with mental health & learning difficulties. Secondary school teaching in Design & Technology.\u00a0 Young peoples community development worker, using Active Citizenship to re motivate at risk of exclusion pupils working in a Neighbourhood Management Team, I had a 98% success rate with 28 children out of 30, in 2 years. so 28 children re engaged with learning.\n\u00a0 Community Artist Undertaking community art projects for NDDC, at Bicclecombe Park, Cow Green Community Gardens Sure Start mosaic. Momentum Inspire me\u00a0This is your chance to choose your favourite environmentally or nature themed quotation or ideas how to ban the plastic from your life (in 20 words or less), incorporated into a series of\u00a0 ocean themed fine art paintings, to be produced. I aim to go into your Schools, Businesses or Community Events free of charge as a test pilot to work out how to make it as effective as possible, then create 'a how to do it' document to pass on to other groups, so people can save time and learn from each other, to get the plastic out of our lives as quickly as possible. Is it easy in your community to find out how to access stuff about Living Litter Free? Perhaps you would like your group name to be on the painting? Should the people doing similar work in community groups communicate and do a similar test pilot and exchange results, to see if the litter reduces? I know it will, then could volunteers in community groups sustain it, this is 'Active Citizenship' & 'Collaboration'. Momentum 'Inspire Me' will enable valuable information in communities that may not live at the beach to be part of inclusive learning for everyone including visitors on holiday, lots of fantastic people 'keep' cleaning up the litter, but after a storm and at the end of each day. The litter is back again........Part of my previous role with Transform was to over come barriers and link existing services, therefore because Cornwall has many small towns, that are all individually doing great work, some thought needs to go into targeting the people who still litter, this is where my project comes in. I want to exhibit my work in places that are not usual for art exhibitions, so that the work becomes educational in itself. I am launching and selling Art works from my website www.tidalmarks.co.uk Latest work from the 'Plastic Shoreline', 'Effervescence' Deep Water, 'Toxic', 'Kribow' (translation in Cornish for Reef/ widow maker surf) & 'Phosphorescence' series via our Tidalmarks website, incorporating litter findings from small beach cleans with my children over the years and I have created a great new project  that will be free for people to participate as a test pilot. Art Prints & Greetings Cards. Credit to Emily Stevens for the animation clip :)\u00a0 I have art prints and cards of many beautiful Cornish Landscape paintings available to view via on our Etsy Tidalmarks Shop. Sales will enable me to purchase more 6 x 4 ft canvas which cost \u00a350 each + paint materials, as I enjoy working in larger scale and makes the texts larger for reading at exhibition. It gives me a\u00a0 great sense of freedom to work this way and the message will be clearer, the pieces I have created are really my development test pieces, which in there own right are stunning but my journey as an emerging artist has just begun. Makeover\u00a0 I will need to expand my studio premises to fit and store the new canvas and also fix a leaky roof, having built the studio in our garden ourselves 4 years ago, it needs some tlc, as does the garden and gable end of the house, which is the first thing you see driving by, I want to showcase the studio in the best light as my husband and I work really hard, we are tired after a normal working day and quite frankly struggling to fit more in to our lives will be difficult and by freeing up our time to pay to have things done, would free up time and lift a burden, enabling focus on this project. I am offering 6 opportunities for you to 'meet the artist' and invite me to produce some work at your favourite\u00a0location or at your fund raising event, business venue or corporate event.\u00a0 Or you can arrange to meet me at the studio as I can also work from photos, Great for wedding presents etc. \u00a0Limited places available.\u00a0 (3 x Cornwall & Devon, 3 x UK mainland only)\u00a0 I would like to:\u00a0 Grow my audience and pay for more social media campaigns, raise funds to travel and exhibit my work further afield.\u00a0\u00a0 Get new signs at my house and pay for an upgraded website, as my current site has limits on the selling quantity and I have exceeded this, I also would like to upgrade my phone website, as its not as responsive as I would like.\u00a0 Develop & produce some affordable merchandise, to go with my fine art,\u00a0 and community projects so everyone can enjoy taking a small piece of my art and small selection of alternative bio degradable and non plastic products to show people how to change.\u00a0\u00a0 Visit venues and aspire to be an inspirational speaker, promoting about conserving and protecting nature, using negative issues caused by man-made pollution and turning these into positive solutions, reinforcing ways to improve a more natural lifestyle. Questions for you with a view to forward thinking... Is shopping at the \u00a31 shop a bargain? Do we really need to have so many plastic bottles around our bath?\u00a0Can we not use soap?\u00a0 As an example, only 7% of plastic from Coca Cola gets recycled, it's being made new 93% of the time. (This is getting better, but its not enough) particularly as the U.K has been shipping our rubbish off for years to Japan, Peru and who knows where else! and probably some of our \"recycled\" rubbish is floating in the sea forming that island bigger than the size of France!\u00a0 Recently new adverts in the UK following stand up to cancer 'Bake off', are showing the new slimline can, stating 100% recycled, this has been introduced gently in my opinion, however with Michael Gove\u00a0doing the U.K a great service by delivering the plastic bottle returns scheme, this will make a remarkable difference to us all, I am delighted by this news, a massive break through. It's really so amazing that these issues are topical thanks to the inspirational 'Attenborough effect' and team at Blue Planet ii, I'm so pleased to see so much more increased effort in lots of communities. Hope\u00a0/ Sustaining\u00a0Momentum I truly hope that everyone can keep up the amazing litter picking and beach cleaning all around the U.K,, reinforcing fly-tipping penalties and many more community groups doing their bit is wonderful investigating packaging etc, the way forward, this is so important to keep up the 'momentum'\u00a0 especially as more and more wildlife are added on to the endangered species list.\u00a0 \u00a0 Education I used to be a teacher and would very much like to educate through the process of exhibition, which will keep raising the profile of 'banning the plastics'.\u00a0 I want to do this in unique venues, that will allow people from all walks of life to view the work, as well as galleries. Bit of a Rant, just saying....... I feel it is essential for families to visit my work and interact so that future generations do not repeat the 'plastic catastrophic mess' that we have somehow embraced in the last 30 years. I am not perfect by any means and did not realise myself about how much damage can be caused by the way we currently live.\u00a0 'I love the glitter\", bling and pearl as much as the next girly girl, however, once I started to research micro-plastics in toothpaste several years ago, before creating a painting called 'Chilli Roulette',\u00a0 the more I read, the more I knew I had to change how I live, the rest has grown from there. Milk delivered at home, Bamboo Nappies or pull up pants that are biodegradable, washing machine filters to stop plastic fibres from our clothes washing down the drain, home made pesticides, replacing slug pellets with beer to protect birds, planting flowers for bees and butterflies,\u00a0 'Pop bottles' used to be glass and children wanted to return them for sweet money, old school stuff is best!\u00a0 If you use glitter then clean it up with play dough (create sparkle dough),\u00a0 do not wash the cloth under the tap and send it out to sea. #bemindful If humans pull together and make small changes, like refusing the polystyrene at the take-away shop, choosing the card packaging instead, then #beingmindful is your thing, its really happening.\u00a0 (Thanks to my mate Fiona for being so clever with that one!). My favourite hash tags I use to promote my work and spread the\u00a0 message are; #bethechange\n#buycansnotplastic\n#ifthebinsarefulltakeithome\n#usesoapnotshowergel\n#festivalfunlitterfree\n#thebeachisnotabin\n#makedoandmend \n#growyourown\n#givenatureachance \n#litterfreeliving",
  "Hi all, I'm Rach, artist behind Bird House Press and this is my 7th Kickstarter! This time I'm aiming to get my ALICE IN WONDERLAND inspired pins and flair made. I have always been a fan of the crazy world of Alice in Wonderland - I live in Warrington, a town in the North-West of England that has links to Lewis Carroll.\u00a0\u00a0The author was born in Daresbury, not far from the town, and the town centre has a marble sculpture of the Mad Hatter's Tea Party!\u00a0 One of the churches in the town has a sculpture of a grinning cat that is said to have inspired the Cheshire Cat... my favourite character!! \u00a0My first pin in the collection had to be the Cheshire Cat.\u00a0 His enigmatic, slightly crazy smile has always made him a favourite character of mine.\u00a0 \u00a0Details of the pin: WE REACHED THE \u00a3250 goal!!!!\u00a0 Woooo hoooo!!!\u00a0\u00a0 So here is the 2nd design I have planned!\u00a0This pin will be available to choose if the campaign reaches \u00a3550 The second pin is based on my favourite phrase by the Cheshire Cat 'We're all mad here'.\u00a0 \u00a0I wanted to keep the design pretty simple - but link back to the Cat so I've kept the shape of his head and the big grin in the design. Details of the pin: The third pin was due to be revealed at \u00a3800 - but I have decided to let you see this little guy early - so here we have the very dapper looking - White Rabbit!! Details of the pin: This pin will be available to choose if the campaign reaches \u00a3800 I have other idea for other pins and goodies - there is another pin design based on the Cheshire Cat (now revealed!)\u00a0- as well as the White Rabbit (revealed early!), Alice and other characters - there is a whole wonderland full of inspiration!\u00a0 I also want to add other goodies to the campaign - so I am excited to see how it goes! The image here gives a hint as to what I have planned!! By backing this project you will help me raise the funds to get these pins manufactured. The majority of the goal amount covers the production of the pins. The amount that remains relates to postage and packaging costs in shipping the pins out to backers. For those Early Birds to the campaign - there are special pledge amounts for those who support this campaign early on. Look for the Early Bird pledge amount - and grab yourself 1, 2, or 3 ALICE IN WONDERLAND inspired pins at a price especially for early backers! At the end of the campaign - backers will be able to choose which designs they would like from the unlocked pins. The CAMPAIGN GOALS image above gives a hint as to what they will be - the actual design will be revealed as we get nearer to the goals! This campaign is set to end in the first week of December - so realistically - by the time I receive surveys back, and funding from Kickstarter - we are nearly at Christmas, so these pins are going to be produced in the new year. I am therefore expecting to ship early February.\u00a0 If I can ship out earlier - I will, I just don't want to over promise and under deliver!! Once the pins are manufactured and I have checked them -\u00a0 all post within the UK will be sent out Royal Mail 2nd Class postage. For international deliveries 1 & 2 pin pledgers are sent standard international shipping, 3 pins and above get International Tracked shipping (Royal Mail signed for in the UK) as standard. This means no tracking numbers will be available with standard international shipping (although I always obtain proof of postage). If you would like a tracked delivery service with 1 or 2 pins then please don't hesitate to get in touch and I can let you know how much extra this would cost.

  "As stated above I turned 60 this year.\u00a0 It's now time to go back \nthrough over 45 years of negatives and produce silver gelatin \nphotographs of my work. Even today I'm still using film cameras and all \nphotographs that are being made for this Kickstarter project are silver \ngelatin photographs.\u00a0 In time the words \"film\" and \"darkroom\" will\n rarely be used in the English language.  With your help we can keep \nthose words around for a little bit longer.  Over the next few \nyears I plan to pick over 200 negatives and make small editions from \neach. Once the editions are sold out no more photographs will ever be \nmade from them. Producing this many photographs \n(around 5000) will require funds for materials, labor, etc.  Your help will make this project successful and for your participation you will received one or more of my rewards. Rewards start as low as $18.00 for an original signed silver gelatin photograph. One of my Kickstarter Rewards will be for 80 of my limited edition photographs.  Thank you for viewing my Kickstarter project...Russell Levin  After working with Erin for a few hours we noticed we were being joined by \n100's of seagulls on the beach. Not knowing what would happen I asked her if she \nwas willing to run among them.....she was more than willing. I was only able to \nmake a few images before the birds flew away....this was my favorite.  I consider this 1971 photograph to be one of my first serious portraits....43 years ago! \n\nThe photo of Caroline above was made during a figure session. As I was loading film I looked up \nand Caroline was holding up the lace we were draping over her body. I liked what I saw and made 4 or 5 exposures. They ended up being the best images of the night! Years \nlater this photograph was hanging in my gallery and a woman came in and was staring at \nit for 5-10 minutes. She asked me who the photographer was? After I let her know it was me, she said, \"Do you know what you have \nhere?....This is the Mona Lisa of photography\" This \"Attic\" is now an attorney's office here in Monterey. I was lucky \nto have been able to use it before it was converted. Renee was not a \nprofessional model but you would never have known as she was so easy to \nwork with. My one and only \"flight attendant\" model. \n\n This image was made during one of my first photo sessions with Larkin. At some point I noticed the scar on her ankle. She said it happened when she was much younger from a bike accident. I asked her if she could put it up on a table and the next thing I knew she had her leg up over her shoulder. Excitedly I asked \"how long can you hold that pose?\" while I quickly changed my lens. Her reply....\"as long as you need\". Mindy was a great model to work with, she was very shy but after she was comfortable with me and my camera all went well. I wasn't trying for it, but after I saw the contact sheets of this session, my first thoughts were the look of Marylin Monroe by Hollywood glamour photographer George Hurrell.....just 45 years later by Levin :)  Over the last few years I've had collectors of my work ask me to make \nsome images from the back side of my models. They didn't want to see a \nface....just the curves from this point of view. This image is one of \nmany that came out of this session from the Summer of 2014. The lighting around the figure\n reminds of Edward Weston's \"Kneeling Nude, 1927\" New reward! - Limited edition of only 15! - Only $200.00! The photo above of model Adrina Lynn was made in a my studio that I shared with photographer Martha Casanave. Much of my work from 2001-2010 was done in the studio. My kids were young and with the weather being unpredictable, working indoors was the best at that time. This image is one of my favorite from that period. I've added \"Perspective II\" as part of the title in honor of Ruth Bernhard and her, \"Perspective II\". On a side note one of Ruth Bernhard's \"Perspective II\" sold at auction recently for over $16,000.00. When she was 60 years old her photographs were selling for under $100.00. Wonder what mine will be selling for if and when I make it to 90....just something to think about.",

Astonishingly, the majority of these deer hides are disposed. This has occupied the biologist and hunter Conny Thiel-Egenter and the economist and chemist Kadri Vunder Fontana since spring 2016.\n In 2017 we founded the Swiss enterprise Cervo Volante and began to develop our first fully sustainable product line.  We thrive to minimize the ecological footprint at every step of our production chain including the conservation of the hides, the transport, the leather processing, the shoe manufacturing and other constituents of our creations. We collect the skins at local butcheries in the mountains. We preserve them either by drying or by deep freezing in order to avoid the use of an enormous amount of salt.  After more than two years of intensive work in this line of thought, the team has grown to include six members. Today, Cervo Volante offers six different styles of shoes in five unique natural colours. True to our principles, all of our products derive from deer that have been hunted and tanned in the Swiss Alps according to the highest ecological criteria and traditional handcraft.  Fine shoes make the beginning of our first product line. Handcrafted by the grand Italian maestro Silvano Sassetti in Italy, they express the magic of the wilderness. \u00a0\u00a0 \nAccording to our Cervo Volante customs, we tan all of our leather 100% vegetable without chrome and with no chemical pre-tanning agents. As far as we know, our leather is one of the very few in the world which is tanned this consequently. We want our precious leather to stay as natural as possible. Therefore we do not add any synthetic agents for dying or surface sealing. A truly unique procedure today! Cervo Volante accessories will be handcrafted in Switzerland aiming to minimize the negative environmental impact of long transports. What you see here are handmade prototypes of each model, which may vary slightly once made ready for serial production.THE SHOPPER THE WEEKENDER THE TRAVEL TAG THE NECESSAIRE ONE TO AIM FOR: THE GLASSES CASE Would you like to see our Cervo Volante wild and beautiful companions live? Our prototypes are ready for personal encounters in our Cervo Volante Store at Neumarkt 24 in 8001 Zurich, open Di-Fr 12-18.30, Do -20 and Sa 10-16h. You\u2019re also welcome to send us an e-mail requesting further pictures and specifications or setting a personal appointment with one of our team members. HOW TO PICK YOUR WILD LEATHER COMPANION\n Like all of our products, Cervo Volante accessories possess a unique character. For selected items we won't just ship you any random piece if our campaign reaches its goal. We will send you a link to our online library where you can choose the colour and design-by-marks of your leather companion once production is completed (unless you pledged for the \"Blind Booking\" reward).  In case you pledged for the \"Blind Booking\", you will be able to select the product colours by sending us an email. However,\u00a0you will not be able to select the individual item based on its design-by-marks.\u00a0 Because our products are manufactured in different batches, the delivery dates of your reward items may vary.\u00a0 VAT, duty, and import taxes are included for the following countries:USA, United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden.  If your shipping country is not listed in the list above, you will be responsible for VAT, duty, and import taxes.\u00a0  Since our red deer are free to roam the Swiss Alps, wildlife marks such as scars, skin folds or minor injuries are expected. This is not an impediment to us. On the contrary. Those wild traces constitute the character and backbone of products that can be bought with good conscience. They are proof of our authentic and devoted production line.\n To preserve the Alps and their inhabitants, red deer are hunted during a well-regulated hunting season in September and subsequently brought to local butcheries. The hides are then slowly and naturally dried in a salt-free manner before being tanned. \n Toxic and environmentally harmful chemical pre-tanning agents are still used in the pre-tanning process of most vegetable-tanned leather. By avoiding toxic and environmentally harmful chemicals, our tanning process is natural from the very first steps, but requires time and patience. All our deerskins are tanned in the canton of Berne, Switzerland, at the tanneries of J\u00fcrg Zeller&Friends and Beat Graber&Family.  For all those reasons, our customers can wear our shoes and companions in good conscience and without any health concerns, even barefoot or right on the skin.  The idea of Cervo Volante was born in a climbing hall in Z\u00fcrich where Kadri \u2013 a seasoned businesswoman and chemist, and Conny, a keen hunter and biologist, used to go climbing together once a week. They became friends and in addition to the common hobby they discussed different issues related to work, values and life in general. At one point Conny mentioned how much valuable raw material such as skins was wasted as nobody cared to use hunting leftover. Being responsible people, who respect animals and care about our planet and its future, making use of such waste was a topic very close to their hearts and every time they went climbing they continued the same discussion \u2013 would it be possible to produce some \u201cnatural luxury\u201d out of that wild, valuable but wasted raw material? That was in February 2016.\u00a0  Active as they were, they went further than just words. First, they made a feasibility study \u2013 researched tanneries and technologies on the Internet. Next they informed themselves about tanning opportunities and visited several tanneries and leather goods producers (including Silvano Sassetti and Meindl-Fashion). As both the above mentioned producers were very interested in cooperation and able to produce according to their specifications, they decided, in September 2016, to give it a try. In October their team was complemented by Marc Fischer, graphic designer, creative director and entrepreneur and Piret Puppart, professor and head of department at the Estonian Academy of Arts.\n In a nutshell:  five motivated people, eager to resurrect traditional tanning methods, have launched an eco-friendly product line  of shoes and are ready to embrace a future beyond 2050 with production-ready prototypes of Cervo Volante Wild Leather Companions in the pipeline. Cervo Volante \u2013 recreating future traditions \u2013 for a future beyond 2050 _ _",
  "About half a year ago, I launched a Kickstarter campaign for my Zodiac Constellation series which included the 12 traditional zodiacs and the moon. My goal was to create pieces that were relatable to the wearer, and to crete pieces that offered a way of self expression. After all, zodiacs are linked to unique dates, making each sign a special symbol of each person\u2019s identity. This time I want to expand the constellation series, and to create a different narrative.   In this new collection, I\u2019ve chosen to feature four constellations, including the  constellations of the Big Dipper, and the Little Dipper; also known as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. While there are many origin stories, the one I\u2019ve chosen to focus on is the one about a mother and child who find eternal peace together in the sky.  \u00a0The next two constellations in the series were chosen to represent an eternal romance: Perseus and Andromeda. A story of a hero and his wife who were granted immortality to live amongst the stars. Each backing card contains a short summary of what the constellations symbolizes, with everything printed in gold foil on a 3.2\" x 4.2\" dark blue uncoated cardstock. The brief description of the story provides meaning to the constellation, they act as a symbol of romance between lovers, and of the familial love between parent and child. In addition to the new pin sets (Big Dipper + Little Dipper, and Perseus+Andromeda), I will be expanding the current gold zodiac collection to include Ophiuchus, often known as the 13th sign of the zodiac.  Silver versions of each pin will also be available in Nickel Plating. Lastly I will also be including the new version of my constellation print in this campaign. The new and improved version is printed with high quality rose gold foil, on a dark blue uncoated cardstock to create a reflective metallic look with high contrast. An upgrade from my previous kickstarter campaign where both the blue and the gold were printed on matte paper separately. In comparison, the new version is shinier and constains no offset in any of its colors. The print will fit in all 8.5\"x11\" frames or larger frames with a matboard.\n\n The constellation weekly planner from my previous campaign will also be available for a discounted price. When the campaign ends I will send you a Backer Survey to retrieve your shipping and order information. As soon as I have this information I will start packing your order (First come First Serve!). All items will start to ship the second week after the campaign ends when payments are processed, and I will ship 2-4 times a week to try and get all the orders to you as soon as possible. If you live in Canada or the United States and you fill out the Backer Survey as soon as campaign ends, then it is likely that your product will arrive before Christmas.\u00a0 \u00a0Once your items are packed, you will be notified via kickstarter message. The approximate shipping times are listed above in business days. Due to high volume of shipping items during the holidays there may be delays, but I don't expect it to stray too much from the regular shipping times. Canadian orders are shipped through Canada Post and do not include tracking. Orders from the states and international countries are all shipped through USPS and include full or partial tracking. \u00a0*******Stretch Goals******* \u25a1 $2800 funded: free shipping on all additional items from my website! \u25a1 $3200 funded: 10% off code from my website! \u25a1 $3800 funded: 15% off code from my website! \u25a1 $4200 funded: 20% off code from my website! \u25a1 $4800 funded: 25% off code from my website!

All my life this desire has followed me and now the time has finally come, I am going to get my book published. We all have different tastes and so what one person feels is amazing literature is garbage to another. So what makes me different from other authors and my story worth the investment? Well my secret is that I do not build or make up these stories. Instead I meet these characters and allow them to live their lives on paper. I feel that by allowing my characters to be themselves and act as they would makes a story for all people in all times. Like Frodo I am going to walk all the way to Mordor with or without a companion but it is nice to have someone to help ease the burden. In other words I am going to get this book edited and on the shelf but it will be an easier journey with your help.\u00a0 If you have made it this far down the page I honestly want to thank you with all my heart. You have heard me out and given me a chance. Whether or not you choose to donate you now know of a lone author making his way to the lava pit of the publishers mountain and you can tell a friend.

  "Izzy and Tris are nearly identical twins but couldn\u2019t be more different. Izzy is a wild child and can run as fiery as her red hair in the wind. Tris is brown-haired, bookish and falls through the cracks like water, as his thoughtful and methodical manner belies his age. The only thing they appear to share is the love for their father: who traveled across the world when they were very young to save them from an uncertain fate after their mother (and his estranged fiance) died amidst mysterious circumstances. What they will discover together is another world where the word \u201cmagic\u201d takes on another dimension. As they pass their 10th birthday and take the first steps into their teenage years, the rift between them grows wider as their true selves begin to emerge, creating a potential unbalance with repercussions beyond imagination. Meanwhile, the planet reels from tensions in every arena of life: political, societal and environmental. While the twins mature into their respective destinies, a mounting dread methodically transcends time and space to bring further chaos in an effort for total domination. Forces of nature can heal their divide\u2026 but will that reconciliation happen in time to save Earth? Set in western Massachusetts, the Five College area (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, Smith & UMass) and its culturally-diverse community serves as the backdrop. Experience in the Western world of media & PR intermingles with my side trip into Eastern medicine & philosophy - while bringing in a fascination with theoretical physics - to tell a tale that bridges this world with the mystic. The medium of fantasy & science fiction leads this journey between the physical world that we feel and the metaphysical one that we sense\u2026 the battle between who we are and who the world wants us to be. This Kickstarter project is for the first edition - which will focus primarily on Izzy - of a prospective trilogy. The second book will address Tris\u2019 storyline. There is a possibility of expanding on this verse with further side/back stories in the future. As far as my Rewards program is concerned, I have included an option to tailor a short side story that will include the donor in the plot line. Pretty cool! Your assistance will go towards the immense time & effort to write & print this book. I\u2019m hoping to have WILD AS THE WIND completed by Summer 2018. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: I\u2019ve been writing my entire life, hammering away at a typewriter as soon as my mother put one in front of me. My first \u201cbig\u201d book was \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d and I was officially hooked. I always had a great imagination - art & music have always been a part of my life as well - and the realm of fantasy and science fiction just further opened up my mind to new worlds and experiences. After starting out my adult life as a chef - while also trying to be a rock & roll star - I went to college in my mid 20\u2019s. It didn\u2019t take long for me to realize what I was meant to do: write. I wrote about anything as I traveled around the eastern U.S. and Europe (while on exchange in England) during my studies at UMass. Journalism gave me a route to explore the world in a more rational manner while my own personal work blossomed as a result, too. After graduation, I went on an odyssey of sorts over the last two decades, working in sports media & PR on the college, semi-pro and pro levels. Interesting side work in Eastern medicine, philosophy, etc. occurred along the way and expanded my outlook on life. Unfortunately, the sports media world is a young person\u2019s game these days. Combine that with my long battle with Chronic Lyme Disease and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that its time to re-shuffle my proverbial deck. So, at this transitional time, I\u2019ve gone with my heart. This project began over 15 years ago and every time I\u2019ve come back to it, something reality-related got in the way. Now is the perfect time to take it on; especially as I proceed soon on the shady lanes of life after 50. This is truly a one-man project, starting on the ground level. And here\u2019s where I hope y\u2019all will hear this call to the universe and help me complete this dream endeavor. I chose western Massachusetts as a backdrop because I\u2019ve lived, worked and studied here for 25 years and the region is special beyond words to me. If you haven\u2019t been here than what are you waiting for? Food, music, culture, scenery\u2026 mystery. It has it all! If you\u2019re a social media creature, you can follow me on Twitter at @jkansanen and the project page on Facebook here. \u00a0",
  "First published in 2008, the Young Chesterton Chronicles opened up a new direction in Catholic fiction. Far from being a \"dead\" market, the series proved that there was definitely a market for great stories told with a Catholic flavor and mindset. >However, despite selling through printing after printing, times grew hard for most Catholic publishers. Several Catholic publishers closed their fiction lines, and even the Young Chesterton Chronicles had to find a new home.  But now, in 2017, with one book left to publish in the series, the YCC has a new ally in the world of Catholic publishing--an ally that can tip the scales, turn the tide and get this series back on the shelves and ready to move Catholic storytelling forward again.  and that Ally is...  You! You, with your dollars, your love for great stories, your love for the faith, and your desire for a new literary culture to rise again in the tradition of Tolkien, Lewis and Williams. You are the greatest ally this series has, because you are the kind of person who made The Tripods Attack a best-seller, kept the series afloat by buying its sequel, The Emperor of North America , and have asked for years about the progress of the third and final novel in the series, Where the Red Sands Fly.  ...and is that third book coming? The one we've been waiting seven years for? Yes, indeed! We're nearing the finish line at last. But to cross it, we need you!",

Guy's long-held ambition was to create a company that nurtured the talent of emerging young singers, players, design and stage team members. Fortunately the Marquis de Grailly and his family, Panloy's owner, were willing to open up their home to this shared endeavour.\u00a0 Over the past 11 years WOCo has been able to support over 220 Emerging Artists to hone their craft in preparation for a professional career on the operatic stage. In doing so WOCo has also created enchanting evenings of opera for audiences in South West France and the UK. The company has performed Handel, Purcell, Puccini, Donizetti, Mozart, Rossini, and for our 10th Anniversary in 2018: Verdi.\u00a0 We are raising funds to support this ambitious performance of La Boh\u00e8me which requires funding for 24 young professionals whose mentoring and support during the project costs \u00a3500 each. This is in addition to the standard production costs for opera which this year will run to \u00a320,000. WOCo relies on the generosity of individual donors in the UK and France to supplement box office receipts as well as a grant from INDEPENDENT OPERA at Sadler's Wells for which we are extremely grateful.

  "Postscript is an early-music ensemble based in Amsterdam. \u00a0We play period instruments, study historical techniques and expressive devices, and above all strive to \u00a0create performances that are fresh, engaging and communicative. We are:\u00a0 Aysha Wills & David \u00a0Westcombe, traverso\u00a0 Artem Belogurov, harpsichord\u00a0 Octavie Dostaler-Lalonde, cello\u00a0 We are making a high-quality, live CD and video recording of music by Georg Phillip Telemann and his contemporaries with the aim of capturing the excitement of a live performance and bringing it to your living room. The repertoire chosen for our first CD is close to our hearts as our first musical endeavours as a group revolved around the Galant style, of which Telemann is an emblematic figure. The concert will be on June 25th in De Waag, a beautiful 15th-century building in the centre of Amsterdam that originally served as a gate in the city walls. We chose this location because it is a landmark of the city where we all met, and because it is simply a gorgeous space - both visually and acoustically - that will bring our performance to life.\u00a0 The program will include: Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767), Quartet No. 6 in E minor, TWV 43:e3, from 6 Quatuors ou Trios Telemann, Concerto in G minor, TWV 42:g2 from 6 Concerts et 6 Suites Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-1788), Trio Sonata in E major, Wq. 162 Telemann, Fantasie for solo flute No. 8 in E minor, TWV 40:2-13 Joseph Bodin de Boismortier (1689-1755), Sonate en trio pour deux flutes et basse continue, Op. 28 No. 2 Telemann, Fantasia for solo harpsichord No. 1 in D major from 36 Fantasies pour le clavessin Telemann, Sonata for violoncello in D major TWV 41:D6 from Der Getreue Music-Meister Jakob Friedrich Kleinknecht (1710-1784), Sonate pour la fl\u00fbte traversi\u00e8re Ire et IIde avec la basse continue en sol majeur, Op. 2 In order to realize this project, we teamed up with TRPTK - a Dutch record label known for its high-end surround-sound recordings. The costs include: We are also taking great care in choosing a venue and a harpsichord. The extra costs are: We are using historical instruments that have delicate voices; thus, to convey the emotional nuances of each piece, it is essential to bring you closer to the action. This is why we chose to work with TRPTK, who will provide high-quality audio and video to make the music come to life.\n \u00a0Instead of recording in a studio, we chose to capture a live acoustic performance in order to share with our listeners the spontaneity that can be achieved only at a concert in a small and warm-sounding space.

That's what I'm looking for your help with. To create and self publish a definitive Photography Book of these images.\u00a0 ONCE UPON A TIME ON THE BOWERY: After finishing photo school in Boston, I came to New York City in 1976 looking for work. One winter night, I stumbled into CBGB's to see the band Television. It wasn't very crowded - in those days you could fit everyone who went to the place in one or two subway cars. But it didn't take a genius to figure out that this was the most interesting thing happening in New York City in 1976. The right people were attracted like flies, the wrong people didn't want anything to do with the dump. Pretty soon i would see The Ramones, Blondie, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, Talking Heads, Suicide and countless other bands, where in the most unlikely of places, the slumping New York City's infamous Bowery, \u00a0a small group of like minded musicians and artists had their sights set on the future.\u00a0 HISTORY IS MADE AT NIGHT: I made it my business not to use flash. I \"pushed\" the film like crazy so I could shoot under the Bowery streetlights while everyone was hanging out between sets. I was committed to shooting at night - no flash - under natural light, which gave my photographs a unique look.\u00a0I used a Leica 35mm camera with long, handheld exposures.\u00a0I wanted to set down, on grainy film, what occurred in this particular place at this particular time. I was influenced by everyone from Diane Arbus to Robert Frank, from Brassai to Walker Evans, from Weegee to Garry Wiinogrand. NOW - FROM THE DARKROOM TO YOUR ROOM: People who were at CBGB's in those days, 1976-79, tell me these pictures look exactly as they remember it. Now it's time for these photographs - this piece of history - to be collected in a high quality, well printed photography book.\u00a0 I have an amazing designer and top quality printer, and with your help this book will go into production as soon as I meet my goal. \u00a0I will keep all contributors updated and on top of the project as things progress, with photos and updates.\u00a0We'll even be having a contest to settle on a final book title, that can win you a free copy.\u00a0You'll be along for the ride, and have the final product in your hands by the end of the year holidays.\u00a0 Additionally, I'm thrilled that\u00a0Jim Jarmusch - director of the classic \"Stranger Than Paradise\" \u00a0and current \"Only Lovers Left Alive\" - who btw hung out at CBGB's - has agreed to do the intro for the book. We'll also be getting some other \"regulars\" involved in the project.

  "\n\nWhat happens to the energy that ripples away from us in our best moments?\u00a0My finest moments were spent holding an art class enthralled.\u00a0 \"Once upon a time, when I was an awkward teen with terrible bangs, a sparkly purse, and a Tool t-shirt, I took a photo class at Maine East. Brandi Martin was my teacher. She was everything all of my other teachers were not: Accessible. Real. Honest. Relatable. She treated us like we were people already. Fast forward to now: thanks to social media we reconnected a few years ago and she is the big sister I never had.\u00a0 One day in class, she was demonstrating how to adjust darkroom enlargers and said \"If you turn the knob this way, it will unscrew and this whole very expensive piece will come crashing down...\" She looked up with a dramatic pause, met each of our eyes to make sure we were looking at her and paying attention. \"...do not turn the knob this way.\" She raised her eyebrows at us and paused again, let it sink in, and it did. Do not turn the goddamn knob this way, people. I would not. Ever. \"Turn it this way instead. You will feel it make these very satisfying little clicks.\"It was a 20 second snippet of my life 13 years ago, and I remember that exchange. The exaggerated way she paused and made sure we were watching, the \"satisfying little clicks\" was the perfect description of what we were supposed to feel for. As a parent, I have employed that strategy many many times. The quiet. The big pause. The opposite of shouting, but so, so much more effective. That's a little piece of Brandi that I carry into the world with me. It's a little piece of my teacher that my kids go into the world having experienced. There are over 9000 of us that spent a semester or an entire 4 years with her. Some of us became artists or photographers, but the vast majority of us did not. Yet we still carry these little pieces of her, of all of our teachers, out in the world with us.So where are the 9,000 now? What are they doing? The pieces of Brandi making art, raising children, making sandwiches, nursing sick people, building roads, building stock portfolios. They are standing in waiting rooms, sitting in church, yelling in traffic, resting in an urn, laying on a beach. Please consider funding this incredible art project, building a portrait of these pieces who have been scattered around the world over the last two decades.\" There's no standardized test to measure lifelong educational influence. This requires the hard way, locating and visiting 20-30 former students, talking to them about their lives, and what art now means in their daily lives. After taking it all in, I'll make a meaningful portrait about them and their world. \u00a0 I've already begun tracking down former students, talking to them about the project. I tested the waters by creating a Facebook group. It already grew to 213 members! I asked them to make a video stating their name, age, location, major life activity, and what class they took with me, and got more than I bargained for. I spliced some of the results together to create the video above.\u00a0These aren't even all of the replies; so many asked me visit and document them! I was deeply moved when Nick actually wrote a song about what he remembered from photo class. The final product will be a gallery show in Brooklyn next summer (location TBA)\u00a0that speaks to the humanity\u00a0of these wonderful people, and to the best kind of student/teacher relationships. I plan on capturing testimony about how the memories of teachers and students continue to influence the quality of each others' lives. You can help make this happen with your contribution. Your contribution will enable me to travel around the US and for some photo equipment. Any funds that exceed the total will be put towards additional travel to Europe, Brazil, and Japan, where even more of my Diaspora awaits!",
  "It was like a bolt of lightning in my studio!\u00a0 Just like Benjamin Franklin, I was playing with water and electricity when something shocking happened.\u00a0  I had been in my garage studio seeking inspiration.\u00a0 I was working with water and coins, exploring new ways to illustrate the fluid nature of money.\u00a0 As I walked Buddy one night, I found a pane of glass in the alley and was inspired to try something different.\u00a0 I had seen an image from a Dutch artist who used glass, soap and a female model to create a great photo.\u00a0  The idea was that soapy water would cause a cool refraction of an object behind the glass.\u00a0 Since I didn't have a naked model, the shot didn't really work, but when I cleaned off the glass - it happened!\u00a0  I was shocked...  In the 1/1000th of a second that my lights burst, something magic was created.\u00a0 I was mesmerized by what I saw.\u00a0  It made me laugh.\u00a0  For the next several weeks, I threw a lot of water at my camera. \u00a0 I played with colors and backgrounds. \u00a0 I threw the water fast and I lobbed it slow.\u00a0 My studio walls were streaked with water and the floor was soaked.\u00a0 It didn't matter what I did, the results were consistently amazing.\u00a0  I was in a creative zone like I'd never known and I am still.\u00a0 That unexpected bolt of lightning changed the entire trajectory of my photography.\u00a0 What started out as a few dozen images has grown into a significantly deeper collection.\u00a0 I see no reason to stop the momentum of this inspiration.\u00a0 It really is a lot of fun.\u00a0  I'm going to create a physical portfolio of nine 16\" x\u00a0 24\" prints and a set of fifteen 24\" x\u00a0 36\" prints with the funds from this campaign.\u00a0 The images will be printed on brushed metal and will be of the highest archival quality.\u00a0 The portfolio will be the introduction to prospective buyers and the large prints will be ready to deliver when a buyer says yes.   \u00a0 When this campaign ends, the emphasis will flow into establishing an art gallery presence of my work.\u00a0 I will keep the updated evolution of this work on my website, www.alanhillphoto.com.  I've also been experimenting with portraits of people within the set of the Splash concept.\u00a0 See Update #6 for examples.\u00a0 It's pretty fascinating. \u00a0 Give me a shout if you'd like to model for me. \u00a0  Why do I want the money?\u00a0 The costs of producing the portfolio and the large prints are $5,230.\u00a0 The costs for contributor gifts, Kickstarter fee, and Amazon credit card processing are $3,000.\u00a0 The total campaign cost is $8,230.\u00a0 The overage of $1,770 will be used for cost of sales.\u00a0 I expect to travel to present my portfolio.\u00a0 This campaign is the booster rocket to get this project off the ground.\u00a0  Why am I using Kickstarter?\u00a0 I could go to the bank and get a less expensive loan for the same amount, but the process of getting a loan contributes nothing to the marketing presence of the project.\u00a0 This Kickstarter campaign does.\u00a0  What about credit card security?\u00a0 Credit card transactions are done through Amazon.\u00a0  Gifts - Contributors who pledge $10 or more will receive a print from the collection.\u00a0 Sizes range from a post card to a 24\"x36\" gallery print and you can choose which image you would like printed.\u00a0  THANK YOU for considering my project.\u00a0 You will LOVE the prints of these images.\u00a0  Alan http://www.alanhillphoto.com/ ps, here is an example of the super custom T-shirt  pps.\u00a0 I think Buddy deserves an assist... \n",

  "Puss N' Books is a used book shop and cat cafe. We have joined forces with Cattails Feline Rescue to dream up the perfect scenario: A cat cafe that allows the cats to find loving homes, and provide people with the relaxation that felines are known to provide. We are setting up here in Bloomington, IL, near Illinois State University. There are a lot of students around here constantly missing their feline friends at home, we believe this is a chance for students to get away and enjoy the relaxing environment.\u00a0 People will be able to stop in to play with the cats, grab a coffee, purchase a book, adopt a cat or a combination of them all! The money we are raising is going towards the complete start up costs: We plan on making this happening, hand in hand, with Cattails Feline Rescue. They will be our source of cats and kittens. Dr. Reid is a vet who will make sure the cats are happy and healthy. Once they are rescued and cleared by Dr. Reid, they will find sanctuary with us until finding a great home.\u00a0",
  "THE PLACE: Masseria Miele is a XIV century farm facility of several buildings surrounding a farmyard; the main building is a tower that, with its arch, welcomes people at the entrance of the farmyard. The whole farm is about 600 sq mt, some of the buildings are already restored and used for association activities. Masseria Miele is located close to Lecce (Southern Italy \u2013 Apulia) in a rural environment rich in wild animals and nature just few kilometers from the town.\n When we arrived in 2008 the place had been vacated for 25 years and it was completely ruined: Nowadays we already restored and re-fixed some of the buildings in the premises such as the XIV century tower (1) that houses the janitor's house, the kitchen (2), the farmer's house (3) used as meeting room and hall for our winter activities; the farmyard that hosts us during work brakes and summer dinners (5). We started to cultivate some of the land for growing vegetables, feed some cattle, plant an educational vegetable garden and offer to children the opportunity to learn how food grows.\u00a0 Masseria Miele is a place where you can meet new friends, learn how to grow vegetables, share your knowledge and experience all year round in a peaceful and rural environment. Among our most successful projects there are the community vegetable garden and the Social Coin Project. The garden allows our associates to take care of the vegetables and harvest fresh and organic products. Social Coin Project is a time bank that gives the associates the opportunity to be part of the organization of the association life, and earn some time-based credits and spend them in future activities such as classes, dinners, etc. THE PROJECT: We ask your collaboration to re-fix an old wood fired oven (7) and an annexed room (8) to be used as bakery workshop for our community.\nWe would like to revive the habit of shared bread kneading using sour dough \u2013 we already have and use our home made sour dough starter \u2013 and have a community wood fired oven where everybody can bake their naturally leavened baking products (bread, pizza, pies, cookies and biscuits), or simply share time or recipes and stories and support the ones in need. To accomplish our goal we estimate we would need about 20.000 Euros that we will use to: \na. clean the area end remove the debris;\nb. fix the original flooring;\nc. rebuild the wooden roof;\nd. put on new wiring;\ne. new doors and windows;\nf. restore the old plaster \u2013 without destroying it;\ng. fix the old wood fired oven.\nIn the following diagram it's possible to see the project area \u2013 buildings with red roof (numbers 7 and 8 on the map). If the project succeeds and raises more than we need, we plan to restore the room close to the bakery workshop (numbers 9 and 10 on the map) and offer to our community a larger workshop space, a meeting room and a storage area for raw materials and baking tools. Arci Miele friends are thrilled to have you as partner in this new adventure!\u00a0",
  "SharkCafe fights depression, anxiety, and fatigue through humor, cuteness, and a healthy dose of salt. In fact, my fans are called the #SaltSquad!\u00a0 In \"Pretty Pins for Petty People,\" I've created relatable, aesthetic pins that work for anyone, anywhere! Stickers are also available of each pin design. In the past, I've created extremely popular wood + acrylic pins, but now I need your help making enamel ones! You can check out my previous merch + webcomics on Instagram , Twitter, or Facebook -or in my Shop. Pledge now risk-free, Pay later: You can always change your pledge at any time during the Kickstarter. You will only be charged when the Kickstarter ends, if we reach the $500 base goal.\u00a0If we don't reach the base goal by the end of the 30 days, the campaign will not fund and you will not be charged anything. Note: I will probably not be reordering any pins until after ECCC (March 17th)!!! I'll be saving some of my stock for conventions, so this might be your only chance to ensure you get one for the next 6 or so months! All pins in this Kickstarter will be: 35 mm (~1.5''), hard enamel, gold plated, 2 pin posts. Sticker versions are at the bottom of this section. As thanks for backing, I made a FREE sarcastic sticker for SharkCafe's fanclub, the #SaltSquad! You'll all become honorary First Class Petty Officers! You can officially join my club at the bottom of my site.\u00a0 If there isn't an exact tier for what you want, you can add pins or stickers to your pledge anytime during the campaign. When the campaign ends, you will be sent a survey to determine which items you want. To add a pin: $11 per pin To add a sticker: $2 per sticker Remember your pledge total will include shipping. Example #1: I want to pledge for 3 stickers. I would choose the 1 Sticker tier ($2), then add 2 stickers ($4). So the total pledge should be $6 + shipping. Example #2: I chose the last remaining Early Bird slot for 5 pins. I don't want to lose my extra discount, but I want to add one more pin. I would choose the Early Bird 5 Pins tier ($50), then add 1 pin ($11). So the total pledge should be $61 + shipping. Example #3: I want to pledge for 2 pins and add 4 stickers. I would choose the 2 Pins tier ($22), then add 4 stickers ($8). So the total pledge should be $30 + shipping. If you have any questions about how much to pledge, feel free to ask in the comments section! Or, you can email me at info@sharkcafeart.com ! There is a chance the pins will come in this year, but to be safe I've given some cushion to get everyone's orders out. Sticker-only orders will ship first after the campaign ends. Stickers will be added to my online shop after these orders ship. If you ordered both pins and stickers, the order will ship together when the pins arrive.\u00a0 Early Bird pin orders will also ship first before regular pin orders. If you wanted to buy a pin as a Xmas gift, but are bummed about it not coming in for the holidays - no worries! I've still got you covered. (If you've ordered stickers only, they should arrive in time domestically for Xmas!) You will be able to download and print an illustration as either a full-color image or black/white lineart that you can color yourself! All Kickstarter orders will be shipped in a bubble mailer via USPS First Class. This includes tracking within the US and delivery confirmation for certain countries. Please be aware that in the weeks after the campaign ends, stickers will be added to my online shop. They will be available to ship untracked in a regular envelope ($1 US, $2 INTL). This is an inexpensive shipping method for international backers, if you want to wait til after the Kickstarter - but you accept the possible risk of the envelope bending or getting lost, at your own expense. Whether you've pledged or not, please share the campaign everywhere you can! Kickstarters are incredibly reliant on word-of-mouth to be successful.\u00a0 I've included 3 sizes: 1 default ratio for social media, 1 tall ratio for Instagram/Facebook Stories, and 1 square ratio for reposting on Instagram! Save one out and share! Tag me on IG/FB/Twitter @sharkcafeart ! I have experience shipping to many countries such as Australia, Singapore, Canada, France, etc! Hopefully this section can answer common questions and give you confidence to back my project! Why is shipping so expensive to my country? Unfortunately I don't set the pricing, the US Post Office does :) For this Kickstarter, I'm actually eating the cost of intl pin packages over 8 oz because it costs even more than I listed. To save on shipping, pair up with a friend or two and split the cost! Or, pledge for the Free Worldwide Shipping Tier for the most savings! What kind of shipping are you using? I am shipping via USPS International First Class Package. USPS has an agreement with certain countries for delivery confirmation. Please check the list below. If your country is not on it, tracking will stop at the US border. \u00a0I have shipped to countries outside this list and have not had any issues, but you are accepting the risk of your package being lost at your own expense. How long will it take to get to me? This depends on your country's postal service and how it takes to get through customs! Generally I've found packages arrive within 2-3 weeks, but it could take as long as 8 weeks. Please be patient! Rest assured I'll definitely be watching the tracking (if available) for each order along with you :) Customs Fees, VAT Please be aware of your own country's customs fees. It is illegal for me to mark the package as a gift and I cannot pay the fees for you. I do not set these prices myself, it is set by your country. (For instance, Royal Mail (UK) will charge a flat handling fee of \u00a38 and you will have to pay VAT on purchases over \u00a315.) If you do not accept the package when it arrives, I can only refund your money (minus shipping) if the contents are returned in the same condition I shipped them to you.",
  "Il cavaliere di Bahamuth pt 1 \u00e8 l'inizio di una grande, anzi enorme avventura. Il cavaliere di Bahamuth pt 1 is the beginning of an epic adventure. Trama e Estratti in fondo! Plot and Extract a the end of the page! Questo progetto \u00e8 iniziato per me nel 2012, ma ha subito mille rimaneggiamenti perch\u00e9 volevo fare qualcosa di davvero epico. This project started for me in 2012, but it has undergone a thousand refinements because I wanted to do something really epic. Questo lo rende a me particolarmente caro, poich\u00e9 \u00e8 un progetto che prende ben cinque anni della mia vita. Perci\u00f2 riflette molto i miei cambiamenti, le mie vicissitudini e il mio percorso. This makes me particularly important, for it is a project that takes five years of my life. So it reflects my changes, my vicissitudes and my path. Grazie a Kickstarter per\u00f2 ora spero di fare un passo avanti e iniziare la vera e propria stesura. Per ora ho delineato solo le mappe, le vicende e la trama in generale. Ho inoltre scritto 80 pagine della parte iniziale. Col vostro aiuto spero quindi di potermi dedicare finalmente alla fine del processo, ovvero la bella copia per intenderci. Thanks to Kickstarter now I hope to step forward and start the actual draft. For now I have only outlined the maps, the stories and the plot in general. I also wrote 80 pages of the start. With your help I hope that I can finally dedicate myself to the end of the process, that is, thereal copy. Il genere \u00e8 Fantasy Young Adult. I protagonisti sono adolescenti, e per questo si portano le problematiche tipiche di quell'et\u00e0: amicizia, amore, trovare un posto nel mondo. Ma anche omofobia, razzismo e povert\u00e0 . The genre is Fantasy Young Adult. The protagonists are teens, and for this reason they bring the typical issues of that age: friendship, love, find a place in the world. But also homophobia, racism and poverty. Tutto questo per\u00f2 in un contesto magico, popolato da misteriose e pericolose creature, dove si comprano e vendono pozioni, dove maghi e meccanici convivono pacificamente. All this however in a magical context, populated by mysterious and dangerous creatures, where potions are bought and sold, where wizards and mechanics live peacefully. Oltre quindi al tema dell'amicizia, dell'amore ( etero, gay o materno/paterno ) e della magia, per non parlare dell'adolescenza, si affiancano il problema dell'inquinamento, povert\u00e0 e corruzione. Beyond the theme of friendship, love (ethereal, gay or maternal / paternal) and magic, not to mention adolescence, the problem of pollution, poverty and corruption is also alongside. Oltre a questo progetto spero di aggiungere altri libri per un totale di pi\u00f9 di 1000 pagine di saga all'interno di questo Mondo. In addition to this project I hope to add more books for a total of more than 1000 pages of saga within this World. Nella sezione Upload pubblicher\u00f2 piccoli estratti e la presentazione dei personaggi, sperando che il progetto vi piaccia. In the section Upload I will publish small excerpts and presentation of the characters, hoping that you'll like the project. Spero dunque di potervi trasportare in un mondo fantastico, diverso e che possa arricchirvi l'animo.\u00a0 \nSo I hope you can carry you to a fantastic, different world that can enrich your soul. TRAMA: ESTRATTI: 1.\u00a0Sogno\nRadura, 1\u00b0 Giorno Prologo, Mattino\u00a0 Una leggera brezza mi scosta i capelli, portandomi una ciocca gi\u00f9 sulla fronte e provocandomi un leggero prurito sulla pelle. Un caldo raggio di sole mi sta riscaldando l\u2019orecchio destro.\nDevo aver dimenticato la finestra aperta ieri sera, e ora il caldo mattino mi sta dando il benvenuto. Inizio a stiracchiarmi portando le mani verso la nuca come sono solito fare, ma la sensazione sulla pelle \u00e8 totalmente diversa.\nCerco di aprire le palpebre per capire cosa siano quelle piccole striscioline morbide, simili a ciuffi di peli. Il cane deve essere salito sul letto, non c\u2019\u00e8 altra spiegazione.\nIl raggio di sole sta lentamente raggiungendo i miei occhi impedendomi di aprirli, cos\u00ec rimango in quella posizione per un altro paio di secondi.\nD\u2019un tratto mi mordo il labbro corrugando la fronte, com\u2019\u00e8 possibile che un rottweiler pastore tedesco si sia infilato tra il minuto spazio tra la mia testa e il muro?\nRiapro gli occhi incurante del bruciore causato dalla luce, porto istintivamente una mano per proteggere il volto e a poco a poco comincio a mettere a fuoco le mie dita. Intorno alla sagoma di quest\u2019ultime predominano fasci sfocati di verde e blu.\n- ma che? - mormoro tra me e me. Tolgo la mano, ormai la vista si \u00e8 abituata all\u2019ambiente, e tutto prende forma. Sono nel mezzo di un immenso prato fiorito, circondato da fitti alberi. Mi rendo inoltre conto di essere all\u2019ombra dell\u2019unico albero nel centro della radura e capisco che la sensazione di prima era dovuta alla morbida e verde erba.\nLa mia mente fatica a pensare qualcosa di sensato, mi sento piuttosto confuso. Cerco di ricordare quello che ho fatto ieri. Si, ecco i ricordi riaffiorano.\nRipercorro brevemente la giornata e infine mi ricordo di essermi ubriacato, quindi probabilmente ora sono nel mio letto, o almeno spero di essere nel MIO letto, e sto avendo un sogno pi\u00f9 fantasioso e realistico del solito, per via dell\u2019alcol.\nSenza essermene reso conto mi sono seduto con la schiena appoggiata a quella che pare essere una giovane quercia. Percorro nuovamente la radura in lungo e in largo osservando i fitti alberi, sembra cos\u00ec buio laggi\u00f9.\nNon ci si dovrebbe svegliare, una volta capito che si sta sognando? Mi massaggio la nuca, una debole ma crescente fitta mi pervade. \nSe mi sono ubriacato come l\u2019ultima volta devo aver battuto la testa in ogni singolo angolo. Un leggero sorriso prende forma sulle mie labbra, ma dubito che contager\u00e0 gli occhi.\nComunque non ho il tempo di scoprirlo, qualcosa nel bosco attira la mia attenzione. Che idiota di cosa mi preoccupo, \u00e8 un sogno! E c\u2019\u00e8 persino luce ... ultimamente i miei sogni sono tutt\u2019altro che luminosi.\nBeh \u00e8 inutile aspettare di svegliarsi, forse devo raggiungere un qualcosa per poterlo fare ... anche se francamente non sono sicuro di volermi svegliare ... o almeno non subito.\nMi alzo leggermente pi\u00f9 pesante del solito, chiss\u00e0 da quanto tempo giacevo in quella posizione. \n- ma che sto dicendo - mormoro quasi ammonendomi, \u00e8 solo un sogno non giacevo l\u00ec sul serio!\nEcco un altro spostamento, questa volta pi\u00f9 visibile. Le felci ai piedi degli alberi si muovono ancora velocemente, troppo per essere semplicemente l\u2019effetto della leggera brezza. Guardo meglio avvicinandomi di qualche passo, i miei piedi affondano nell\u2019erba alta.\nUna macchia indistinta gialla compare nell\u2019ombra dell\u2019albero pi\u00f9 esterno del bosco. Mi fermo, leggermente impaurito, la macchia sembra avere dimensioni notevoli, forse persino pi\u00f9 alta di me.\nSforzo ancora di pi\u00f9 la vista, cercando di capire se si tratti di un animale o magari di una persona con un abito giallo. A poco a poco riesco a individuarne i contorni e riconosco quello che sembra un enorme becco arancione. 2.\u00a0- Dobbiamo muoverci! - esclamo agitato fiondandomi verso il gruppo. Gli uomini sono ancora troppo intenti a gesticolare, ma i miei compagni si voltano turbati.\nKimberlin mi tocca la spalla - stai bene? -. I suoi occhi mi scrutano con preoccupazione, sa che raramente mi spavento in quel modo.\nUna voce si fa largo nella mia testa, fredda. Terribilmente fredda. Sembra una donna, ma non posso dire che sia umana. Sussurra il mio nome una volta.\nProviene dalle rocce dalla parte opposta dello spiazzo, dove la vegetazione sembra distrutta dal gelo. Si, ne sono sicuro. Sono sicuro che ci sia un\u2019ombra laggi\u00f9.\n\u201cWill\u2026 Wiiiiiiiiiiiil\u201d la voce esplode nella mia testa, proprio mentre Nate si lancia su di me. Sento il mio volto affondare nel suo petto, vengo sbalzato per terra.\nTutto accade molto velocemente, e ci metto diversi secondi ad afferrare che siamo sotto attacco. Nate mi scuote con energia, sento la sua calda voce spronarmi - ehi William, ci sei? Dobbiamo mettere in salvo queste persone! -.\nBatto le palpebre riprendendo il controllo, mi rialzo afferrando il mio arco. Al mio fianco Nathan continua a castare scudi mentre una raffica di proiettili si riversa su di noi. Proiettili? Si ci stanno sparando con dei fucili, le armi proibite. \nChe il popolo di Obscuria abbia trovato un accesso a delle vecchie armi? Effettivamente sia le uniformi che le armi non sembrano in perfette condizioni. Un proiettile si disintegra proprio davanti alla mia testa, scontrandosi con lo scudo.\nNate mi aveva salvato la vita. Si \u00e8 piombato su di me proteggendoci giusto in tempo con la magia. Lo fisso per un istante. Poi Kimberlin crea un diversivo per permettere agli uomini nascosti dietro il carro di dirigersi verso il cunicolo che ci aveva portato qui.\nLancia un enorme sfera di fuoco dritta contro i nemici, una decida di guardie provenienti dall\u2019unica strada oltre l\u2019arco di pietra. Questi vengono investiti in pieno e sono obbligati a spegnersi le fiamme di dosso, intenti a urlare di dolore.\nDietro il fumo riesco a scorgere tuttavia altri uomini e degli oggetti non definiti avvicinarsi a passo svelto.\nMi reco insieme ai miei compagni verso il cunicolo per tornare ad Arcadia, sento altri spari partire all\u2019impazzata. \nMentre i primi due uomini scompaiono nell\u2019oscurit\u00e0 noto Nate fermarsi per continuare a farci da scudo, io mi fermo a mia volta.\n- Nate muoviti - gli urlo io mettendomi in ginocchio e scoccando una freccia dritta contro il braccio di un soldato che si stava avvicinando troppo. Sento una fitta allo stomaco non appena essa gli perfora la carne.\nEntrano gli altri due uomini e poi scoppia il caos pi\u00f9 completo: un enorme sfera di metallo, probabilmente una palla di cannone, colpisce prepotentemente la parete sovrastante il passaggio.\nStordito dal botto assordante mi volto per assistere alla scena. Vedo Kimberlin scaraventare di forza l\u2019ultimo uomo dentro il passaggio, appena in tempo prima che degli enormi massi di roccia ricadessero dritti contro il suolo. I rombi assordanti si uniscono agli spari dietro di noi. \nKim si scosta di lato con una ruota evitando dei frammenti, vedo il suo viso segnato dall\u2019agitazione. Si rialza cercando un passaggio tra i detriti, ma \u00e8 inutile. La via \u00e8 bloccata. Siamo accerchiati senza una via di uscita, e per la prima volta riesco a intravedere della paura sul suo volto.\nLa verit\u00e0 si stava facendo chiara anche a lei, la verit\u00e0 su come sarebbero andate le cose: avremmo ucciso i nostri nemici\u2026 o loro avrebbero ucciso noi.\nLa rossa si perse un attimo nei suoi pensieri, poco prima aveva fatto la sua decisione. Aveva deciso di non infilarsi nel cunicolo lasciandoci indietro, ma di rimanere con noi a combattere.\nPerch\u00e9 \u00e8 questo che Kimberlin sa fare meglio, combattere. E non appena lei stessa se ne ricorda, abbandona lo sconforto della situazione inaspettata e soprattutto inspiegabile. La vedo posizionarsi in assetto di guerra e farsi avanti.\nNate che finora si era semplicemente occupato di tenere alto lo scudo si volta cercando il suo sguardo e, trovando un solido supporto, decide di agire.\nIntorno a noi si profilano oltre una decina di uomini, tutti armati nella stessa maniera. Tuttavia dietro di loro altri due manovrano quello che riconosco subito essere il cannone. Prendo una freccia e miro immediatamente alla gamba di quest\u2019ultimi.\nColpisco il primo uomo, subito scocco la seconda freccia ma un soldato si frappone per evitare che il cannone venga messo fuori uso. Lo colpisco in pieno petto.\nSgrano gli occhi. Mentre lo vedo cadere in una posa innaturale per terra e assisto al sangue scarlatto riversarsi sugli stivali dei suoi compagni, il mio cuore si ferma. I miei muscoli si pietrificano.\nKimberlin completa la mia opera con una sfera di fuoco che colpisce in pieno il bersaglio, tramortendolo soltanto. Troppo tardi comunque. La miccia ardeva e la mira era gi\u00e0 stata presa.\nProprio in quel momento Nate si distrae per colpire con quanta pi\u00f9 energia gli consentano le sue capacit\u00e0 i soldati con un\u2019onda d\u2019acqua.\nQuando la sfera di cannone viene liberata e il fragore riempie le nostre orecchie, Nathan, stanco e indebolito dallo sforzo, cede cadendo all\u2019indietro.\nKimberlin prende il suo posto, alzo uno scudo con le mani verso il cielo. I colpi della seconda ondata di nemici ora pesano sulle sue spalle. \n- Will, ti prego. WILL! - la sento urlare da cos\u00ec distante. Batto finalmente le palpebre pi\u00f9 volte, poi raccolgo l\u2019arco e mi fiondo su Nate che tossendo cerca di rialzarsi. Ha diverse bruciature sui vestiti, e evidenti graffi sulle braccia, ma la sua espressione \u00e8 forte e determinata come sempre.\nUso un incantesimo di cura veloce per sostenerlo, poi mi giro verso i nemici che sembrano aumentare sempre pi\u00f9 e provo a pensare a una soluzione. Ma l\u2019unica cosa che riesco a vedere nella mia testa \u00e8 la freccia conficcarsi dritta nel petto di un uomo.\nNo, non \u00e8 vero. C\u2019\u00e8 anche un altro pensiero che si manifesta prepotentemente. Un\u2019ombra scura ai piedi della parete rocciosa alle nostre spalle. \n- c\u2019\u00e8 un passaggio di l\u00e0 - sussurro infine. Sento quasi un peso nel pronunciare queste parole. Ebbene ho paura. La figura che avevo visto sa il mio nome e ci sta aspettando. E ho paura di trascinare i miei amici in una trappola. \nMa magari mi sono solo immaginato tutto. E comunque\u2026 che scelta abbiamo?\nNathan mi scruta con i suoi occhi blu, lo sento quasi penetrare nella mia mente. Il suo viso corrugato in un\u2019espressione indagatrice.\n- muoviamoci allora - esclama Kimberlin, poi lancia un cenno al compagno e come tre fulmini ci lanciamo in ritirata.\nDecine di proiettili mi sibilano accanto, alcuni proprio vicino alle orecchie. Voglio reagire, ma non ci riesco. Vedo Kimberlin invece continuare a lanciare alla cieca delle sfere di fuoco, mentre Nate alza nuovamente una fitta nebbia dietro di s\u00e9.\nVedo la vegetazione secca e le rocce appuntite farsi pi\u00f9 vicine, poi cambiando prospettiva scorgo finalmente un passaggio. \nNon appena varchiamo l\u2019accesso e le pietre mi offrono protezione mi fermo, raccolgo le energie e erigo un enorme muro di ghiaccio. Poi mi ricongiungo ai miei compagni e proseguiamo a passo svelto nello stretto passaggio tra le rocce. \nPercorso un centinaio di metri sentiamo un\u2019esplosione seguita dal rumore di vetri infranti. La mia barriera \u00e8 stata abbattuta.\nKimberlin si volta sorpresa ed esclama - che razza di armi sono! Come pu\u00f2 una cosa cos\u00ec piccola a sprigionare una tale potenza! -.\n- continua a correre - la ammonisce il compagno. Ma avverto lo stupore persino sul volto di Nate, tuttavia non faceva vacillare la sua sicurezza nemmeno un secondo. Mi chiedo se abbiam mai avuto paura in vita sua. \nRipensandoci durante la prova sembrava pi\u00f9 rassegnato che spaventato. Poco prima che il ghiaccio\u2026\nGhiaccio? Le rocce in torno a sono ricoperte di ghiaccio e camminiamo ormai da diversi metri sopra della neve fresca.\n- Nate! - urla la rossa con incertezza, vedo il vapore acqueo uscire dalla sua bocca.\n- non lo so, ma \u00e8 l\u2019unica via - risponde secco affondando pesantemente i piedi nella neve sempre pi\u00f9 alta.\nPoi dopo un\u2019ultima svolta a destra compare la fine del percorso: una piccola salita che si insinua nell\u2019ingresso di un enorme grotta. L\u2019intera apertura \u00e8 formata da spuntoni e pilastri di ghiaccio.\nCon un po\u2019 di fantasia ricorda un enorme bocca con delle fauci gelate. La voce nella mia testa si ripresenta. Sento un brivido lungo tutta la schiena e sono costretto a fermarmi.\nI miei compagni rimangono interdetti. Kimberlin mi si avvicina, il suo tocco caldo sulla spalla mi ravviva per un secondo. Ma la vedo tremare e percepisco lo sforzo nel mantenere alta la sua temperatura. La sto portando nel luogo pi\u00f9 avverso a chi ha il dono del fuoco. Una volta l\u00ec dentro, sar\u00e0 facile preda. \n- vi sto portando in una trappola - sbiascico in fine. English translation made with google, the project is it in Italian so I'm not going to traslate it, at least for now! 1. Dream, 1st Prologue Day, Morning\n\n\u00a0 A slight breeze shakes my hair, pulling me down on my forehead and causing a slight itch on my skin. A warm sunbeam is heating my right ear. I must have forgotten the window open last night, and now the warm morning is welcoming me. I begin to stretch out my hands to my neck as I usually do, but the feeling on the skin is totally different. I try to open my eyelids to figure out what those soft little stripes are, like tufts of hair. The dog has to get on the bed, there is no other explanation. The sun's ray is slowly reaching my eyes preventing me from opening them, so I stay in that position for another couple of seconds. Suddenly I blunt my lip, wrinkling my forehead, how is a German shepherd rottweiler stuck in the space between my head and the wall? I re-open the careless eyes of the burning caused by light, instinctively hand a hand to protect my face and gradually begin to focus my fingers. Around the shape of the latter, blossoms of green and blue dominate. - but what? I murmur between me and me. I take my hand, now the vision is used to the environment, and everything takes shape. They are in the middle of an immense flower meadow, surrounded by dense trees. I also realize that I am in the shade of the only tree in the center of the clearing and I understand that the first feeling was due to the soft and green grass. My mind struggles to think something sensible, I feel rather confused. I try to remember what I did yesterday. Yes, here are the memories coming back. I briefly cover the day and finally remember I was drunk, so I'm probably now in my bed, or at least I'm hoping to be in my bed, and I'm having a dream more imaginative and realistic than usual, because of alcohol. Without realizing it, I sat with my back leaning against what appears to be a young oak. I walk past the clearing long and wide watching the dense trees, it looks so dark down there. Should not you wake up, once you realize you're dreaming? I massage my back, a weak but growing dullness pervades me. If I'm drunk like the last time I have to beat my head in every single corner. A slight smile takes shape on my lips, but I doubt it will catch my eyes. However, I do not have time to find out about it, something in the woods attracts my attention. What an idiot of what I'm worried about is a dream! And there is even light ... lately my dreams are far from bright. Well it is useless to wait to wake up, maybe I have to get something to do it ... even though frankly I'm not sure I wake up ... or at least not right away. I get slightly heavier than usual, who knows how long I was in that position. - but what I am saying - I murmur almost admonish me, it's just a dream I did not lie there seriously! Here is another shift, this time more visible. The ferns at the feet of the trees move still fast, too much to be simply the effect of the gentle breeze. I look better at approaching a few steps, my feet sink into the high grass. A faint yellow spot appears in the shadow of the tree's outer tree. I stand, slightly afraid, the stain seems to have considerable dimensions, perhaps even higher than me. Try even more the sight, trying to figure out whether it's an animal or maybe a person with a yellow dress. Gradually I can locate the contours and recognize what looks like a huge orange beak. \u00a02. - We have to move! I exclaimed agitated and slid toward the group. Men are still too good at gesturing, but my companions are upset. Kimberlin touches my shoulder - are you okay? -. Her eyes are scrutinizing me with concern, know that I rarely get scared like that. A voice goes wide in my head, cold. Terribly cold. It looks like a woman, but I can not say it's human. You whisper my name once. It comes from the rocks on the opposite side of the square, where vegetation seems to be destroyed by frost. Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure there's a shadow over there. \"Will ... Wiiiiiiiiiiiil\" the voice explodes in my head just as Nate throws me over. I feel my face sink into his chest, I'm embittered on the ground. Everything happens very fast, and I take several seconds to grasp that we are under attack. Nate shakes me with energy, I hear her hot voice spin me - hey William, are you there? We need to save these people! -. I bend my eyelids, taking control, I get up and grab my bow. At my side Nathan continues to shield while a bullet bursts over us. Bullets? We are shooting with rifles, weapons forbidden.\u00a0That the people of Obscuria have found access to old weapons? Indeed, uniforms and weapons do not look in perfect condition. A bullet disintegrates right in front of my head, colliding with the shield. Nate saved my life. It has plummeted on me, protecting yourself right in time with magic. I fixed it for a moment. Then Kimberlin creates a diversion to allow hidden men behind the chariot to head to the tunnel that he had brought us here. He launches a huge sphere of fire against enemies, a decade of guards coming from the only road beyond the stone arch. These are invested in full and are forced to turn off the flames of lightning, screaming with sorrow. Behind the smoke I can see other men and unspecified objects approaching quickly. I go with my companions to the tunnel to go back to Arcadia, and I hear other shots kick off. As the first two men disappear in the darkness known Nate stop to keep shielding us, I stop for myself. \"Get on the move,\" I shouted, kneeling down and rocking a straight arrow against the arm of a soldier who was approaching too much. I feel dull in the stomach as soon as it penetrates the meat. The other two men enter and then the most complete chaos breaks out: a huge metal sphere, probably a cannon ball, strikingly hits the wall above the passage. Stunned by the dumb bang I look to see the scene. I see Kimberlin stomping the last man into the passage just before the enormous rock boulders fell straight to the ground. The sloppy rhombs join in the shootings behind us. Kim shakes his side with a wheel, avoiding fragments, I see his face marked by agitation. It raises the gap between debris but is useless. The road is blocked. We are surrounded without a way out, and for the first time I can see the fear on his face. The truth was also clear to her, the truth about how things would go: we would kill our enemies ... or they would have killed us. The red man lost momentarily in his thoughts, shortly before making his decision. He had decided not to go into the tunnel, leaving behind, but to stay with us to fight. Because that's what Kimberlin knows best, fight. And as soon as she remembers her, she abandons the unexpected despair of the situation, and above all inexplicable. I see her standing in the wake of war and getting ahead. Nate, who until now had merely been busy keeping the shield high, turned to look at her, and, finding a solid support, decided to act. Around us, over a dozen men, all armed in the same manner. However behind them two others maneuver what I immediately recognize as the cannon. I take an arrow and immediately go to the leg of the latter. I hit the first man, immediately picked up the second arrow but a soldier stands to avoid the cannon being put out of use. I hit it in full chest. His eyes are lifted. As I see him dropping in an unnatural pose on the ground and assisting scarlet blood pour over his comrades' boots, my heart stops. My muscles are petrified. Kimberlin completes my work with a sphere of fire that hits the target in full, trampling it only. Too late anyway. The fuse was burning and the aim was already taken. Right at that moment Nate is distracted to strike with as much energy as possible by his soldiers with a wave of water. When the cannon ball is released and the rumble fills our ears, Nathan, tired and weakened by the effort, drops backward. Kimberlin takes his place, I raise a shield with her hands to the sky. Shots of the second wave of enemies now weigh on his shoulders. - Will, please. WILL! I feel screaming so far. I finally knock my eyelids several times, then I pick up the bow and lean on Nate, coughing up and trying to get up. She has a variety of burns on her clothes, and obviously scratches on her arms, but her expression is strong and determined as always. I use a fast care spell to support it, then I turn to enemies that seem to grow more and I try to think of a solution. But the only thing I can see in my head is the arrow sticking straight into the chest of a man. No it is not true. There is also another thought that manifests itself exaggerately. A dark shadow at the foot of the rocky wall behind us. - there's a passage over there - finally whisper. I feel almost a weight in saying these words. Well, I'm afraid. The figure I saw knew my name and is waiting for us. And I'm afraid to drag my friends into a trap.But maybe I just imagined it all. And anyway ... what choice do we have? Nathan looks at me with her blue eyes, I almost feel it penetrating my mind. Her face corrugated in an inquiring expression. \"Let's move on then,\" Kimberlin exclaims, then nods to his companion, and like three lightning strikes us back. Dozens of bullets hiss next to me, some close to my ears. I want to react, but I can not. I see Kimberlin instead continue to throw blindly the spheres of fire, while Nate again raises a dense fog behind herself. I see the dry vegetation and the sharp rocks get closer, then changing the perspective I finally see a passage. As soon as we reach the access and the stones offer protection I stand still, collect energy and erect a huge ice wall. Then I rejoin to my companions and we proceed step by step quickly into the narrow passage between the rocks. A hundred feet down we hear an explosion followed by the noise of broken windows. My barrier was demolished. Kimberlin looks surprised and exclaims - what kind of weapons are! How can such a thing be so small to release such a power! -. \"He continues to run,\" admonishes his companion. But I even wondered at Nate's face, but he did not even shake his security for a second. I wonder if we've ever been afraid in his life. Thinking about it during the test seemed more resigned than scared. Just before the ice ... Ice? The rocks are covered with ice and we are now walking several meters above the fresh snow. - Nate! Shouts the red with uncertainty, I see the steam coming out of his mouth. \"I do not know, but that's the only way,\" she says dryly, sinking heavily in the snow. Then after a last turn to the right you will see the end of the trail: a small climb that creeps into the entrance of a huge cave. The whole opening is formed by spikes and ice pillars. With a little fantasy, he remembers a huge mouth with frosty mouths. The voice in my head reappears. I feel a shiver all along my back and I'm forced to stop. My companions remain silent. Kimberlin approaches me, his hot touch on my shoulder enlivens me for a second. But I see her shiver and feel the strain in keeping her temperature high. I'm bringing it to the most adverse place to those who have the gift of fire. Once in there, it will be easy to prey. - I'm leading you into a trap - I suspect in the end.",

  "This summer I have the incredible opportunity of participating in a residency program at Artscape Gibraltar Point in Toronto, Ontario. Oh, Canada! The residency  is located on Toronto Island, situated in Lake Ontario just off the coast of Toronto, and is only accessible via ferry! While at the residency I will be producing a new series of large cyanotype photographic prints using giant paper negatives combined with traditional contact printing techniques. I am running this Kickstarter campaign to fund the supplies I\u2019ll need to complete this project. Cyanotype is a very early (c. mid 1800\u2019s) photo process that is practiced today by photographers working in alternative processes. Its most recognizable feature is the vibrant blue color of the final prints (prussian blue to be exact). The chemicals used are applied to any absorbent material, dried, and then exposed under UV light, commonly the sun, which has also given them the name \u201csunprints\u201d. You can either make photograms by placing actual objects over the sensitized surface, which is what Anna Atkins became famous for, or you can contact print negative if you prefer more photographic effects. I use cyanotype for a few reasons. First, I'm not stuck in a smelly darkroom for hours in order to get a beautiful image and there are less chemicals involved. (It develops in water, how great is that?) Large scale cyanotype printing it is much more economical than darkroom prints. Also, compared to many other photographic processes, cyanotype is relatively forgiving because of its low sensitivity to anything other than UV light. Since exposures are measured in minutes rather than seconds, I can alter the final product in ways that would be nearly impossible in a traditional darkroom setting. For me, it\u2019s the perfect balance of predictability and latitude for experimentation. \u00a0Well, that\u2019s kind of a difficult question to answer since I haven\u2019t made the work yet, but I will answer questions I do know the answer to which might get us most of the way there.\u00a0 Additionally, you could view some of my work at benpanter.com in order to get a better feel of my aesthetic tendencies. Three words: Time, Space, and Community. A huge value of a residency is simply dedicated time away from daily routine where one\u2019s only task is to fully engage with the creative process. The studio space and tools provided as a part of the residency are also important because it gives me a way to work which is normally difficult in my own studio. Also, I feel that spending time in close proximity to others who are engaged in their creative process is the best way to expand one\u2019s own practice. I look forward to meeting new artists and I know for certain that an artist friend of mine will be there during the same period. So, I\u2019m hoping we can engage in some collaborative work. Different residencies offer a wide range of opportunities, and Artscape Gibraltar Point supplies the right balance for my needs right now. I\u2019ll have my own studio, access to a full darkroom, (which will come in handy if I\u2019m coating and drying light-sensitive material) plenty of open space in which to be inspired and make work, and I\u2019ll be spending time in a community of artists which should prove invaluable through the exchange of ideas.  I am running this $600 Kickstarter campaign primarily to fund the supplies I need to make work. Also factored in are fees and taxes that I\u2019ll have to pay as well as the rewards I\u2019ll be shipping out to you. Specifically, the supplies I'll be purchasing are: STRETCH GOAL 1 -\u00a0SUCCESSFUL! If I get $100 more\u00a0($700 total)\u00a0I\u2019ll be able to add on a few more supplies that will allow me to work on a small side project while in residence. Since the cyanotype process needs bright sunlight, it's really got a 9-3 kind of timetable. So I've decided on this additional project which dovetails nicely with that in mind. I've always been fond of pinhole photography, so I plan on taking some low light digital pinhole photos. In order to do this I'll need a pinhole lens cap for my camera and an intervalometer in order to allow for very long exposures. STRETCH GOAL 2 - UNLOCKED Any money beyond the first $700 will go towards the trip expenses (travel, room & board) which totals over $500 for a grand total goal of $1200. We can do it! I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of rewards I would want to receive from a project like this, and I\u2019m really excited with what I\u2019ve been able to make available. I hope you are as excited to receive these rewards as I am to make them. If you have any questions feel free to ask. If you want to get a better sense of who I am as an artist I recommend visiting my website, benpanter.com, and my blog, benpanter.blogspot.com\u00a0. Thank you for taking the time to learn about my project. ",
  "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 SYNOPSIS\u00a0 This is the story about Rufio, before the mohawk, before Neverland, before he was The Pan.\u00a0 Roofus is a 13-year-old kid who is destined to be more than he is. After his mother is forced to put him into a foster home, he and his rag-tag group of best friends - a Jamaican boy named Julani\u00a0and a\u00a0bright-eyed\u00a0latina force of nature\u00a0named Ella - find a way for Roofus to escape his ill fate, find his happy thought and fulfill his destiny.\u00a0 The story has been reverse engineered from what was set-up in Hook. We answer all the questions you've ever wondered -- How and why is Rufio the leader of the Lost Boys? Where does \"bangarang\" come from? And of course, how he gets the mohawk.\u00a0 In a world of endless sequels, prequels, and reboots - we feel Bangarang holds a unique place. , The key for us is that this movie is a social commentary on the current world climate. We are taking a beloved character out of his comfort zone.\u00a0 This is an underdog, coming-of-age film in all the best ways. It's the story of a under represented group of heroes - bullied because they're different, and nothing more (such as Roofus, who comes from a immigrant family) - who won't let their villains get in the way of destiny.\u00a0We think there's a hunger for good storytelling and strong execution, as well as fun original characters. With Bangarang, we plan to do just that.\u00a0 If our production budget is met, and we exceed our target number, we've set up a dream milestone: That's right. We're confident that for that budget, we could tell this story in feature form and bring you to a version of Neverland you've never seen before.

  "The early Internet was a vast, unregulated frontier where users discovered totally new and unexpected sides of themselves. \u00a0The opportunity to invent a new life and join a new community through an avatar revolutionized communication and social connection. \u00a0This was particularly true in the cold, dark aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. \u00a0Ishkhan, a young Armenian man, discovers a new side of himself through an online game community. \u00a0He is more comfortable expressing himself as a beautiful woman in a fantasy universe than as a downtrodden man in a bleak home scenario. \u00a0But how do others see him, online and offline? Welcome to the Kickstarter campaign for Role Playing Game! Role Playing Game tells the story of a young man in post-Soviet Armenia who reinvents himself through a massively multiplayer online role playing game [MMORPG]. \u00a0The opera addresses themes of loneliness, alienation, gender expression, and the complicated relationship between traditional cultures and our new digital world. Featuring a cast of four and a supporting ensemble of twelve, the music blends Armenian folk music and Japanese videogame music into the opera style. \u00a0Specifically, synthesizer, Armenian duduk, Nintendo GameBoy, and digitally processed voice supplement a chamber ensemble of strings, clarinets, and piano. Though many people are intimidated by opera, this project presents an accessible and entertaining 90-minute experience. \u00a0The story is contemporary, and in English; the music draws on cultures from outside the traditional old-world settings of the famous operas. \u00a0The production also features original projections behind the stage. The protagonist of Role Playing Game, Ishkhan, creates an avatar that is everything he is not: bright, beautiful, free, and female. \u00a0At first, this new online persona reinvigorates his self-esteem, but then he naively plunges into an unhealthy relationship with another player online. \u00a0His mother, with great dismay, watches the game absorb her son; she worries how he will fulfill his role as an Armenian man, and she cannot understand the force the online world exerts on him. \u00a0This opera embraces the astounding social opportunities of the Internet but acknowledges the dark, addictive side of anonymous online interaction. _____________________________________________________ I am producing the entire opera on my own, without a professional opera company or backing from an institution. The money raised from this campaign goes towards renting the venue, producing/recording the shows, and the awesome musicians who have dedicated much time for very little money. \u00a0Additional funding beyond the goal is much appreciated and will go towards superior video/audio recording, additional performances in the future, and paying the musicians a fee closer to what they deserve. \u00a0An $18 donation includes a discounted ticket to either performance. //CORRECTION FROM VIDEO// The performances on Friday, Feb. 22 and Saturday, Feb. 23 are open to the public. \u00a0Thursday, Feb. 21 will be a \u00a0closed dress rehearsal. \u00a0[If you cannot attend the two perf ormances but are available for the dress rehearsal, reach out to me directly and I will open a small audience section.] This opera has been in development for over three years and I am so proud to present the finished product. \u00a0Thank you for supporting new artworks that reflect our time. \u00a0To reach me with any questions, comments, or just to say hi, email me at jacobpshulman@gmail.com. - Jacob Shulman, composer and librettist",
  "I am recording my second album - comprised of lesser known Italian violin sonatas around the time of Corelli - with good friends Doug Balliett, Ezra Seltzer, Adam Cockerham and Elliot Figg. This is a super exciting project that will be a lot of fun, and - we think - will produce an amazing CD. Please help us make this possible! Recording is an expensive venture - equipment, engineer, venue, harpsichord rental, travel expenses, etc. We hope you\u2019ll contribute and win a fun reward :) Thank you for your consideration.\u00a0",
  "It was 1 a.m. when I got the itch. My mind had been racing and searching trying to figure out what to do. Finally, the idea twisted itself into my mind and The Raven Book Crate was born.\u00a0 The Raven Book Crate is a young adult book subscription service with a crafty twist, homemade bookish candles created from the heart from The Candle Caffe (a.k.a. My Kitchen).\u00a0 Part of the joy of this subscription service is the mystery of not knowing what book or goodies you are going to get before it is received. The only little hints you get is the knowledge that you will receive\u00a0a recently released Young Adult novel and the theme of the month.\u00a0 For my first ever The Raven Book Crate box my theme is Love and Theatrics!\u00a0 What does this entail for my bookish crate? A book twisted in two of the most dramatic of human pleasures love and theater. To tell you all the specifics of what might be contained inside would ruin the fun and certainly the surprise. So embrace the madness and the uncertainty, it is truly what makes up the spice of life! By pledging your support you are helping me to transform what was once only an idea in my mind and turning it into reality. With the money received I will: -obtain the supplies for the first book crate -create the official logo for The Raven Book Crate Brand\u00a0 & -Set up the full website for the subscription service to be sold \u00a0",
  "This naturally allowed me to focus on Rey de Noches and actually write it to the point where I tried to find a\u00a0literary agent who could help me gain momentum and help me edit the story. But with no luck whatsoever came to me. I then did the stupid thing and self-published it, hoping that it would be successful enough to give me a chance in the field of writing. At least, to the point where I could work in the field on a more professional level. Hell, I was convinced that the plot and setting would be enough to get my name out there and help kick off my writing career. Unfortunately, despite the positive feedback regarding my imagination and creativity, the most frequent\u00a0criticism\u00a0that has held this story back is the writing. It's been difficult having to make such a commitment. But thankfully it has allowed me to form a steady way of paying off student loans, debt, and giving my younger siblings a better future. Perhaps even give me a chance to take care of them directly myself.",
  "Exposure to live music is certainly not an essential, but it can help to lift moods and minds and remind people going through a tough time of when they played, what they played and how much they enjoyed doing it. Dignity Music is a project designed to uplift the heart. The first year of Dignity Music I presented eight concerts for the homeless and marginally-homed population of New Haven at the St. Thomas Moore Soup Kitchen, Stepping Stone Transitional Housing program, Fellowship Place and the New Haven Free Public Library. Two years ago, though Kickstarter funding and a Community Arts Grant from the City of New Haven, I presented thirteen concerts with a variety of musicians who presented everything from Baroque trios to Irish jigs and reels. Last year, I presented five concerts and continued to build particular relationships with the Sunrise Cafe and the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen. At every concert guests at the kitchen come to chat about music, what they like, what they played or continue to play. It is always a cheerful experience! All musicians were paid under the going rate and prepared beautiful selections of music designed to cheer people up (no late Beethoven :). The goal for 2018-19 Dignity Music is modest, but I plan to apply for the Neighborhood Cultural Vitality Grant in order to present ten concerts during the darkest time of the year. \u00a0All of the $1,000 raised (after Kickstarter fees), will go to pay musicians; I receive no payment for the administrative aspect of this project. The video is now outdated, but many thanks to John Fon Kovalsky and Joey Ortiz for making it! Th",
  "An album blending Mexican folk tales, Bulgarian rhythms, and film noir atmosphere An album that explores the mystery and magic surrounding the month of October through various Mexican folktales and artists. The music features a quintet of solo violin, harp, guitar, bass, and world percussion. The centerpiece of the album is a violin concerto with the featured quintet surrounded by a full orchestra.

  "\u00a0 Overview of Project We are making a very special fine art painting.\u00a0The painting shows good people passing along a beautiful world to young stewards in a perpetual stewardship relay. Kickstarter makes it fun, easy, and inexpensive to participate. An explanation of the importance of the work is shown below. \u00a0Suffice\u00a0it to say that - \u00a0if you choose to participate you will be proud to\u00a0say that you are an original\u00a0backer this wonderful kickstater project.\u00a0 Imagine yourself helping to make the best world ever. Imagine all the kickstarters and everyone everywhere working together\u00a0to make that happen. \u00a0Imagine teaching and preparing the youngsters (youngstarters) to do an even better job. Imagine passing along\u00a0that beautiful world to the youngsters who in their turn - make the world even better. Imagine that happening over and over again in a perpetual stewardship relay. This painting shows how kickstarters and good people everywhere\u00a0are helping to make it \u00a0happen. They are truely making a beautiful home for all living things. A home for freedom and respect for the individual. A home for all to peacefully\u00a0love, share, cherish, protect, preserve,  and enjoy. This beautiful fine art painting is a portrait of humanity, the living earth - our home, and the cosmos. As you can see, \u00a0the power of art allows us to place you and all of humanity in the painting twice; once as a youngster and then again as an adult. The painting has a very special message. The message of the painting is - We are all making the world a better place. We all are working together to improve our own lives, the world in which we live, and our future - and we are a very small part of a larger creation. We are all participants in a perpetual \"Stewardship Relay.\"\u00a0 Billions of good people are working together to improve the World. They work together to prepare the youngsters to do an even better job. That whole situation is a beautiful \"Stewardship Relay.\" A relay that just keeps happening over and over again. And things just keep getting better and better. And it never seems to stop. It may sound a little idealistic at first; but it is really happening. This very special painting is tribute to all the kickstarters and good stewards everywhere - past, present, and future.\u00a0 It is also a gentle reminder that time is short; and before you know it - you are passing along a better world to the next generation. Also important - \u00a0we want to sell prints of the work to get and keep this message in front of as many people as possible (especially the youngsters) and so that we can fund the project and further fund the business of continuing to promote the work and its message.\u00a0 Practical\u00a0Application When you talk about making the world a better place and why it is important\u00a0- everyone has a different picture\u00a0in their head. This project provides you with a beautiful picture that you can point to and say, this is what\u00a0we are trying to accomplish\u00a0and this is why it is important.\" It provides a really good \u00a0visual aid \u00a0- \u00a0so everyone sees the same picture. You will be proud to display this picture in your home, business, school, government building, place of worship, or other institution. If you choose to help out now and fund the project now - you can get a print that shows that you are an original funder of the project - Very Special.\u00a0 Painting's Message We all are working together to improve our own lives, the world in which we live, and our future - and we are a very small part of a larger creation. We are all participants in a perpetual \"Stewardship Relay.\" Who are we?\u00a0 Free Stewards LLC; doing business as Free Stewards. There are two main collaborators for this specific project: the person that conceived the work and a skilled fine artist. The work (painting) reflects \u00a0important values that we all share. I can tell you that the skilled artist is of the highest integrity. \u00a0We want this work to reflect the highest values and integrity so there is no funny business. OK.\u00a0 Overall Mission Of Free Stewards Promote public awareness of and encourage preservation and safeguarding of the environment and creative works of art. What we are planning to make? A 6 foot by 10 foot - \u00a0oil on canvas high quality fine art painting.\u00a0\u00a0We are aiming high, i.e., the best possible painting ever. To fund the project we are offering several print sizes to choose from. Since the painting is relatively large, most are reduced size prints. We are offering one cropped print. The cropped print focuses on the hands and the earth as shown below. \u00a0 For the record we are painting (both literally and figuratively) the greatest work of art ever. The greatest work of art ever is of course all of creation by our creator. We are rendering that work with an emphasis on humanity, i.e., how we shape our lives, the world in which we live, and our future. If you feel there is a greater creative work please let us know - with a short explanation, but please no pictures of your spouses.\u00a0 Where did this project come from? \u00a0 The image was conceived some time ago. There are registered copyrights and also a registered trademark. So this particular project is a derivative work situation - done in the fine art format.\u00a0 What\u2019s our plan, and what\u2019s our schedule? The project and painting are well thought out.The hard part of the work is done, i.e., figuring out what to paint. The mock-up (as shown above) is complete. The painting will be finished very soon. It is a simple painting that is easy to execute - at least for someone skilled in the art.\u00a0 What\u2019s the budget? The budget provides for high quality investment grade art work and high quality rewards as noted. We will maintain high quality and integrity at all times. The majority of the funds go to the skilled artist. Funds over the goal mainly go to continuing to promote the painting and its message. Why do we care? The same reason everyone else does. It seems that making the world a better place is \u00a0hard-coded in the human DNA. This painting will help by providing an excellent visual aid as well as a symbol for good stewards to rally around. On a personal note, I believe that understanding the painting will have a powerful and positive influence on our future. It is the greatest work of art ever executed by the greatest artist ever.\u00a0 \u00a0An artist's painting. Art is very powerful communication tool. In this situation the skilled artist is literally using his hand (as shown in mock up below) and the power of his craft to help shape the world and make it a \u00a0better place for the benefit of everyone. \u00a0 Original\u00a0quotes for this project Quote 1 \u00a0 - \u00a0 \u00a0\"before I can believe in anything else I must first believe in myself.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"before you can believe in anything else you must first believe in yourself.\" Quote 2 \u00a0- \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Believe in yourself.

  "Be part of history by supporting the Hellenic Museum's upcoming exhibition, SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES.  SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES is a one-of-a-kind exhibition that captures the spirit and history of both the contemporary and mythological worlds. The exhibition draws parallels between the Greek siege of Troy and the Gallipoli campaign, and links the modern world to the ancient, touching on the universal stories of humanity that transcend civilisations. \u00a0 Sidney Nolan was a major figure in Australia's Modernist art movement. In a career that spanned five decades he explored a variety of themes through his art, but none more consistently, and with more variety, than that of mythology. Experimenting with figures, landscapes, mythologies and histories whilst staying on the Greek island of Hydra in the mid 1950s, SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES proved to form one of the most influential periods of Nolan's life, culminating in two of his great series, Gallipoli and Leda and Swan.  The exhibition will be enclosed by stark black gallery walls, contrasting against the vibrant colours of 61 original Nolan works - some never before seen - including priests in sunglasses; goats; prickly pears; boats in the harbour; and scenes of Homeric warriors such as, Theseus and the Minotaur, Icarus and ancient Greek theater masks. The works in SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES were all nearly modest in scale, and it is said that the handful of larger works were abandoned owing to difficulties in arranging transport. \u00a0 Your gift\u2014at any level\u2014will support the exhibition and related events, and help ensure we showcase this amazing piece of Hellenic-Australian history in a spectacular way. You will be awed by the design of the gallery and the depth of content that will be presented from Thursday 24 August, 2017.  Our budget for the exhibition has been set to include: framing $7,015; lighting $2,500; painting $500; installation $500; printing $1,500; launch event $2,500. For supporting our efforts, we will thank you with a variety of perks including private tours, exhibition merchandise, and access to exclusive events. If you can\u2019t contribute, you can help our cause by sharing our SIDNEY NOLAN: THE GREEK SERIES campaign with your friends and family through social media using our handle @HellenicMuseum.

  "I\u00a0want to paint but i can't afford spray paint, if we reach the goal i'll be making two murals and one that it's yet to be finished. The paintings where inspired by Skrillex (cat) and Bob Marley (my Dog) I've always liked to draw, i started with the gel pen by doing cartoons and creepy stuff, then i started to do stuff with colors, highlighters, then paint! But it wasn't long ago that i really start betting on my strengths and i started by selling drawings and paintings\u00a0here and there, my evolution and the story of my stuff will be on my eBook!  It's getting akward to be stuck\u00a0now that kids are taking pictures on the unfinished mural, and i can't get the paint to finish it... its a slow progress that's killing me..

  "Broken Roots is a fantasy short film produced by Northwestern undergraduate students. The project was made through the Senior Directing Program, which gives grants and equipment to seniors pursuing a thesis short film.\u00a0 The film tells the story of how one young woman overcomes personal tragedy. We were excited to make a movie that dealt with realistic themes against \u00a0a vibrant backdrop. In the process, we were able to film in some of Cook County's beautiful forest preserves and work with an array of talented student and local actors.\u00a0 Check out our facebook page:\u00a0 https://www.facebook.com/pages/Broken-Roots/317554948400472 Writer/Director: Nicole Ramberg is a senior at Northwestern University where she has spent the last three years learning the true meaning of film making and friendship. Nicole first fell in love with storytelling when her dad read her The Hobbit at the ripe old age of 6 and then proceeded to submit ridiculously long stories to her English teachers for the next twelve years. Broken Roots is her first short film and she couldn\u2019t have made this film without the hard work and support of her wonderful producers, Jon and Evan, and her talented cast and crew. Producers: Jon Rizik is the creative partner and best friend of writer/director Evan Rindler. Jon admires the fact Evan discovered his love of storytelling at a young age by creating poorly drawn Star Wars spin-off books. Jon has seen Evan's first attempts at filmmaking in high school, which he has since improved from. Jon appreciates that Evan came to Northwestern University and struck up a creative partnership. Together, they produced Broken Roots, a feat that neither of them could have achieved alone. Evan Rindler first met his creative partner, writer/director Jon Rizik at Northwestern University in 2012. Evan was immediately drawn to Jon's stories of how, from an early age, he crafted short films and music videos on his father's camcorder. Evan was also interested to learn that Jon was dedicated to creative outlets throughout his teens by taking part in speech competitions, playing guitar, and constantly writing creative fiction. Evan is thrilled to have just finished his first feature with Jon Rizik, How We Became Famous. At the young age of 20, they are both excited to begin their careers as filmmakers and ready for their next project. Check out the full cast and crew list at the bottom of the page! We're proud to say that principal photography has wrapped. To make the film we had to pay for equipment rentals, location fees, permits, food, transportation and more! We have received a generous grant and have worked to recoup our investment, but we are still trying to finish paying back our crew who paid for many of these things out of pocket. More importantly, we hope to share Broken Roots with the world by applying to film festivals. Film festivals have expensive entrance fees, in addition to mailing fees.\u00a0 Now that we are in the ending phase (editing, sound design, color correction) we need help to make sure that Broken Roots reaches the widest possible audience, and that our crew can afford to continue making challenging, beautiful films. In return for your generous donations, we're offering a host of rewards. Of course, no matter what amount you donate or reward you choose, you have our genuine thanks. We're grateful that your gifts help us make this dream a reality.\u00a0 This is just a taste of the kind of treats you get if you donate. You'll have access to many of our behind-the-scenes photos.

  "This trailer is the product of a ten day shoot in Iceland during January of 2015. The key creatives and principal cast pooled our resources to create this visually stunning representation of the film.\u00a0You might notice a few things: Our entire cast is Icelandic. All of the locations are Icelandic. The crew is Icelandic. Writer/Director Max Gold has interwoven the classic fairy tale with Icelandic folklore because Iceland is not just a setting, it is part of our film's identity.

  "I know it's hard to believe, but there are people in this world that don't know how to cook or bake and don't know how to turn on an oven. It's true. I'm combining my love for baking with my talents and patience to teach others to do the same. I've been supplying homemade baked goods to my local city for about five years and I love it.\u00a0 I want to be able to spread my passion to others by inviting them into my test kitchen and teach them the basics about cooking and baking. At the end of the class - we enjoy the spoils of our labor. Yummy - Delicious! You don't have to feel out of place in one of those back store kitchens classes like in most Metropolitan Department Stores. Here you get the one-on-one attention in a comfortable home atmosphere. With your help, I can make that dream come true not only for me, but for those Oven-Challenged wanna be chefs, too.",
  "In the past 4 years that I have built my brand, I have had many fans on social media that keep begging for my product to come to their town. \u00a0My cupcake brand has been tested and loved all over Wisconsin and is already selling in one big box retailer plus a few other retail outlets. However, there are so many people that don't know me yet! Possibly you-the person that is reading this and I want to share the passion I have for my brand with you. \u00a0Amanda Cupcake is already established and just ready to do great things, but I am asking for funding support from you to help me take this brand to the next level and share the cupcake love quite possibly in your town. \u00a0How do you do this? \u00a0You can select a pledge amount on the right side of this page, starting at $1.00 and up and I will in turn reward you with lots of cupcake love for your belief in my dream to quite possibly turn the Amanda Cupcake brand into a household name. \u00a0My initiative is to not only to sell cupcakes, but to become a brand like Starbucks, Disney, or for bakers inspiration.. like Mrs. Fields the cookie company!I have a partnership already with a big box retailer that wants me to expand my line of cupcakes to more of their stores. I am asking for funding to help me move into a larger distribution kitchen and hire one team member to start to help me grow. \u00a0I have been renting a transitional small church kitchen on an as needed basis, but they have asked me to leave as soon as possible since I am not the tiny little bakery girl they imagined. \u00a0They said they aren't equipped for a full on traveling bakery like me to be working in their kitchen. (No doubt I am grateful for this church's help though, they haven't kicked me out, they let me use the kitchen when I need it until I can move out).I ended up in the hospital this past November because I thought I could do it all-the baking, the decorating, \u00a0the business end, and being the face of my company. (I am a very passionate person)! \u00a0It took my body being tired for me to see that I needed to restructure my business plan so that it could grow with a team of different people doing things that they are great at!I reconstructed a business plan where I simplified my company to focus on distribution to retailers to start, and we'd grow from there with other fun possibilities once we had our foundation set.I simplified our flavors to 3-4 best selling recipes that I have already worked the past 4 years to master and we will gradually start to distribute these flavors to grocery stores and retailers everywhere, hopefully eventually expanding outside of Wisconsin.As we sell more, we can master our recipes further, and hire another person to add to our team. \u00a0As we grow, we will gain expertise in how production works and we could then outsource some of our product to contract manufacturers or even sell our licensed recipes to retailers that have fixed kitchens so they could bake our recipes right in their store. \u00a0In the future, I see little Amanda Cupcake teams throughout Wisconsin and hopefully nationally (or maybe one day globally) baking away in the kitchen making our best selling cupcakes. Think about how Mrs. Fields cookies did it. Yep, that's my vision! (Except mine is a little sparklier and fluffier).I have a commercial kitchen promised to me right now, but I promised myself I wouldn't just move into a whole kitchen facility again without the financial backing that I need to rebuild a healthy business platform where I can hire a helper and relaunch this winning business model of mine where I am the face of the company, the person behind the branding, marketing & product developers and I have a team helping me bake and decorate my cupcake recipes!This business model supports the growth and production of not only a product-but an awesome brand,.My inspirations are Starbucks, Walt Disney, Betsey Johnson.This Kickstarter is the truest test to my customers (and future customers) support. \nI am looking to you - my community - to support me and help me relaunch this business so that I can deliver cupcake love, and the Amanda Cupcake brand to your hometown! \u00a0None of this possible without you. I've faced a lot of glory in this business, but I've also learned the hard way that when you are manufacturing a product (especially a small one that you need to make lots of to be able to make a living off of), that you can't do it all alone, and that you need the right space to grow creatively!What your Funding will do:Cover expenses to move into my new larger commercial kitchen space so that I am no longer at the church kitchen.Hire my first employee in this new business adventure.Help me invest in a commercial freezer that is needed for production. About Me: I also deliver recipes on a\npopular TV lifestyle show: My inspirations in how I\u2019d like my brand to feel and grow are Betsey Johnson the fashion designer, Starbucks, and most of all..WALT DISNEY! I also have thousands of fans on Facebook, Pinterest and\nInstagram. I communicate with daily who are constantly posting, asking me to sell product in their town.\nOther fans want to know where they can buy my product. \u00a0I also post bake-at-home recipes you can try on my blog! What some may not know is how many long nights, early mornings, sore joints, wet shirts, and frosting splattered pants I've been through so that I can share my passion through a cupcake as my medium. \u00a0I have to tell you-it is so rewarding / worth it when I see the product on the shelf. \u00a0I feel like I am paid in love when I make my customers so happy that they cry or jump up and down and squeal with delight. \u00a0I cry or squeal with them because their connection with Amanda Cupcake is my world. \u00a0After trying to work with several \u201cinvestors\u201d (I even auditioned on Shark Tank), I still haven\u2019t found my \"sidekick\". \u00a0I started this brand from nothing but a dream in a kitchen out of a small diner in my hometown, and thousands of cupcakes later, it looks as though my dream is starting to be so tangible that you can touch it (or eat it)! What else is in the future of Amanda Cupcake (after we get through this plan)\u00a0?1. \u00a0An Amanda Cupcake license. And with that, a line of licensed Amanda Cupcake products (think of how Walt Disney did\nit, but Amanda Cupcake would be the edible, sparkly, sugar sweet version)! \u00a02. \u00a0A recipe book (I have already been writing one and working with an illustrator, I even wrote the story)!Is there a retail store in the future of Amanda Cupcake? \u00a0Someday I would love to open up an Amanda Cupcake destination. \u00a0I'd name it THE CUPCAKE MANSION.\u00a0\u00a0An entire mansion with walls made of sugar and glitter dedicated to a sweet lifestyle---a destination that the Food Network could talk about because it would be so exciting. Maybe in the future when we are ready we can launch another Kickstarter for this idea. \u00a0 When I open this place, I want to do it right, so that we are prepared for the awesomeness that is in the future of a cupcake mansion! \u00a0 Right now the best way to fund and support the end vision of a Cupcake Mansion would be to sell my cupcakes at fixed retail stores that have displays just waiting for Amanda Cupcake product to fill their space!Rewards:If you invest in Amanda Cupcake, you will be\nrewarded! Not only will you be rewarded\nknowing you are a part of a growing brand.But you will also be rewarded in Amanda Cupcake Swag that is offered here as a reward.

  "\n\nThe Project 'Colour hides a power still unknown but real, which acts on every part of the\nhuman body.' - Wassily Kandinsky\nThe effect that colour has on us emotionally is still very much unexplored and\nremains a mystery. Painting is the best artistic practice for colour application, to\nenable us to experience the affect of colour pigments. My activity involves\nfurther research and development within the structure of a four-week program,\nnot covered by a local education authority, to learn more about abstract\npainting, and the science, physiology and phycology of how colour affects us. I\nwill record information, and share this with an audience through a final\ninteractive exhibition of visual arts. Relevant artistic work, experience and achievements:\n\n With over twenty-five years of experience within the arts, studying art from age\nsixteen, finding my passion for exploring shape, colour, rhythm and pattern\nexpressed in large- scale paintings, which I continue to progress to this day,\nallowing my love of Abstract Expressionism to develop. Side \u2013stepping into a\ncareer as the film and television make-up artist, tested the edges and\nboundaries of cross disciplines such as applying colour to a sculptural 3-D\nelement while working within the brief of special effects make-up.\nOverlapping between painting onto 3-D human faces and casts, as opposed to\na flat canvas surface, enhanced my painting skills by working with the\nmateriality of various pigments to paint on more challenging surfaces. I continue\nto research and development interests in the history of colour and how shifts in\ncolour palettes, with make-up, or painters paint, change depending on people's\nmoods and world and social issues surrounding us such as war, and societal\ntrends. With long held interests in the language of colour and the science\nbehind the psychological impact it can have on us emotionally,\nI have recently been researching ways of working with colour and cultural\nchanges since the 1300s, inspired by an exhibition I was involved in at \u2018The\nWalker Gallery\u2019, working with the Curator of British Art. I have been exploring\ndifferent aspects of colour preparation, and the importance of working up\ncolours, the \u2018glory of the profession\u2019 according to artist Cennino Cennini, in his\nbook \u2018Il Libro dell\u2019Arte\u2019. I have been researching how abstract visual information\nregistered through the retina, before being translated by the subconscious and\nconscious mind to use in creating new work, can be recorded with the use of\ntechnology.\u00a0 \n\nProposed artistic activity, and what I want to achieve.\n\n My proposed activity is to attend two sets of four week summer\nworkshops within the environment of an internationally renowned university, to research and develop my work further in abstract painting, and\nthe importance of colour in practice. These non-academic courses cover\nthe role and purpose of developing painting skills and abstract qualities through concepts of using \nboth traditional and modern media and pigments, gaining feedback through\ndiscussion and practice. As well as covering functional aspects of looking at\nhow to present work in new ways, the course will cover questions about\ninvestigating abstraction through representation, approach to composition and\nof placement in an exhibition space. Addressing problems, and finding new\n dynamic outlets for both artists and audience to form a dialogue and connection\nto the work, will help me achieve new avenues to pursue within my own\npractice.\nComplementing the painting in contemporary practice workshop, with the colour\nin practice workshop, will give me a deeper understanding of the phenomena,\nand still little understood power of colour. I aim to form a more coherent\nunderstanding of colour concepts, and the role of colour in art today. I want to\nachieve a way of reaching better creative decisions, as well as increasing my\nability to understand aspects of colour science.\nCreating a series of new works within the four weeks of research and\ndeveloping my skills further, to push the boundaries of how colour has already\nbeen used within the visual arts, how work has been displayed, and new ways\nof audience interaction and recording reaction to colour. At the end of this \nprocess I will hold a final exhibition to gauge public response. I aim to promote\ncultural activities and creative learning, encouraging exchange between the\nartist and community, by developing this new work. Sponsorship \n\nI am raising sponsorship, which can be divided to cover London based course costs in either one or two parts. The painting course runs from 17 July- 11 August, and the abstract and colour course from14 August- 08 September 2017. Sponsorship could be sole (\u00a323,000), split into two (\u00a311,500) or into four sponsors. Costs cover course fees, material costs and expenses, and I hope that the research can become useful in the scientific field to benefit health concerns in the future. \u00a0Colour has been a constant theme in my work, as I believe it to be a very powerful communicator with our subconscious minds and how it reacts with our bodies. Colour is a relatively under developed language, unique to each individual, and can be interpreted differently depending on culture. Our eyes are constantly absorbing visual images from the world around us. These images, taken in through the retina and processed by the mind, can fill in the blanks to make sense of what we see. This means that sometimes the mind will make connections from previously stored information of memories on form and colour linking patterns together, whether they are actually linked or not. The retina itself organises visual sensations of light before they become perceptions in the brain. Nonrepresentational works of art make the eye and information gathered work in a different way to pictorial representation.\n\nThe power of colour to soothe the emotions and uplift the soul is immense when undiluted, as are the effects of music. Sound is intrinsically linked to my work, as both music and colour have affected patients with neurological conditions as they have a very powerful therapeutic potential. \nI want to explore this untapped potential in more depth. To do this, last year I invested in myself and began BA Fine Art, so that I could expand my knowledge and link with a University to collaborate with the science departments. The Summer school painting and colour workshops will also greatly benefit my progress in this research. I have a budget breakdown, and the funds will go into a separate bank account for the project. I will be building and keeping a blog of my progress which will be able to be followed through my website and other media.\n\n I have a more detailed proposal with marketing plan for approval with sponsors.

  "The project We are seeking funds in order to commission four exciting northern female composers to create new opera and song for Brain Jar Session #2 on the 18th/19th July 2018. The Brain Jar Sessions are informal concerts in an upstairs room of Hull's friendly bar in which composers present their music and are available for questions and comments. For Session #2, the event will be repeated in the family-friendly Paragon Arcade catered by Two Gingers cafe.  The composers are: Anna Appleby Katie Chatburn Rose Dodd Ella Jarman-Pinto The pieces will be performed by Ben Newton (keyboards), Rosie Middleton (Mezzo) and Poppy Shotts (Soprano). Each of our composers produces really distinctive and memorable work and we believe that our commissions will both add to the repertoire of new vocal music by women and shine a light on women's music more generally. We hope that our association with these artists will lead to further collaborations in the coming months and years.  Hull Urban Opera Collective Hull Urban Opera Collective is a new not-for-profit organisation whose aims are to invigorate artistic life in the city with new thinking about artistic production and audience engagement. We began this process with a free 15-minute production of Christmas Meeting in December 2017, which took new opera to three locations in the city. Our aims were taken up by the BBC who asked \u201cWould you try opera if it was free and 15 minutes long?\u201d. Audience reaction was very positive describing the production as \u201cbeautifully sung and played\u201d. In April of 2018 we began a series of informal performances of new music entitled the \u201cBrain Jar Sessions\u201d. Audience members are encouraged to bring their favourite tipple upstairs to the friendly bar\u2019s back room where composers present their work and make themselves available for comments and questions. Brain Jar Session #1 was a sell-out success with some audience members experiencing the music for free from the foyer rather than miss out.  Commissioning new music has a cost attached and we're currently \u00a3300 short of our goal so please support HUOC and women composers by making a donattion. ",
  "The Young Musicians' Foundation Orchestra (TYMFO) begins season 2018 with a warm welcome to the New World! Coupled with Takemitsu's brave new world of sounds, TYMFO presents an orchestral classic, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Symphony No. 9, From The New World.\n\u00a0 Inspired by a Japanese poem and the Tibetan \u2018wind-horse\u2019,  From Me Flows What You Call Time by Toru Takemitsu explores a new world of sounds beyond our imagination. This work was commissioned to celebrate the 100th anniversary of New York's Carnegie Hall. The title, taken from a poem by Makoto Ooka, is meant to suggest the flow of music and time that had passed through the famous hall during its first century of existence. \n\n\u00a0 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s \u201cFrom The New World\u2019 Symphony in the second half, will inspire the souls of those who indulge in the spirit of the African-American spiritual songs. By mere coincidence, this symphony was first presented to the world at the same hall 97 years earlier, New York's Carnegie Hall. Tasked to create an identity for American national music, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k believed that it could be found in the music of the 'primitive', not steeped in European tradition. Today, this symphony is well-loved by all because of the haunting melody found in the second movement, Largo. \n\n\u00a0 This concert will be presented and curated by our Music Director, Alvin Seville Arumugam, alongside the orchestra to enrich the concert experience for our audience. TYMFO is an orchestra in Singapore whose mission is to nurture and develop the artistic growth of Singapore\u2019s pre-professional orchestral musicians by providing a platform for them to smoothly transition into the professional music industry.\u00a0TYMFO envisions being Singapore\u2019s next semi-professional homegrown orchestra, locally formed for Singapore. TYMFO is currently led by its Music Director Alvin Seville Arumugam who is pursuing his Masters in Conducting at the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music.\u00a0 TYMFO strives to bring fearless innovation and mastery of the art that we execute, while building camaraderie in Singapore's artistic circle and contributing to our Singapore community.\u00a0In harmony with our core values, our objectives are targeted towards two communities: the music community and the public. For the music community, we aim to hone the skills of our musicians to the highest level so that we can challenge musical standards and establish true camaraderie among our artists. For the public community, we want to cultivate an appreciation for orchestral music by educating our audiences through our concert curation segments. TYMFO believes in enriching the concert experience for our audiences.\n\nAt our concerts, we incorporate educational elements by discussing the works and composers that we perform. Fashioned after a Lecture-Demonstration concept, our Music Director engages the audience with the work's background, before delving into the musical details.\u00a0 With the help of the Orchestra, these musical details are illustrated by the Orchestra's performance of short excerpts, before the work is performed in its entirety.\n\nTo watch our past curated concerts, visit this link:\u00a0https://www.tymfo.org/watch-listen/ Our orchestra caters its concert programme to all demographics of society. While classical music aficionados will be definitely able to appreciate the classical music pieces that we perform, we also want to make classical music relatable to the general public. Our music curation portion of the concert allows us to do just that; by explaining the motivations and inspirations behind a piece of classical music, we can allow all concert-goers to appreciate the music we present, regardless of their prior background or knowledge in classical music. \u201cThere was nothing amateurish about the performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony after the intermission. It was a very good one, in terms of overall ensemble, projection and the realisation of that most Beethovenian of commands - con brio (with vigour)...This life-affirming outing bodes well for a young orchestra with much to offer.\u201d \u2013Dr Chang Tou Liang, Published on The Straits Times (12th Apr 2016)\u00a0 Website: www.tymfo.org \n\u00a0 Facebook: www.facebook.com/tymforchestra Instagram: www.instagram.com/tymfo Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnnLTcBBdtmjo6uah5DutRw\n",
  "The QuarterTones Flute Ensemble, in conjunction with composer David McIntyre and pianist Gordon Gerrard, are working towards creating a piece that we focus on the themes of Diversity and Identity and will hopefully be premiered during the Pride festivals in Saskatchewan in June of 2018.  We are looking for your support help fund this composition project!  The QuarterTones worked with David McIntyre in 2014 on his composition \"Argyle Street\" which was a piece for flute quartet. The piece went on to win the 2014 Newly Published Music Award -Chamber Music from the National Flute Association. It has since been performed internationally and remains one of David's most popular pieces. We hope to collaborate again, this time on a piece for flute quartet and piano. The addition of the piano to the ensemble creates a new dimension within the composition, as since David himself is an outstanding pianist and amateur flutist, the combination is extremely exciting for him!  We have asked pianist Gordon Gerrard to work on this project with us, and we couldn't be happier to have him collaborating with us. Gordon's experience as an orchestral conductor and collaborative pianist makes him a huge asset in the creative process. Your financial support towards the creation of this piece will support the creation of a new piece of Canadian contemporary music and a piece that will also reflect the stories and experiences of the LGBT+ community in Saskatchewan. We hope to premiere the work itself during the Pride festival in Saskatchewan in June of 2018 and hope for further performances elsewhere in Canada and around the world!",
  "With a spray can in Melbourne, Australia, my painting career began and continued through New Zealand and back home to the United States. I was hooked on starting new murals and it was the perfect solution to creating artwork without the comfort of a studio. The downside being that, while I had nice photos of my work, I didn't have the time nor space to create a series of detailed physical paintings. With the beginning of my art career budding from travel experience I am packing my bags again and setting off to South America to begin a residency in Buenos Aires. I have been accepted into the Proyecto 'Ace International Exploration Art Residency in Buenos Aires, Argentina!\u00a0 This is a month-long residency, afterwards I will continue my travels and create murals along the way. My goal is to challenge myself to not only paint walls along the way but to create a collection while travelling. As an artist, you require space, solitude, a wide array of materials, and time to create a collection. All of these things are lacking or nonexistent when travelling. I'm going to push myself to find creative ways to focus and paint while on the road and create a body of work that is personal and also reflects the locations I visit. \u00a0 The $1,600 will fund the program fee and materials. I will cover all travel and personal expenses.\nWith this goal, I will finally be able to invest the resources and time into creating multiple collections - a long time dream of mine!\u00a0",
  "Art is an expression of how we feel, who we are, where we have been and where we are going. Owning an original piece of art that speaks to your special occasion is something that everyone should have to help tell the story about that moment in time when the next step was taken whether into personal or business history. As you can tell by the video, I am not a natural speaker. My strengths lie in artistry and written words. If you will see past my awkwardness, you will find merit and interested (dare I say excited) engagement in funding this fun and creative new venture. While creating new and interesting paintings, I was inspired to pull from the ether a new design studio brand to showcase and sell not only original art, but greeting cards and accessories that feature a beautiful photograph of that original art. Currently, I am working on projects at my kitchen table between meals and household duties. In order to fully realize my dream, I must rent a studio space where I can become inspired, create, market, store and sell my art along with a showcase area to feature the boxed sets of cards and accessories. All boxed sets come with the option of a greeting printed inside for any occasion as determined by the purchaser. I created a business plan and learned about the costs associated with space, materials (paint-related, et al.), furnishings, camera, lighting, and so much more, building a new brand, advertising, creating a web presence and forming business relationships necessary to carry the brand forward for a permanent presence in the industry and future growth. Niche cards are gaining a stronger foothold in the card industry because of the individual messages in the pictures as well as the words. My plan includes the opportunity for customers to purchase the original piece of art to display in the new owner's home or business. Occasions like birthdays and weddings can have original announcement cards sent AND the bonus of presenting the original art to the person(s) celebrating. This model works well for businesses that are just beginning, reinventing AND celebrating an anniversary! I welcome questions, suggestions and contributions. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a painting will say more to you in the first moments than any speech ever could. Thank you.\n\n Let's fund the startup!",
  "I am a painter and I used to have a stall at a local market, but I wanted to move out of London and to the countryside - and I have! Now I'm getting a new stall at Abergavenny art and craft market (and other local fairs).\u00a0 I'm now surrounded by wildlife - from woodpeckers, wagtails and wrens to badgers, bunnies and squirrels (sorry couldn't think of another b!). I expect 6 paintings to be birds and 6 to be mammals - and I'm open to requests! I plan to spend the next 12 weeks painting, while also working full time and selling existing work at local fairs and art markets. My new work is most likely to be in acrylic rather than watercolour, so will be a different media - but one I've been enjoying working with recently. I want to introduce my new work from October onwards - available to buy both online and locally. My big hope is to be able to spend more time outside and painting and less time sitting in an office. My style of painting has been well received by kids and as presents for new babies and parents. I intend to sell the original paintings, limited edition prints and cards. At Christmas there may also be cushion covers, tea towels etc. I\u00a0hope in future to be able to take commissions for pet portraits.",
  "Why: Today, we find our country in grave turmoil. The current administration\u2019s action to reverse critical climate change legislation, deregulate the fossil fuel industry, rolling back of protections to\ndesignated national monuments, and cutting funding for the preservation of the great gift of our National Parks System is alarming. In short order, they have attacked the EPA, scientific community, and moved toward deregulation of laws that protect our land, natural resources, and National Parks. We all must continue to resist\nthese actions! In fact, it is the park rangers \nthemselves that launched the resistance against\nthese actions with alternative (rogue) social media\naccounts to get factual information to the public as\ngag orders and information freezes take hold.\nWhat can we do to combat these actions? Each\none of us can utilize our individual gifts to create a\nmassive shift of awareness, appreciation, and\nresistance. It is working presently in a variety of\nareas and I intend to continue in a way that can\nmake an impact. As a 27 year resident of Vermont, blessed with a shared sensitivity for sustainable living, I came to fear that much of general public has either taken for granted or turned a blind eye to the incredible gift we have in our National Park System. Millions of acres of protected lands, chosen for their awe inspiring beauty, untamed habitat, and diverse wildlife are at imminent risk of losing protections, devastating development, drilling, and sell off. As the firestorm of change emanates from Washington, I am alarmed by the seeming lack of concern for the future of our parks.\n  \nWe live in an age of on demand information driven by electronic relationships. Our most influential and powerful generation at risk has been raised seeing our country and the world through the lens of Google. I fear the National Parks have lost their importance in the minds of citizens, as if a Wiki search of the Grand Canyon equates to seeing our parks or even worse that a drive-by \u201cselfie\u201d at the rim posted to Instagram is a cheap substitute for truly experiencing the priceless gift that it is. Without personal, authentic, and emotional connection to the marvel of true nature, the parks will lose value and one day become a shadow of a once great tradition. As an artist, observer, and interpreter of nature, I am urgently driven to create a wake-up call using my gifts and great personal risk to preserve the legacy of the National Parks.\u00a0 What: Honor the great artist and activist Ansel Adams, who personally captured and promote the concept of \u201cWilderness Value\u201d to conservation groups, Congress, Cabinet Members, and Presidents.\nConduct two great American road trips to revisit, reinterpret, and reinvigorate value for our parks. In the spirit of his inspirational legacy, I hope to lift up his concept of The Wilderness Idea - \u201cA mystique; a valid, intangible, non-materialist experience\u201d. To this end, I desire to revisit some of the locations of the iconic photographs of Adams interpretation of wilderness and on the very same ground, interpret through paint a new record of these precious places as well as discover new spots along the way. Through a valuable permanent collection of plein-air paintings, and a personal study of the park\u2019s people, I will record \u201cPostcards from the Parks\u201d though a virtual travel journal blog. Using social networking, environmental preservation organizations, and project partners, I intend to create a tribe of followers and awaken a new appreciation for our parks as Adams did almost 75 years ago. The ultimate goal is to create awareness, appreciation, and action to motivate a new generation to hit the road, experience these gifts with their own eyes, \u201cHonor Ansel\u201d, and join the resistance to protect these places for future generations.\u00a0 \u2022 A daily travel journal blog with visual components in the form of plein-air paintings, sketchbooks, photos and video of individual parks unique features.\n \u2022 A written log of impressions, interpretations, and interviews with the people I meet and issues at hand. \n\u2022 Postcards from the Parks project website where people can join the virtual journey in addition to following Instagram, Facebook and Twitter feeds. \n\u2022 A limited edition collection of prints of the paintings which will be available for purchase on the website. \n\u2022 A line of quality branded goods will be available for purchase as followers become engaged in the journey and want to support the effort.\n \u2022 At the trip completion the paintings and writings will be published in hardcover coffee table book including sponsor acknowledgements. \n\u2022 The collection of paintings may travel as an exhibition with continued publicity across the country, along with a possibility of a touring speaker series in colleges and organizations around the country. \n\u2022 The entire experience and body of work will continue as a vehicle to promote protection for the parks, conservation of resources, promotion of clean and renewable energy, and combat climate change. \n\u2022 Proceeds from the sale of products and services related to the project will be directed to organizations including The Sierra Club, Green Peace and the National Park Service.",

  "Then the day comes dressed in gold and butterflies, a chance for transformation, an opportunity for a relationship, even if she only talks in his mind. This arty, romantic/comedy, a surreal fantasy film uncovers an artist\u2019s dilemma. Alan\u2019s struggles with prescription drugs, his passion for the unknown, and of course, the voices he hears in his head that develop into a love affair with a gold mannequin. Golden Butterfly Girl is a heartwarming story of self-discovery thru Art. Ultimately the goal of the short film is to bring potential interests from movie studios to help finance and create a feature-length feature of the short. It\u2019s a surreal and colorful concept that has caught the eyes of a few producers, and we\u2019re hopeful that with the help of the Kickstarter community, we can turn this concept into a reality. Many of the main cast and crew will be volunteering their equipment, time, and skills for the short. We will be shooting this film with my own camera gear but will still need additional equipment. A large portion of the production cost will be for the lighting and grip equipment. Other production cost includes: Post-production cost includes: Our character, Alan, loves to collect cool trinkets, and the Golden Butterfly Girl team has plenty of them as rewards for backers. The different rewards are listed in detail on the sidebar, but a few include 3D fridge magnets, t-shirts, 11x17 posters, GBG frisbees, and a digitally autographed postcard by Efren Ramirez (Pedro/Napoleon Dynamite).

Super Stretch Goal any amount above $26K will allow me to pay our amazing cast, my editor that has been working passionately for meals and chocolate, pay my incredibly talented and Loyal DP who has devoted himself to this project, and pay myself, and reimburse my prep expenses that have already exceeded $5K. \u00a0This is Huge! We would be insanely Grateful to meet this Goal!!! One of the biggest challenges for the Golden Butterfly crew is the current pandemic, and we'll be keeping an eye on the news and practicing safe COVID rules on the set. This is more feasible with the small crew that we have. With that said, restrictions could possibly result in us delaying the shoot a month.

  "Hello, My name is Jacob Butts. I'm a photographer based in Norfolk, VA. I'm the founder and owner of JaySlays Photography. I got into photography because it gave me the ability to make beautiful moments last for a lifetime while providing for my beautiful son who happens to be the person who inspired me to embark on this particular project. One of my older brothers passed August of 2011 and that took a major toll on me because he was honestly my best-friend. I didn't want to be bothered by anybody for months afterwards and couldn't see any reason to continue living. Early October of this same year my ex-girlfriend came and picked me up from my oldest brothers' home. She'd called prior and told me she needed to talk to me but it had to be in person. So we reached her house and that's when she told me she was pregnant. At this point in time, I'm a directionless 21 year old who just lost his best friend and brother so this was a bit much to process. Yet I took responsibility and for the next 9 months I moved back in with her to make sure she was as comfortable as she could be during the pregnancy.\u00a0 In all my life I'd never seen anything more beautiful than her carrying our son. It was as if she was glowing and I could do nothing but admired her process.\u00a0 Our son was born July 12th of the following year and my life was changed forever.\u00a0 I now had my reason to fight for my life and it came because of this beautiful woman. This was when the thought of honoring the ideal woman was initially birthed.\u00a0 I want to pay homage to the art and beauty that women birth on a daily basis. Whether it's a birthing life, a hug, or merely a smile, women have the ability to lift men to the best versions of themselves without us even knowing.\u00a0 Your support will allow to me to display all shapes and forms of a woman's beauty while \u00a0giving them the honor that is due the best way I know how.\u00a0 Each image will come with a description of that particular woman's journey and how she's grown in her personal life.\u00a0 Woman have been silenced for too long and I just want their stories to be heard.\u00a0 Thank you in advance for you support in making this dream a reality.\u00a0 Below is several shots that will be involved in the gallery.\u00a0",

  "Audio : a taste of things to come! Entracte from KING OF KINGS recorded in Prague April 2017 Above are: Video of recording of SODOM & GOMORRAH... previously recorded by the Tadlow Music team Video of BEN-HUR recording session in which we added the KING OF KINGS Entr'acte right at the end of the sessions...note this is Camera Sound Audio of Final Mix of KING OF KINGS Entr'acte After the success and acclaim of new digital recordings with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra made over the past 15 years of complete scores by Tadlow Music of EL CID, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, EXODUS, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, CONAN THE BARBARIAN, THE BLUE MAX ,SODOM AND GOMORRAH (see attached video) and most recently BEN-HUR .... now comes their greatest challenge! The recording of one of the finest of all film scores by MIKLOS ROZSA for the 1961 Epic KING OF KINGS. Critics and fans raved over BEN-HUR: \"The new Ben-Hur release is conducted by Nic Raine and features the City of Prague Orchestra and Chorus in a presentation that should become the standard for classic score reconstruction. It has been amazing to listen to the Prague Orchestra develop over the years from questionable, to serviceable, to solid, to exceptional. The sound quality of this recording is about as good as one could imagine. The sections that incorporate organ and full orchestra never find the keyboard overwhelming the sound picture, but it does come forward at the right moments. Piano lines can be discerned when necessary, adding accents, but always balanced within the ensemble. Given the modern recording techniques at play, the sheer craft of Rozsa\u2019s orchestrations resonates here perhaps even more so than on the OST.With this release, they have outdone themselves, cementing their place in film music history as one of the finest re-recording ensembles for the medium\". \u2014Steven A. Kennedy FILM SCORE MONTHLY In some 30 years of recording producer James Fitzpatrick has produced over 1000 CDs of Film Scores and New Recordings of Classic Film Music including new recordings of ZULU, THE LION IN WINTER, THE LAST VALLEY, ROBIN AND MARIAN, EL CID, THE LIFE AND TIMES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, EXODUS, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, VILLA RIDES!, TARAS BULBA, OBSESSION, QBVII, HOUR OF THE GUN, SALAMANDER, THE BLUE MAX, THE ALAMO, THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, DUEL IN THE SUN, CONAN THE BARBARIAN, CONAN THE DESTROYER, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD plus collections of the music of JOHN BARRY, MAURICE JARRE, JERRY GOLDSMITH, JOHN WILLIAMS, MAX STEINER, ALFRED NEWMAN and many more....\u00a0 These have largely been totally funded by Tadlow Music along with Prometheus Records and in the past Silva Screen Records. Now James Fitzpatrick is seeking additional funding directly from the people these recordings are aimed at...the soundtrack fans. And,unlike the abortive MOONRAKER Kickstarter campaign of a couple of years back, all rights have been cleared in advance. Not only are these recordings aimed at CD sales to lovers of great film music but with each release the previously \"lost\" original written scores have been reconstructed and preserved for our film music heritage of some of finest music ever composed for the Cinema which not only can be heard afresh on CD but also made available worldwide for the ever popular film music concerts. The cost of the recording this Double CD set will include restoration and reconstruction by Rozsa expert Leigh Phillips with the help of the original scores from sketches by Rozsa's orchestrator Eugene Zador of the complete film score, 10 recording sessions with the full 96 members of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra Conducted by Nic Raine (himself one of Rozsa's orchestrators for his later films) and 2 or 3 sessions with the 80 voice City of Prague Philharmonic Choir Conducted by Miriam Nemcova ... plus editing, mixing and mastering in Cambridge by Gareth Williams. The total costs for all of these will be in the region of \u00a380,000.... Tadlow Music are looking for part funding of this project with the balance coming from the \"deep\" pockets of James Fitzpatrick!",

  "\u00a0A DEMON CALLED GRACE - pilot episode Imagine a world wherein there are deities, angels, demons (or daemons), watchers who oversee the world, without interfering in the destiny of man, live among men unseen in plain site. Some working to disturb the balances that are in place, and others fighting to make sure they remain. With their own goals and ambitions, their own hopes and aspirations. This is the world where a Demon called GRACE lives. It is a complex world of checks and balances where life is like an intricate dance where one false step can be disastrous. I have the team and the equipment, I have an incredibly talented cast, I do need help though to make this happen. Renting locations, logistical challenges, and some say the most important, feeding the cast and crew, ( you do not want people being \"hangry\"). As someone who loves the classic fantasy genre and becoming enamored with the film series The Prophecy and the action of Supernatural combined with the suave and sophistication of Lucifer, the humor of Good Omens, I need to contribute to this movement. A Demon Called Grace has strong female leads and interesting characters throughout. With hedonistic demons, compassionate humans, and valiant deities. Each character being very individual one from the next. Your support will help bring this to life.",

  "I'LL BE DAMNED is a\u00a0visually spectacular, Hitchcockian,\u00a0supernatural noir\u00a0set in the\u00a0afterlife about a deceased private eye\u00a0who saves lost souls stuck in a nightmarish limbo.\u00a0\u00a0 The detective must\u00a0embark\u00a0on an unsanctioned mission; \u00a0to rescue\u00a0his\u00a0newly-departed and embittered\u00a0old flame from her current beau; a demonic gangster with designs on her soul. There's suspense, action, romance, scares, laughs, heartbreak,\u00a0twists, detectives,\u00a0dames,\u00a0gangsters, femme fatales, angels, demons\u00a0and even a samurai - All of which are filtered\u00a0through the eyes of someone who died in the\u00a01930s. \"I'll Be Damned\"will be a thrilling\u00a0experience that should play to\u00a0both\u00a0art house\u00a0and genre lovers alike. \u00a0It has scope in places and intimacy in others, which will\u00a0offer a universal experience for all.\u00a0 A spectacular\u00a0vision that will allow us to explore\u00a0themes that are unique to\u00a0this concept. \u00a0A fusion of the supernatural and the surreal, that never forget's the most important aspect\u00a0of storytelling-- Character What will keep all the spectacle from\u00a0going off the rails\u00a0is a very grounded, human\u00a0story about a haunted and\u00a0emotionally-repressed man who must confront his past, while\u00a0journeying into\u00a0the heart of darkness\u00a0to save his\u00a0lost love, who may or may not\u00a0want saving.\u00a0 \"I'll Be Damned\"has been buzzing around in\u00a0my head\u00a0since high school,\u00a0in one form or another and\u00a0over the last few years\u00a0came together in a real and powerful way. \u00a0In fact, when I was 16, I made my\u00a0first\u00a0short film\u00a0was a black & white detective movie.\u00a0 I've loved noir ever since. \u00a0So much so, that I spent what I had (5K)\u00a0to film a\u00a0very ambitious 4 min\u00a0opening scene. \u00a0We already have 5% of the movie in the can (or\u00a0hard drive). \u00a0We've also managed to raise some more, but we need you for the rest!

We're asking for 49k. \u00a0That might not seem like enough, but combined with the funds we've already secured, we'll be able to make this film a reality. \u00a0 We'll also be bringing camera, gear, a multi-talented\u00a0cast & crew to jaw-dropping locations we've catalogued over 20 plus years of prior development, which will significantly cut back on total costs for completion.

  "My name is Jon Higdon and i am making a YouTube series called bloodbound. Its about supernatural beings living in the modern world.

  "The Vision:\nSell ethically, and when possible, locally sourced coffee, tea, and food to keep the lights on. Provide a meeting space for anyone who needs it, from block watches to planning neighborhood holiday events, from political activists to board game enthusiasts.\nUse the sound stage to host all ages shows that are truly welcoming to all. Most venues rely on alcohol sales for profit, and in doing so become inherently unwelcoming spaces for people who can\u2019t or don\u2019t drink. The Story: For years, it's been our dream to open a community gathering place where people can meet, share ideas and work together to make the South Side the best it can be.\n\tWhen we asked our friends Colleen Dempsey and Danny Lemmon to join the cause, they immediately had ideas about how they would use the space to create the community they wanted.\u00a0 Colleen, a social worker who lives and works on the South Side dreamed of support groups, having often thought \u201cI wish there was an AA for people who aren't alcoholics. A place to check in, to listen and be listened to.\u201d Danny's head went straight to music, \u201cI came into music in a scene built by people who were under 21. We couldnt play at bars and clubs so we played  in churches, and our parents' basements. To have a permanent space for shows that did not rely on alcohol sales to stay open would be fantastic.\u201d\u00a0 So that's Community Grounds, a place to gather, and host the kinds of events we dream of, but more importantly the kind of events YOU dream of. There's a reason the place is called Community Grounds, and a reason the website is mycommunitygrounds.com. Tell us what you want to do here, we can do more together than any of us could alone.\u00a0 The Coffee and Food: As much as possible, our food will be grown within our community gardens. There are currently three pocket gardens (with more soon to come) where the vegetables for several events, including Tara and Joel's wedding, were grown. With your help we'll create a green space on the roof of the building for growing even more vegetables and herbs. We believe we have more green thumbs per capita than most of the city! \nSeveral local coffee houses have offered to provide us with the training needed to ensure our success. From making the best pour over coffee in the neighborhood to working an espresso machine that costs as much as some of our cars, our fellow coffee aficionados will help us guarantee that every drop of coffee served is among the best. We will be working with local Ohio suppliers who use fair trade practices to provide the community with honestly sourced coffee and organic teas. We'll also be working with local restaurants and chefs to provide our neighbors with a variety of options including vegetarian and vegan choices; at Community Grounds, someone looking for a non-dairy milk product won't have to pay extra. The Meeting House: \nWhen you see \u201cCoffee and Meeting House,\u201d meeting house could mean lots of different things to different people, and we hope it will. We want to create a space that enables people to host the things they want and need. Want to put on a play? We'll have a stage.\u00a0 Want to put on a concert? We'll have a sound system.\u00a0 Want to screen a film? We'll have a projector.\u00a0 Want to put on an educational workshop? YES!\u00a0 Cooking class? Oh Yeah!\u00a0 Activist organizing meeting? Please!\u00a0 Board game night? Gimme more!\u00a0 Another idea we haven't thought of? Our minds are ready to be blown.\u00a0 The\nBuilding: The\nKickstarter funds raised will be used to finalize the purchase and renovate a building\nthat's been without life for nearly two decades. Known to residents as the old sweeper store; it was built in 1925 on the corner of Cline St. & Parsons\nAvenue. It was the time of \"Glass and Steel\" for the South Side of Columbus. At a time when businesses thrived and all the buildings breathed life. The building served as the community library until\nthe mid-1960s and then as the base for the Central Sweeper Exchange vacuum repair\nshop until the early 1990s. We are working hard to find more historical\ninformation about the building and have been blessed with some memories from\nour senior residents. Because\nof its age, the building is in need of some upkeep; plumbing and electrical upgrades\nin particular will require the most attention. Renovation is expected to\ntake 4-6 months, weather permitting. We are fortunate to be working with the Parsons\nAvenue Redevelopment Corporation and a local contractor who will ensure that\nrepairs are done at low cost and high quality. They are among many who have\nfaith in our vision and believe that\u00a0Community Grounds: Coffee & Meeting House will provide this beautiful building life and memories once again. With 2400 sq feet to work with, we have a lot in mind. The front of the building will house the cafe and performance stage. While the back area will be used for the kitchen and an office that will have it's own storefront. We'll also be renovating the two apartments upstairs which have not been lived in since the mid-1970s.\u00a0 The Neighborhood: The most important aspect will be our involvement in the area. Community Grounds will be located within the borders of the Ganthers Place Civic Association. A strong and active community that has been a shining example for the South Side of Columbus. This close-knit community will be working together to help us succeed through the combined efforts of talented and skilled residents. We are proud to live with a diverse group that consists of business owners, legal counselors, social workers, musicians, artists, community activists & leaders, landscapers, woodworkers, and pretty much any skill you can imagine.\u00a0 You will become an honorary member of the community by backing this project. We hope that, regardless of where in the world you live, you'll know that you have a second home in Ganthers Place, Columbus, OH. Mo' Money, Mo' Problems (or so we hear): Most banks would not invest to create a space like this in a neighborhood like ours. Crowd funding through Kickstarter takes the decision making power away from entities only concerned with profit, and gives it to the people who will actually be affected. We want to build something to be proud of, and like most good things in life, we can't do it alone. Your support is incredibly important to us, and this is a breakdown of what your backing goes towards. After Kickstarter fees & rewards, we'll have about 85% of our funding remaining. The majority will be used to finalize the purchase of the building. The rest will be used to repair the plumbing, electrical and heating. This will allow us to begin the process of re-designing the space into the vision you see above. We'll be working with local, community and small business focused architects who have offered to provide services at low costs. As you may know, Kickstarter runs an All or Nothing campaign. This means that if we do not meet our goal by the deadline, we receive nothing. This is why we need your support to make the dreams of our South Side residents a reality. We are committed to making every dollar you provide stretch as much as possible.\u00a0 Only YOU can help make this a success. We hope that you will stop by and have a drink once we're up and running. We'll be here to welcome you to your second home. Media Coverage: Our efforts have not gone unnoticed in Columbus. We've received some great media coverage which has brought excitement to the South Side: Columbus Underground WBNS 10-TV\u00a0 WSYX ABC 6 & WTTE FOX 28 Simple Marketing The Metropreneur Our Founder Joel, has even received some extra time in the spotlight after being awarded the National Retail Federation's Dream BIG Scholarship: NRF Scholarship Class of 2014 Even Congresswoman Joyce Beatty gave him a shout out on her\u00a0Twitter\u00a0&\u00a0Facebook\u00a0pages! We are excited for future coverage in order to help us gain more backers. But, don't forget that YOU have the power to share, like, favorite & re-tweet us to your friends and family. YOU are the reason why we will succeed. Special Thanks: We wanted to take a moment to thank the many people who came out to our launch party in body and spirit. You are all an example of the vision we all have for Community Grounds: Coffee & Meeting House. Thanks for the wonderful music: Grapefruit Moon,\u00a0Playing to Vapors\u00a0& Discount Tents. We hope to see you all again for our Kickstarter success party!",
  "This feature length film, A Tale of Knights and Vampires, has a dynamite script prepared. It is a tale of vengeance, redemption, and the sacrifices one must make for the greater good. Fantasy films with strong female leads are all the rage in Hollywood right now and this story is locked and loaded for big screen success.\u00a0 We are anticipating a box office gross of $200 million+, and to tell this story the way it deserves to be told requires a budget of $65 million. We are also seeking partners who are as passionate as we are about the fantasy genre, and we want to bring that passion to millions of viewers.\u00a0 The Story Prince Radu and Princess Claudia harbor a forbidden love for each other. \u00a0Their kingdoms have been in bitter conflict for centuries. Princess Claudia sneaks out one night for a rendezvous but her father is suspicious, prompting him to send out a search party.\u00a0 The lovers are caught in their romantic escapades in a clearing by the edge of a sparkling lake. Prince Radu is viciously beaten to within an inch of his life.\u00a0 Radu is stripped, flogged and is sent home barely alive. His father, King Michael of Raagon swears vengeance. This leads to a massive conflict between the kingdoms that unleashes ancient evils and threatens to consume everyone involved.\u00a0",

  "I am raising funds to help \"Kickstart\" my new painting series,\u00a0 entitiled \"Be My Muse,\" and also to help raise funds for my new art studio. More about my project... I am getting recognized for my art more and more often and have been in many galleries and published for both my art and my writing. Just being in Chicago for a few months I finished a commission and am in a figurative show at an established gallery, The Oak Park League. I am now in the Boston area to be closer to galleries and art clientele in the area and of course, New York. My next move is to have my own exhibition. For this\u00a0I need a theme and a series of paintings, supplies, and my new studio. Therefore, I created this \"Kickstarter.\"  In Greek Mythology the 9 muses were the protectors and inspirations for the many different arts. I've been thinking of doing a project like this for sometime and finally settled on the \"Muse\" idea due to the fact many muses have helped me create and succeed as a fine artist. \"Be My Muse\" exhibit will be the 9 muses named after the top 9 patrons for this fundraiser. They will all be female nudes of different sizes, color, and body types. Each painting will be 36x48 in size and all Oil on Canvas.  To see an example of my work and what your \"original of You\" and the paintings will be like you can reference the video above, the images attached or view my website: www.artofkristi.com \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "This project is to finance the Rubber Brush from the ground up. i.e. Making the molds, producing enough product to show retail stores nation wide, to put myself in an apartment in order to get online line and promote the Rubber Brush, to obtain a patent which means I'll need a patent lawyer, to set up an LLC.\u00a0 Once these things are accomplished, we will be able to change how a painter or a homeowner goes about producing a high end finish without having to tape and plastic everything in order to spray. Home projects, tables, chairs, coffee tables, will be done in a few minutes with no brush strokes. Doors and panels can be painted without spraying and achieve the same perfectly smooth finish.\u00a0 It's also an incredible bucket-mucker. It bends perfectly to get all the paint out of a bucket and just needs a quick towel swipe instead of a hosing that nobody likes to do. It's amazing that the Rubber Brush wasn't invented 50 years ago!",

  "My challenge \"Make 100\" is the start of a much larger project to paint a painting a day for the entirety of 2017. 365 unique paintings in one year !!! Can you imagine that accomplishment ! I'm a British artist based in Texas specializing in abstracts in acrylic and alcohol inks. Alcohol inks are a great medium to work with because you can achieve so many effects and the colors are always beautifully vibrant. Each painting is guaranteed to be unique because of the way the inks work against each other. Just adding a few drops of isopropyl alcohol enhances the paintings even further.\u00a0 These beautiful paintings are guaranteed to delight - they are painted on Yupo paper which is an amazing substrate. It's non porous and allows me to move the inks around the paper and create wonderfully different landscapes. Although the challenge here is 100 paintings I'm actually working towards a painting a day for the entire year (as well as all my larger paintings). 2017 is going to be a fun challenge. Any kickstarter donations above my original goal are guaranteed to get a painting too.\u00a0 Make my year long challenge possible by supporting my Kickstarter for the first 100 days !!! \u00a0\u00a0",

  "Started by Cheno Barajas, a fitness leader in The Gorge community, IBLV (I Believe) is a fitness apparel brand whose mission is to bring fitness to the underserved members of our communities and to inspire and empower individuals, through fitness. With Kickstarter, Cheno hopes to open his first IBLV Retail Store.\u00a0 IBLV is not just a fitness apparel brand, it's an idea that, if embraced, can help change someones life. When Cheno started IBLV, he wanted to create an apparel brand that was durable and attractive, but more importantly Cheno wanted to address two main issues; the lack of self confidence people experience in their fitness journey and the lack of resources undeserved members of his community experience within fitness. Through IBLV, Cheno hopes to help empower individuals to live their life fully and courageously and help the underserved members of our communities have access to fitness. \u00a0 The Gorge is known for its outdoor sports and most retail stores in the area tailor to the outdoor enthusiast. There isn't an activewear retail store in The Gorge that tailors to general fitness enthusiast. \u00a0IBLV will help fill the gap and provide the fitness community with a wider variety of fitness apparel. Furthermore, IBLV will provide an environment where individuals can develop\u00a0confidence and provide the social support to accompany them on their fitness journey and elevate them in their path to self-discovery. IBLV will donate 10% of the yearly profits to a charity to support underprivileged and underserved members of our communities, giving them access to fitness when they otherwise would not would not have access. IBLV will work to \u00a0acquire outdoor recreational equipment and gear that community members can rent free of cost. Cheno is the Founder of IBLV.\u00a0A White Salmon native, Cheno grew up in a community that was financially limited. His family is from the small town of Madrid, Colima, Mexico. Madrid faces high levels of poverty and violence, which Cheno constantly had to battle with in his childhood years.\u00a0 Cheno has always been an active person. He was considered one of the top soccer athletes in The Gorge, and with the support of his family and mentors, he was able to secure an academic scholarship to Seattle University, where he walked on to their Division I Soccer program. After obtaining his degree in Business Management and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Cheno found himself lost. For three years, he aimlessly tried to fill the void within by indulging in unhealthy habits. He began drinking heavily and experimenting with heavy drugs. On his 24th birthday, after waking up not remembering what had happened the night before, Cheno had to make a decision, either he stayed on the path he was on which would lead to a very dark place, or he made an effort to change in hopes of reaching his true potential. \u00a0Even though he knew he wanted to change, he did not know where to begin. So he decided to change the one thing he could control, his body\u2026.and that\u2019s when his fitness journey began. Cheno always lacked self-confidence. The reason why he was never truly successful in one area of his life had little to do with his abilities, but more with his lack of self-belief. \u00a0He began noticing this same lack of self-worth preventing many of his peers from reaching their true potential. \u00a0He noticed that there was a need to be inspired. In hopes of inspiring his community and helping them find purpose and fulfillment in their lives, Cheno created IBLV. It is more than an apparel brand; IBLV - I Believe - is a mentality. Through IBLV, Cheno wants to address the inequalities in his community and give those who come from a background similar to his the opportunity to express themselves and become the capable and impactful person they are meant to be. Community and family are at the core of IBLV. There is potential for IBLV to make great changes happen within communities. For this to become a reality, IBLV needs the support of the community to get off the ground. We hope that with Kickstarter, our community will give IBLV an opportunity to show the world what it is truly capable of. Cheno has worked with The Power Station Gym and has agreed on building out an IBLV retail space. All the money will go towards renovating the space, purchasing Inventory, and marketing. Cheno will work with local contractors to get the retail space established, and with a marketing director to help increase the IBLV reach. Through the years, IBLV has been able to establish itself because of the support from YOU! \u00a0We are truly blessed and grateful for the constant love and support we receive from you. We hope you continue to support us throughout this transition.",
  "Brahms' works are among the most beloved in the classical music canon. Every so often, though, we hear the complaint that his music is too serious, too heavy - even stodgy.\u00a0We think that this is a misperception, and that there's no better antidote than to listen to recordings by some of the musicians he trusted most.\u00a0 As we delved further into the (surprisingly intricate) world of early recordings, we found that some of the most inspiring and informative performances came from Brahms' younger female colleagues. At the turn of the century, it was still common for female musicians to withdraw from public concerts after marriage, while still continuing to play (and even perform) in private. As a result, there is a small but astonishing set of recordings from as late as the 1950s that preserves a style of playing untouched by the revolutions of the early 20th century. And what a style it is! We've included some examples in the reward tiers so that you can hear it for yourself. To us, the musicians in Brahms' circle sound powerfully creative and eloquent, as though they're native speakers of his musical language and are simply thinking out loud. We've spent the last several years working to absorb this style, which turned out to involve breaking a lot of the \"rules\" (spoken and unspoken) that we were taught as music students: how to shift, how to prepare a chord, how to play \"together\", and above all, how to keep a tempo.\u00a0 Fortunately, we're not alone on this journey of rediscovery. A new historically informed edition of the Brahms cello sonatas, which Kate co-edited with Clive Brown and Neal Peres da Costa, brings together all different kinds of information relating to Brahms' own aesthetic: recordings, memoirs, treatises, early editions, and more. There has been a huge amount of interest in the edition already, which makes us think that the time has come to put the old artistic freedoms back into circulation. We recorded our disc in March, with the help of a hugely inspiring and supportive team. Yi-heng played on a copy of an 1870 Streicher similar to Brahms' own, generously loaned to us by Peter Sykes and painstakingly maintained throughout the week by Dale Munschy (it turns out that Streichers are finicky beasts).\u00a0 Our engineer, Angus Lansing, plays historical instruments himself and knew just how to capture the warmth of the cello's gut strings and the soft iridescence of the Streicher. Sarah Darling, our highly gifted producer, is also a musical soulmate who knows how to draw the best music making out of us, and always managed to say exactly the right thing at the right time. We even allowed ourselves the luxury of using a second producer as a stylistic guardian: it was Andrus Madsen's job to make sure we didn't revert to modern playing styles in the frenzy of perfectionism that often overtakes recording sessions, and his enthusiasm for the risks we were taking gave us a lot of confidence. We'd like to invite you to join our project now as we enter the process of turning the music into a disc. Here's a breakdown of the total cost:\u00a0 \u2022 $3,000 Recording and producing \u2022 $2,000 Piano moving, tuning, and maintenance\u00a0 \u2022 $4,000 Editing and mastering\u00a0 \u2022 $3,000 Artwork, design, and replication of 1000 discs",
  "Overture Hello Everybody...and Happily Ever After?!!Information you should know before you read through this project description.1- Clips and sound bytes are from a high school student film based on the Fairy Tale version (not the modern day version) of the \"Happily Ever After?\" screenplay. \u00a0Imagine how they will look and sound when performed by Hollywood professionals!!2- Also note that even though the Rewards are worded in Old English, there is not one whit of Old English in the screenplay. The Old English is just for the fun and benefit of the backers.3- It has been brought to my attention that there are at least 3 other movies out there named Happily Ever After...but none of them end in a question mark. Of course, Happily Ever After? is a working title, but if it gets to be too confusing, I'm sure the studio(s) who pick up the movie will come up, perhaps, with a name that they like better.

Also, the FEMALE LEAD's name, Madison, is pretty much set in stone. I actually do NOT want to change her name. The name Madison has a special meaning to me, so I offer this reward with MUCH hesitation!HOWEVER, IF you are the second $5000 backer, you will get to change Madison's name to whatever you want...much to my chagrin AND yet, much to my gratitude! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * An Invitation to the Screening of the Movie when it is released (if you are in the movie screening area at the time) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *ACT IIScene 3 Here is bit of the script which includes lyrics to the Title Song \"Happily Ever After?\" INT.

  "LOVECHILD Cake Co.\u00a0 started from humble beginnings.\u00a0 Previously LOVECHILD Cakes + Confections started from a hobby - rooted in tradition.\u00a0 Growing up, I watched my mom and my grandmas on both sides bake countless delicious treats from scratch.\u00a0 Box mixes were never an option. \u00a0So when I had kids of my own, it was important to me that I keep that scratch-made tradition alive.\u00a0 I\u2019d been making the girl\u2019s birthday cakes for several years but they were a simple labor of love and far from professional. In 2020, when the world felt like it was ending, I was laid off from my job and forced to re-evaluate everything I was doing.\u00a0 By August 2020, I had decided \u2013 I was going to go for it and take a chance on turning my hobby into my career.\u00a0 And LOVECHILD cakes was born!\u00a0 I can\u2019t put into words how much the early support and encouragement I received meant to me.\u00a0 Business took off quickly and I hit the ground running. \u00a0I spent the better part of our quarantine days (2020-2021) creating cake art for clients all over the Grand Strand. And in that year and a half, I discovered what a true passion cake artistry was for me. Day in and day out, I devoted hours to learning new techniques and trends.\u00a0 I perfected my signature recipes, and stayed current on all of the up and coming cake trends.\u00a0 I even took a 3 week intensive course \u2013 taught by Christina Tosi of Milkbar New York! As the weeks and months went on, I would purchase new tools here and there when the project required it \u2013 usually cutting into any profit I had hopes of making.\u00a0 But that\u2019s par for the course in starting a business and over time I was able to collect several items that make the job easier and make the cakes stand out from the rest.\u00a0 However \u2013 the list is still long! September of last year, We sold our home \u2013 my OG baking headquarters - \u00a0and it\u2019s taken a few months to truly get settled somewhere new.\u00a0 But we are finally settled and I am READY to get back to work! I\u2019ll be opening up my Calendar for booking starting JUNE 11th! I am starting this fundraiser to help with the upfront costs of some premium supplies and business must-haves so that I can bring you breath taking, instagrammable cakes and a more streamlined booking process.\u00a0 It\u2019s all about the customer \u2013 and I want to be able to provide the best of the best product! Some things your gifts will help me add to the LOVECHILD kitchen are: Why am I crowdsourcing funds this way? The answer is simple: \u00a0Without start-up funding, the cost of these items would be reflected the price of your cake and we can\u2019t have that.\u00a0 The success of any solid business relies on having the right tools to get the job done right.\u00a0 Without them, I\u2019d be swimming upstream, working harder - not smarter, and that\u2019s just not sustainable. Who is this for? -Anyone who has been rooting for LOVECHILD cakes from afar.\u00a0 Anyone who can\u2019t support this small business by ordering my product, but would like to show support some other way.\u00a0 Friends and family in other states \u2013 that might be you! -Anyone who has experienced the magic of a LOVECHILD cake and wants to see us become a mainstay in the Grand Strand\u2019s cake community. -Anyone who believes in supporting local business. -Anyone with a little extra cash in their pocket \u2013 looking to do something good with it. -Anyone who wants some of the really cool rewards I\u2019m offering! Did you think I was going to take your $$ without throwing a little swag your way? With my relaunch, will come a bit of fancy re-branding too! And I\u2019ll be having buttery soft LOVECHILD t-shirts and fun LOVECHILD waterbottle (super durable) stickers made.\u00a0 Depending on your gift, you\u2019ll receive one of those items, a coupon towards your next cake order, or all of the above \u2013 just as a thank you from me \ud83d\ude0a",

Amanda is a Pastry Chef & Professional Chocolatier, and has over 7 years experience working in a commercial kitchen and owning a successful business. You maybe know Stef from her One Minute Planty Chats with Coffee on Instagram. She's a plant enthusiast to the core, and studies Horticulture at the University of Guelph. If you like talking about dirt or worms, she's 100% there for it. Stef has worked in retail and management environments for most of her career, and has spent the last 8 years building up an extensive indoor plant collection. \u00a0She plans to pursue her Master Gardener's accreditation so she can continue to educate our customers on how to care for their investments. Our brick & mortar location will be located at 675 Main Street East in Hamilton, Ontario. \u00a0Hamilton is located on the traditional territories of the Mississaugas and Haudenosaunee. This land is protected by the Dish with One Spoon wampum belt covenant. \u00a0We acknowledge our presence as settlers on this land, and will continue to work towards being stewards of this land, and good neighbours to local Indigenous communities.\u00a0 Our shop was home to the former Jet Diner, which closed after a fire in 2017. We are excited to breathe new life into this space, but it does require some serious TLC before we can open our doors to you.\u00a0 Meeting the need for a space for folks to gather, graze and grow, Pinch will combine a bakery, caf\u00e9 and plant store all in one. \u00a0Our shop will feature daily baked goods, a full service caf\u00e9 and espresso bar, and endless lush tropical plants for you to both take home, and enjoy while you're in the space. We will feature cozy nooks around the shop for comfortable seating in a luscious atmosphere, providing an escape on those days that you just need to look at something green.\u00a0 We plan to prioritize sustainability, accessibility and community in our design to include things such as a wheelchair-accessible entrance, gender neutral washroom access, a guaranteed nut-free kitchen, environmentally sustainable packaging options and community engagement with not-for-profits in our neighbourhood and city. Accessibility is our main focus, and we plan to use funds raised during this Kickstarter to transition two small bathrooms into one larger, accessible washroom, along with some other more minor changes to the shop. These renovations require permits with the City of Hamilton, demolition of walls, new fixtures and other smaller upgrades. By funding this Kickstarter, you can help us bring our vision to life.\u00a0 We've lined up some pretty great rewards for this Kickstarter, you can find some more details below! Most of our rewards are self explanatory, but we wanted to give you the breakdown on a few things you probably have questions about! Here's a sample of some of the seedlings included in our seedling pack, both the Bright Colours and Warm Neutrals. Keep in mind, these photos are 1) not ours and 2) just for vibes, because right now, AS WE SPEAK, these sweeties are popping their little heads out of the soil. All seedling packs will be a mix of \u00a0at least 8 different annual varieties, including favourites like cosmos, stock, asters, sunflowers, zinnias, strawflowers, black eyed susans, calendulas, dahlias, scabiosas, flowering tobacco, maybe some grasses - the point is, we're growing a LOT of flowers. But each pack will be assembled with design, ease and style in mind, so you know you're getting a mix of some gorgeous colour to fill your garden with! Please note, most seedlings are partial to full sun with well-draining soil. All are suitable for Hamilton's planting zone 6b, and will be available once they are hardened off and ready to be planted outdoors. All will come with planting instructions and lot of good faith. Seedlings will also be available for a later date for individual purchase, once we have made sure we are offering our backers the cream of the crop (hehe). Adding the consult too? Please note, we do not have every answer and might not be able to solve every problem, but we are committing to working it out with you, and being present for the follow up. We can grow together, ya know? Sometimes we just need a bud to hype us up, and we got you. Our Perfect Cookies, Custom Cakes & Treat of the Month Club feature bakery items made in a commercial, public health inspected kitchen. \u00a0Since Sweet & Simple Co. has been nut free for the last 4 years, we plan to keep that moving forward with Pinch.

  "Did you ever have one of those days? It was early October and the TV and internet were covered with reports that Hurricane Matthew had become a Category 4 and was most likely headed our way! \u00a0You spend your day removing possible projectiles from your yard, securing what you can, boarding up your shed, installing your hurricane shutters, and stocking up on three days of supplies, but you never know if it's enough for \"this\" storm. Then Matty comes for a visit ... Yeah ... Hurricane Matthew. \u00a0 Family members were evacuated last minute, everyone has taken refuge in my home. They bring their own supplies and everything seems fine. \u00a0The rain and sustained winds are no match for your level of preparedness.\u00a0 Suddenly the winds begin to gust, taking a section of your soffit, then another and another, the trim is flapping in the wind, and then it's gone. \u00a0Sounds like a piece of siding is pulling free on the other side of the house as you watch your neighbor's tree fall in a slow motion destroying their fence. Trees tops are slapping the sidewalk in the front yard, while the smaller trees in back are already laying down or just missing. \u00a0You hear someone in the house say \"Your gazebo just collapsed\", as you watch a couple of your hurricane shutters pull free from your home. \u00a0 The next few hours are scary for your guest, but truly terrifying for you, because you took these people in and now you fear for their safety as well as your own. Everyone watches as your fence is torn apart ... posts break like twigs, sections pull up into the air to smash down to the ground. \u00a0The fence sections that only lean get really scary as the slats break off and fly across your yard. \u00a0Some of the newly created debris takes flight with the next series of wind gusts and is soon dancing it's way across your roof (that damage makes itself known a little later as the water stains start appearing on your ceilings). What do you do now?\u00a0\u00a0What can you do until the storm is over? For a moment, the storm eases back, and as the rain stops the sun appears like nothing ever happened. \u00a0I looked through what still stood of my broken fence, I could see a newly formed lake in my neighbors backyard between the missing slats. \u00a0It grew dark again as the winds picked up speed, his lake appeared to have a current, then a tide, and finally it had waves. \u00a0My own dark ocean scene happening through the slats of my fence. This was my inspiration. \u00a0I will commemorate the death of my beloved fence (my means of separating my own tropical sanctuary from the outside world) by taking its remains and painting a beach scene, one vaguely similar to that which I saw Through the Fence. Broken slats are removed and here you see my first attempt. With more fence everywhere, I continued to paint away! \"Hurricane Matthew - The Through The Fence Series\"\u00a0is my attempt to bring light to the darkness of all the damage, to put a positive spin on what was, and still is, a costly situation. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hi!  I'm Mark Pari.  Just an average homeowner hit hard by Hurricane Matthew.  I'm the type of person who appreciates the beauty of my surroundings, tries to protect the environment, and makes a conscious effort to recycle, reuse, or repurpose where I can.\n\u00a0 This project is my way of creating some good from the bad resulting from Matthew.  So much debris was hauled out to the road to be picked up by local trash services who in turn redistribute into our landfills.  I know, there's not a lot that could be done with the damaged roofing and siding, but seeing those piles of broken fence gave me an idea.  \n\u00a0 My wife and I spent many years building ourselves a little tropical oasis here, safely protected by our fence.  It was devasting to watch the fence and much of what it protected destroyed in just one storm.\nI wanted to return some beauty to Florida, to show what this State has to offer, so I chose to paint Beach Scenes.\n\u00a0 All my work is varnished on all sides, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.\n\u00a0 I hope you enjoy my work.\n\u00a0 Thank you!  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "My name is Tihomir Petrov, an immigrant to the United States with a deep love of my adopted country. \u00a0I have started to paint five years ago when I first came to the United States, usually some of the most breathtaking places in the United States. \u00a0 Ever since, I have dreamed of organizing an exhibition, titled \"Beautiful America\", of my landscapes featuring picturesque landscapes from all around the United States -- Yellowstone National Park, Letchworth State Park, the Potomac Valley, as well as lesser known but equally beautiful landscapes from Colorado, Montana, and Alaska. \u00a0The exhibition will also feature local cityscapes such as the National Cathedral, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials.\u00a0 My goal is to raise $2,000 to cover (contribute towards) annual gallery membership fees in Washington DC so that I can exhibit some of my best paintings and eventually organize the \"Beautiful America\" exhibition. REWARD #1You will receive a set of 6 postcards with prints of some of my landscapes from some of America's most breathtaking places. \u00a0REWARD #2A calendar with some of the most beautiful places in the United States, chosen to best reflect each month of the year.\u00a0 REWARD #3An original 12\" X 12\" oil painting featuring a Still Life theme such as the one below: REWARD #4An 20\" X 16\" original oil painting featuring a landscape from Beautiful America. \u00a0",

  "Deviating from the normally taken path of life is not for the faint of heart. \u00a0Over the years, I have always worked to get better, learn some new form of art or style to apply to my arsenal, and to be able to provide that art to everyone. \u00a0And it is because of that support I have been able to get to this point in my creative career. \u00a0I've researched other mediums to expand my work to, as not every piece of art must be on a 2D piece of canvas. With that being said, this Kickstarter campaign will be the jumping off point to take RISE -Art and Design- from a self owned artist proprietorship, to a creative multi-medium provider.\u00a0 I hope with the success of this KickStarter, to be able to provide Original works as well as multiple sizes of prints at Art Fair venues (Arts, Beats, and Eats, ArtPrize, DIY Fest, etc). \u00a0Along with bringing my work from the studio to the open venue location, I am also working on multiple solo and group show submissions that these funds would assist with preparing for these shows.\u00a0 And finally, to further assist with achieving all these goals for 2017, I have been approached by representation to assist with finding creative opportunities. \u00a0This representation would eliminate my need to spend time doing this, and allow me the time and focus to bring the work of RISE to you.\u00a0",
  "Clockwork Corpse interweaves elements of both the steampunk and dystopian genres, with black comedy as its tone. It\u2019s intended for Young Adults because of the mature themes that I intend to explore. But it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, relying a lot on grim, dry humour and sarcastic, almost self-aware characters.\u00a0 Charity Steele, a determined and observant noblewoman and lead singer of the Royal Amphitheatre, is intended to be one of the main protagonists of the story, as she struggles to survive in the ensuing conflict. There are many questions- where did this violent undead army come from? Who started it? And why?\n\nI intend the book to be 80-100k words, with an ensemble cast and multiple PoV characters interwoven into the main conflict with the rotting army. Right now, Charity is the only protagonist set in stone, and I am still working out the specifics of the others; one possible addition to the main cast is a very psychotic/obsessive widow who is obsessed with reviving her late husband, who unbeknownst to her had a young secret lover.\u00a0 For those that chose the $60 perk (limit of 5 people) you can help me work out what kind of characters you want to see featured (either as a PoV, or in the supporting cast). You can be as specific as gender, name, occupation and backstory, etc., or you can just give me vague stimuli. I do already have an idea where the story will be heading, but I will rework the main plot so that these fan-created characters will be critical factors in the narrative.\u00a0 Anyway, the project proposal has turned out to be quite a bit longer than I intended, but I hope that it\u2019s ticked some dots for potential backers.\u00a0 Thanks for taking the chance on it and I look forward into bringing this story to life. There is a distinct lack of (original and exciting) steampunk literature in the modern day, and so I hope to fill that void with Clockwork Corpse. Thank you so much :) Here is my email for general enquiries, questions, friendship requests, fan-letters or anything of the like: fluorescentsloth@gmail.com\u00a0 \u00a0~Jae V.

  "Colin Currie Group's first gig was a performance of Steve Reich's Drumming, and ten years later it is still the foundation of our repertoire. Steve has been incredibly supportive of our performances of his music (he once said CCG play Drumming better than he does) and we'd like to repay his support by making the best possible recording of one of 20th Century's most important compositions. We have the team lined up. We have a venue. We've already raised enough money to cover all the administrative costs, so every penny we raise through Kickstarter can go towards recording music. We have some great rewards for our backers, including percussion lessons, signed scores and the chance to record Steve Reich's Clapping Music with Colin. We can't make this recording with half the players, a quarter of the microphones or a third of the venue, so we really need your help to hit our target. Thank you for your support - together we'll make a piece of music history. Colin and Steve talk about Drumming:",
  "I'm Nick Photinos, founding cellist of Eighth Blackbird, and I'm raising funds to finish my first solo recording: Petits Art\u00e9facts. The idea for this recording began to take shape soon after a concert at the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival, an annual festival of new chamber music held every year in North Adams, MA and run by Bang on a Can where I have taught for a number of years. In 2015, I premiered a work by bassist Florent Ghys, whose own recent and amazing\u00a0T\u00e9l\u00e9vision\u00a0inspired me to reach out to him. The piece he wrote for me: Petits Art\u00e9facts, for cello, electronics and video,\u00a0got me thinking about all the great yet small (sub 10-minutes) pieces I've performed over the years, most of which had never been recorded. These are works by some of the most acclaimed names in new music--David Lang, Andrew Norman, Bryce Dessner, David T. Little--but also a newer generation of groundbreaking composers like Ang\u00e9lica Negr\u00f3n, Florent Ghys, Molly Joyce, and Pascal Le Boeuf, who are quickly gaining notoriety for themselves. The music runs the gamut from quirky and hilarious to profound and ethereal, and is brought to life with the help of two of my favorite collaborators, pianist Vicki Ray\u00a0and percussionist Doug Perkins. Doug is also serving as Producer on this effort, with Todd Reynolds as co-producer. Here's the full recording lineup: To be clear about why I'm raising funds: I have already recorded the works for the album, which has prompted some to ask whether I am raising funds to reimburse myself, or even to pay myself. Far from it. As many of you know, there are considerable costs beyond studio time and editing, and include mixing, mastering, PR costs, photography, album art, and physical album production, to name a few. New Amsterdam has agreed to pick up the album, with a release scheduled for the Fall of 2017, but their involvement and amazing help, including PR, requires money. It is to help cover these costs that I am launching this campaign, and any money raised above the target amount will increase the amount given to individuals that have largely given their time pro-bono to this recording.\u00a0 This is an exciting, gripping album with music that deserves to be heard, and I'm deeply committed to bring it to life. Thank you for considering to be a part of its creation!",
  "I am raising money to do my first Midnight Piano Concert in Los Angeles. I plan on traveling from Sweden to Los Angeles, and I will be playing at a venue in Hollywood. My goal is to play for my Periscope fans, and people that shares the same passion for music as I do. And I love to share my unique piano songs with everyone who is interested\u00a0 to listen to it. I will be staying in LA for about 6 days, and the money raised will cover costs for flight tickets, hotel, venue, transport and costs connected with the concert. If I exceed my funding goal, I will be able to record the concert and make a unique cd that would be available to purchase as a unique memory from the concert.",
  "The story so far\u2026. In early 2013 I founded Resonance in order to make classical music accessible and fun for everyone.  Most people are amazed by how much they feel connected to the music which we present. \u00a0Equally, our drinks parties offer opportunities to \u2018meet the artists\u2019 as well as to network and make new friends.  \u00a0 Great classical music is often labelled as \u201celitist\u201d, and unfortunately ticket prices to top-notch arts events are often absurdly high. \u00a0It has always been my ambition to offer amazing music at an affordable price to all, and Resonance does exactly this, with concert tickets costing just $20 and $25.  Since March 2013, Resonance has successfully presented 83 individual concert performances, based on 41 creative and interesting programmes. At Resonance we also believe that great music and socialising go hand-in-hand. \u00a0We offer complimentary drinks parties after our concerts, and these bring about new friendships and networking opportunities. \u00a0 As the costs of all overheads continue to rise, it has been difficult to keep Resonance going strong and to keep our ticket prices where they stand, as the best-value concert tickets in Australia. \u00a0We also insist on remunerating our wonderful artists at the levels which their years of training and world-class standards deserve. We really hope that you can help us in continuing to enrich the Australian arts community. \u00a0Resonance is an organisation about music and friendship, and we welcome you to join us for both. The future\u2026.. Aside from supporting our regular series of concerts in Sydney and Melbourne, your pledge will also help us achieve two other important goals:  We are committed to providing professional performance opportunities for young people and music students. \u00a0Exciting projects in both Sydney and Melbourne in 2017 will see some of the most talented young musicians in Australia sharing their hard work with audiences. We want to reach out to Australian communities well beyond metropolitan areas. \u00a0Your pledge will assist us to begin some regional touring of Australia, bringing our amazing concerts to communities which lack arts opportunities. Our fundraising target\u2026.. Our target here represents approximately 50% of our annual costs. \u00a0With your help, we can partially fund some of our most basic and necessary costs such as: Professional, established artists Piano tuning fees Wine and soft drinks Marketing and insurance The rewards\u2026.. Should our campaign be successful, the greatest and most obvious reward is that we will continue to hold beautiful events and include the wider community. \u00a0Some of the reward tiers feature concert tickets and further interaction with Resonance, and we truly hope that you will take advantage of these and become our new partners. Finally\u2026.. Recent Australian governments have infamously slashed budgets for the arts, painting a rather grim future for this invaluable and most human of sectors. \u00a0Resonance is a musically-professional organisation with a community-driven heart, and offers a very honest approach to beautiful cultural and social events. \u00a0Please help us to keep this wonderful series alive. \u00a0",

  "\u00a0A fine art painting project to explore and expand on my current painting journey, to create a new body of work, and exhibit these at both the Python Gallery in Middlesbrough and The Brick Lane Gallery in London.\u00a0 This funding will allow me to create visionary new paintings, which will explore and challenge the paradigm of the feminine, through my own perspective and story, examining hopes, fears and fantasies. These pieces will push the concepts of portraiture and figurative painting formalities, through the experimentation of painting materials, structure and technique. (Art). \u00a0 \n\nOpening up my own past and exploring what is means to be female, the concepts of beauty which are projected upon us by the media, but deeper than this. I will finally allow myself to examine the coercive control I was unwittingly subject to, a subject which has orbited my art but I have never felt strong enough to explore.\u00a0 Having this this project funding will give me the freedom to create authentic work, be be free to try new mediums, new technique, new surfaces and will allow happy accidents to happen, to really explore the subject of my story, I story which will resonate with people who view my work. Art is after all and expression of emotion, of feeling, and this project will allow me to take a further step in my artistic career.\u00a0\nHowever without it I won't be able to really push and experiment with the work, I will feel more restrained and need to be precious about each piece I make.\u00a0 \u00a0The exhibition will open in January 2017, at The Python Gallery - giving me 3 months to create the work for this.\u00a0Part of this exhibition will then be exhibited in London at The Brick Lane gallery.\u00a0\u00a0 Being invited to exhibit in a London Gallery is a hugely exciting achievement for me, and this could open up so many doors and really give me the break I need to get my work seen by other galleries and collectors. Unfortunately if the Kickstarter project isn\u2019t successful I wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve this at this time.\u00a0 To create enough new paintings to exhibit at Python, and Brick Lane I need to produce around 25 pieces.\nI will then organise the exhibition, promote it really well and provide an epic preview evening for friends, family and collectors - and you of course are more than welcome! Watch this space.\u00a0 This is a two venue exhibition as the work will then be taken and shown at the Brick Lane Gallery in London - the date of this is to be confirmed as the project unfolds.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 I am a full time studio based fine artist, my work explores beauty, femininity, love, passion and a sense of self. The inspiration comes from memories, life experiences and dreams. I have a distinctive style, my work has been said to be instantly recognisable, even when exploring new techniques and materials. I tend to use an idiosyncratic colour pallet of blues, turquoises and violet hues, mixed with monochrome styles. I aim to create exciting unconventional pieces which are authentic and resonate with the viewer.\u00a0 When you buy an original painting, or other piece of art you are making an investment - this is the same with crowdfunding support.\n\nYou become an investor and patron of the arts, buying, supporting or commissioning, you are investing in the artists career making it more likely that said artist will prosper, be seen by more people, make more work, secure more meaningful exhibitions, ultimately increasing the value of your own investment. And, as all that is happening every day you are enjoying looking at and living with the most unique purchase you will ever make - unless you get the collecting bug. \u00a0I want people to feel like they are a part of the work,\u00a0like I have got inside their head and painted their thoughts,\u00a0their lives,\u00a0their inner fantasies,\u00a0their fears. \u00a0\u00a0 I want to bring them hope through resonating with their own emotions.\u00a0 So far a lot of men have resonated with my paintings, I\u2019m not sure why, maybe the woman are scared of their own inner self, maybe they are really\u00a0suppressing\u00a0what is going on inside?\u00a0 I need my work to\u00a0be an expression of me, of my energy, my femininity, my emotion, my pain, my journey, and therefore a reflection of other womens, who have stepped along even a small part of the same path I have walked.

  "The first book in this series, 'KNACK' (which is featured in image below),  was totally funded by my last Kickstarter project. That book is now published and on sale! This is book two. Think Odd Thomas as written by John Green. A dark urban fantasy that explores choices and relationships when you aren't truly a part of the normal world. \"SLEIGHT\" is the second novel in my series about Benjamin Brown.  Benjamin is part of a secret society of supernaturals who have existed for over four hundred years. He's a newbie and trying to navigate the difficulties of being who and what he is. He's trying to live off the grid but circumstances are making that impossible. Having saved his high school from a terrorist attack Benjamin suffered some close personal losses and his life has been turned upside down. His mentor is close to death, his best friend has moved away and his maybe-girlfriend has just returned after having been missing for a month. Does she want to pick up where they left off or does she have something more sinister in mind? Because she doesn't look or act like the same girl.  At\u00a0 all. Here's an excerpt, but f you haven't read 'KNACK' be aware that there are many spoilers. Enjoy: CHAPTER 1 Have you ever stood before a door and been faced with the proverbial \u201clady or the tiger\u201d moment? There are rare occasions when it might actually be both. On a morning where I\u2019d just needed to grab a change of clothes that\u2019s what I was trying to figure out. I pressed my hand against the door of my apartment, like you would to see if it was hot during a fire, except that it wasn\u2019t a fire on the other side of the door that I was worried about. It was the person standing in front of my apartment door that was weirding me out. She was someone familiar, but currently less so, which was scary as hell. \nEvents over the past several weeks had caused my life to tilt sideways. Not that my typical week or month was normal anyway. Having recently saved most of the student population in my high school from a slaughter you\u2019d think that I would be a celebrated hero and that my biggest challenge would be fending off all of the people lining up to thank me.  No, and no, and definitely not today, and really not now.  Because of the way I lived, I needed privacy. So, no hero parades for me, thank you.  My best friend in the world moved away two weeks ago, and my mentor, the closest thing that I have to family in Seattle, had been taken away from me too. A good friend that I had trusted with some of my most precious secrets had turned into a psychopath, or had always been one and I\u2019d been too stupid to notice. Oh, and that former friend? He had promised to hurt people close to me if I ratted him out for the role he had played in the aforementioned attempted mass murder. Add to all of that, a man I hadn\u2019t known a month ago, and now knowing him I wish I still didn\u2019t, currently has tremendous influence over my life and directs virtually all of my activity during my waking hours unless I avoid him.  So, now this.  \u201cBenny, I know you\u2019re in there. Open the door.\u201d came the voice again.  When I\u2019d come back to my apartment to pick up some clothes I hadn\u2019t been prepared for the wave of emotions that had washed over me. Memories had rushed in unbidden and I\u2019d immediately regretted coming back. I had also been totally unprepared for the visitor calling to me from the hallway. I let my forehead rest against the door and closed my eyes tightly, hoping that she would just go away. She\u2019d been missing for almost a month and we had all resigned ourselves to the fact that she probably wasn\u2019t ever going to be found. But there she was, standing at my door asking to be let in, and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to open the door. Justine.  Why was I reluctant to open the door? I mean, I\u2019d kissed this girl twice, taken her to a dance, had lunch with her dozens of times and\u2026had started to think, feel, that maybe our casual flirting and on again off again friendship was something more, a lot more. Then why hadn\u2019t I flung the door open and thrown my arms around her?  Because the girl standing in the hallway that I could see through the peephole didn\u2019t look like the friend I thought I had lost.  She looked\u2026wrong. And she\u2019d shown up here unannounced, unexpected and\u2026what? Unwanted? I couldn\u2019t get a handle on my feelings. All I knew for sure was that her showing up out of the blue was creeping me out and the way she looked wasn\u2019t helping to calm my nerves.  Justine Winter had been an academic All-American. The prototypical sweet-girl-next-door. She had worn her blond hair long, usually with a simple ribbon holding it back from her face. She had worn long, modest dresses or jeans, little makeup and a shy smile that flickered around her lips and eyes. I mean seriously, she was like right out of a Disney movie.  The young woman I could see through the fish-eye lens was obviously Justine, but not the way she had always looked as long as I had known her. This version didn\u2019t have the pink-cheeked healthy glow I remembered. This version was pale and edgy. Her hair had been cut so short that if her features hadn\u2019t been so feminine it would have been possible at first glance to mistake her for a boy, and it wasn\u2019t blond anymore. It was white. Her clothes were tight-fitting and revealing in a way that shouted \u2018look at me\u2019. Hip-hugger jeans that looked like they had been spray painted on and a low cut dark shirt that revealed a lot of skin, and a lot of curves. Something the old Justine would have never considered wearing.\nThe left side of her face was oddly shiny. The skin stretched tight and devoid of any blemishes or wrinkles, like it had been scrubbed with a stiff brush to the point of removing a layer of skin. The other side of her face was covered in makeup and blush.  As I watched her, she raised a hand to her lips and brushed the tips of her fingers across them. Her nails were lacquered with a dark red polish that matched the lipstick she wore. Both stood out in harsh contrast to her chalky skin.\nBut the most disturbing thing about her appearance was her eyes. They had always been a golden brown. Unremarkable, but soft and wide and happy. The pair of eyes trying to peer through the lens were wary, hooded and a startling shade of purple. They seemed to glow in the dimly lit hallway. And that, more than anything else, is why I didn\u2019t want to open the door.  Those eyes and their lavender color were too similar to a pair owned by someone who had tried to kill me.  Twice.  \u201cI heard that you\u2019re a hero. Pretty scary. Don\u2019t you want to talk about it?\u201d  \nShe paused, waiting for an answer I wasn\u2019t going to give her. \n\u201cI can wait out here all day. I\u2019ve gotten real good at waiting. I thought you might be happy to see me, but maybe I was wrong.\u201d She said.  \nI held my breath.  \u201cYou can\u2019t avoid me forever, Benny. I\u2019ll catch up to you eventually.\u201d She paused, looked down and then her head snapped up, her eyes slitted so that the purple color was hard to see.  \u201cWe have things to talk about.\u201d  She moved away from the viewable range of the peephole so quickly that it was almost as though she\u2019d disappeared. Pressing my ear to the door I strained to hear her footsteps on the stairs. The only sound I could pick up was the quiet ticking of my refrigerator in the kitchen behind me.\nTurning, with my back to the door, I leaned against it and slowly slid down to a sitting position. Resting my head on my knees I let out a long shuddering breath.  In the back of my mind I heard a whisper from the past\u2026\n\u2018People change Benny, not always in the way we would hope\u2019 ",

  "Hello, my name is J.A. Moscat. The purpose of this campaign is to help publish my first novel as an Indie author. Establishing myself as an indie author is important. Writing is a part of me and without it I would be missing a piece of my soul.  I\u2019ve been writing fantasy since I was a boy. Kings and Queens is a story that has been in the works for almost ten years. Reason being, I had the characters I wanted to write, but lacked the desirable situations. Now I\u2019ve committed to this version of the story and I know fans of the Paranormal Urban Fantasy genre will love it too.\u00a0 All his life Nate Torres wanted to be the hero of his story. By playing the Virtual Reality Game, Legion Wars, with his cousin Elis, he could do just that. It would be a lie to say he was a boy scout. The Virtual world was his escape from the real one because in game Nate could slay the monsters that caused him torment and sorrow.  The real world was cruel and dark, unlike in game Nate didn\u2019t have to power to fight off the Demons that lurked in his soul. With battles being fought at home and school Nate could only understand the meaning of peace when he\u2019s with his two closest friends in the world, Kyle and Melody. But those feelings become complicated when Melody is the object of his affection.  Their relationship starts to go down hill once Nate sees that Melody is happier with the school\u2019s linebacker than him. Fueled with anger and a broken heart, Nate runs from his problems only to get cornered by the school\u2019s bully. After surviving his near death experience, thanks to his new best friend Antonio, who happens to be a blood sucking day-walker, also known as an Upir, Nate finds himself in a library that appeared to be located at the center of the universe. There he discovers that the world he once knew was a lie and that monsters truly exist and the only thing that stands between order and chaos is magick. Now powers that will give Nate the ability to protect or destroy humanity begin to awaken. There are Demons, Lycanthropes, Vampires and Warlocks alike wanting to kill him for his gifts, and without proper training Nate will surely succumb to the darkness within.  Get a sneak peak on Wattpad, Check it out here. In order to get my book Published I\u2019m going to need to get at least three different types of Edits \u2013 A Developmental Edit \u2013 A Line Edit \u2013 A Proofread Edit. I am confident on my storytelling skills, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to get a professional option. I want this novel to be  the best it can be and that you, as the reader, can be fully immersed in the story without having to re-read a line just to understand what I was trying to say.  Along with fees, what is left will go into formatting the book for both Print and E-Book and then finalize my Print Book Cover. (The spin and back blur.) Now if you take a look to the right side of the page you\u2019ll notice a list of very attractive perks that could be yours once you help contribute on making my dream a reality. It goes without saying that I can\u2019t do anything without a little bit of help so I want to thank you in advance for either funding this project or spamming it all over your social media. I can\u2019t say that growing up in my shoes was easy. It\u2019s a fact that there are others in the world that have worse problems, but that doesn\u2019t lessen that fact that we all have problems. Writing is my escape. It\u2019s what I love to do, and eventually, God willing, I can make a living off it. I have to get my foot in the door by publishing this first book. You have no idea the magnitude of a difference just having my worked publish can do. So if you're still here, \n Thank You\u00a0 \nFor setting aside your time to consider on helping kick start my project. \n",

  "It's happening! After almost four years of schlepping our freezer to pop ups all around Richmond and hand packing hundreds (thousands?) of pints for delivery to get y'all through the pandemic...WE ARE OPENING OUR PARLOR! For the uninitiated, we are Spotty Dog Ice Cream Co., a two person dream team who have spent the last few years side hustling an ice cream pop up based in the East End of Richmond. We craft New England style ice cream, an ultra-rich, ultra-creamy ice cream with a bit of bite, inspired by the good stuff we grew up eating up north.\u00a0 Whether you've been with us since our free sample delivery days in 2017, used to shoot the shit with us at our Union Market pop ups, relied on us to get you through 2020 with weekly porch delivery, or are brand new to us and curious to try our scoops...to us, you're a SpottyHead and we need your help now more than ever! Perfectly situated on Jefferson Avenue, tucked in alongside our favorite East End shops--Dear Neighbor, Sub Rosa Bakery, The Roosevelt, North End Juice Co., Pizza Bones, and Union Market, to name a few--our parlor will serve New England style ice cream from our 1,366 square foot space. Half of our parlor will be dedicated to retail space, featuring bar seating to watch our scoopers craft the perfect cone, as well as booths to cozy up with your buds over a scoop or two. We will also have a walkup window, so you can order your treats ahead of time, grab, and go.\u00a0\u00a0 Our space will be a modern take on the classic parlor, providing the perfect spot for our neighbors to gather with family and friends for an afternoon treat on a hot day, to flirt on a date over a shared sundae, or to grab a few hand packed pints to go for your party or a night on the couch.\u00a0 In Fall 2017, Spotty Dog was born from delivering free ice cream samples to our neighbors in the East End. Slowly but surely, word spread throughout the neighborhood, and by Spring 2018, Spotty Dog was selling scoops at pop ups throughout Richmond. When March 2020 hit, we quickly pivoted to a pint delivery model, to ensure all the SpottyHeads out there could keep their freezers stocked. From 2017 on, our goal has remained the same -- to bring a classic ice cream parlor to the East End, sharing treats with our neighbors (just like we did back in the day).\u00a0 Your Kickstarter pledges will help us open our doors spring of 2022! So far, Spotty Dog has been fully self funded and we've relied mostly on our scrappy 'tude to make our pop-up model work. With your help, your pledges will go towards vital parlor equipment, like our dipping cabinet, where we'll scoop all of your favorite flavors, and our oven, where we will bake all of our house mix-in's. And truly... every single dollar helps!\u00a0To sweeten the deal, we have some rad gear to get you excited for our opening day (like totes, lighters, tees, mugs, the works).\u00a0 While y'all anxiously await our grand opening, you can continue to support Spotty Dog (and keep your freezers stocked) by ordering from our weekly pint drop. Every Tuesday at 6pm, we release a fresh batch of pints available for delivery to all City of Richmond addresses (or Friday evening pick ups from our Church Hill test kitchen). For more info, make sure you're following us on Insta at @spottydogrva. Pints can be purchased through our site: www.spottydogicecream.com :)",
  "Hello Cookie Lovers! My name is Heidi, I am the owner of Maui Cookie Lab. We offer \"fresh-from-the-oven\" Classic Cookies and sweets, all hand-crafted from scratch daily here on Maui. \u00a0Maui Cookie Lab was officially launched in late January 2020 as a side project to what was my main cookie brand: Maui Sweet Cakes, which were packaged shortbread cookies. When COVID came to town in March of 2020, Maui Sweet Cakes was forced to close, as all of our hotel and retail accounts were shuttered.\u00a0 With the effects of the shutdown here on Maui, I was worried about how I'd continue my business and be able to provide work for my team. Since Maui Cookie Lab had just launched and was a Mobile Cookie Bar, we were deemed \"essential\", and allowed to operate during the shutdown.\u00a0 With growing popularity of our \"cookie pivot\", we are in desperate need of a larger commercial kitchen. We are bursting at the seams in our current 400 square foot kitchen, and we now have the opportunity to move to a larger kitchen facility which will enable us to expand our production, \u00a0and also have space for a retail Cookie Bar & Sweet Shop to serve even more of our Cookie Loving community. We are about to start construction, but are in desperate need of more funds to enable us to complete the project. Costs are higher than planned and YOU can help us get to the finish line!\u00a0 Funds raised here are just a portion of what's needed to close the financial gap we face, as costs of construction, \u00a0equipment and supplies have all \u00a0risen quite a bit.\u00a0 My MCL team and I are beyond excited to have the opportunity to continue this pivot with more room to create our delicious Classic Cookies and new recipes too! ***Please note: all backers who would like their perk to be shipped, we will contact you to determine the ship date, address and cost. Shipping costs are NOT included in the perk cost, and will be charged separately at the time of shipping.\u00a0 Heidi & the Maui Cookie Lab Team",
  "Meet Thomas! Like you, he was fed up with the endless texting, ghosting and fake accounts on dating apps. A friend told him about Greenlight Accessories and things got instantly better. I bet you and he have a lot in common. . . A message from our founder:\u00a0 Hi, I\u2019m Adrian, the creator of Greenlight Accessories. They say \u201cnecessity is the mother of invention\u201d and this idea is no different. It started about a year ago when after 15+ years I reentered the dating scene. The more I did it, the more I hated it and after talking to others I wasn\u2019t alone. Everyone seemed to feel the same way, dependent on digital romance as a necessary evil to find love, but miserable in the process. That\u2019s when the idea hit me, how do we ditch the dating apps and meet face-to-face again? Enter a Brazilian steak house \u2013 sitting down you receive a card, green on one side and red on the other. Clear signals between the patrons and the servers \u2013 aha people like clear signals \u2013 and Greenlight Accessories was born. It was then that I set upon a quest to find the easiest, cheapest, most adoptable way people could send signals of approachability, and make the color green the internationally recognized color of \u201csingle and ready to mingle.\u201d Ultimately, this idea is only as good as those who support it. As I said in the video, I\u2019ve kept prices as low as possible to encourage bulk purchases. I hope similar green products become widely available online and at retail stores to enable the movement to spread quickly. I truly thank you for your support and look forward to hearing \"happily ever after\" stories that all started with a green wristband. Adrian One of the best things about this simple, low-tech idea is how easy it is to use it. When you want to be approachable, turn it to green. When you aren't in the mood, turn it to the design and it looks like any other bracelet.\u00a0 Finding it hard to believe so many people hate online dating? Check out Google's most requested search results when you type: \"Why Online Dating...\"\u00a0 OK, so technically I made up Online Dating Syndrome (ODS) but I'm pretty surprised it doesn't already exist. Certainly not taking anything away from those suffering with real illnesses and syndromes, but numerous studies document the mental health concerns caused by digital dating, specifically swiping. \u00a0 Time to deep-dive into the rewards you can receive when you back different levels. Keep in mind the pricing structure is such that the per piece price drops with higher quantity orders. And your biggest reward. . . . we'll that's obviously meeting new people and getting off the dating apps for good! \u00a0Throw a Greenlight Party - - \u00a0just remember to invite me :)\u00a0",
  "Hello, my name is Deirdre Graham and my project is to reclaim Angel Numbers Jewelry to be the Great Brand it is destined to be! A brand of basic, urban and fine lines of jewelry. The mission of Angel Numbers Jewelry is to bring awareness of spirituality and inspiration into the world! The vision of Angel Numbers Jewelry is to be the backbone of a platform called Light Workers Unite! On this platform, members will have access to funds that aid in their individual missions to better humanity. \u00a0My goal on Kickstarter is to get the help of the public to reclaim my brand. This brand of jewelry is not meant to be just a fashion trend. \u00a0Angel Numbers Jewelry has a necessary and worthy cause behind it. We are a community of lightworkers. Within this community, we democratize funding to aid in each other's missions. We are unified to help each other!\u00a0We will donate to one another through the use of mobile payment services we already have access to. This monetary stream will instantly fund projects that have the intention of bringing more love and light into the world! \u00a0 Have you ever come across repeating numbers, multiple times a day and throughout the week? 11:11 being the most urgent sequence of them all. When you see 11:11 the universe is trying to get your attention on a personal significant matter, or you may be beginning your spiritual journey. According to numerology and popular opinion, these repetitious numbers are signs from your Angels, encouraging you that you are on the right path and everything is going to be okay! AN INTRODUCTION TO THE NUMBER SEQUENCES:\u00a0 THE COMPANY: Angel Numbers Jewelry was founded in 2020 and incorporated as a Limited Liability Corporation within the state of Delaware. It was founded by Deirdre Graham who owns 100% of the business and also possesses intellectual property rights over the name Angel Numbers Jewelry, in reference to necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets, body chains and anklets.\u00a0This business is 100% debt free and committed to reinvesting it's sales back into the goodness of humanity. MY FIRST DESIGNS: My previous market designs were sleek yet basic, however the ads I ran on social media sites opened the market place up... Yes, I thought it was a good idea too! The blessings behind intellectual property theft is PROOF OF CONCEPT! Seeing the amount of competition in the market place made me realize... I have to bring brand worthy creativity into my designs. Currently in production is an Urban Line, styled with wings made of detailed antiquated silver. \u00a0A Classy Line, styled with zircon accents, and the higher end lines are made with exclusive gems. For proprietary reasons, I won't show them here until I launch the line in July, but trust me when I tell you they are beautiful and unisex! These lines will be offered online and retail, providing multiple streams of income to sustain our charity platform, Lightworkers Unite! THE PLATFORM BEHIND THE BRAND: Why Angel Numbers Jewelry the brand? When I thought of getting people involved in this positive movement, the first idea that came to mind was community. This is the community that lightworkers, chosen ones, star seeds, helpers of humanity... whatever you want to call us, have been dreaming about! The Light Workers Unite platform will be hosted on Discord. Customer's will gain access to this members only community through a QR code inserted into the package label. In this community we follow the basics of crowdfunding. A large amount of people donating small amounts of money. Light workers have a lot of great ideas that can help better the world. This platform will help in the beginning phase of those individual missions. A member will post their cash handle and every member will rally behind their cause. Angel Numbers Jewelry will match all donations with a $500.00 maximum. HOW YOUR FUNDS WILL BE UTILIZED: $3750.00 - A line of brand worthy designed necklaces: 1800 pieces of the 'Basic Line' in gold and silver. 400 pieces of the 'Urban Line' in gold and silver. 600 pieces of the 'Classy Line' in gold and silver.\u00a0 $2000.00 - 2 months of Brand Ambassador Services / Marketing $8100.00 - \u00a06 months of Brand Protection from the best in the industry $2000.00 - Business Website $500.00 \u00a0\u00a0- QR Coded Package Inserts $2000.00 - Unforeseen Cost\u00a0 This investment is a catalyst for getting this brand off of the ground and into major retail markets! Thank you for your time and donations. I believe in this brand because, not only are we spreading positivity through jewelry, we are standing behind it with a platform that actually gives back. This brand is going to do great things and help a lot of people! The power of good needs a broader presence in this world! I'm always looking for great like minded people to work with. If you can't donate please just share! The official Angel Numbers Jewelry line will launch July 4th. Thank you Kickstarter and may us Lightworkers Unite!\u00a0",

  "Bust a\nBully with \u201cBully Busting 101\u201d Hello, my name is Doug Setter, BSc. I have\nwritten this self-help, do-it-yourself guide designed to help teens deal with the growing issues of bullying.  Whether you are a parent or adult relative of a teen, you may often think about what your child goes through if they are being bullied.\u00a0 You might feel guilty not having the tools or the time to empower your teen.\u00a0  If you are that teen receiving the constant onslaught of taunts (hey fatty, skinny, geek, spaz, etc.),\u00a0 threats, shoves, slaps, lunches stolen, property damaged and other forms of degradation, you might have noticed that the adults or the school policies are not working the way that they are supposed to.\u00a0\u00a0 Overview Our popular culture\nreinforces the idea that bullying can be destroyed with a few tips, tricks and policies written\nby adults who have never been on the receiving end of bullying or\u00a0have lived through the social media driven and technology\nage. I am out to change that one book at a\ntime!  Help me establish this initiative to serve kids in need of a solution for\nthe constant bullying. As little as $10 (2 gourmet coffees or a fast food meal)\u00a0 gets a \u201cBully Busting 101\" eBook to an individual that can change their\nideas about what\nthey can accomplish\u00a0for the rest of his or her life. Make this vision\na reality with a donation to this project today! More about the Project Today\u2019s\nworld is a different place than a generation ago.\u00a0 Verbal and written threats and taunts have graduated into cyber bullying and cyber stalking.\u00a0 Jostling, punching and lunch theft as gotten meaner and more humiliating.\u00a0  As a result of bullying, more young people are turning to depression, drug-use, self-mutilation and suicide.\u00a0 This is what prompted me to dig deeper into research and my own experiences to produce: \u201cBully\nBusting 101.\u201d\u00a0 Think of the benefits that we could bring to teens:  \u00b7Increased self-esteem to avoid destructive lifestyles and relationships \u00b7Physical and mental health\nand fitness  \u00b7Increased learning ability and enjoyment of greater education  -Greater sense of self When\nI think about all of the opportunities in life that are lost from avoiding school\u00a0and higher learning or being too distrustful of other people, it assured me\nthat this book needs to be shared. If executed properly, we\ncan reach a large market of teens in need of an easier way to live what should\nbe the best part of their lives.\u00a0 My\npersonal experiences will make me qualified to succeed.  I was bullied myself for years at school, work and home.\u00a0 I have also previously written several other books, including the Global award winning novel: Selo.\u00a0This paired with attention to detail and\nquality content will make me a key player in the anti-bullying\nculture. My mission is to take care of every funder, supporter and teen with the\nutmost respect and care. I have always looked after my soldiers and my team.\u00a0 It is crucial to our growth. About Me I was born with a club foot and had pnuemonia three times by\u00a0the age of six.\u00a0\u00a0Later, I was\u00a0a ninety-eight pound, young, sickly teen.\u00a0I grew up around alcoholic relatives and hated going home. \u00a0As a five foot, ten inch 18 year old, I weighed 120 pounds. \u00a0After several years of studying health, fitness and self-defense, I reached 155 pounds, ran full marathons, parachuted in\nthe military, competed in kick-boxing and earned a university degree. I later\nstarted training other people in fitness and martial arts and noticed the\npatterns of low self-esteem and childhood bullying.This is what brought me to write this book\nand helped me know I am on the right path. How You Can Help For me to bring the \u201cBully Busting 101\u201d\nto life, I need your support. Your generous funding will assist me with the cost\nof further development, art work, proofing, editing, manufacturing, production, shipping and promotion of the book.

  "Hello and thank you for visiting this page! My name is Marci Meth and I\u2019m a classical singer. I hope you will join me in an adventure called\u00a0The Wild Song. \u00a0\u00a0 As you can see, we have met the original goal! Thank you so much to all of the backers that have made this possible! \u00a0I have set a new \"stretch\" goal at 16,000\u20ac. \u00a0The additional funds will be used to do outreach and PR work in order to build awareness and community around The Wild Song\u00a0and its ideals. Bonjour et merci de votre visite sur cette page ! Je m\u2019appelle Marci Meth et je suis chanteuse lyrique. J\u2019esp\u00e8re que vous me rejoindrez dans cette aventure qui s\u2019appelle The Wild Song. (Le texte en fran\u00e7ais se trouve plus bas sur la page.) The Wild Song is an album that will alternate between Benjamin Britten\u2019s beloved folksong arrangements, poetry by W.B. Yeats recited by the great Shakespearean actor Simon Russell Beale, and new electronic music by the Oscar-winning film composer, Mychael Danna.\u00a0 This will be the first album ever to combine spoken poetry with classical and new electronic music. \u00a0It is also the first album to unite artists from very different artistic backgrounds in one recording. The brilliant pianist Anna Tilbrook and I recorded the folksongs at the Britten Studio in Snape, England, this past July.  Snape was home to Benjamin Britten, the greatest British composer of the 20th century, for most of his life.  Britten had a very strong connection to the land in Snape and you can hear and feel his connection to the Earth in his songs.\u00a0 \u00a0One of Britten\u2019s folksongs is about a \u201cwild song,\u201d and that\u2019s where the title of the album comes from. It\u2019s the song sung by Nature.  It\u2019s everywhere, if we listen\u2014in the sound of the wind, the waves, our hearts.  It\u2019s the \u201cwild song\u201d within us and around us.\n\n The folksongs remind us that we are part of something bigger and more beautiful than we can see, and that each of us has a duty to cultivate a physical and spiritual connection with this Earth and leave it more beautiful than we found it. We are now in the editing stage and I need your help to finish the album.  I won\u2019t be able to finish it without you! The cost of producing an album like this is enormous.  In fact, the total budget for the project is close to 25,000\u20ac. The artist fees and production costs, including studio rental and the recording fees have already been covered.\u00a0Yet many more post production costs remain, including: mastering, graphic art, design, photography, the actual printing of the CDs and USB keys, and the rights to Britten\u2019s music.  Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing venture, which means that if I don\u2019t reach the target sum, I won\u2019t have the funds to produce the album.  Your credit card is only debited for the amount you pledge if the target sum is reached. \u00a0Breakdown of the costs:\u00a0 \u00a0 10\u20ac or more\u00a0 You will receive a digital download of one song from The Wild Song when the album is released. 15\u20ac or more\u00a0 You will receive a digital download of one song from The Wild Song and one poem read by award-winning actor Simon Russell Beale to Mychael Danna\u2019s music one week before the album is officially released. 25\u20ac or more\u00a0 You will receive a CD signed by Marci and Anna one week before the album is officially released. 50\u20ac or more\u00a0 This is a great gift! You\u2019ll receive a lovely little wooden box containing a USB key with the entire The Wild Song album on the key.  Just plug it into your computer and download the album! 75\u20ac or more\u00a0 You will receive the lovely little wooden box containing a USB key with the entire The Wild Song album on the key, plus a signed CD to give to a friend!\u00a0 100\u20ac or more\u00a0 You\u2019ll get a big beautiful box set containing the USB key and CD\u2026plus a thirty minute singing lesson with Marci in Los Angeles or Paris or via Skype! 250\u20ac or more\u00a0 Marci will deliver a singing telegram to the person of your choice in Los Angeles or Paris or via Skype + that wonderful big box set with the USB key and a signed CD.  Someone you know would LOVE a singing telegram! 1000\u20ac or more\u00a0 Your name as an associate producer in the liner notes of the CD\u2014you\u2019ll be a music producer! Plus a big USB/CD box and 5 extra CDs to give as gifts! \nBonus: Marci will also bake you her world-famous NYC style cheesecake.\n \u00a0Britten was very fond of Yeats\u2019 poetry.  So much so, in fact, that he composed an arrangement to one of Yeats\u2019 poems.  That poem was based on the lyrics of an old Irish folk tune.  Perhaps you know it?  It\u2019s one of Britten\u2019s most famous folksong arrangements.  It\u2019s called \u201cThe Salley Gardens.\u201d (It will be included on the album.) As I was studying the lyrics to Britten\u2019s folksongs, I realized that the language used in all of his settings was very much like the language in \u201cThe Salley Gardens.\u201d  That gave me the idea that it would be lovely to hear some of Yeats\u2019 poetry recited before and after the folksongs.  I looked for poems that had the same themes as Britten\u2019s songs and I paired them together. Well before I met Simon, I had written to Mychael Danna to ask him if he would be willing to compose for the project\u2014and to my absolute delight, he agreed.  Mychael is a film composer (as was Benjamin Britten at the beginning of his career) and he is amazingly gifted for adding emotional content to the spoken word. That\u2019s why I wanted him to compose music that would bring out Yeats\u2019 poetry and weave a musical continuity throughout the album.  \n Mychael Danna, composer   www.mychaeldanna.com Mychael Danna is an Academy Award winning film composer recognized for his evocative blending of non-western traditions with orchestral and electronic music.  He composed the transculturally inspired 2013 Oscar and Golden Globe-winning score for Ang Lee\u2019s Life of Pi, as well as many award-winning scores for his longtime collaborator, Atom Egoyan.  Danna has composed for all of Egoyan\u2019s films since 1987\u2019s Family Viewing, winning the Genie for their films Exotica, Felicia\u2019s Journey, Ararat and The Sweet Hereafter.  Other noted credits include Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated films such as Moneyball, Capote, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Monsoon Wedding, Shattered Glass, Little Miss Sunshine, (500) Days of Summer, Surf\u2019s Up, Water, Antwone Fisher, Being Julia and Girl, Interrupted. \u201cThe most gratifying filmmaking experiences are ones that take effort to unpeel the layers surrounding the heart of the story and to find the best musical expression of that heart,\u201d says Danna.  \u201cThose are always the film scores I am most proud of.\u201d Simon Russell Beale, actor Simon Russell Beale has been described by The Independent as \"the greatest stage actor of his generation.\" He made his name at the Royal Shakespeare Company as a comic actor in the 1980s. Since 1995 he has been a regular player at the National Theatre, a BBC radio and television actor and presenter. He has won two Laurence Olivier and BAFTA awards.

Yeats r\u00e9cit\u00e9e par le grand com\u00e9dien Shakespearien Simon Russell Beale, et une musique \u00e9lectronique de Mychael Danna, compositeur prim\u00e9 aux Oscars. Cet album sera le premier \u00e0 m\u00e9langer la po\u00e9sie, la musique classique et la musique \u00e9lectronique. \u00a0C'est aussi le premier album \u00e0 r\u00e9unir des artistes de si diff\u00e9rentes formations dans un seul enregistrement. La pianiste Anna Tilbrook et moi avons enregistr\u00e9 les folksongs au Britten Studio \u00e0 Snape en juillet. C'est l\u00e0, en effet, que Benjamin Britten, le plus grand compositeur anglais du  20e si\u00e8cle, a v\u00e9cu pendant la majeure partie de sa vie.  Britten \u00e9prouvait un lien tr\u00e8s fort avec la terre \u00e0 Snape et l\u2019on peut l\u2019entendre et le sentir dans ses m\u00e9lodies. Le titre de l\u2019album vient d\u2019une des folksongs qui \u00e9voque une \u00ab\u00a0Wild Song \u00bb : une m\u00e9lodie sauvage. C\u2019est la m\u00e9lodie chant\u00e9e par la Nature. Si nous \u00e9coutons, elle est partout, dans le son du vent, les vagues, nos c\u0153urs.  C\u2019est la m\u00e9lodie sauvage qui r\u00e9sonne en nous et autour de nous. Les folksongs nous rappellent que nous faisons partie de choses plus grandes et plus belles que celles que nous voyons, et que chacun de nous doit cultiver un lien physique et spirituel avec cette Terre et la laisser plus belle  que lorsqu\u2019on l\u2019avait trouv\u00e9e. Nous sommes maintenant en train de faire le montage et j\u2019ai besoin de votre soutien pour finir l\u2019album.  Je ne pourrai pas le faire sans vous\u00a0!  Le co\u00fbt de produire un enregistrement comme celui-ci est \u00e9norme.  En fait, le budget total du projet est de 25.000\u20ac.  Les cachets des artistes et les co\u00fbts de production, y compris la location du Britten Studio et les frais d\u2019enregistrement sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9gl\u00e9s. Mais il reste beaucoup d\u2019autres frais \u00e0 couvrir, y compris\u00a0: le mastering, le graphisme, la photographie, l\u2019impression des CDs et cl\u00e9s USB et les droits \u00e0 la musique de Britten.  Avec Kickstarter, c\u2019est tout ou rien, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire, que si je n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 lever les 9.000\u20ac, je n\u2019aurai rien du tout.

Britten \u00e9tait un grand admirateur de la po\u00e9sie de Yeats, au point de composer un arrangement sur un de ses po\u00e8mes.  Ce po\u00e8me \u00e9tait bas\u00e9 sur les paroles d\u2019une vieille m\u00e9lodie irlandaise. Peut-\u00eatre que vous le connaissez?  Il est un des folksongs le plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bre de Britten.  Il s\u2019appelle \u201cThe Salley Gardens.\u201d (Il sera sur le CD.) Pendant que j\u2019\u00e9tudiais les paroles des folksongs de Britten, je me suis rendue compte que le langage utilis\u00e9 dans tout ses arrangements \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s proche de celui de \u201cThe Salley Gardens.\u201d  C\u2019est comme cela que j\u2019ai eu l\u2019id\u00e9e que ce serait joli d\u2019entendre de la po\u00e9sie de Yeats r\u00e9cit\u00e9e avant et apr\u00e8s les folksongs. J\u2019ai cherch\u00e9 des po\u00e8mes et des m\u00e9lodies qui avaient les m\u00eames th\u00e8mes et je les ai mis ensemble. Bien avant de rencontrer Simon Russell Beale, j\u2019avais \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mychael Danna pour lui demander s\u2019il voulait bien composer de la musique pour ce projet, et \u00e0 ma plus grande joie, il a donn\u00e9 son accord.  Mychael est un compositeur de film (comme Benjamin Britten au d\u00e9but de sa carri\u00e8re) et il est tr\u00e8s dou\u00e9 pour ajouter de l\u2019\u00e9motion \u00e0 la parole.  C\u2019est pour cela que je voulais qu\u2019il compose de la musique qui soulignerait la po\u00e9sie de Yeats et cr\u00e9erait une continuit\u00e9 musicale pour l\u2019album. A propos des artistes\u00a0:\u00a0 Mychael Danna, compositeur   www.mychaeldanna.com Mychael Danna, compositeur prim\u00e9 aux Oscars pour la partition du film The Life of Pi de Ang Lee, est connu pour ses musiques  qui m\u00e9langent les traditions non-occidentales avec la musique \u00e9lectronique.  Mychael Danna travaille avec le r\u00e9alisateur Atom Egoyan depuis 1987 et il a gagn\u00e9 le prix \u201cG\u00e9nie\u201d pour leurs films Exotica, Felicia\u2019s Journey, Ararat et The Sweet Hereafter. Il a aussi compos\u00e9 la musique pour beaucoup de films nomm\u00e9s et prim\u00e9s aux Oscars, tels: Monsoon Wedding, Little Miss Sunshine, 500 Days of Summer, Moneyball, Capote, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Shattered Glass, Surf\u2019s Up, Water, Antwone Fisher, Being Julia et Girl, Interrupted.  \u201cLes exp\u00e9riences les plus gratifiantes dans la composition d\u2019une musique de film, sont celles o\u00f9 il faut faire un effort pour trouver le c\u0153ur de l\u2019histoire pour lui donner une vie musicale,\u201d dit M. Danna.  \u201cJe suis toujours le plus fier de ces partitions-l\u00e0.\u201d Simon Russell Beale, com\u00e9dien Simon Russell Beale a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit par The Independent comme \u201cle plus grand acteur de sa g\u00e9n\u00e9ration.\u201d Il s\u2019est fait un nom au Royal Shakespeare Company en tant qu\u2019acteur comique dans les ann\u00e9es 80.

Working with her are Sergio and Sara two young and trusted assistants and her former university professor, Marco Vani. Once the significance of this discovery is understood, the secret service and military intelligence start to take action in order to take possession of this device that works through the physical phenomenon of quantum entanglement and therefore, does not need any cable transmission or radio waves. Eva and her friends are threatened, but don\u2019t give in to pressure and continue their hectic work. The reaction of the powers that be was immediate: the four researchers are kidnapped, but they manage to escape in an incredible way. Just when they think they have been defeated, they realize that the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, apparently located just inside the device, has in fact already correlated with the pineal gland of Eva (the famous \"third eye\" of the human mind) and this will lead them to achieve the ultimate goal: to save the world from self-destruction. \n Sara - Is 25 years old, she\u2019s a pretty and nice girl. She is Eva\u2019s trustworthy assistant. She has a degree in computer engineering, a subject in which she excels, especially in the field of advanced programming. With the nickname of Valkyrie, she is part of the global group of hacktivists known as Anonymous. She's also idealistic, stubborn and she\u2019s always ready to take on small and big battles. \u00a0Sergio - Is 26 years old, he\u2019s pragmatic and a bit of a nerd. He\u2019s also Eva\u2019s trustworthy assistant. He has a degree in experimental physics. At the University of Milan he was first in his class. Excellent ability in practical application. He finds it a bit difficult to take on scientific subjects that are different from his training and specialization. He\u2019s not afraid to face tough challenges. He dreams of winning the Nobel Prize for Physics.    \u00a0Miner \u2013 Around sixty, but looks old and wrinkly due to a lifetime of hard work. For Eva, he is the man of destiny that unites within himself the ancestral and esoteric fears about everything that we do not know. ",
  "The Forgotten Chronicles began as a Roleplaying game in the style of AD&D, Pathfinder and multiple other Pen and Paper games. Based on this I wrote a book, which you can already purchase on Amazon\u00a0and DriveThruRPG\u00a0in the german version. We're still working on the translation. This Roleplaying game is special because of its simple and modular system, which is easy to learn for new players and it can be extended endlessly. You can even write your own expansions for it.\n In addition we completely parted from the classical elements, and added completely new ones. The Races come completly from nature and are inspired from classical literature. From feudal Middle-Ages to Steampunk. Everyone can find his / her setting.\n At first planned as instructions, we now want to start a little series in which our old testing team continues their adventures. We want to document it and involve you, the viewer directly into it.\n Every episode lasts about 20 - 30 minutes and a season then lasts a whole evening which usually goes on for around 4 - 6 hours. Uninteresting passages we of course cut out and instead we cut in single comments of the player, who describe what they thing in special situations. The viewer, other then the players has always the option to read secret notes and if he / she wants experience the different secrets each and every character has.\nMeet our six players and their weird quirks! Their characters range from the Healing tree to the naughty Kitty.\n As a little kickstart we need simple consumer-equipment to evolve from it. We need two Full-HD cameras, tripods, omnidirectional Microphones and equipment for all of this.\n",
  "\"Pieces\" has been a project 2 years in the making. From the premier date of Alan Theisen's \"Arcanum\", I knew I wanted to record an album of all unaccompanied music. There were many factors that went into making this recording, the most important being timing. For the past year I've been stationed with the 8th Army Band in Seoul, S. Korea, all the while trying to make this recording in an inexpensive way. After countless missteps, it became clear the only way to have this recording come out how I wanted was to hire the right professionals with the years of experience necessary to do it right. The perfect opportunity came to record while I would be between Army Band stations Korea and Germany, home for a month-long tour of the Southeast followed by recording. That's where Tommy Joe Anderson of ACA records and Spivey Hall come in. ACA has recorded a number of well known artists over its 30+ year history, including many recordings of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Spivey Hall is rated as one of the best halls for chamber music and recording in the world. This acoustic phenom comes with a price. At $1500 for the hall rental, another $1000 for recording engineer, and between $1000-$2000 for editing, this makes up the bulk of the money I'm trying to raise through Kickstarter.  While the actual recording took place 27-28 September, \"Pieces\" is still very much a work in progress. I am still awaiting the first draft of edits and will then send it back for touch ups and mastering. There is also the costs of album graphic design, photography and video production, licensing, and printing of the physical CDs, which brings the total well past my fundraising goal. After deliberation, I settled on $6000 as a reasonable and most likely goal to raise. I hope you will consider donating to this exciting project. The $10 and $25 donation level rewards are a great way to pre-order the album... and just in time for Christmas! I'm also offering a poster of the beautiful cover designed and photographed by Laura Anderson Welborn. OR you could commission your very own 2-minute solo work from Alan Theisen. Browse through the rewards and see what's right for you. And thank you for your support! -Chris",

Past projects include \"Beau Soir: French Music for Oboe and Piano\" which raised funds for repairs in one of our favorite performance venues - a historic French gothic church in Abbeville, South Carolina - and in subsequent recitals, sent contributions to victims of the Paris terrorist attacks. Last season we took a series of composers' last works into senior centers and nursing homes to celebrate how the wisdom of age influenced these masterpieces.\u00a0This year, our program of works by women seeks to highlight their voices, and bring awareness and aid to organizations that support diversity and equality.\u00a0 We are in the midst of creating our debut album, but we need your help! The album will include music for oboe/english horn and piano--including exquisite songs by Faur\u00e9 and Debussy, a new transcription of the Adagio Assai from Ravel's Piano Concerto in G, and a complete recording of the Silvestrini \u00c9tudes for Hautbois, and more! We have already laid down the tracks with Grammy-award winning recording engineer, Bill Maylone at Pianoforte Studios in Chicago... \u00a0Now here's where you come in!\u00a0We are seeking additional funding for editing, CD printing, and distribution. While we have independently covered the initial recording costs, we want you, our community of friends and supporters, to be actively involved in the final stages of the project!\u00a0We know the immense power of collaboration and what can be achieved when we work together.\u00a0Our fundraising goal is the minimum amount needed to make the album a reality, and every dollar counts! Once we've reached our base goal, all additional contributions will cover costs associated with the album-release tour and\u00a0facilitate direct engagement within the local community.\u00a0 We believe music has the power to heal, stir, call to action, and light up our dark world - that's what Lumina is all about. We are asking you to join us on our quest to continue these and other projects.

  "Recently in the news:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Potato #345 by Keith Abosch - Sold for $1.08 million(What did #1-344 look like?)\u00a0 Did this spud only sell for that much because he photographs celebrities for $500,000 sitting fees? Can you imagine invoicing a half-million dollars for a photo shoot?\u00a0 And wouldn't $1 million be enough for the potato photo?\u00a0 Did he have to collect that extra $80,000?\u00a0 Because (makes frowny face) \"Sorry, I just couldn't let it go for $1 million.\" Phantom by Peter Lik - Sold for $6.5 millionJonathan Jones of The Guardian described it as such: \"The $6.5m canyon: it's the most expensive photograph ever \u2013 but it's like a hackneyed poster in a posh hotel.\"\u00a0  And Peter Lik's sale has NOT been substantiated.\u00a0 That seems like a lot for a black and white photo, if you ask me.\u00a0 Does that include a mat and a frame, or is that extra?\u00a0 (I think Hobby Lobby is having a frame sale this week.)So, I want to REALLY sell the most expensive photograph ever \u2013 a verified sale \u2013 with a collective buyer (all of you), to claim rights as the most expensive photo ever sold, and to poke fun at the lunacy of these prices for a photograph.\u00a0 And to do some good work with the funds, which you'll see below. These recent sales remind me of Marcel Duchamp's Fountain, where he could make anything, including art out of a urinal, and it would sell. From The Art Story Web site: Fountain (1917) \"The most notorious of the readymades, Fountain was submitted to the 1917 Society of Independent Artists under the pseudonym R. Mutt. The initial R stood for Richard, French slang for \"moneybags\" whereas Mutt referred to JL Mott Ironworks, the New York-based company, which manufactured the porcelain urinal. After the work had been rejected by the Society on the grounds that it was immoral, critics who championed it disputed this claim, arguing that an object was invested with new significance when selected by an artist for display. Testing the limits of what constitutes a work of art, Fountain staked new grounds. What started off as an elaborate prank designed to poke fun at American avant-garde art, proved to be one of most influential artworks of the 20th century.\"  And also the work of Piero Manzoni. Can we make news around the world with this photo sale? And maybe get featured in Time magazine and other publications, and the photo will be seen and admired around the world. It's a happy photo, don't you think?\u00a0 Definitely a conversation starter!\u00a0 Maybe put it up on the ceiling, where you wish you had a skylight? You all will be the collective buyer \u2013 of the most expensive photograph ever sold. That should be worth a little something at cocktail parties. It's titled \"SKY BLUE SKY\". It was created on January 29, 2016, using a vintage Canon FL 55mm 1.2 lens on a Panasonic GF1 body once owned by famous photographer, Mike Johnston, of The Online Photographer.\u00a0 There will never be another photo exactly like it and you'll have a \"piece of sky\".  You will receive the image file to print and frame (as a JPG full-resolution digital download), that you will be able to gaze at on grey and rainy days, and that will help you look forward to the next sunny day. And once all the JPGs have been delivered as rewards, the original will be offered to the Smithsonian or the Lyons History Museum (one of them should take it.) The backers will have the only other copies of the most expensive photograph ever sold. Let's have some fun and make this project soar.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I can get $1 from a whole lot of people, we can make this 'sale', and history!  So, if you can, toss a buck in.\u00a0 Come on, you'll be able to say you bought the most expensive photo ever sold! Thank you!\u00a0  See my full bio for what I will do with the funds, including turning a local Colorado project, THE WISE PHOTO PROJECT, into a global project  \u2013 I photograph the elderly and print them large so that they can live on in our homes after they've passed away.\u00a0 I'll be able to offer sessions and photographs to people without needing a fee, if they are unable to pay.

  "Thanks to everyone for helping us smash past our funding target in the first week! The more we can raise the better though, so here are some stretch goals to show you hoe we will utilise extra funds in a way that rewards everyone! We will produce a 20 page recipe booklet, featuring two recipes for each chilli sauce (one easy, and one more challenging and elaborate) with vibrant photography, and amazing, totally unique dishes and include it free with every order! Chef Fergus wants to rid your meals from the horrific and unnecessary tragedy of bland and boring. This means at the very least, adding a sauce that has a complex flavour structure that will liven up any meal, but ideally inspiring you to push your home cooking to totally new levels.\u00a0 There are many artisanal chilli sauce brands out there, but many of these sauces are far too spicy for the average pallet. Chef Fergus looks at chilli sauce almost as though it's ice cream. That is; a platform upon which to host lots of bold and exciting flavour combinations. Alkemio aims to bring you a growing range of sauce, and other condiments with flavour combinations you won't find anywhere else. But more importantly, pairing it with content that shows you how to utilise these sauces as a highly effective tool in the art of culinary expression.\u00a0 Alkemio Kitchen was born from a passionate home chef who delved into restaurant work and found it uninspiring, cooking the same dishes over and over again. Frustrated with the grind, Chef Fergus decided to go his own way and throw himself in the deep end by running supper clubs, serving 8 course taster menus of elaborate fusion cuisine, where the aim was to take the diner on a tour of the culinary world where each plate was at least two destinations... then COVID happened! In the midst of the second lockdown Fergus was playing around with a few ideas, and found an audience keen to try some his chilli sauce. He did a trial run and it went a lot better than expected, the orders kept coming and quickly the project took over his flat.\u00a0 Now Alkemio Kitchen is crowdfunding, and with your help we can turn it from a side hustle into small business, get it on as many shelves as possible, develop lots of new and exciting recipes, and inspire you!",

  "The Oblivion Walker is the birth-child of the countless ideas for science-fiction and fantasy literature I've had for countless years. The story-line is original and interesting, with just the right mix of humor, emotion, action , and mystery. I believe that the questions it raises and unique predicaments make it a new story for audiences of a wide range to really be in enveloped in and enjoy. I have sent excerpts to publishers and authors , and they all give it very positive reviews. I truly think there are many out there who will enjoy this story and I really want to have the money to get it published, just so I can have people experience my story. The issue I face is , I have a life to live, and a novel of this caliber requires attention to detail and consumption of time ; I've made headway , but progress is slow. What this money would go toward is expenses so I don't need to worry about work, at least long enough so that I can finish the book. Anyone that would be willing to believe in me just the slightest, would mean the world.\u00a0 Summary: Pierce is quiet kid, drifting along through life , deep in quiet Appalachian mountains. His peace is only disrupted by one thing; everyone else. Still, he enjoys his stroll through life , until it begins to fall apart, and he finds himself thrown into a strange world, one only told to children in storybooks. This confusion would be fine for the bright adolescent, except for one thing: everyone wants to kill him. In a magical world he doesn't know, with friends he cant remember, and powers he doesn't understand, Pierce has to put the puzzle together piece by piece, having to act like the god-like tyrant everyone remembers him to be. Political reconciliation, romantic entanglement, and ending a war isn't something you would consider doing over a long weekend, but to Pierce , and the rest of the Ageless, its just another day's work. It could be said that his fiery passion drives him , or at least drove Demetrius, the alter ego he has taken the place of, as his anger burns bright enough for him to make an inferno from his bare hands. But what will happen to Pierce once they find a way to recover the soul that was lost nearly a decade ago? Will he just go gently into that good night, or fight them to his last breathe? Find out the secrets this world holds , and many more in The Oblivion Walker. Recap: Pierce lives a normal life, but the world he, you , and I know falls apart and he ends up in a fantasy world,\u00a0competently\u00a0different from here. As soon as he\u00a0awakes , humans attempt to end his life, but he escapes , and a kid who claims to know who he is helps him to other old friends as they attempt to reclaim the memories he had lost while in the \"dream\", which is actually the world we know. While trying to come to grips with his existence, Pierce learns the master the power he has , including enhanced strength and ability to conjure fire, which is\u00a0closely\u00a0tied to his\u00a0emotions. Like his friend , he is Ageless, a classification of being that live for\u00a0millennium. Actually being nearly 3 hundred years old, Demetrius and Hesper\u00a0had been quite the travelers, before a near fatal accident nearly ended Demetrius's life, now Hesper works to bring him back. This vast and\u00a0detailed\u00a0world is visited in detail in this book, as Pierce must work to not only\u00a0help Hesper, but to prevent a global war. To make matters worse, they must learn more about the prophecy of the Oblivion Walker, which they fear pertains to them. Follow along as the two form a friendship and grow as companions. The world is explained in much greater detail and scientific sense than others in the fantasy genre. This story has twists around every turn and unique action sequences and plot. You wont be\u00a0disappointed. \u00a0",

  "We (Harvey Lloyd & Ivana Lovinci) have spent ten years reinventing the art of photography for the digital age called BREAKING THE LIGHT.\u00a0 Picasso said, \"I don't paint what I see, I paint what I imagine.\" We have created techniques to use our digital cameras as painter's tools and photograph that we imagine and even what we can't imagine. Using the TAO, quantum mechanics physics and metaphysics, ancient martial arts techniques, ZEN and Eastern philosophy, we are able to photograph what the eye cannot see, \"what isn't there,' until it is observed. The proof is seen on our website www.harveylloyd.com. The classic still film photography of \"what you see is what you get\" is ending as realistic painting ending over a hundred years ago,.\u00a0 Alll who are young in heart and love the art of photography will shatter the past and create a new way of seeing with our digital cameras.

Our cameras have photographed post abstract expressionist images in New York City and New Mexico, aerial photographs of the red hot lava in the volcano five to twenty miles below the geyser basins in Yelloswtone National Park, the world's largest volcano, our moon in hyperspace in our holographic universe, Las Vegas Deconstructed; abstract impressionist images of the famous city of Lady Luck and many more. Each image is made during a single exposure in our digital camera. The raw images are the score for the music of light. The raw images are downloaded into our software for finishing. We do not manipulate images in any way or add to the raw images. The art is in learning to photograph the illusions of reality and bringing them to our own vision and enjoyment. A new world appears, GAIA the earth mother's beauty. Our new visions will help to protect GAIA and the environment by creating awareness of the overwhelming beauty of our hidden world.",
  "\u00a0We LOVE PROTEIN BARS, but we think they can be better! Protein bars have the potential to be delicious, organic, and have real healthy ingredients in creative and exciting ways! \u00a0How do we plan to do that? By giving protein bars the treatment and attention they have always lacked. Our protein bar recipes are NOT formulated using factory-farmed cows and artificial ingredients.

OutClass Nutrition believes having simple ingredients is the healthiest way to make a protein bar! Each ingredient is selected to provide a great tasting bar. Our bars provide natural ingredients with a purpose. The bars are free of artificial sugars and flavors.

  "Imagine Diversifying Our Mountains For years, I have been fascinated with various outdoor activities like camping, fishing, hiking, snowboarding, and mountain biking. Backpacking in particular has become my favorite mindfulness activity, but I often find myself as the only person of color on the trails. This gets me in my head, trying to think of why I\u2019m one of the few people of color who love backpacking. When I return from my trips, I always come back to the same thoughts: There comes a moment when you have to realize that the \u201csystem\u201d wasn\u2019t built to be inclusive and has extensive barriers in place that discourage black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), would-be adventurers from participating in wilderness activities. What do I mean by this? Food is one of the best representations of different cultures and people in America. \u00a0When you go to a grocery store or a major outdoor retailer, there are ZERO culturally relevant adventure meals for campers, backpackers, hikers, and other outdoor devotees. You see the same big-name brands serving your \u201ctraditional\u201d meals like beef stew, lasagna, or biscuits and gravy. Personally, as a first generation Mexican-American immigrant from Michoacan, I know I would enjoy my outdoor adventures more if I had access to foods that packed real spice and flavor. Changing Human Behavior We founded Oso Meals with the goal to attract and support more BIPOC participation in wilderness activity and to introduce current explorers of every culture to a more diverse range of delicious backcountry meals. I believe we can achieve this goal by changing the normal, by creating the best adventure meals on the market and committing to sustainable and equitable food purchasing practices. I\u2019m incredibly excited to launch Oso Meals - and to invite you to help us improve the outdoor industry through real food that is rich in taste and culture. Our Meals Dehydrated meals on the market today lack the flavor and taste of regular cooking - this is because the food is seasoned prior to dehydration (if it's even seasoned). This process sucks all the taste, spice, and goodness out of the ingredients, leaving you with a bland mass of texture. We have figured out a way to prepare and package adventure meals so that they don't lose the flavor of home cooking. \u00a0We took it a step further and created Latin meals rich in the Mexican-American flavors of our youth, ensuring that all adventurers have access to a better type of food.\u00a0 What we need -\u00a0 We have innovated a new way to cook dehydrated meals, but we still need to finalize recipes, packaging, and the manufacturing processes to ensure food quality, shelf-life and safety certifications. We are currently boot strapping this company with our own (limited) funds and need your help to accelerate \u00a0our timeline!\u00a0 Our goal is to launch Oso Adventure Meals by June 2021 so that everyone can have meals in time for summer and fall adventures.\u00a0 Oso Meals began in the mountains of Michoacan, Mexico and continues here in the Rockies of Colorado. Deep into a week-long backpacking trip, friends Dom Barrera and Felipe Vieyra were sharing stories about their abuelita\u2019s home cooking. We remembered fresh huevos migos in the morning and giant platters of spicy enchiladas for the entire family. Dom was from Colorado and Felipe was from Michoacan, but we grew up enjoying the same flavorful meals. \u00a0That night over a bland dinner of flavorless dehydrated beef stew, the idea for Oso Adventure Meals was born. Along with Marcos Vieyra and Connor Lawrence, we are creating a new type of adventure meal, meals based on a love for food that is rich in taste and culture. Oso\u2019s soul is sharing delicious meals while you\u2019re off the beaten path and far from home. It\u2019s about creating access to flavors and recipes steeped in tradition. We all have fond memories of these recipes and are excited that foodies, adventurers, and all fans of good tasting food can share and enjoy the authenticity of Oso Meals. By you contributing to the founding of Oso Adventure Meals, you'll be a part of the journey to bring delicious meals to an ever diversifying outdoor community, you'll be a game-changer in the outdoor space and you'll be investing in a small business that's ready to disrupt a stale market. We plan to start with these 3 meals and expand to other culturally relevant options, bars, etc.\u00a0 The following meals were selected due to their history in traditional and modern Mexican culture.\u00a0 Inspired by Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico\u00a0 One of the most popular dishes of Michoac\u00e1n, Huevos Migas is a traditional egg-based dish from Michoac\u00e1n. It's a delicious combination that you'll be eager to wake up to.\u00a0 Inspired by Mexico City, Mexico\u00a0 Mexico City is known for the many delicious meals you can come across and one of the best meals your taste buds will enjoy is Mexico City style Enchiladas. Delicious and energizing lunch or dinner for your adventure.\u00a0 Inspired by Oaxaca, Mexico Tlayudas are handmade dishes. It's a staple of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It's a delicious meal, traditionally served somewhat like a pizza.\u00a0",
  "I started Dayum this is my Jam, AKA Dayum Jam, in 2015 with my best pal, Lindsay. What started as a teeny little jam biz where we sold jars of jam to mostly friends and family -- with the support from the Richmond community and a ton of our own hard work -- has grown into a 5-person operation. Still small, but certainly bigger than I think Lindsay or I ever would have imagined. These days we are one of RVA's only queer and trans-owned food businesses. We craft jam, pickles and other products named after hit songs. With our limited space, small-batch canning process, and limited equipment, we can only craft so much Dayum Jam product. Due to our old school style of stove-top jam cooking our ability grow, meet wholesale and retail demand, and get our goodness out to those who want it is extremely limited. Our little business has outgrown our small kitchen so now it's time to move forward with a larger-scale Commercial Cannery. This holiday season has shown us two important things: In addition to working with a cannery to boost production, we've teamed up with Black Woman-owned River City Selections are working with some incredible local minority biz owner friends to elevate the visibility of businesses like ours: People with huge hearts and a massive amount of passion to ensure Queer, Black, Trans, and other marginalized businesses succeed.\u00a0 We've teamed up with Black Woman-owned River City Selections to provide RVA with a weekly Pop-Up Shop, The Safe Space Market, to support awesome minority small, local businesses who've faced hardship due to the pandemic. We just need your help to make these two things happen! Timeline: January 14th: Announcing our two new \"Love\" themed jams\u00a0 January 26th: Our first large-scale production day at the new Cannery is January 26th February 6th: Safe Space Market Launch, Friday night, from 5-8pm\u00a0 We will use any funds raised from this project for: \u00a0 If you know us, you know we're more than a jam company. We're a family, we're a team of activists, and we do our best to be community contributors. Please help us take this big step, grow our operations, and work with other local minority businesses for a truly exceptional and impactful shopping experience!\u00a0 Thanks for the Love + Support!",
  "WE DID IT!!! YOU DID IT!!! Thank you SO much!!! With 7 days to go, Caf\u00e9 TISTA has reached 100% of its $5K funding goal to kickstart our single-origin specialty Colombian coffee and establish our on-site coffee shop in Calarc\u00e1, Colombia. \u00a0 *New Eco-friendly resealable coffee bags\u00a0 **Shipping expenses; to bring more coffee to more coffee lovers ***Launch of Caf\u00e9 TISTA's website SI SE PUEDE! We\u00a0are Caf\u00e9 TISTA, a single-source specialty 100% Colombian coffee brand and coffee shop located in the coffee region, \u00a0in Calarc\u00e1, Colombia.\u00a0 Welcome to a true farm to cup \u00a0coffee experience! \u00a0What Makes Our Coffee A Unique Experience? Caf\u00e9 TISTA has grown from the perseverance of family, farm-life, and our coffee harvesting tradition. During COVID-19, the\u00a0brand's creator Diego Mora and his family found themselves going to the countryside regularly. His wife Andrea\u2019s family farm located on the outskirts of Calarc\u00e1, Colombia has become a meeting point for\u00a0social distance gathering.\u00a0Palermo Farm- \u00a0has been in Andrea's family for\u00a047 years and her grandfather, Don Teotiste Lizarazo, aka TISTA, the inspiration behind this project, has been\u00a0harvesting coffee in small batches from this farm for three generations. Palermo Farm\u00a0is located on a small mountain top (la loma) 1,573 meters above sea level (MASL), surrounded by mountains, where shade-grown coffee trees dot the landscape, and the grounds are home to native and migratory birds. This is how family, land and coffee tradition have become the inspiration for our brand and on-site Cafe project- a unique farm to cup experience. \u00a0Our Project Diego, Andrea\u00a0(Team TISTA Colombia)\u00a0and Lida and Jos\u00e9 Juli\u00e1n\u00a0(Team TISTA USA)\u00a0have come together to launch Caf\u00e9 TISTA. We have been sharing our story in\u00a0Colombia and the United States through social media and through a promotional small batch sale of our 100% Colombian single\u00a0origin specialty coffee with family and friends.\u00a0 We are raising seed money to open Cafe TISTA, an on-site coffee shop where our coffee is grown, and to\u00a0bring the unique experience to our families,\u00a0friends, bird watchers and musicians. Our dream is for coffee lovers from all around the world\u00a0to enjoy our single origin coffee, learn about our trade and experience the beautiful Colombian countryside. Our Mission 1- Produce and share our 100% Colombian single origin specialty coffee 2- Continue growing our coffee preserving traditional farming practices that are clean (chemical free) and\u00a0sustainable while employing local talent 3- Offer a unique farm to cup experience to coffee lovers in Colombia and abroad offering a bridge for the world to experience Colombia in a different light. Meet Team TISTA\u00a0 TEAM TISTA Colombia & TEAM TISTA USA Diego\u00a0is a civil engineer and musician, and Andrea is an accountant in the non-profit sector in Colombia.\u00a0 They met 11 years ago\u00a0in Calarc\u00e1 through their love of music, coffee, and nature. Diego is the brains behind this project and the Caf\u00e9 TISTA brand. Lida, a native of Colombia, is a clinical social worker in New York and Jose Julian, also Colombian-American is a medical billing specialist\u00a0in New York City. Lida and Jose Julian keep close ties to their\u00a0family in Colombia.\u00a0 Many of them are proud farmers there and grow coffee, sugar cane, avocados, bananas. Part of Lida and Jose Julian\u2019s childhood was spent on a family farm in Colombia. Lida and Jose Julian are promoting Caf\u00e9 TISTA coffee in the United States. Diego, Lida and Jose Juli\u00e1n are siblings living in two different countries but share a love for nature, family and good coffee.\u00a0 The Caf\u00e9 TISTA dream is a family dream to bridge these two worlds and share our\u00a0very best coffee from the mountains of Calarc\u00e1 Colombia. Teostiste \"Tista\", Andrea\u2019s grandfather, a seasoned artisanal coffee grower is the soul of our coffee brand.\u00a0 He brings over 47 years of experience to our Caf\u00e9 TISTA project. Where is our project right now? Caf\u00e9 TISTA is currently being promoted and sold in Colombia at small coffee\u00a0shops and stores as well as farmer\u2019s markets.\u00a0 In the United States, Caf\u00e9 TISTA has been sold in small batches among friends and family through good \u2018ole word of mouth.\u00a0 This progress has allowed us to continue to promote the brand, share our vision for Caf\u00e9 TISTA and raise seed money to renovate the space that is to become Cafe TISTA on Palermo Farm, in Calarc\u00e1 where our coffee\u00a0is grown.\u00a0 This space will be converted to a shop where Cafe TISTA will debut and begin offering coffee origin experiences in summer 2021. What Will We Do With The Money? We are hoping for your help and support to get us there. Your pledges will\u00a0help us finish making improvements to our shop and purchase our first commercial espresso machine.

  "Great coffee and shared experiences is how this US Army veteran turned coffee roaster strives to make a difference in the community. History Through the Camacho\u2019s countless travels, moves, and deployments coffee has always been in abundance. In some places the coffee was intricate, almost delicate and in other places it was strong and bold. But regardless of the region of the world the coffee bean came from, the final beverage not only reflects the culture from where it now resides, but it also has the captivating ability to unite all those that partake of it. It is this \u201cidea\u201d that coffee unites people that intrigued one particular Colonel so he started to dabble in a new garage hobby. With each new shipment of beans from various parts of the world his skills grew in the roasting process. And with the encouragement of his spouse, family and friends and upon his retirement, the Colonel decided that coffee was what he wanted to do, \u201cwhen he grew up\u201d. Purpose Growing up is costly: emotionally, physically, and financially. Coffee seems like such a simple beverage; buy beans, grind beans, and then add water. Not much to it, right? That would be a resounding WRONG. Great coffee requires experience, partnerships, and equipment. We are looking for people who want to share in our passion and want to partner with us. Why We Want Your Help? Well, one particular Camacho wanted the garage back for her vehicle, especially now that it is winter in Colorado. That meant that the roaster needed a new home, one more suitable to coffee roasting. So the good Colonel packed up his roaster and moved it to a friendly commissary kitchen, \u00a0The roaster now shares a space with pies, cookies, chocolates, and some aspiring chefs. Granted coffee does pair well with all those delightful delectables, but we feel the two should be introduced at a later date when both arts have matured.\u00a0 Your partnership helps us build the Coffee Tasting Bar and Teach To realize our coffee wonderland dreams we need some serious coffee equipment:\u00a0 What's the Investment? We're glad you asked. We've come up with several fun ways that you can invest and help the Model Citizen Coffee Company reach it's goal. Find the one that's right for you, the different tiers are either to your right or at the bottom depending on the device you are using to view this awesome opportunity. Why else should I join the Model Citizen Coffee Team?\u00a0 Great Coffee and cool stuff, that's why. During our 30 years of military life we have learned that service members and their families, civilians, and contractors are a wonderful representation of America. That community secretly houses some of America's most talented treasures. We would like to showcase their talents in our products, art, and swag. Most, if not all Model Citizen Coffee designs have been created and inspired by a military spouse, veteran, dependent or other patriot who is connected to wanting to preserve this great nation. We're proud to showcase their passion in our products.\u00a0 A Taste of Model Citizen Coffee. \u00a0The three signature blends of Model Citizen Coffee\u00a0 \u00a0In Closing If you've read this far, thank you! The Camacho's are proud to have served this great nation for over three decades. \u00a0Having lived a transient lifestyle, putting down roots was tough. We did have community, it's just our connections stretched across states, countries, and continents. Now it's time for the Camacho's to settle in Colorado and make this home. We hope to use Model Citizen Coffee as a platform to do good, not only in our geographic community, but in the lives of those we share life experiences with. One year ago we said goodbye to the military, but we continue to salute those who still answer the call every day. We find great comfort knowing the nation is in their hands. God Bless you and those who serve others.\u00a0",
  "\u00a0The time has come for G+H to expand our offerings to the community, and that means we're ready to start producing sourdough croissants! We've been testing these for weeks, and we are SO excited to bring local, freshly made croissants to Robertson County. We are a very small staff of 3, and hand-laminating croissants is extremely labor-intensive. We want to be able to offer these as an everyday item in our bakery, but we can't produce the amount we want to by hand. \u00a0Our initial goal is to raise $1,500. Your generous donations will be used to purchase a commercial dough sheeter that will help us roll the perfect laminated dough for our sourdough croissants. We've got our sights set on a gently used dough sheeter that is available at an auction in the middle of December, and your contributions will ensure that we can make a bid on this incredible piece of equipment!\u00a0",
  "Hi I'm Elans, I'm an amateurish painter and illustrator currently undergoing my University course, so that's me. I've been working on watercolours for about a year now and have finally a substantial amount of quality paintings and illustration that I would like to publish in a professional book format. However as you may have guessed this is an expensive endeavour. My intention is to purely promote my own work in a fancy acceptable medium. Any dontators will also be given the opportunity to promote their own social media or online sites where they publish similarly themed work as I like to help out other artists however I can.\u00a0 For more information or questions don't hesitate to contact me!",
  "Really... I'm just taking a leap of faith and trying to take my art to the next level. I have always enjoyed being creative... it's my calm... it is something that makes me remember who I am. Enough people have told me that they see something in my work and that they believe in me... time to believe in myself and do what makes me happy.\u00a0",
  "Art for Earth is an event created with the purpose to raise awareness of the world's ever-growing environmental issues, we bring the creative community into the mix by allowing them to have full control over how the show goes.\u00a0 The idea of living a more sustainable life excites each and every one of our guests and models and we provide an intimate and safe environment for people to come to learn why these issues deserve our time and attention. A successful event for us is one where if we touch or change even one person's mind we have done our job, we give guests plants to take home with them and encourage them to plant them in the ground to help alter the world's carbon footprint. I absolutely love what we stand for, we are currently being fully \u00a0funded out of my daily finances, I feel our volunteers deserve these events to be the best we can possibly make them and I would love to do more for our community.",
  "This is my first project on Kickstarter, and I believe it will provide me with everything I might need. I've been dreaming of creating paintings as a real artist, and I think this will be my chance. The paintings I will make will be showing scenes in an array of colours and shapes from soothing and calming to mysterious and dangerous. I've been reading books since I was 14, and my imagination is bursting with all the beautiful things I have read, and I want to bring it to life, there're just so many possibilities. If only I had real supplies in hopes of creating stunning views, I can finally do what I've always wanted. Thank you.",
  "Casa X\u00e1tiva is my very first home and art studio. Finding it was a major breakthrough for me. Since January, I\u2019ve had the time and place to jump into a series of pieces unlike anytime before. My living expenses now are LESS than any other apartment or studio I've ever had.\u00a0But Casa X\u00e1tiva is a big place, and any dream that begins and ends with oneself is not big enough. So my plan for Casa X\u00e1tiva has grown from a means of achieving my own life goals to a means of helping other artists struggling with the same challenges. I want to make Casa X\u00e1tiva a haven where fully engaged artists anywhere in the world can come to fully develop their ideas all on a minimal budget. \u201cThe major problem of life is learning how to handle the costly interruptions. The door that slams shut, the plan that got sidetracked, or that lovely poem that didn't get written because someone knocked on the door.\u201d\u00a0\u2015 Martin Luther King Jr. I've been an artist as long as I can remember. What I can't remember is ever having a period in my life when I could work single-mindedly toward my artistic goals without the persistently encroaching financial and social disruptions of the \"real world.\u201d Moving from city to city, I also found that studio space was difficult to find either because the costs were too prohibitive or my profile didn't fit the criteria of any art committee or residency program. And given the pragmatics of keeping a job and meeting various obligations, simply taking a few weeks off to attend an overpriced studio workshop abroad proved not so simple. The idea of buying a place that could serve as home and studio might have seemed an obvious first plan. And it might have been, had I lived and worked in an area where the real estate was affordable and banks were accommodating. However, something else gnawed at me: Could I invest the next 20 years of my life in a place that didn\u2019t inspire me? So why not just give up the dream of being a consistently productive artist? Because I couldn't. In the end, persistence being my one advantage, a less than welcoming artist's community, a downturn in the economy, and my unwillingness to settle all turned out to be good things.\n\ufffc\u00a0 Vincent Van Gogh had plans for a refuge from the noise and distraction of Paris. He settled on a yellow house in the South of France where he envisioned friends could gather to share ideas and pursue artistic goals. It was a dream he could not have accomplished without the unfailing support of his brother Theo, and It allowed him the time to devote himself entirely to art. Finding my own \u201cStudio of the South\" in Spain was a major breakthrough for me. Less than an hour south of Valencia, the town of X\u00e1tiva is the perfect setting. Watched over by two mountain-top castles, it is beautifully replete with gardens, fountains, and cafes. See for yourself and catch a glimpse of the house in\u00a0this video. \ufffc \ufffc\u00a0 Since January, I\u2019ve had the time and place to jump into a series of pieces unlike anytime before. And despite Casa X\u00e1tiva being as large as it is, my living expenses now are LESS than any other apartment or studio I've ever had.\u00a0But no matter where you live, any dream that begins and ends with yourself is probably not big enough. So my idea of Casa X\u00e1tiva is transforming from a means of achieving my own life goals to a means of helping other artists struggling with the same challenges.\nMy goal with Casa X\u00e1tiva is to create a haven where fully engaged artists anywhere in the world can come to and fully develop their ideas all on a minimal budget. I\u2019ve already done some of the heavy lifting in setting up the house. Practically everything a painter will need to begin \u2013 paints, brushes, drawing media, substrates, large and small easels \u2013 is ready to go. Furnishings are on the way and I plan to do some cosmetic repairs to the front of the house. However, the money we raise in this Kickstarter campaign will go towards outfitting the printing studio with the following: \u2022 A Screenprinting Exposure Unit Table with vacuum \u2022 A\u00a033\" to 39\" Wide Etching Press\u00a0Floor Model In a future campaign, I hope to expand our resource kit to include woodworking equipment, clay-building tools, and a kiln! ...The same thing that's in it for you. Whether you\u2019re purchasing my art, visiting for a few days, or planning a long-term artist\u2019s residency, you'll be contributing to making Casa X\u00e1tiva a place for creativity with an array of creative equipment. It will become an accessible and very affordable place that continually challenges me and everyone who enters it\u2019s doors with an ongoing exchange of new perspectives and approaches to making art. And finally, I hope Casa X\u00e1tiva will help forge a global network of artists we all can rely on.

  "I wanted to give back to awesome Kickstarter community that rewards creativity and innovation! What better way to celebrate the community than with the portraits of those who donate! If successfully funded those who donate will have their portrait painted and featured in a book titled \"The Faces of Kickstarter\". Thank you for your support! $25,000 - If the project becomes successfully funded to this level I will exhibit the portraits in an art gallery in Manhattan.\u00a0",
  "BevShots are photographs of crystallized alcoholic beverages viewed through a polarized light microscope. \u00a0The resulting images, which are presented unaltered, offer complex and colorful topology unique to each drink. \u00a0A challenge in producing a BevShot is crystallization of the drink, which requires a series of laboratory experiments. \u00a0Once complete, the images can be featured across collections of contemporary art, fashion items, and bar ware. For this project we intend to produce new BevShots from a number of beers originating from craft / micro breweries. \u00a0BevShots\u00a0were historically made from popular brands of beer, liquor, and wine, as well as for various cocktails and mixers. \u00a0It will be very interesting to see what the best craft / micro brews look like under the microscope. \u00a0Backers will receive prints or other products as rewards. \u00a0Proprietors of craft / micro breweries can have custom BevShots produced from their top brews for use in advertising, labels, tap house art, etc., to promote their brand.

Romer As a visual artist and photographer, I first began to create these images in the 1990's. It took years to perfect the technique, but once I did, the results surprised me! I had never seen images like these before - all from the natural spectrum. I found the process and the photos themselves mesmerizing, almost meditative, and discovered the finished pieces come to life in the sunlight. When I shared the work with others, or after gallery shows, I noticed \u00a0audiences had the same response. I began to show my work more, not only in galleries, but with dementia patients at a health care facility near my home. The patients were mesmerized and suddenly joyful - they were smiling!  \nAfter the tragic loss of my son, among a community of grieving families, I saw the response over and over, with anyone who might be able to use a little sunlight in their life. The images are entirely real, but open us up to the ethereal and magic that is right here in front of us. Something not always easy to see. I am looking for funding to create these works, not only to build my own business, but also to distribute healing art to people who might not always have access. I'm eager to collaborate with the Funeral Directors Association of America to reach more people, as I, as well as family and friends, have found peace burying loved ones with sunlight. I am also developing an app which would give anyone with a phone in their hand access to these beautiful images of light. Once I reach my Kickstarter goal I will be able to purchase materials to produce my work on a larger scale, and also have the funding for marketing. I will then begin the process of both selling the works to a wider audience, and donating the art to those who could use a little sunlight, in hospitals and hospice. As works of ART my images are simply inspiring, moderately priced, and can be printed any size to hang anywhere! Printed on Kodak Endura Metallic paper guaranteed for hundreds of years. A very special thanks to;\u00a0 \"Wonder Woman\" Cole Kazdin for her help in putting this project together. Music, \"For Joe\" created and performed by award winning, singer/songwriter Graham Nash, a true friend. My wife Rita and daughter Amanda for all their encouragement. The memory of our son Joe Jr. for starting me off. The Kickstarter team for this opportunity. The very special team at CYBERSHORE.com for the cyber boost and support they gave me.

  "Don DeLillo\u2018s powerful post-9/11 novel Falling Man captures the first moments of the global tremor that has forever changed our emotional landscape, our memory, and our perception of the world. A man stumbles out of the falling rubble of the World Trade Center and witnesses the raw terror and absolute chaos of the shocking events of the fateful morning of September 11, 2001. The Center for Contemporary Opera will present the stage premiere of Kenneth Fuchs\u2019 Falling Man, based on a text adapted by J. D. McClatchy\u00a0from Don DeLillo's novel. Conceived and adapted for the stage by David Krane, the work is an operatic\u00a0monodrama scored for baritone voice accompanied by an ensemble of eight instrumentalists. The solo vocal role will be performed by baritone Jarrett Ott, recently named one of \u201c25 Rising Stars\u201d by Opera News. The production features videography by Justin West from photographs contributed by the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. The single performance, under the musical direction of David Krane, with stage direction by Eugenia Arsenis, will take place at 8:00 p.m. on April 29, 2016, at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway (at 95th Street), in New York City. \u201cKenneth Fuchs\u2019 Falling Man is a stunning work that truly encapsulates the ineffable experiences of that day. Fuchs\u2019 music supports but never overshadows baritone Roderick Williams. You can hear every gripping word of the sung narrative. The London Symphony\u2019s superb accompaniment is under the excellent direction of JoAnn Falletta. With Falling Man, Fuchs has written what for me is the defining musical memorial of 9/11. The music has the grace and strength needed for such a work.\u201d \u2014 Jeffrey Tarlo, Expedition Audio (September 2014) About the Center for Contemporary Opera\u00a0 The Center for Contemporary Opera was founded in 1982 by Richard Marshall and Robert Ward, and is the oldest company in the world devoted solely to contemporary opera. CCO represents artists from all along the spectrum, from America\u2019s most well-known composers, to emerging artists, to composers from historically underrepresented groups.\n\u201cNo company, large or small has a better track record of service to American opera\u201d \u2014 The New York Times  How will my gift be used?  Is it tax-deductible?\u00a0 Your tax-deductible contribution will be securely processed by Kickstarter and transferred to an account for the Center for Contemporary Opera. All contributions will be used to fund expenses for creating the production videography and hiring the eight musical instrumentalists. The Center for Contemporary Opera is an IRS recognized 501(c)3 non-profit organization. All donations are tax-deductible, minus the value of any rewards you receive. If this project meets its financial goal during the prescribed funding period, you will receive a letter acknowledging your donation once the Center for Contemporary Opera has received all funds. How Kickstarter Works\u00a0 \u00a0For the next 21 days, you, your family, and friends can make pledges to help support this project, ranging from $25 to whatever you can afford. For your pledge, you can select one of the reward packages listed at the right. Your credit card or other account will not actually be charged at the time you make your pledge, and you can change your mind right up to the final deadline. If the final deadline comes and we've reached our goal, then everyone gets charged the amount they pledged, and we begin putting together all those rewards for you (along with producing our show, of course). But if for some reason we don't meet our goal, then the whole thing is called off. No one gets charged, no fees are applied, everyone just keeps their money. Of course, if we fail to meet the goal, then no one gets any rewards either, and some of those rewards are pretty cool, don\u2019t you think?",

  "As promised to our existing backers and supporters, Truesicilian Blackbee is back for a new and exciting season. And this new season we have even bigger hopes to present the unique Sicilian black bee (apis mellifera sicula) to a much wider audience, and of course, to introduce our incredible naturally obtained honey, from these fantastic bees, to these unaware or just unlucky folks, who haven\u2019t yet discovered it. Hoping to bring more admirers to this fantastic honey, while contributing to increase the Sicilian black bee population, and ultimately, bring more awareness to the vital importance of all bees and their varieties. Most of the worldwide beekeepers, nowadays basically use the same 4 or 5 bee's strains, with the Apis Ligustica or the Carsica as the main two used all over the world. That's why, helping local and endemic strains, as the Sicilian black bee, will instead contribute to maintain different varieties and species. It is extremely helpful for the natural ecosystems and all of nature in general, in order to ensure life for us, our planet and our future generations. No one was expecting a 2020 so dramatic and frighten, since its very beginning has taken all the globe to a dreadful conditions, both healthy and economically. Many countries are still struggling with this new and scary epidemic, some have been target deeply, such as a beautiful country named Italy, our country. Italy is still fiercely fighting against the Covid-19, with a very unfortunate statistics, but the country never stopped to fight back! This pandemy has reduced our activity drastically, making basically impossible to operate our passion as before, and the conseguent economic crisis has taking a toll on us. but with the help of our amazing bees and your support we're sure to bounce back, and gain back what has been our dearly passion since 2014. This round we need you more than ever! This time not only for preserve one of the most unique bee in our planet, but also to provide us with the strenght to carry our job in this difficult time, and stay alive for other seasons to come. Hopefully with your support, we will be here for many more years. Thank you, stay safe and bless you! Everything has begun with a passion for beekeeping and bees\u2026 We started to produce our raw honey, just for our family and friends a few years ago. Family and friends have often gifted, offered and left honey to other people to taste and we got many compliments and appreciations for our honey, coming from people we'd never met before. Soon people started to ask where to they could find and how to obtain this honey for themselves. This ignited the idea of producing our honey for a wider elite audience, and to share this amazing product with other lucky honey lovers around the globe. However, we are still very small and keen to remain like this, we cannot and certainly don\u2019t want to compete with market giants or industrialized productions. We think a good product comes from passion, dedication and little production. Our Honey is always produced in favour of quality, instead of quantity. We put lots of passion in what we do and take great pride in our final product, which is strictly Limited Edition and only available directly from us. We are passionate and totally committed to our bees, our main purpose is to make them happy and healthy, and to give them the best conditions to produce their magic, in order to give us the best and sweetest food that nature has ever created. As Sicilians, we are lucky enough to be in one of the most beautiful island of the Mediterranean, with wonderful climate conditions and large biodiversity. Sicily is in fact the first region in Italy for organic farming and products, and the only one with an endemic bee species. We carefully choose the places, always trying to find a perfect spot inside national parks or untouched natural reserves around Sicily. Thanks to its several Natural Parks (Sicily has five National Parks and seventy two Regional Protected Reserves), it is a perfect place for a nomad apiculture. We choose meticulously the best environments for our bees, always looking to improve our honey varieties, specializing in the production of mono floral and single blossom honey, extracting basically very different honey varieties, often with different and distinctive flavours, with specific and unique properties depending on their floral origin. All of our bees are Apis Mellifera Sicula, also known as Sicilian Black Bee. Uniquely endemic of the island, they are smaller and darker than common honeybees, and are very renowned for being really docile and easy to handle, they definitely produce less honey compared to other domesticated honeybees, but their honey keeps the same levels of vitamins in smaller quantities, making their honey one of the richest ever, as several studies have proved. These little fellas were almost disappeared from Sicily and therefore from the entire earth, until Mr. Amodeo, a famous beekeeper from Palermo, started to take interest and created awareness for this amazing ancient bee strain. Thanks to his incredible job and dedication, the Sicilian Black Bee, has been slowly recovered from extinction and reintroduced among Sicilian beekeepers, with several of them certified as Slow Food Presidium. Today the Sicilian Black Bee is much more known, capturing lots of interests and attention, and its honey particularly admired and appreciated. Pure raw honey, it is as simple as it sounds. Following a natural way to source honey, with ancient and very respectful methods, without additives or external interventions, making nature our only ingredient. Our final product is therefore entirely natural, cold-extracted and never pasteurised, in order to keep intact all its properties and characteristics. We work hard to ensure the best conditions for our bees, in order to produce the best honey, the result is a formidable product, unique and extremely singular of its kind. As a matter of a fact, you will never find elsewhere, a honey with similar characteristics or the same intense flavour. Also, you will never find our honey on shops or markets shelves, but only directly from us. Our honey varieties include Orange blossom, Lemon blossom, Eucalyptus, Sulla flower, Chestnut, Thyme, Prickly Pear, wild Thistle, Sicilian mountain flowers and other unique flavours. This season we also have available our two Super Honey! Both made by simple adding some natural ingredients to our raw honey. The results are two amazing honey with incredible superpowers! A Balsamic one, with raw eucalyptus honey and natural essential oils as Menthol, Thyme and Eucalyptol, and an Energy one, with orange blossom raw honey, royal jelly and ginseng. The first, is the perfect natural remedy to fight winter ailments, cough and flu, and the second is able to fight fatigue and boost your energy. We love bees, and we love honey. Bees are good for nature and honey is just GOOD\u2026 Nothing pleases us more than to be able to keep on doing what we do, the way we do it. That is why we don't have big plans or big expectations. As on our previous campaigns this season's goal will help us cover all expenses, repay our work and resources, and give us the chance to continue our honey production for another season on coming. More important, it will also help us keep our Sicilian Black Bee's safeguard project alive and active, with the remaining funds totally reinvested in more hives and black bees! Looking back at our previous honey seasons, we noticed that folks backed our project mostly just to grab our unique honey, so we decided to cut any gadgets, and send just our honey, which probably will come in five or six different varieties, depending on season\u2019s harvest conditions and results. Every new season we push things a little bit further, looking for new varieties to add and new honey to produce, therefore if the season goes well, we may have inedited varieties as well to offer among the rewards. The varieties available will only be determined at the end of the honey season, if season goes well, backers may be then invite to select preferred varieties for their rewards. The rewards are twelve in total, ten out of them will involve our honey, with two different size of jars available, depending on the pledge, the standard 250gr and the 500gr. Any rewards sent, will be complete of Brochure, Honey varieties leaflet and a sticker. Three rewards include also the two new Special Honeys. Special Honeys: We all know the amazing benefits of raw honey... Packed with goodies such as enzymes, phytochemicals, nutrients and vitamins. Moreover, raw honey has a high potassium, iron, calcium, magnesium, protein, and vitamin C content. It is also a strong antibacterial and an effective immunity builder. To these already amazing qualities, we\u2019ve just added some special natural ingredients to increase benefits, in order to create an incredibly powerful and curative honey. #1. True Sicilian ENERGY Honey: Ingredients: 90% BlackBee Orange Blossom Honey, 5% Royal Jelly, 5% Ginseng Strong remedy against stress and fatigue.

  "\u00a0Kickstarter\nProject: \u00a0 \u00a0B&W Photography - Modern Landscapes My traditional photography project is centered on our\npresent day environment with the embedded human imprint on the far\nreaching landscape of the American West Coast. In my work, I am fascinated by\nthe remaining natural beauty and as well the man-made traces upon the natural\nworld, even our \"monuments\" of concrete and iron, as I am\nexploring our land in its modern day condition. \u00a0 This campaign hopefully will provide the opportunity to finance the production expenses of a larger body of work with 2-3 dozen pieces, to create a full size gallery show with a full body of work in oversize fine art print work. After 4 years sketching and creating the key pieces for the\nproject, it is time to take the final step to fully realize this art project\nand for that purpose I am seeking your support.  The project combines traditional and high resolution photography\nwork to create an art show and gallery project in over size fine art print work\n- the final framed pieces will be in sizes up to 40x80\" single\nimages, diptychs and an occasional triptych up to 40x150\", created purely from\noptical files without the need for post production interpolation or\nmanipulation - the print work is in most cases the actual size of my digital image files, in a\nlarger sense and technical essence a digital negative \"contact\" print. My photography work process relies on classic lenses and\noutstanding lens characteristics for oversize, \"large format\" type, captures for extreme details and rich tonalities suited for large format print\nwork, pushing the boundaries of traditional photography in conjunction with\nmodern digital archival pigment print work. The subtle characteristics of finer\nlenses define these images in great detail, to bring out unique print formats\nand large photographic displays in a workflow exceeding the resolution of any\nstandard capture process. My work flow consists of traditional photography with the images created in camera, at exposure with superb lenses while using sensor technology to create 1 - 2 GB image files for the purpose of very large size print work and the ability to work without digital enlargement processes, I rather like to have very large optical files and downsize the images for added quality definitions. I do use the digital lab in the same fashion as I did work in the darkroom. The images are created at exposure and realized in the modern print process. One might describe my general work style as a result of some\ndistant roots around the West Coast School of Photography together with a\nstrong element of the recent European Photography philosophy on large format print work, the stand alone large wall display,\nhighlighting subtle objectivity through a raised visual experience, while\npushing the envelope of the photographic art display. Still - personally, I am always eager to experiment, to\nredefine my work process anew frequently and push tools to their inbuilt limits,\nto match my tool set for the desired output ......and not to forget,... there is\na bit of playfulness left in this old photographer.\u00a0 I am working with a broad\nspectrum of techniques, while combining a lifetime of experience in the film\nbased area combined with the newer digital possibilities - a combination I am\nfortunate enough to have at my disposal at the recent convergence of\nphotographic systems, techniques and styles. There\nare a few fortunate photographers around with one foot planted firmly in the\nfilm era and another in the newer digital tool set, creating work that is deeply\nrooted in traditional photography brought into a new light with the modern,\npost dark room, print tools. Far Northern California and Southern Oregon are one of the\nfew geographical areas left today, in which the natural and man made world are\nat an uneasy equilibrium, largely due to the remoteness of our area and the sheer\nvastness of the mountain and desert areas. My work is all about the visual\nbeauty one can find in the oddest places, within the combustion of visual art\nand mundane human efforts. I do wander a bit in a Carleton Watkins' type of\nwonder, another re-discovery of the Western World - a photographer in search of\nroad side impressions, a curious eye roving along the jagged edges of Western\nCivilization and the modern human condition. \u00a0One of my latest works for the project, a color work, \"Edgewood\nand Slough\" has just been selected as part of the West Coast Biennial 2015\nat Turtle Bay Museum in Redding ( wall display size of ~ 40x150\" diptych ),\nsetting a perfect jump off point to take this project up to the next level and\npursue the work as a priority with your support, after a 5 year gestation and\nstudy phase. The Kickstarter project's primary effort is to finance\nthe necessary time, travel, print and frame production and some gear expenses with\na production timeline for the end of 2015. A secondary goal is to produce a\nlarger body of framed art work for larger gallery show effort to find presentation in larger art centers, like San Francisco, Portland, LA and other places in\n2015 and 2016. The work will result in 30 to 40 larger fine art prints,\nincluding large size diptych and triptych work at about 40 by 80\" to 40 x150\"\ndisplay sizes. The work will be centered around the greater Mount Shasta area,\nthe lands of the Southern Oregon and far Northern California area, the unique\nheart of the American West Coast Region.

The Kickstarter campaign is aimed to afford the actual production work and to take a big step forward in my art work, reach new gallery representation for this particular project in oversize print work and to gain some art market attention for my photography work for the future. Fund Raiser Goal and Budget: Production: covering\ncar and travel expenses for the photography work in the greater area around\nMount Shasta, Northern California and Southern Oregon. ( Budget of $ 3300 ) Hardware: hard\ndrives for mobile capture storage, flash card media and some tools for the\nmobile capture of 1 to 2 GB files, which require massive storage capacities, a\nfew lens accessories and a rental camera body to round out my tools set for\noversize image capture work. ( Budget of $ 1200 ) Post Production: Print\ncost (ink and paper media cost) for the production of various large size print\nwork with some 40x120\" oversize fine art displays for the project. Framing\ncost, general cost to ready a larger gallery show project at material cost - while\nutilizing my workplace Studio Liink as the print and post-production studio. (\nBudget of $ 4500 ) Kickstarter Funding\nTarget: $ 9,000 Here is a glimpse on the two fine art\u00a0prints\u00a0offered as rewards, see\u00a0more at heinzdanzberger.com.\u00a0 Both pieces are initial studies to the project while fine tuning my technique. Eichen is am amazing rendition with a Pentax 6x7 lens and Eclipse is an initial study for tonality and resolution involved in my work ( comprised of over 70 frames with the fine Pentax 200mm tele in play). The soft light at the peak of the\u00a0eclipse\u00a0made this piece a very well collected piece about Mount\u00a0Shasta. These two motives are rewards as a fine art poster print, without signature, or a signed and dated collector's fine art print. Thanks for taking the time to consider my project, you can reach me through heinzdanzberger.com for any continued exploration of the project per email. Thank you Daniel for helping me with my first attempt at video work, virgin territory and I hope the viewer can appreciate the wooden effort.",

  "Hello, we are Farrago, an eclectic cohort of 60 practitioners from Falmouth University's BA Photography programme. With each practitioner having developed a unique style, our practice pushes the boundaries of the photographic image to new and exciting measures, often outside traditional photographic categories.  This June we are putting on our degree show in London. We have secured the location and set the dates but now we are seeking your help. The money we raise will be used for the transportation of our work, the promotion of the show, the production of our printed catalogue, as well as all the little things in between.  With your money, we can put on a professional exhibition right in the heart of London's creative hub. A show of this scale will let us share our work with industry professionals and many of you, giving our work the footfall and exposure it needs.  To say thank you for your donations, we have created a selection of packages for you. These range from postcards from our exhibitors, to limited edition prints and even a copy of the printed catalogue you will be helping us to fund!  For more information on the show and to see our exhibitors and some of their work, click here: http://bit.ly/18oMNJZ. Exhibition dates: 18-22 June 2015, The Old Truman Brewery, 91 Brick Lane, London, E1 6QL.

  "Welcome to our Kickstarter Page! Here you\u2019ll find further reading about the project, sketches and images of work in that\u2019s in process, as well as what\u2019s to come. You'll also find images and information about the exciting and unique offerings we have as an incentive to support our work. Oh, and there's also a section of FAQ\u2019s that dig deeper into the project\u2026. everything from the budget, to the story behind the title and even the reason for some nudity. No donation is too small, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us by clicking the blue \u201cContact me\u201d link to the right.\u00a0 To learn more about us and our work, please click the \u201cSee Full Bio\u201d link to the right, or visit www.BarbozaGubo-Mroczek.com where you can see more of our collaborative work in Peru including the Los Chicos series.\u00a0 Without further ado... The series Virgenes de la Puerta focuses on the transgender women of Lima, who continue to be cast aside by the political and religious administrations. They are often denied employment, assistance from government programs, and not given any state or government-issued forms of identification; in essence, they are being marginalized and erased. We honor the diversity of the Peruvian culture by re-incorporating transgender women into the cultural landscape and history of Peru. In direct contrast to their oppressor\u2019s intentions, the work celebrates the contributions made by transgender people and presents them as iconic figures within the context of their native land. These photographs pay homage to the resilience and beauty of these women in an effort to strengthen, empower, and embed a sense of pride within the current and future generations of Peru\u2019s LGBTQ community.\u00a0 Whether a portrait or tableau, each image is created by first constructing costumes, sculptural headpieces, and props to adorn and embellish each one of the women. The objects are all designed and fabricated in a collaboration between Barboza-Gubo & Mroczek and the local artisans of Peru who specialize in regional crafts and textiles. Each photograph utilizes culturally relevant references unique to Peru in an effort to embed the women into the culture of their homeland.\u00a0 Below you'll see our in-process image of Gaby, a respected trans activist in Lima. It's inspired by the patron saint Santa Rosa of Lima who was rumored to have worn a heavy silver crown with spikes hidden in its interior, emulating Christ\u2019s crown of thorns. Our Santa Rosa dons a crown of thorns sculpted by Juan Jose Barboza-Gubo and finished with silver leaf that was mined in Peru. Its elongated design, which stretches above and past her shoulders, and represents the shared persecution of the people in her community. Once the image is printed at the appropriate scale and installed on gallery walls, it will be positioned at the height of the average adult so as viewers enter the space they will see, from a distance, other visitors standing beneath the crown with her\u2026 because when we persecute others, we also persecute ourselves.\u00a0\n\n This is a digital proof of the image we made for the purpose of this Kickstarter page. The image will be scanned from the negative and refined in post-production, but we wanted to give you a peek!: The women are photographed with an 8x10 view-camera using color negative film in order to maximize the ability to print the images in oversized scales of up to 6-feet wide. The large negative ensures that the image will retain its integrity when printed in larger scales\u2026. and we want the women in the photographs to be printed close to their natural size. When photographing we utilize many locations throughout the city of Lima. We look for destinations off the beaten path that represent the country, the city, and its people. Each location is thoroughly researched and we often rent additional props and antiques from local dealers to complete a scene. It's truly a multi-layered production, and we do all the work ourselves without any assistants.\u00a0 Once finished, the work will be displayed in galleries and LGBTQ community centers in Lima and, hopefully, in the US. We want to promote a dialog about acceptance, about respect, and about survival.\u00a0 We hope this gives you an idea of our work and our mission. The section of FAQ's gives a thorough budget breakdown, as well as a section about the title and some important acknowledgements and thank-you's to the many people who have helped make the start of this possible. We're hoping to add your names to the list of those who can help us finish. TEXTO EN ESPANOL: V\u00edrgenes de la Puerta: Fotograf\u00edas por Juan Jos\u00e9 Barboza-Gubo y Andrew Mroczek\u00a0 La serie \"V\u00edrgenes de la Puerta\" se centra en las mujeres transg\u00e9nero de Lima, que contin\u00faan siendo dejadas de lado por las administraciones pol\u00edticas y religiosas. Casi siempre se les niega el empleo, la asistencia de los programas del gobierno, y no se les da ninguna forma de identificaci\u00f3n emitida por el gobierno; en esencia, est\u00e1n siendo marginadas y borradas del sistema.\u00a0 Honramos la diversidad de la cultura peruana, re-incorporando a las mujeres trang\u00e9nero en el paisaje cultural y la historia del Per\u00fa. En contraste directo con las intenciones de sus opresores, la obra celebra las contribuciones de las personas transg\u00e9nero y las presenta como figuras ic\u00f3nicas en el contexto de su tierra natal. Estas fotograf\u00edas son un homenaje a la resistencia y la belleza de estas mujeres en un esfuerzo por fortalecer, capacitar e incorporar un sentido de orgullo dentro de las generaciones actuales y futuras de la comunidad LGTB del Per\u00fa.\u00a0 Ya sea un retrato o una escena, cada imagen es creada primero construyendo trajes, tocados escult\u00f3ricos y accesorios para adornar y embellecer cada una de las mujeres. Los objetos dise\u00f1ados y fabricados son una colaboraci\u00f3n entre Barboza-Gubo, Mroczek y los artesanos locales del Per\u00fa que se especializan en artesan\u00edas y textiler\u00eda de la regi\u00f3n. Cada fotograf\u00eda utiliza referencias de relevancia cultural \u00fanica en el Per\u00fa, con el af\u00e1n de integrar a las mujeres en la cultura de su tierra natal.\u00a0 Las mujeres son fotografiadas con una c\u00e1mara 8x10; utilizando una pel\u00edcula negativa de color con el fin de maximizar la capacidad de imprimir las im\u00e1genes en escalas de gran tama\u00f1o, hasta 180 cm de ancho. El gran negativo asegura que la imagen mantenga su integridad cuando se imprime en escalas mayores. El prop\u00f3sito es que las mujeres se impriman cerca de su tama\u00f1o natural.\u00a0 Al fotografiar, utilizamos muchos lugares de la ciudad de Lima. Buscamos destinos fuera del circuito tur\u00edstico, que representen el pa\u00eds, la ciudad y su gente. Cada lugar es investigado a fondo y a menudo alquilamos adicionalmente objetos y antig\u00fcedades peruanas en los distribuidores locales para completar las escenas. Es realmente una producci\u00f3n de muchas capas, y todo el trabajo lo hacemos nosotros mismos sin ayudantes.\u00a0 Una vez finalizado, el trabajo ser\u00e1 mostrado en galer\u00edas de arte y centros de la comunidad LGBTQ en Lima y en los EE.UU. Queremos promover un di\u00e1logo sobre la aceptaci\u00f3n, el respeto, y sobre la supervivencia. \u00a0Esperamos que este texto les de una idea de nuestro trabajo y de nuestra misi\u00f3n. La secci\u00f3n de preguntas frecuentes les dar\u00e1 un desglose exhaustivo del presupuesto, as\u00ed como una secci\u00f3n sobre el t\u00edtulo y algunos importantes reconocimientos y agradecimiento a personas que han ayudado a que el inicio de este proyecto sea posible. Esperamos a\u00f1adir sus nombre a la lista de los que nos ayudar\u00e1n a terminar este proyecto.\n",
  "Hello, My name is Austin Speer, and I am a photographer based out of Grand Blanc Michigan. \u00a0Photography has always been something I admired and enjoyed, yet never put photography to use in my personal life. \u00a0That changed only about a \u00a0year ago. I began my photographic journey, as mentioned, about a year ago. \u00a0It all began when I received a GoPro for christmas in 2013. \u00a0Photography was suggested to me by a very good friend of mine to help aid my videography skills. \u00a0Not long after the purchase of my first DSLR camera, photography stuck with me. What kind of photography do I do you may ask? \u00a0Well, quite frankly, any photography I will tackle. \u00a0But what I have done was narrow my main focus to three categories. \u00a0They are: \u00a0Automotive, Landscape, and City photography. Anybody can take a photo of a car, a mountain view, or a cityscape. \u00a0But what I have done was work on bringing it a step further. \u00a0I decided to take photos and display only the best cars in the world, the best landscapes that I have been able to capture, and interesting city photos that I have been privileged to take when the time has risen. What I really want to do with photography is work in the automotive industry and taking photos for magazines, manufacturers, and various publications. \u00a0If I had to choose three car manufacturers to work with, they would be: 1) Ferrari 2) Audi 3) Bentley I am not asking you to donate your life savings to my fund, but if you do that is greatly appreciated. \u00a0I am working on expanding my photographic portfolio to attract as many people as possible. \u00a0Every dollar helps greatly. \u00a0 Below are some photographic experiences I have done so far. \u00a0With this being only a year into my photographic journey, just imagine what is in store for me next week, next month, next year, and so on. \u00a0",
  "Have you ever done something and then you discover that you never want to stop? That is how I feel every time I pick up my camera. When I take photos the world around me changes, it is no longer this place that is full of ciaos and destruction, it is now a place full of beauty and amazement! What I am looking at using Kick Starter for is to buy the supplies that will help me succeed as a young artist. I want to be able to sell my work, but I would like to do so much more than that. I want to be able to be in a career that I Enjoy to do. Photography is one of few careers that I know I am able to feel this way about. People always say to follow your dreams, but how are we suppose to do that in such a harsh world. This is where you come in. For that dream that you may not have gotten to do. You could help mine come true! I am not looking for a lot right now. Just some simple things like\u00a0a light reflector, tripod, and maybe a new flash. If I have enough to get more I will be buying advertisements so people can know I am here. You may be able to change my life, YOU have that power! Even if you are not able to donate, let me know your story, or give me some advice. I would love to hear it! Thank You \u00a0for any and everything you can give! P.S I do have a website full of pictures I have taken. It is LuHendrixPhotography.weebly.com !",

  "The City of San Joaquin is California's poorest incorporated city.

Now we are using a commercial kitchen, a culturally authentic recipe, hard work, and local ingredients, to make a salsa that will transform your meals and our community.",
  "What started as a weekly event in a dusty bar to feed friends has grown into a sustainable business. \u00a0 Pietrzyk Pierogi has for a long time been a Pop-Up food service where we go into other businesses and set up our kitchen and sell pierogi to masses. \u00a0After being a rouge kitchen for two years, we have found a place that we can call home inside of Gratiot Central Market in Detroit.\u00a0 We have been a business focused on creating nutrient dense foods while also caring for the people who make them. \u00a0In today's cut throat world of culinary, we aim to provide long term employment for anyone who is willing to learn new skills. \u00a0Our end goal is to have a production facility where we can work with local non profits to fill the employment gaps in Detroit and give jobs to those who are in need.\u00a0 Our store front is our first step in that direction and we need your help. \u00a0We are a self funded company and have had many small testing moments in this process. \u00a0We believe in solutions not problems and that strife builds character and boy o boy do we have a lot of character.\u00a0 This Kickstarter will help raise the funds needed for the finishing touches of the store. \u00a0We need a few equipment items(mixers, display freezers, prep tables), some signs for outside of our store so you can find us, packaging equipment, and some electrical work to get us up and going.\u00a0 We've had some repairs that pushed us over our initial budget for opening and just need a little help from our friends. \u00a0We wouldn't want anything for free so we want to return your support with some great gifts coming from the new location and most of all, PIEROGI!\u00a0 With your support and donations our dreams of Pierogi can come alive!\u00a0",
  "We have some new delicious, organic, sugar free, artisan chocolate rewards for people who might not be able to come to the concert but would like to support us.\u00a0We still have some hours left and every little bit we get over our target will help us move this project onwards & upwards!! More than an orchestra of some of the best musicians in the UK, the Beethoven Orchestra for Humanity is a new kind of concert experience\u00a0where we weave music and a provocative talk around a topical issue that all we're dealing with today.\u00a0 We're performing in intimate venues with limited seating in order that everyone can see, hear and feel inside the sound and to complete this we're inviting the audience to be completely free from any classical conventions that tell you where and when not to clap.\n It's a big melting pot where one element plays off another and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. For our opening event we're thrilled to announce that Francesca Martinez, comedian, activist and writer, is our guest speaker: She'll be speaking about climate change and social responsibility and we'll be playing music from Beethoven and other composers that relates - either on themes of nature (Beethoven's incredible Pastoral Symphony), society (G\u00f3recki Symphony of Sorrowful Songs Part 2) and humanity (Beethoven's Leonora and Villa-Lobos Bachianas Brasileiras).\u00a0 We're kickstarting for \u00a310,000 to launch a series of events starting with our first concert on\u00a0Monday, 8 February 2016! Our opening night\u00a0will give us the platform from which to build our future. Putting on each concert involves a unique venue, 40 musicians, guest speaker and much more, so on a straight profit sheet it's\u00a0totally uneconomical. We want to do more than bring the sheer power and beauty of classical orchestral music to a new audience. We've designed the Beethoven Orchestra for Humanity from the ground up to create a visceral, multi-layered experience that makes a meaningful impact for audience and musicians alike. This means conjuring up an environment where the music can speak most powerfully and directly to today's audiences. \"BOH does Climate Change\" A short talk by comedian, activist and writer\u00a0Francesca Martinez With music that relates from \nBeethoven, G\u00f3recki\u00a0and\u00a0Villa-Lobos\n Date: 8pm, Monday Feb 8, 2016Venue:\n Menier Chocolate Factory Studio, London Bridge\u00a0 Music in full:G\u00f3recki: Symphony of Sorrowful Songs / 2nd MovementVilla-Lobos: Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5 / AriaBeethoven: Symphony No. 6 'Pastoral',\u00a0Leonora Overture No. 3\u00a0 Beethoven Orchestra for HumanityLeader: Katie StillmanSoprano: April FredrickConductor: Michael Alexander Young It's all in the mix, but in particular three things:\u00a0 Music doesn\u2019t exist inside a vacuum. It lives inside the times in which we live. Often we use music to 'escape' our lives. Here we get right into it with a talk on an issue that we're all involved in and that sets the tone and context for the night. The music will live inside this.  We want the audience to be central to the experience. The music we'll be playing has soul, depth, power, beauty, shock, wit, brains, all of it. Except there are unspoken rules governing classical music concerts that tell you when and when not to respond, so we're throwing that out the window.  There's nothing like the immediacy of\u00a0being up-close to an orchestra of musicians playing their hearts out, bringing thrilling music to life, in the moment. Most concerts put the orchestra separate from the audience and the further back you are the less you see and hear. The less you see and hear, the less you feel. At the Beethoven Orchestra for Humanity we want the audience to experience everything. No falling asleep in the first half here! Beethoven literally transformed music, tore up the rule book in the process and made it reveal both who we are and who we can be; he was possibly the greatest humanitarian in all art. As Tom Service\u00a0put it so well, in any moment of Beethoven there\u2019s the sense that everything is possible. We like that. P.S. We won\u2019t only be playing Beethoven! A collective of like-minded musicians and entrepreneurs who believe that when the best classical music is played as it should be, with raw passion and total commitment, it hits the sweet spot of depth and accessibility and is truly life-changing stuff. It's for everybody and we want to get it out there.\nAnd at the same time, we think it can make the world a better place, especially when placed at the heart of the conversations that are shaping the times we live in.\u00a0 For the full team click here.",
  "5 years ago, the world of art and mainly street and pop art, took me by storm! My eyes lit up at the bold colors rising out of dilapidated urban landscapes. My brain awoke with the statements being made. Unfortunately, I lived in a small town in Missouri for 4.5 of those years and there was not much to see there. I had to live vicariously through documentaries on Netflix and google image searches. 5 months ago I moved to Los Angeles to further pursue my musical goals and dreams. While music is an amazing outlet for my creativity, I felt compelled to express myself visually in other ways. I have had runs ins with attempts painting before. I was successful at painting guitars for awhile, but only solid colors or with stripes. When it comes to drawing or painting anything in an actual artistic sense, it isn't pretty. Since I cannot create, I figured, why not document it and share with all my friends from other states that are not here to see it for themselves. I only had my cell phone, but figured it was good enough, so I grabbed my skateboard and started skating down every street in LA searching out as much art as I could find and photograph. A funny thing happened and some of my friends that are photographers started telling me that I had an eye for photography and that I needed to get a professional camera. That's cool and all, but I'm a musician, so i'm broke all the time. If I am a musician and a photographer, will that mean that I am somehow even more broke? Sometimes I have to climb a pipe and a fire escape ladder to get a good shot, sometimes I have to get over a bit of razor wire. I do whatever I can to get the best shot I can with the tools I have. I am taking this mindset to Kickstarter in an attempt to do all I can with what I have to get an actual camera and begin my newest creative venture properly. The camera I am after is a Fujifilm x100t. A photographer that used to take pictures of my band had one. It took amazing shots, was small and discreet, and just had an overall look that inspired me to want to wield it. One of these new runs $1200-1300. Any extra money raised from this campaign will go towards bags/cases, lenses and traveling to other cities to document the amazing art across this country and maybe even the world. Thank you all so much! My work can be viewed at: www.instagram.com/justineerf justineerf.tumblr.com",
  "I am raising the money in an effort to create paintings and other images that will create an interest and motivation for people to become more aware of their second amendment rights and the laws surrounding this right. \u00a0 If you are not aware this is your right to bare arms. While some in the U.S. population think that it's an outdated part of our constitutional rights; thinking there is no need for gun ownership; others say its one of the rights that make The United States of America Great. \u00a0One of the questions that I plan to paint about is the question of weather some laws regarding gun control make sense. \u00a0Some citizens of the United States want more laws and more controls. \u00a0There is much debate and confusion around this. \u00a0 Each State in the United States has different laws regarding certain aspects of gun ownership causing much confusion and court cases against people whom where unaware they were breaking the law. \u00a0This is especially true when transporting guns but is also confusing in other ways as some states require permits others do not and still other states don't require permits if the gun is just in the home.\u00a0 \u00a0I am not a legal expert my goal is simply to bring awareness to this subject. \u00a0I have family and friends whom own guns. \u00a0I feel no need; \u00a0however I respect the many sides of this debate. \u00a0I believe it's a right we should have for all citizens. \u00a0I imagine a day when the laws are simpler and more universal. As an artist I wish to paint or/and draw somewhere around six paintings about this subject. \u00a0I will then seek out a venue to show my artwork to a larger audience as a way to bring awareness to this subject. \u00a0I Plan to use some visual imagery and some use of the hand-written word in my art as an almost graffiti \u00a0as a way to make it meaninful and more personable. I know this is a hot button topic, \u00a0I just wish to create more intelligent peaceful debate as soon will be elections and laws are always being\u00a0 created.\u00a0 This project should take me around a month and a half to two months or so to create. The cost just for raw materials will be approx. 100.00 for canvas, paint, paper, etc. \u00a0My time for six paintings an estimated or approx. 160 hours. \u00a0That is about twenty hours per painting. \u00a0Then I will need time to find and create a venue to show my work.\u00a0",
  "I am a freelancing artist, I always wanted to start a business. I want to spread smile to everyone through my painting. I am here to offer high quality paintings at low prices! I have interacted with many people, who have a perception that getting a painting done is very costly. Many people also mentioned that they always wanted to gift someone a painting or wanted a real painting for their sweet home , but ended up buying a print instead because of the cost.  I want to change the perception. I am now offering high quality paintings with affordable price. You directly get the paintings from me.  If you were one among those who wanted to have a painting ,here is a chance to get one ! Send me a Photo, and I will paint it for you! I can paint anything, like Landscape,Portraits,Animals ... Any occasion nearby , I can also deliver according to your scheduled date. Make your dream come true! (I don't wish to paint nude pictures and violent pictures, I am afraid )",

  "The Kitty Hawk Flying Detective Agency is a series of mystery/adventure books for young adults (and adults too) featuring Kitty Hawk, an intrepid teenage pilot with her own De Havilland Beaver seaplane and a nose for mystery and intrigue - imagine a cross between Amelia Earhart and Nancy Drew.\n Following her amazing summer adventure in the first book of the series Kitty decides that she wants to fly around the world and in each book that follows she finds herself in various different exotic locations where her knack for solving mysteries and getting herself into (and out of) all kinds of precarious situations leads her to incredible places and experiences that she never could have imagined having.\n These books bring to life this amazing planet of ours.  Filled with highly Google-able locations and history they are perfect for firing the imaginations of armchair explorers and amateur detectives alike.  In total there will eventually be thirteen books in the series and with the first four of those books already released it's time for number five.  Continuing on her epic flight around the world Book #5 takes Kitty Hawk to the Eternal City of Rome where she meets up with an old friend and together they find themselves caught up in a bizarre mystery involving stolen paintings, secret rooms, strange voices and cryptic messages.\n Your support of this project will help bring this next book in the Kitty Hawk series to life by helping to cover the cost of: Check out the latest black and white draft sketch of the artwork for the cover of the book. Check out what different Amazon reviewers had to say about the previous books in the Kitty Hawk series: \"Adventurers and adventurers-at-heart, grab your gear and get ready, because Kitty Hawk and the Curse of the Yukon Gold is a must-read.\" \"[Kitty] is a lady who loves her airplane, adventure, she is brave, [with] an inner voice she rarely listen to (at least not always), a love for nature and history. In a way, she is kick ass, and I admire her ability to keep a cool head even when everything goes to hell in a handbasket around her. Yes, she does get scared at times, but with everything happening, I am awed that she acts the way she does. Awesome girl!!!\" \"Think Harriet the Spy only a million times cooler. Once you pick it up, you're not going to want to put it down so make sure you have the time to just sit and read... I can only hope the rest of the series is as great as this book!\" \"Kitty is a very self-assured eighteen-year-old girl... and I especially enjoyed how [her actions] showed that a normal girl can achieve almost anything...\" \"The best part of the book was the mystery. Despite the fact that this book was written with younger readers in mind, it kept me guessing until the very end.\" \"I loved this book. It is [everything] I wanted it to be, mystery, suspense and fun.\" \"I can't get enough of these fun adventures... Kitty has to be one of my favorite characters in fiction. There's definitely something real about her, as she seems more like a friend rather than someone I just happen to read about. She's clever, funny, and adventurous. Not to mention, she's an excellent pilot of a red and white seaplane. Although she does seem to get involved with a lot of trouble. It's okay, Kitty, it just makes your story more interesting.\" Also from author Iain Reading:",
  "Potato chips, pretzels, cheese puffs, popcorn-- who doesn't love a good snack? The only problem is, nearly all of the tastiest snacks are unhealthy. And when we turn to healthier snacks, most of the choices are bland and taste like cardboard (we're looking at you, kale chips!). We've worked for over two years to bring to life a snack without any tradeoffs. To do that, we had to throw out potatoes and tortillas and create a chip out of an entirely new base-- egg whites!\u00a0 With notes of salsa and spice, our signature flavor combines the eggcitement of gourmet huevos rancheros with the convenience of a bag of chips. With only 2 net carbs per bag, it fits right in to the Keto lifestyle. Did we mention it'll get you jacked, too? Each bag of Rancheros has 10 GRAMS of protein. And as if that all weren't good enough, this flavor has 6 grams of fiber. If you watch your macros, you need some Quevos Rancheros! Sour Cream & Onion, like all our flavors, is lactose free, but you would never know it! If you're looking for a delicious, creamy flavor with a hint of onion zest, this one's for you.\u00a0Sour Cream & Onion has the same stellar macros as Quevos Rancheros-- 10 grams of protein, 2 net carbs, and 6 grams of fiber.\u00a0 A NEW FLAVOR LAUNCHING RIGHT HERE ON KICKSTARTER! Fresh off the grill, this flavor provides the classic Barbeque chip experience. On the sweeter side but with a hint of smoke, this one on is a snack lovers dream! We pack in five grams of protein and five grams of fiber into every bag of Sweet Barbeque so you can indulge without any of the guilt of a conventional BBQ snack!\u00a0 This flavor is also a NEW INTRODUCTION to the Quevos family specially released for kickstarter! Cheddar has the same macros as Sweet Barbeque, but with a strong cheesy punch. If you like cheese, order these, please! Incredibly, despite the powerful flavor on this chip, Cheddar Quevos are lactose free. Most delicious snacks are cursed with one or more nutritional weaknesses. Often, they have artificial ingredients, high levels of sugar and unhealthy fats, and/or they're loaded with starch from sources like potatoes, corn, and white flour. On top of that, they're typically fried. And worst of all, most tasty snacks usually have deceivingly small serving sizes, making a quick snack into something close to a MEAL if we're not careful.\u00a0 Quevos were created as an answer to these nutritional problems. But we spent a painstaking amount of time making sure we didn't lose out on deliciousness as we crafted our product. After all, we wanted people to EAT our snack, not just think it was a cool idea! What we came up with is a revolution in the snack category. Quevos pack over twice as much protein and fiber into each serving than conventional snacks like potato and tortilla chips do. We get fats from superfood sources like avocado oil and chia seeds. Our chips are gluten free, lactose free, and soy free. Quevos don't have artificial ingredients, and they're not fried. And to put a cherry on top, each bag (one serving) is over 30 chips! Quevos leave you satisfied-- happy with a delicious snack and full and nourished from our incredible nutrient composition!\u00a0 Also Contains: Milk (ghee) Please note: Our facility also processes tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans.\u00a0 Zack, our co founder, is type 1 diabetic and frequently cooks egg whites as a low carb snack. His favorite part of any egg dish he makes are the crispy pieces left in the pan. In June 2016, he was eating some egg white crispies and couldn't help but think about how they crunched and cracked just like potato chips. He wondered, \"Is it possible to make a chip out of egg whites?\" He saw the potential for a higher protein, lower carb, and overall more nutritious snack. So he called Nick (his best friend since age 9!) over and they began formulating in Zack's kitchen.\u00a0 Things got serious when Nick took the idea for Quevos and our early prototypes to the New Venture Challenge at University of Chicago. Ben, David, Nick, and Zack spent 10 weeks in a rigorous business development course that taught us about customer discovery, market sizing, financial projections, and creating a business plan. At the end of the course, we pitched to a panel of 19 investors who judged us against the 9 other teams in the class. We won first place, taking home $15,000 from the Booth School of Business. For most of last year, our main focus was perfecting our product. We used our early seed funding to buy hundreds of ingredients, which we tried out in over a thousand different combinations. Plus, we experimented with different cooking processes at a pilot production lab we rented space in. To get feedback on each new version, we sampled with healthy snackers in gyms and health food shops around Chicago. Slowly, but surely, Quevos were improving. Feedback on Quevos had become very positive by the fall of 2018 and we knew we were ready to go. Zack and Nick were working long days during the summer, and it was clear that we wouldn't be able to commit to both Quevos and our education fully. So we dropped out of college to work on Quevos full time! We found a commercial kitchen space, began production, and launched our market test around Chicago stores and online. It was tremendous to finally have a product in a package on a shelf. Our idea had become a reality!\u00a0 The reception of Quevos has been phenomenal, so much so that we sold out of our entire inventory in March. Now we are scaling up to produce at higher volumes so we can get our snack out there to every healthy snacker in need of a better option! We can't do this alone, though. WE NEED YOUR HELP to fund our first large scale production run so that we can make thousands of bags to sell online and in natural food stores around the country!",
  "Hello!After a tour of the Western United States, I arrived in the Northwest with a lot of great music under my fingers, in very polished form. \u00a0So I splurged on a couple hours of studio time in one of the finest studios in the Seattle area.The program I was running in the summer of 2015 was an attractive mix of Classical and contemporary masterpieces. \u00a0I love how this set-list brought together fans of old music and fans of new music, allowing them to connect with their favorite genres in new contexts and also find beauty in the other half of the concert.I waited for a couple of months to listen to the recording, and when I did it floored me. \u00a0This is clearly my best work, lovingly recorded on a 9-foot Yamaha with exquisite microphones. \u00a0After listening through all the takes, it became clear that I needed to build it into an album soon. \u00a0\"Darkness and Light\" was born. \u00a0I began to assemble the team consisting of a mixing engineer, mastering engineer, photographer, and graphic designer. \u00a0I've chosen some of the very best in my current city, because I feel very strongly about this work and feel that it deserves the strongest presentation possible. \u00a0 Professional quality means paying professional wages. \u00a0The final touches on this album push me beyond my personal financial limits. \u00a0Thankfully, I have supportive community of friends and fans that will help me get there. \u00a0I'm deeply grateful for any support you can offer. \u00a0Every bit counts!\u00a0",
  "The above video is a introductory concept of what the film will appear like. The original music is by John Williams to go along with the beat, but we have our own soundtrack for this particular scene which we can't release at this time. We will be adding additional elements to the trailer, including actual scenes with the actors during the duration of the fundraiser as it progresses. So stay tuned \u00a0for more updates and enjoy! For more information about the project and additional clips to view, which includes some of the original soundtrack, please click on the video icon below. Written & Directed by Allen Driscoll Short Synopsis: Asarum After a seismic event event off the coast of Florida deep below the surface, a couple unknowingly discover something extraordinary in a subterranean cavern that defies their senses. Relying on their ambitions and curiosities, Mike (played by SETH REMIS) and Tracy (played by Mariela Martinez) strive to mend their ideals with this discovery, only to learn it was something that mankind wasn't meant to disturb. Filled with adventure, and a lesson to be learned, Mike and his girlfriend Tracy, unravel the enigma of the plant through a series of mysterious events and encounters only to return what does not belong to them. Asarum is a myth meets reality adventure set in modern-day 2016\u00a0written by Allen Driscoll. We pitched the script and our ideas to a few people and they loved it! Their reaction matched our motivation! A film like this is very needed and different from what is out there today. Our society is lacking films reminiscent of the 80's with a great story, like ET and Raiders of the Lost Ark, in which the whole family can enjoy, and Asarum offers a chance to bring it to them in theaters abroad. And, if that isn't exciting enough, we are extending an incredible opportunity to you! Be a part of this amazing and wholesome production, experience the process, visit us on set, give input to our guest star list, help us bring a positive message to people of all ages. Join us, in this way, to create an awesome film! The response from actors/actresses who have expressed interest in being in the film is overwhelming as well as other talent from around the world! Development & Pre-production Module: $50, 000.00 Prodution Module: $300,000.00 Post-production Module: $600,000.00 The Funding is for Development and Pre-production. We are confident that the amount to raise will be enough to do the necessary work to bring the project into Production. During the duration of the fundraiser, we'll post updates to Kickstarter and the websites on progress of the film. With a budget estimate of One Million for entire project, we can use our resources, & technology of today to make a movie looking like 10 - 20 Million. We have talent in every category of production that are willing to help with the creation of the film! We also have arrangements with The National Kidney Foundation, & Lyme Disease Foundation, to do sizable donations after the film is out. We are very passionate about our movie project \"Asarum\".

  "Inspired by the musical comedy of Spike Jones and a British humorist named Gerald Hoffnung, I started presenting satirical concerts in the 1950\u2019s at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City and the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado, leading eventually to the first public P.D.Q. Bach concert, as it had come to be called, at New York\u2019s Town Hall.  Hard as it is to believe, it was 50 years ago that the music of P.D.Q. Bach first wormed its way into the ears of the unsuspecting public.  P.D.Q. Bach was the twenty-first of Johann Sebastian Bach\u2019s twenty children, and his music demonstrated the warped influences of his father as well as his contemporaries, Vivaldi, Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven.  The concerts became an annual last-week-in-December tradition at Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall in New York City, presenting an ever-increasing array of original compositions attributed to \u201cthe scourge of Wein-am-Rhein.\u201d  People began to notice that one could actually learn something about 18th-century classical music from these misguided pieces, some of which have infiltrated classroom syllabi. \n\n We think it's most fitting to commemorate this occasion with a special concert at Town Hall, where the first concert took place in 1965. We've picked a day, December 28th, and The Town Hall\u2019s available, but what stands in the way is the cost of putting it together.\u00a0 \nThe Department of Music Pathology at the University of Southern North Dakota at Hoople has had some funding cuts, and we need your help to get this project off the ground and onto the stage.  It costs money, a lot of money, to put on a concert: we have to rent the hall, pay the orchestra, stagehands and performers, print programs, hire a producer, rent sound equipment, etc. Even in the event of a sold-out show, professional classical orchestral concerts are perennial money losers, made possible by generous donations made to the orchestra and/or the presenting organization. In this case, we\u2019re the presenting organization, and the orchestra will be one we hire, so we\u2019re using Kickstarter to appeal directly to folks like you who like music and comedy.  With your help, I think we can pull this off!\n If we can raise the funding, the show can go on.\n By the way, Kickstarter will only let you back once and we couldn't feasibly offer every combination of rewards, so if you would like to combine two or more reward packages, just pick the one that has a limited quantity available and pledge the combined amount of the packages and drop us a line letting us know what you want and we'll take care of you. That is, if you want a diploma ($100) and 2 premium tickets ($250), pick the tickets and pledge $350 and let us know and you'll get both. We tried to make sure that there are good packages available for both people who can make the concert and those who cannot, but that means if you want tickets and swag (which is a situation we'd be delighted with) you may have to design your own package in this way. The Concert \nWe plan to resuscitate a full evening of iconic works of P.D.Q. Bach with full orchestra on Monday, December 28, 2015 at 8 pm at The Town Hall in NYC. \nP.D.Q. BACH: THE GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY will include: \n\nPeruckenstuck (Hairpiece) from \"The Civilian Barber\"\nSwing Sweet, Low ChariotNew Horizons in Music Appreciation, a.k.a.

  "Their whole day out after the accidental meet up and hitting off happens, in a single day and it's the day where Bala is on a film high, and it is that day where his hormones are on their A game.Their chemistry is so organic, it's just like an Olympic table tennis. What happens as the lunch break ends? Does he say it out loud? \u2014 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY Hi\uff5eMy name is YI \u00a0and my English name is Phoebe. I have studied film and television production in China for four years and have produced short films/advertisements for different companies two years. Now I come to the University for the Creative Arts to study filmmaking. This is my first attempt to produce a short film in the UK. The reasons for choosing ORGANIC CHEMISTRY are as follows: 1 I am also a scriptwriter. I am deeply attracted by the dialogue in this script. The chemical reaction between characters through the dialogue reminds me of many referenced films. For example, Before Sunrise and Annie Hall. 2 I appreciate the optimism that the script wants to express. In fact, we face different levels of pressure and regret in our life. But we need to be full of optimism and courage. I have established a complete professional team.We are making preparations for shooting now.Hope you could become our sponsor PLEASE. Boom, this is Sudarsan, the writer-director of Organic Chemistry. This is my shaping of clay on how finding love or I don\u2019t even know if its love kind of thing in a few instances, can be a forever memory and how caught up in the moment one could be. This will be a colorful, comically and eyebrows shrinking ride. This is a day out film, they work together in an advertising company for a NOS balloons client. It\u2019s her first day and we get to ride with Aella and Bala throughout the time, how they are bonding and how he is falling for her with each disappearing second. That is the kind of guy he is, and Aella is the girl who has an effortless aura of attraction. Then Bala\u2019s heart is bound to bounce. We will be very happy and be grateful for your contributions and any sort of questions feel free to contact us. This is a passionate love story we are wanting to tell this world. It will be a nice conversational comedy with some underlying romance and some hint of magic and chemicals. That\u2019s a nice concoction don\u2019t you think? Our planned shooting days are from April 29th to May 5th. According to this plan, we have completed the script breakdown and \u00a0design of storyboards. So far, we also have identified some actors and shooting locations. Although our school will give us enough help in equipments, we still need a lot of money to make the film perfect.We made an idealized budget table. This is the most ideal budget. But in fact, we will reduce the budget to less than 2000 pounds. In addition to raising funds on the website, we also have small fund-raising activities in Surrey and London. Our film will be finished by September. We hope you could help us please. thank you very much\uff01 The names of all those who helped us will be displayed in the thanks list at the end of the film.",
  "The idea of Glass Door was hatched one October evening in the darkroom at our high school. We had been developing photos and discussing future projects we had in mind for a designated week at the end of the term where students could pursue an independent topic.  Recognizing our common interests, we started plotting to collaborate.  We wanted to draw from our passions \u2013 photography, writing, and activism \u2013 to create a compelling product, thus bringing about the concept of a zine on women in male-dominated industries.  In order to cover a greater breadth of professional environments, we decided to branch out from our home of Putney, Vermont and contact women in New York City.  Among them, we ended up speaking with an executive chef, the founder of the field of psycho-oncology, a filmmaker, and an all-female collective that designs, produces, and sells their own furniture.  Our week in New York allowed us to hear perspectives from women ages thirty to eighty-eight, all sharing a unique story, and ready to continue fighting for gender equality, no matter how steep the climb.\u00a0 \n\nWe hope to use the funds from this campaign to print the physical zine featuring the interviews and photography we gathered over our week in New York.  The cost of shipping, color printing through Issuu (a self-publishing website) and providing free copies to our contributors and school totals to $700.  With your support, we can accomplish our vision and potentially launch more issues and content in the future.\n\n Thanks for being a part of Glass Door!\n\n",
  "\"All your dreams can come true if you have the courage to pursue them\" - Walt Disney I have arrived at a place in my life where I'm ready to pursue my dream. After a decade of working various jobs in manufacturing I have decided to quit my day job and pursue what I'm most passionate about in life, photography.  What I'm doing:  I will spend a month on the road exploring the entire west coast of the United States. I want to capture its beauty through the lens of my camera and through my eyes. I will create a book that tells my story, not only the story of this west coast adventure but also the story of my journey as a photographer and as a man pursuing his dream.  The reason for my trip is to create the book. I'm hitting the road to find out more about myself and to launch my new full time career in photography with a grand adventure.  The book with be a mixture of visual story telling, fine art and short stories. What will make this book unique is that most of my adventures take place between dusk and dawn. The photos will be taken at night and the story will be about my journey through the west coast through the eyes and lens of a nocturnal photographer. I want to show you the world the way I see and experience it. While most of the world is asleep, I'm hiking a trail looking for an epic landscape to capture or driving through a national park with the road to myself.  What I need: Here's where you come in: I can't do this without you. What I love about Kickstarter is that it brings people together to accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible to accomplish as an individual and makes them possible. I need the support of you all, my friends, family, and community to make this dream into a reality. It will be you that actually makes this happen. I'm not doing this just for me, it's not all about me. I'm hoping this will inspire the next generation of creators and adventurers. Every dollar given will go towards the trip, and will get me there and back. It will also go towards creating the book. Lord willing I raise more than my goal the money will go toward living expenses while I create the book. \u00a0",
  "Hello friends. We are here to seek your financial support to bring our first comedy short film to life. But first, who are we? Well, Crown House Entertainment (CHE) is a \"next generation\" video production company that meets the exploding demand of unique, compelling, hard-to-access celebrity-focused content. The company was established back in June 2015 by president and CEO Jocquan Carter, who has over 10 Imdb credits and 10 years of acting, directing, and production experience, working on several prominent and highly successful films. Jocquan Carter came together with several other brilliant individuals, who together, brought a wealth of complementary experiences, skills, and relationships in the fields of entertainment, business, production, syndication, and high-end web design. You see, as film makers, we have the unique ability to transform written stories and ideas into visual presentations, such as movies, television shows, documentaries, animations, and advertisements.\u00a0This is because our aim is to create content that spurs emotions, captivates audiences, or prompts action. Top Flight: Safe and Secure, our first short film, will be all about comedy, fun, and laughter. It\u2019s fun to share a good laugh and we believe that laughter is truly the best medicine. It draws people together in ways that trigger healthy physical and emotional changes in the body. Laughter strengthens your immune system, boosts mood, diminishes pain, and protects you from the damaging effects of stress. Nothing works faster or more dependably to bring your mind and body back into balance than a good laugh. Humor lightens your burdens, inspires hope, connects you to others, and keeps you grounded, focused, and alert. It also helps you release anger and forgive sooner. With so much power to heal and renew, the ability to laugh easily and frequently is a tremendous resource for surmounting problems, enhancing your relationships, and supporting both physical and emotional health. Best of all, this priceless medicine is fun, free, and easy to use. As children, we used to laugh hundreds of times a day, but as adults, life tends to be more serious and laughter more infrequent.

  "SYNOPSIS Beans is a short film about a young woman, Janine, who thinks her birthday has been forgotten and decides to treat herself to lunch.\u00a0 Upon arriving home, she finds that her husband, Scott, has prepared a special dinner for her, and he gets her to put a blindfold on and sit at the table to wait for him to finish his marvellous creation. \u00a0However, she starts to really feel the effects of her special birthday lunch to which she treated herself.\u00a0 So, as Janine tries to cover up the effects of her special launch, Scott continues to set the table, blissfully unaware of the troubles she is having and the comedic actions she uses to try to hide them, all while blindfolded. We are making a comedy because everyone needs to laugh, especially in a time when things are tough for a lot of people, and lately there seems like there has not been enough to laugh about. \u00a0So, if you would like to help put a smile on other people\u2019s faces this is the film for you.

  "Why This Show? We are living in a time when everyone is walking on eggshells, not knowing what\u2019s okay to joke about and constantly censoring ourselves... or are we? When we\u2019re around people we love and trust, we let loose \u2013 at least we hope so. The comedies on TV, aside from shows like South Park and Curb Your Enthusiasm, no longer make jokes that are offensive. When did America get so sensitive? We don\u2019t believe it did and hope you don\u2019t either. That\u2019s why we want to bring back a style of unfiltered comedy. The show is about three best friends in their late 20s from the suburbs of Massachusetts who own a gym together. We chose this location because the stereotypes are true \u2013 people from Massachusetts have no filter and can be offensive. But at the end of the day are mostly good. They\u2019ll yell at you for no reason, but if you\u2019re cold they\u2019ll give you the shirt off their back. We chose a gym because it\u2019s a location that is ripe for unique characters: the person who made a New Year\u2019s Eve resolution, the nerdy high school kid trying to get strong, the college football player, the hot divorced mom, the old lady who lifts the two-pound dumbbells, the overweight guy who wants to be thin, the shallow person who needs to stay sexy. This list can go on forever. When you're at the gym, your group identity doesn't matter because you're an individual with your own goals.\u00a0 In the pilot, the three best friends are in danger of losing their gym, the one place they believe everyone is free to be themselves. If they lose it, they\u2019ll lose their life savings and the community they\u2019ve built, but the most important thing they'd lose is their friendship. The Creators Brett and Conor have been making comedic content since college in 2008 and continue to because they love making people laugh. Brett moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career writing TV comedy and Conor works in retail while hoping Brett hits it big so he can ride on his coattails. Brett's IMDB\u00a0 YouTube Sketches\u00a0 Why Us? We are both willing to push boundaries and aren\u2019t afraid to embarrass ourselves as long as we get a laugh. Brett has professional writing credits that you can check out on his IMDB. If you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our content, then why not help support us to make more? We've always been both the cast and the crew on our projects with a budget of zero, operating the camera and audio equipment ourselves, and we've been satisfied with the results. However, this is our biggest endeavor yet \u2013 a 30-minute pilot with exceptional production value and comedy that will leave you in tears. The only way to accomplish this goal is with your help.",
  "While many ANC earphones simply mimic the generic earphone style, we are here to introduce a completely new take on mobile music enjoyment. We designed the WG-1 to combine class-leading noise-canceling technology, the immersive acoustic performance of the audiophile world, and the freedom of a TWS design. On top of that, the ergonomic shape provides a secure and comfortable fit. Certified IPX5 waterproof, you can feel free to wear the earbuds anywhere, from the gym to long jogs in the rain. Adopting the innovative Active Noise Cancellation Technology, the WG-1 can automatically recognize and capture the environment noise, and then deliver noise reduction up to 25dB. Combined with the powerful 10mm dynamic driver, which generates accurate anti-noise sound signals, the WG-1 ANC earbuds are ready to bring the tranquility and purity to your favorite soundtracks. \u00a0No matter whether you are sitting in the crowded metro, eating in a noisy restaurant, or resting on a plane, you can enjoy pure crystal clear music whenever you like. Moreover, the WG-1 allows you to personalize the ANC effect according to your personal needs. You can effortlessly switch between the ambient sound control mode and the pure cancellation mode with a simple touch of the panel. Many TWS face difficulties in finding the best balance point between sound quality and portability. This becomes a further more difficult task if the TWS tries to incorporate the ANC feature. Our solution to this problem was to utilize the same Hi-Fi dynamic driver that is often used in Custom In-Ear Monitors (CIEM) for the WG-1 ANC true wireless earbuds. CIEMs are popular among the world\u2019s greatest musicians for their precise audio reproduction that delivers accurate monitor playback, which is often needed for stage performances. We have tuned our 10mm dynamic drivers meticulously so that the WG-1 can produce the entire sound frequency range, from the deep pounding sub-bass to the crystal clear high notes. The tuning of the drivers aims to bring a balanced sound signature that allows the listeners to enjoy every aspect of the sound range equally and proportionally.\u00a0Thanks to the BES2300zp chipset, the WG-1 supports playback up to 20kHz, starting as low as 20Hz. \u00a0From the subtleties of instruments to a bare whispered solo, capturing all of the details hidden in a music track has never been easier. Currently, most of the chipsets on the market either have to give up the ANC feature or sacrifice the acoustic performance. There are only a few chipsets that can support active noise cancelation while delivering lossless sound quality. Of them, the BES2300zp is the latest and the best. Built with this BES2300zp chipset, the WG-1 supports both ANC and AAC/SBC codecs to achieve lossless sound quality and seamless audio transmission. Not only has your music never sounded this good before, but now you can enjoy your movies and games with sync rivaling even wired earphones. The latest Bluetooth 5.0 chip is embedded in the WG-1 to provide a stable and reliable connection hour after hour of high-quality wireless streaming. Additionally, the chipset utilizes the Low Band Bluetooth Retransmission Technology (LBRT) to better ensure the synchronization between the two earbuds, so as to offer a seamless music listening experience. Most importantly, the WG-1 also syncs perfectly with what you see on your phone\u2019s/tablet\u2019s screen for latency-free media enjoyment. Put on the WG-1, you will never skip a beat of your favorite songs. With smart touch gestures, the WG-1 puts the music and call controls right at your fingertips. After the first successful connection, both earbuds will automatically connect to the last connected device when they are powered on. Through simple gestures, your music is at your command! Water Resistance The WG-1 is certified IPX5 water-resistant to ensure it works functionally in sweat and light rain. It is your perfect companion wherever you go, whatever terrain it may be! Don\u2019t let a little rain or splash worry you anymore. Embedded Microphone, Hands-free Talking Enjoy the hands-free calling with the WG-1 wherever you are! Whether it\u2019s an online meeting or a calling on the way, we have got you covered! Battery Life The WG-1 comes with a handy magnetic charging case embedded with a 400mA battery. \u00a0You can enjoy a tangle-free wireless experience for 3-4 hours within one charge. *Note: The usage hours may vary depending on the ANC modes, temperature, using methods, etc.",
  "In 2015 I wrote a semi-fictional book called \u2018Just 14\u2019 about a 14-year old boy following his beloved Aston Villa during the incredible 1980/81 season, when of course only 14 players were used. Full of laughs and a real \u2018coming of age\u2019 story with the Villa amazing season the backdrop. The book has to date sold over 35,000 copies. It is really based on me (a season ticket holder in the Trinity for the last 40 seasons) and has proved very popular with Villa fans of a similar age. In 2020, just before Covid, I was approached by a Birmingham film producer to turn the book into a movie. Things have snowballed since, with a number of Villa celebrity fans now lined up for parts, screenplay being written by a Villa fan and some key investors lined up. You can find out more about it at Just14TheMovie.com. We are looking to create a feelgood film that is a blend of \u2018Fever Pitch\u2019 and \u2018Adrian Mole\u2019 with a blend of \u2018Gregory\u2019s Girl\u2019. It won't just be a football film but will be very much a 'Coming of Age' comedy. It'll have romance, bullying, local football rivalries and tearjerkers along the way. Obviously the ending at Highbury is euphoric, oh dear spoiler alert. We have a number of high profile investors lined up as well as famous actors (many with a Villa connection), but these investments take time and we don't want to lose the energy this project currently has. So we have been fundraising for a Development Fund over the last 3 months. The aim to raise \u00a320,000 to take us through Development Stage to Pre-Production stage.\u00a0 Support so far has been fantastic, especially from Villa fans. Previous Crowdfunding and social media appeals have raised \u00a38,500. This has paid for; 1. Scriptwriter 2. Line Producer 3. Legal Contracts 4. Started the Sizzle Reel. Now we are looking to raise at least \u00a31,500 This money would be used for the following;\n1. Finishing the Sizzle Real\n2.Pre-book Studio We are also offering all Kickstarters the opportunity to be involved in the film.",
  "Grey Area highlights people from drastically different cultures asking the questions that we\u2019re slightly embarrassed to admit we don\u2019t know the answers to. Because society evolves so quickly, Grey Area highlights the difficulty in continually trying to understand each other's cultures, while acknowledging the importance of it. While everyone seems either \"woke\" or not, Grey Area examines the process of getting from one to the other. It\u2019s the day you realize you couldn\u2019t refer to that person the way you used to any longer and makes fun of you for adjusting to that process. We have been paying out of our own pockets to make this show and releasing it for free because we believe that so many people like us are not being represented on screen. We know our show is really special and our voices are unique. Using a satirical tone to discuss important issues leaves our audiences laughing and thinking at the same time. We need help to fund the third season because we want to keep bringing this show and it's characters to life for our audience. Check out Season 2 - Episode 1 Sarah, Evan and Asaad created Last Second Sea (the crew behind Grey Area) as an outlet for the three of them to create their own original content.

  "Synopsis:\u00a0\"A dark farce and borderline surrealist short film\u00a0that revolves around two senior men (Ralph/Patrick), both with larger-than-life personalities and pride, in a semi-private nursing home as they reminisce on their experiences gained throughout life\u00a0as well as their love for Tapioca pudding. \u00a0However, when a new nurse (Vince) has informed the two men that Tapioca pudding is no longer being served, they feel their most beloved delicacy could be in jeopardy. Ralph and Patrick investigate, only to met with a sinister surprise.\" \"Grumpy Old Men\" -Donald Petrie (1993) \u00a0\"About Schmidt\" -Alexander Payne (2002)\u00a0 \u00a0\"A Clockwork Orange\"/ \"Dr. Strangelove\" -Stanley Kubrick \u00a0(1971) / (1964) \u00a0\"The House That Jack Built\" -Lars Von Trier (2018) \u00a0\"Gran Torino\" - Clint Eastwood (2008) \u00a0\"Meet The Parents\" -Jay Roach (2002) \u00a0\"Cape Fear\" -Martin Scorsese (1991) \u00a0\"Step Brothers\" - Adam Mckay (2008) \u00a0Ralph: \u00a0A 70-year-old Jewish man born and raised in the heart of New York City. He can be described as a smart ass, to say the least. While Stoic and wise, he can be condescending at times, however, this is usually to humor a situation for his own entertainment. Ralph is a Vietnam war veteran and while he is proud to have served this country, he is deeply troubled by Patrick's view that there is more honor in fighting for a flag than there is in fighting for the things/people you love. Patrick: \u00a0A 70-year-old Irish/Catholic man. He has a rough exterior and uses it as a brick wall. His wits aren't near as strong as Ralph's, which causes him to be quite defensive, lighting a quick fuse to anything that might come off as slightly belittling him. Patrick dreads sharing the same room as Ralph and beyond anything, hates the thought of spending his final years in a nursing home. For that matter, hates the fact that he's even in a time block considered his \"final years\". Underneath his thick skin, is a kind and understanding individual who believes in doing the right thing. Vince: In addition to being the embodiment of the Travis Bickle archetype through and through, Vince is one of the staff members of the nursing home. To a passerby, he resembles something of a\u00a0backwoods lone wolf. There is and always has been a fire deep down in his heart that comes out through his piercing yet wirey gaze and minister-like pattern of speech...that fire being...Tapioca Pudding. The nursing facility is home to a state-of-the-art pudding supply room with enough of every flavor to last someone years.\u00a0 The residents are just roadblocks in Vince's hunger. His mantra is \u201cTo be in control of the supply room, by any means necessary.\u201d Carroll: The kind-hearted receptionist who is the life of this rather dull environment. While she is someone the residents are drawn to for her friendliness, this truly stems from her control over the pudding room. \u00a0When Vince sets out on his mission to assume dominance over this sacred room, Carroll just becomes a chess pawn in his devastating and morbid attempt to seize the room for himself.\u00a0 \u00a0Joshua Morgan (Director/Writer/Producer/Vince)\u00a0has devoted his life to the arts ever since the age of 8. Over time, he has become a versatile performer who is actively working on films, both behind and in front of the camera. Some of his accomplishments over the duration of his high school career include his portrayal of \"Napoleon\" in an award-winning theater production of \"Animal Farm\", employed as the official videographer of Universal Business Solutions, co-directed/starred in the award-winning short film \"The Show\", having the lead role in a Savannah College Of Art And Design (SCAD) Thesis Film, and directing two feature-length films. Recently through his latest Kickstarter campaign as well as working with producer Lucas A. Ferrara, Joshua and his team raised upwards of $25k to shoot the pilot episode of his horror anthology series \"Kill The Lights\" entitled \"Children Of the Pines\" (release date TBD). \u00a0His continued passion for filmmaking and team building drives him more than anything. He couldn't be more excited to bring his outrageous and twisted vision to life while working alongside the film's brilliant cast and crew. \u00a0Lucas A. Ferrara (Producer) is a New York based attorney who has produced over 125 features and shorts, including the upcoming \u201cFind the Light,\u201d starring George MacKay (\u201c1917\u201d), and \u201cPragma,\u201d starring Phil Dunster (\u201cTed Lasso\u201d).\u00a0 His portfolio includes a number of projects with London-based production company, Broken Flames, including \u201cSelf-Charm,\u201d starring BAFTA winner Bukky Bakray (\u201cRocks\u201d), \u201cWhy Wouldn\u2019t I Be?,\u201d starring Harry Collett (\u201cDoolittle\u201d) and Elizabeth Berrington (\u201cThe Nevers\u201d), and \u201cBetter Get Better\u201d starring Elisha Applebaum (\u201cFate: The Winx Saga\u201d). His first feature, \u201cHelp,\u201d is currently in distribution and should be screening, shortly.\u00a0 While his latest feature, \u201cMakeup,\u201d is already garnering a number of \u201cBest Drama\u201d accolades from several international film festivals. Lucas recently partnered with Joshua Morgan to produce \u201cChildren of The Pines,\u201d which is slated to compete with episodic content in festivals around the world. Howard Elson (Ralph) \u00a0has had starring roles onstage in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, CHICAGO, EVITA, A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC, CAROLINE OR CHANGE and many other professional productions. He recently starred in the short film, \u201cGrandpa and Shorty,\u201d and played Titanic victim, Isidor Strauss, in the soon to be released feature film, \u201cUnsinkable.\u201d For many years, DR. Elson toured North America with his one man show for dental meetings and conventions, \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, Doctor Howard Elson!\u201d Joe Harkins (Patrick) is known to many as Santa in TV commercials\u00a0where he's complaining to a lawyer that \"Grandma got run over by a reindeer\". Joe's stage credits include multiple singing performances on Broadway/Off-Broadway\u00a0stages in shows such as RAGTIME. He's co-hosted Nick Cannon's WILD N' OUT on MTV and morning shows on major tv networks. He's acted in more than 100 films and videos that include \u00a0Anna Kendrick's LOVE LIFE and THAT DAMN MICHAEL CHE, both currently running on HBO-MAX. Chris T. Anthony (Cinematographer) is a disciple of the narrative process and thrives on building a well-crafted story. As a practicing Director of Photography and Director for commercial, cinema, and live events, he brings a wide variety of experience, refined artistic principles, and a practiced production ethic. Chris seeks elegance and quality in all of his pursuits. Sune Rose Wagner (Composer) is a critically acclaimed songwriter and producer, most commonly known as the songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist of The Raveonettes, a band widely credited as one of the key influencers of the 00\u2019s garage rock revival scene. Tom Petty and Stephen King listed The Raveonettes \u201cLove in A Trash Can\u201d as one of their most treasured records. Depeche Mode\u2019s Dave Gahan, Martin Gore, and Julian Casablanca from The Strokes have voiced their admiration for Sune\u2019s work, and luminaries such as Little Steven and Johnny Marr(The Smiths) claim to be longtime fans. In December 2014, Sune scored his first commercial no.1 hit in Germany, having co-written \u201cBlue Heart\u201d for contestant Charley Ann Schmutzler, for the popular TV show \u2018The Voice\u2019. He recently co-wrote and co-produced an album for Danish platinum singer-songwriter, Mads Langer, released on Sony Music and produced Danish artist Carl Emil\u2019s record on Universal Music, Denmark. Sune\u2019s success and versatility as a songwriter is perhaps even more evident when considering the vast number of creative syncs under his name. Over the last two decades, he has generated millions of dollars from syncs alone. His songs feature regularly on TV shows, commercials, and film soundtracks. The list includes leading brands such as Jim Beam, Lego, Toyota, Converse, Corona, Nationwide, Lacoste, The Gap, and Tumi. Hit shows like The OC, CSI, True Blood, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, and Lucifer have featured tracks penned by the prolific songwriter and producer who also wrote and recorded a track for the hugely popular video game \"Batman: Arkham City\". Films such as \u201cStill Alice\u201d, \u201cMolly\u2019s Game\u201d, \u201cWhip It\u201d, \u201cDrive Angry\u201d, \u201cTrick \u2018r Treat\u201d, \u201cNick and Norah\u2019s Infinite Playground\u201d, \u201cAmerican Honey\u201d stand out amongst his long list of sync coups. \u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d written in 2008 remains one of Sune\u2019s most successful works, it continues to feature in countless Christmas compilations and television commercials every year and was used in the opening scene of silver screen modern classic \u201cChristmas With The Kranks\u201d. Sune has also achieved indie chart success as a producer/mixer. \u2018Too True\u2019 by Dum Dum Girls, is a collaboration with legendary songwriter and Blondie producer, Richard Gottehrer. The album reached no.1 on the CMJ charts and remained at the top spot for 4 consecutive weeks. \u00a0While Sune continues to consolidate his legacy as a songwriter and producer, present and future projects see him expanding into the world of film. He scored his first feature film \"A War\", which was nominated for an Oscar in 2016. His success in the field has led to big-name projects such as the music production/orchestration for season 6\u2019s \"Game Of Thrones\" trailer. Further industry recognition followed as the track \u201cRecharge and Revolt\u201d, which featured on the award-winning British drama \u201cAmerican Honey\u201d picked up \u201cBest Individual Sync\u201d at the 2017 Music Week Awards. Sune recently worked on several tracks for Netflix's \u201cAltered Carbon\u201d seasons 1 and 2 and Children Of The Pines. Jackson Ring (Editor) in addition to being an award winning director, works as a freelance cinematographer, editor, and photographer. Coming from an arts education and being involved in many acclaimed projects, he hopes to continue making work that inspires himself and others. Jackson is involved in multiple fashion magazines in the Orlando area and is studying for a Film BFA at the University of Central Florida. Keyont'e Howard ( 1st Assistant Director) is a Florida native and creative. He is a film production specialist with years of experience in various roles and productions. Howard has worked on notable projects such as: Dark My Light (2021) and PAPERS (2020). Working his way up through the film industry, he is actively seeking to direct and produce more films and shorts. \u00a0Every film has its own unique path following its release. Our team is confident that the finished product will have a festival run and be more than eligible as an award contender.\u00a0We will do everything in our power to put this film in front of as many eyes as we can. The more money raised means that more recourses and time that are able to be acquired which in short, results in a better product. If its $4000 or $14,000, every cent of our profit will be put right back into the film. Whether or not it will be spent in production, post-production, or distribution, will be calculated once we have an idea of how much money we have in total. Our full budget is listed below. If at the very least we are not able to accommodate this number, the film is not able to go on. \u00a0",
  "UPDATE: This project has reached its minimum funding goal - a grateful thanks to my backers! There is still time for other interested participants to get involved! Digital camera - $600.  Plane ticket to Kuwait - $1500.  Body Armor and Kevlar helmet - $1800.  Embedding alongside US soldiers at war in Iraq - Priceless.  But...printing a full-color book documenting this time in Iraq, and telling and showing the stories of those soldiers - About as expensive as all combined.  \"Can't Give This War Away: Three Iraqi Summers of Change and Conflict\" will be a book of photos and essays that document my trips to Iraq from 2007 to 2009.  In other forms, this work has appeared in daily newpapers across the country, such as the Buffalo News, Bakersfield, Ca. Californian, Worcester, Ma. Telegram, and many others. The photographs have been displayed in museums and other venues. Publication of this book will enable me to contact agents and publishers with a visual introduction to my work, as I continue working toward full publication of a much longer manuscript. However, in the short term, \"Can't Give This War Away\" will provide a colorful and dramatically visual presentation of soldiers in Iraq, in up-close and personal photography rarely seen in newspapers and other media outlets.  Funding rewards will bring this book to my Kickstarter supporters, in several different forms. In a short-run publication, photo books are expensive to produce - but can still be the high-quality equal of any coffee table art book purchased in a book store.  The funding received through Kickstarter will enable me to do the following:  1. Produce approximately 50-60 paperback copies of approx. 120 pages, in 8x10 landscape format, on high-quality glossy paper.  2. Promote my work in a professional and visually compelling style. Most will go to agents and publishers for promotional use, while I continue working on the full manuscript.  3. Bring my photos to published life, most for the first time. For many of the photos, this will be the first and only time they are published. Even if published by a major publisher, it's doubtful that as many photos would be used as I will be able to include in this edition.  4. Through copies earned by funding rewards, bring copies of this work to a small, but hopefully growing, audience. Supporters will have access to different levels of printing quality - but the work and photo quality wil always be the same high quality!  For those helping to fund this project through Kickstarter, several editions of this book will be produced, as noted in the list of funding rewards:  A PDF version that I email to funders. This will include all the written and photographic content, and would be printable by the recipient.  A \"basic edition\" of approximately 80 pages, printed in 7x7 paperback format. This would not include all of the photographs or text (but you would get the PDF with all content).  A \"deluxe edition\" of approx. 120 pages, as noted above.  For funders at the higher end of support, some versions of the book will be printed in hardcover, with photographs included that are unique to that single edition. Other rewards will include signed prints of various photographs, printed thanks within the book, and in some cases, unique \"thank you\" pages actually printed within the book itself.  Because of the short-run printing costs, only at the $75 funding level is it feasible to provide a printed copy of the actual \"deluxe edition.\" This, however, will enable me to use your funding support to produce the \"deluxe\" copies for my own promotional use, and hopefully your support will eventually bring the stories and photos to a larger audience. All I can say is that if the full book was ever published in a truly professional form, I would not forget any of the Kickstarter funders that helped me get that far; I'd like to think you'd hear from me again!  Funding at the lower levels means you still get a PDF copy of the work, or even a signed print of one of the museum-quality photographs. And at any level of funding, you have my thanks! The hard part of this work is finished! I already went to Iraq, already took these pictures, and already wrote most of the content. My funding goal will enable me to transform already-existing rough product into a professional, finished form. I anticipate printing these copies and rewarding funders within 90 days of successful funding. That's not a promise, but it is an expectation. Examples of my work are not hard to find; I hope they give me credibility to earn your support.  Finally, through this work, you are supporting a visual and written record of soldiers at war. As the United States prepares to depart Iraq, it might be hard to remember that our national committment there is nearly 10 years long - more than 20 years, if you date back to 1991's Desert Storm.  When soldiers return from overseas, they take off their uniform and blend back into society; maybe it will be hard to remember what these men and women looked like when they were young and at war in a place very far from home. I hope these photographs and stories help an audience appreciate and understand what it looked and felt like during these three summers in Iraq where the temperature rarely dipped below 125 degrees and a stubborn enemy rarely stood and fought.  It was not a good place to be, but for a good chunk of their youth it's a place these soldiers chose to be, on behalf of their country and all of us. But even though we're leaving Iraq, and think we've handed control back over to the citizens of that country, we can't wash our hands of it; we might think we can, but we can't give this war away.",
  "This will enable me to convert my 200 acres of Kentucky farmland from agricultural uses back to a diverse ecosystem of natural native grasslands. Kentucky, like other Midwestern states, was once covered by millions of acres of native grasslands. The prairie ecosystem is now one of the rarest plant communities in North America, and few natural ecosystems have been so thoroughly destroyed by human land-use practices. Before modern settlement in the early 1800s, the biologically rich ecosystem of the North American midwest grasslands was comparable in numbers of wildlife to the African Savanna. It would have been a beautiful sight much like the Great Serengeti. We can not return the midwest prairie to its former glory but we can return a portion of it in a way that benefits us all. How? By combining the synergistic effect of a large carbon sink, preserving natural habitat, reducing machinery, fuel, and fertilizer use as well as increasing the numbers of endangered insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals that thrive in large scale grasslands. My mission is a conservation effort to restore grasslands (Prairie) starting with my farms in Kentucky as a proof of concept. Then, expanding outward by leasing and establishing prairie on private lands. The plan is to strategically link prairie lands to create a continuous migration path for birds, insects, and small mammals while also capturing carbon from the air and putting it back into the soil. We can make this happen with the use of crowdfunding to rent private land and employ farmers to plant, care for, and maintain a portion of their former crop ground as a permanent natural prairie. It takes decades to establish a forest. We will be able to establish a diverse grassland ecosystem in 2 or 3 years and start the process of transforming the soil's microbiome back to its natural condition. This will be possible by utilizing farmers that have a love for the land, who are already in place, and who already have all the required equipment and knowledge. With all these factors in place, this plan is immediately scalable. Most current farmland in privately held hands is held as an investment. Those landowners consist of family farms, corporate farms, institutional investors, hedge funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and some wealthy foreign investors. If you invest in mutual funds or a 401 K-style retirement account, you probably own some land inside those investments. And as an Investor, you expect a return. So when a farmer leases land to grow crops, that farmer is expected to rent it all year every year, even if some portion of the land is of marginal production value, or the investor will find another farmer that will. So in some cases, crops are grown on land that is a guaranteed loss to keep the other land under a lease that is the most profitable. In some years crop futures predict that farmers will lose money and \u201cburn equity\u201d before they even plant the first seed. You might think some farmers would just take the year off instead of working for nothing. But \u2018Farmer A\u2019 has to lease all the ground and plant it anyway or the investor will give it to \u2018Farmer B\u2019 and now \u2018Farmer A\u2019 is out of luck next year when prices increase and profitability returns. Therefore, American farmers generally overproduce crops. As a farmer myself, I have attended many educational seminars to get better and better at the craft and try to find an advantage to compete. It is the entrepreneurial spirit that drives us to get more efficient and produce more with less. So we all strive for excellence and overproduce. In essence, we are running ourselves out of business. We are taxing our natural resources in the process and making less and less profit. The one benefit, and it is a big one, is that food is cheap in the USA. I say all this to explain that land use is complicated and I do not want to hurt farmers by pulling large amounts of profitable land out of production. I want to help them by giving them the means to earn income by working the land they already use and letting the farmer and the investor decide what portion of the land to conserve and what land to plant crops on while paying them a price equal to what they would make from the normal agricultural crop lease. In the 1989 movie, Field of Dreams, The character played by Kevin Costner converted a portion of his crop ground into a baseball field. He had a vision that drove him, at great financial risk, to build this sports complex in the middle of his highly productive cropland. This fantasy worked out and the movie was a box office success. I have a similar vision, but, instead of drawing in ghost baseball players, I believe we will see a resurgence of wildlife. Starting with beneficial insects, endangered pollinators like the Monarch Butterfly, Bumble Bee, wild Honey Bees, etc. Then the amphibians, reptiles, small and large mammals, etc. Conservationists can assist in quickly reestablishing animal life, but most species will come back on their own if we rebuild an ecosystem where they can thrive. But what if some disaster creates a food shortage with all this land tied up in conservation? Although it\u2019s probably not likely due to the increasing efficiency of American agriculture, in an emergency, some of this land could be returned to agriculture instantly and it would produce abundantly due to the beneficial rebalance of the soil microbiome. All of that carbon our grass is pulling out of the atmosphere and then depositing into the soil is free fertilizer. Once the emergency is over, the grassland could be replanted or planted elsewhere. That is one of the limitations of forestry land and why many landowners don\u2019t commit to growing trees. The commitment is nearly a lifetime, and the conversion can actually hurt the value of their real estate investment. Interesting Facts And Questions Answered... Benefits of warm-season grasses and orbs compared to typical lawn grass. Root depths are only as deep as the grass is tall. Cool-season lawn grasses only penetrate a few inches into the soil and therefore cannot push carbon any deeper. Like trees, warm-season grass can drive 6 feet into the ground allowing more space to store captured carbon. The Carbon Cycle. We are carbon-based life forms. All life is carbon-based. Most of the Earth's carbon is stored in the ground. We are pulling unnaturally large amounts of carbon out of the ground and disbursing it into the atmosphere. We have to do everything we can to put it back into the ground. Aren't crops plants? They cycle carbon through the roots like other plants but don\u2019t put a net positive into the ground. Crops put carbon into the food we harvest. We eat it and our bodies disperse much of it into the atmosphere. Or in the case of biofuels, they go in a gas tank, and carbon is released from the exhaust. Fun fact! Cows and other ruminants add methane to the atmosphere but cows do get a bad rap. First of all, cows do not fart. They burp. All animals that eat food release carbon. Should we condemn animals that exist to feed humans? Humans also maintain pets purely for pleasure which contributes to the carbon cycle. If we add up all the pets on the planet, including large pleasure animals like horses, would it exceed the impact of cattle? Nothing against pets. I have pets. I\u2019m not sure I would want to live in a world without cats and dogs. But for about the same cost of maintaining a pet, you can join me and grow and maintain an acre of grassland where you will be sustaining homes for thousands of wild pets! Why Am I On This Mission? One day my 22-year-old son expressed his dismay at the current trajectory we are on with climate change and told me that he was thinking he probably should not have children so they would not have to endure the disastrous future that lies ahead. I tried to explain that there are lots of reasons why that may not be the case and that it pays to be optimistic about the future but I was not able to see any supporting evidence. He was able to show me plenty to the contrary. So I have decided that I have to do something. If the rest of his generation has a similar belief, we are headed for trouble. So I must take action. The man in the middle is me. I am a retired Air Force C130 Pilot. Currently, I work for the United Parcel Service (UPS). However, when asked about my occupation, I say I am a farmer. Farming is my real passion. A Bit About My Background I developed a love for the land growing up in rural Shelby County, Kentucky. My family were part-time tobacco farmers and many of my extended family had farms that I would visit and help out. One of my aunt and uncle ran a dairy operation and another had beef cows, but as was common at the time everyone had a tobacco crop. Regardless of what one thinks of the tobacco industry,(there is plenty not to like) it provided many Kentucky farm families with much-needed extra cash. It was a true family business. About 3 times per year it was all hands on deck to plant, harvest, and process the crop. Everything had to be done by hand as there is very little mechanization for any part of the process. It brought families close together and often neighbors helped each other which made for some tight-knit communities. Tobacco and dairy are all but gone now, but I have kept a love of the outdoors and an interest in sustainable agriculture. I purchased a run-down farm in 2014 and began investing heavily in the renovation of the land to return fertility to the soil and build out an infrastructure that would be safe for my family to operate. It had to be positive for the environment and wildlife. These efforts were recognized by my local conservation district. I humbly accepted the title of Master Conservationist in 2017 and later that year my efforts were recognized by the Kentucky Association of Conservation Districts as the runner-up Outstanding Conservation Cooperator of the Year. The work did not stop! I continued to improve my land and recently acquired the family farm purchased by my great grandfather in 1917. It\u2019s a special place for me, but, rather than continue an intensive farming operation, my goal is to dedicate it to conservation. I have been experimenting with warm-season native grasses on my farms for about 6 years. Starting with a pure stand of Eastern Gamma Grass that has been established for about 5 years now and a more natural mixture of Big BlueStem, Little BlueStem, SideOats Grama, and native wildflowers such as Partridge Pea, Purple ConeFlower, Black-Eyed Susan, Illinois BundleFlower, Lance-Leaved Coreopsis, Lemon mint, Wild Blue Lupine, Gray-headed Coneflower, and Milkweed. All seeds are sourced from a company that specializes in heritage seeds harvested locally from ancient stands to ensure the integrity of the claim to establishing Native Grasslands. It's very expensive and labor-intensive to establish so I only have a few small plots at this time but hope to grow exponentially with this new effort. The hope is that it continues beyond my land because of the realization that it will take a massive effort to make a lasting change to the trajectory we are on with climate change. If we can piece together thousands of acres of native grasslands, we can make a difference and maybe it will be contagious and others will try to do the same.",

  "\u00a0YOU CAN COOK LITERALLY ANYTHING You Can Cook Literally Anything is a project by Lexi Adams and Ampersand Paris, two best-friends separated by 1,413 miles. They grew up together in Lawrence, Kansas one illustrating and the other cooking and both obsessed with stationary and nice pens. You Can Cook Anything is a celebration of friendship across time and space with a collector's twist. Each pack of recipe-postcards contains seven recipe postcards and a cover card, all with unique illustrations. We invite you join our correspondence and send and receive these postcards with your pen pals, lovers, rivals, family, and friends. Try and collect them all as we expand the collection of recipes and introduce guest chefs, shiny postcards, golden tickets, and more. @youcancookliterallyanything You Can Cook Literally Anything is about the relationships that we build when we cook, when we eat, and when we actively reach out to the ones that we love. We invite you into a queer, colorful culinary universe that is filled with butch, femme, & gender fluid cartoon connoisseurs. Each postcard has an illustration of a connoisseur caught in a moment we imagine you might find yourself in after cooking these recipes. The intention of these postcards is to share this universe in order to fortify our own with more beauty, care, and possibility\u2014 and maybe, even as importantly, good food fuels. You funds matter because we want to make more postcards. This project (albeit an incredible amount of fun) takes time and resources. We have already spent lots of time illustrating, imagining, designing, developing, connecting, researching, packaging, printing. Your funds will help cover our upfront costs as well as make our work sustainable. With these funds we will also be able to set course for releasing a second pack of postcards for you all to collect, trade, cook, and most importantly, eat! We are raising funds to support printing, packaging and distributing these postcard packs ourselves via our remote home studios. Throughout the month of June we\u2019ll be finalizing the details of custom stamps for our packaging, finishing touches on our postcard designs and tweaks for our recipes. Should we meet our fundraising goal, all rewards will be distributed in the month of July. Not only do we hope to build awareness around this project, but also we hope to build enough resources to produce our second set of postcards in the fall of 2022. We need both your pledge and the support of your social circles, please share away! Our inaugural set of postcards includes:",
  "In 2007, Nigel and Julia Gant discovered a mutual passion for history, and they decided to teach history through social customs, manners, and FOOD. \u00a0In order to realize this passion, they designed a field kitchen, with reproduction kitchenalia as historically accurate as possible! \u00a0They discovered there was very little information available, from how to design a hot box, to the recipes available. \u00a0Thousands of research hours were undertaken, including field trips throughout the UK and the USA, \u00a0to artisan craftsmen for the kit needed to create food authentically, trips to libraries to copy out recipes from manuscripts of the time, then translating, and modernizing the recipes. \u00a0From this was born 4 and 20 Blackbirds. \u00a0This group presented fashionable foods of the past 700 years researched from original manuscripts, created with authentic methods, demonstrated by accurately costumed re-enactors in various events in stately homes, palaces and fields travelling through England, Wales and parts of Europe covering the Saxons to World War 2! Enough never being sufficient, Julia had a dream of passing on the legacy that 4 and 20 Blackbirds had begun, by writing a book that could be used as a handbook for setting up a medieval field kitchen (which we used for foods up to the 19th century) , including successes and pitfalls, menus, foods of the era, and fifty of our best recipes taken from the early writings, and converted to use either on wood fires in a camp, or in a modern kitchen. \u00a0Suggestions for things ranging from shopping, to hygiene and safety are included. \u00a0In short this was to make it possible for someone to recreate a bit of history, on a camp or in a kitchen...whether one dish, or an entire medieval feast. If this was still insufficient, she decided to create a whimsical cookbook based on multi period recipes with the time travelling narrator \u00a0Heartsfelled , the narrator of a short film to be released soon, with a true epicurean flavour, and an interesting take on how recipes were created. \u00a0It is a true bit of whimsy, but the small collection of recipes are truly our favourites, from Chocolate Port, to Andalusian Lamb. \u00a0These span 700 years and are delicious. in 2019 , twelve years after we began, we began to feel our age, particularly with erecting and dropping 6 canvas tents, lugging 50 litre cauldrons, etc., so in the spirit of good stewardship, we sold off all of our Medieval through Elizabethan eras kit. \u00a0We didn't realize at that time that Nigel had aggressive cancer, and would have only 15 months left to live! \u00a0His final acts were to complete the first book, \"A Tasty Dish\" which is the medieval cookbook, and to revise \"Heartsfelled's Favourites\", the romp through the kitchens of the ages. \u00a0This became a sacred trust to finish these two books, and make them available as we had originally planned, to people who had an interest, nay, a passion. \u00a0Nigel died November 2020, in the second lockdown, attended by those who loved him, and with the promise to finish our project and fulfill his final dream. The books are completed, edited, and ready to go to the printers. \u00a0All they require is a modest sum to print, and ship, and we hope to have them printed and ready to go within a month of the campaign's end. Thank you for reading our story, and we hope you will love trying Pears in Red Wine, Pumpes(meatballs) Chocolate Port, Syllabub, and many other delicious recipes!",

  "Getting children to take medication especially when you are young is a tough task for all parents. Educating your child about what their medication is treating and how it makes them feel better is the first task to accomplish for a life time of better health. Being different at an early age can cause a child to feel left out or embarrassed, then top that off with medication that is obvious to everyone when they see you use it. Being aware that you are not the only one who takes medication brings those children together and opens a door of compassion to those children who do not take medication. Asthma is treated with inhaled medication and exercise induced asthma needs a bronchial dilator spray to help children to run and play at home or at school. This book shows that taking your medication and playing with your friends is a lot better than not taking your medication and not playing. I am raising funds to get my book published, the illustrations are done by Blake Morgan who did a fantastic job with water color pencils and it has been edited by Jonatha Elenburg so it's ready to go and I need help for the last step. Thanks for all your support now and possibly when the book is out and available for purchase. Thanks, Cindi Hoiness",

  "Masaleydaar (adjective); meaning: flavorful.\u00a0 Masaleydaar explores the dozens of classic Indian spice-blends that shape its complex regional flavors. This cookbook will capture regional Indian spice blends from across its 28 states and 8 union territories in one amazing cookbook.\u00a0 \u00a0Maseleydaar includes both: the recipes for spice-blend and for regional dishes that use them. It is one part ambitious, two parts exciting, and will be one cookbook to stand as the ultimate, 'holy grail' of Indian spice-blends. Indian spice blends are multipurpose work-horses that use locally preferred ingredients to enhance the flavor profiles of dishes. Every region has its own iconic spice blends shaped by local climate, community profile, and dietary needs. Some blends include only a handful of spices, others use a dozen or more. While many are in powdered form, there are dozens of spice pastes as well. Whether they are dish-specific or for multi-purpose use \u2013 they are considered pantry staples. From Bafad or Bottle Masala of the Anglo Indians, Vaduvam of Pondicherry, Kashaundi of Bengal, Vaer of Kashmir and countless others that are far more complex that even the best known garam masala. Many serve as a separate layer in addition to or in place of garam masala. As a very large collective, these blends represent India's vast gastronomic diversity. They open the doors to culinary creativity, and make a practical addition to ones' culinary repertoire. In comparison, any store-bought garam masala, no matter the brand, represents a sliver of flavors. For as long as I can remember, my mother has made her own powdered spices and spice blends. As a child, I learned to winnow ingredients to separate dust from the spices, sitting in the late afternoon sun to clean the spices, and even being quarantined indoors when three varieties of dried hot chilies were being pounded to make my moms\u2019 particular blend of cayenne pepper. For decades, mom would make large batches for our kitchen, for friends and family. Ten years ago, my mom started teaching me how to make her spice blends. That first year we even had our little spice blends on consignment in a local store :) Passing the \u2018pestle\u2019, so to speak. In the two decades that I've been teaching Indian cooking to others, and writing cookbooks, I recognize that recipes to classic spice blends that shape our iconic cuisine are fading. Many are inaccessible because no one has written them all down, or they are only passed down verbally from one generation to another, and therefore never experienced outside home kitchens. Just like ours, recipes for classic Indian spice blends are often passed down through the women in a family. However, there is no one repository for spice-blends or traditions. Masaleydaar hopes to change that. India includes 28 states and 8 union territories. Even if Masaleydaar included only one spice blend recipe from each of India's 28 states and 8 union territory, the book would have too many recipes to start. Additionally most states have 3-5 unique gastronomic regions. Including all representatives will be nearly impossible in the trim version of Masaleydaar. To keep this book manageable, I will carefully select recipes from across the country based on three aspects: With an initial funding goal, $8000, the book will include 48 recipes (24+24), broken down as follows: The success of this campaign will determine the ultimate scale and scope of the collection of recipes included in Masaleydaar. I am sharing stretch goals, so you can envision Masaleydaar's vast potential. In order to explore more spices and blends, Masaleydaar can be expanded with each stretch goal. I am unbelievably excited to begin working on Masaleydaar, a project that has been on my mind for more than two decades \u2013 ever since I entered the food space. I thank you for all your support through the years and hope we continue making great cookbooks together. Please feel free to reach out and ask questions. I am looking forward to a mighty Masaleydaar year ahead! Best wishes, Nandita Supplemental reading/articles that I have written discussing regional spice-blends",

  "Cooking is one of the most basic things in life, something we do every day, unless you\u2019re a particularly lazy multimillionaire. So, why not make the most of it, make it more fun, more playful? \u00a0 Intuitive Cooking is here to provide you with inspiration, a seed for you to grow, a catalyst, rather than a rigid set of rules. It will empower you to trust your instincts, tastes, imagination and intuition to grow as a cook and (who knows?) as a person too. \u00a0It will: The recipes Naturally, Intuitive Cooking is chock-full of mouthwatering recipes! Most of these are vegetarian and/or vegan, and those that are slightly meaty or fishy can be easily adapted to the former. For those dipping their toes into the meat-free swimming pool, I\u2019ve prepared a mini-manual with plenty of great alternatives to get started.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0As I've lived for many years in Spain, many recipes are Mediterranean-inspired, but others are from different corners of the world, some are very simple, others more elaborate: all are as sustainable as possible. There's something for anyone and everyone!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Making things fun again In these times of information overload, Instagram food porn, bake-off TV shows and guru chefs, cooking can become more than a little intimidating. With personal tales and anecdotes, I take a fun and liberating look at this culinary straightjacket.\u00a0Intuitive Cooking\u00a0helps you to once again become your own easy-going boss in the kitchen and takes the grind out of everyday cooking.\u00a0\u00a0 But wait, there's more! Intuitive Cooking also comes with a handy separate booklet to help you implement your new-found inspiration and va-va-voom! The goal is to provide you with ideas to allow you to play and give free reign to your culinary creativity. It covers a wide range of subjects: how to play with texture, temperature and tastes, flavour groups and intensifiers, fun ways of encouraging your kids to eat healthier and so much more. It also includes spaces to jot down your ideas so you can really personalise this book and turn it into something to cherish forever.\u00a0 The team The whole package is attractively designed and bursting with: ABOUT ME\u00a0 Hi! I'm Katrien Claus, and I've always been passionate about food: when I was a lot younger, my chaotically delicious dinner parties for my fellow-students became the stuff of legend. After graduating, I travelled the world, stimulating still further my insatiable curiosity, culinary and otherwise. I then settled with my partner, Roly, in Barcelona, where I experienced first-hand the city\u2019s gastronomic and social revolution of the 90s. There, I began organising food tours and cooking classes for both locals and international travellers alike, which are still popular today. I now live in a mountain village in the Catalan Pyrenees, where I offer culinary (and other) workshops. There, I enjoys rummaging around in my kitchen garden and the other delights of country living. My mission Intuitive Cooking is is designed to bring the fun back to the kitchen for everyone. Cooking and eating is not a life-or-death competition: it\u2019s about being together, having fun and bringing comfort. Let\u2019s face it, who doesn\u2019t have a jolly smile on their face after enjoying a great meal, either on their own or in good company? The book will help boost your culinary confidence and to take of yourself, your loved ones and the planet.\u00a0 Where we are now I've been working hard on Intuitive Cooking for nearly two years now, with the support of my small but extremely talented and dedicated team. There's been a lot of research, trialling and tasting recipes, discussions of ideas and content\u2026 We're nearly there. I have the prototype of the book and its accompanying booklet in my sticky little hands now, and we've carried out the final corrections.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next stop is the printer's! And it's here that I really need your support, as well as to pay the illustrator and graphic designer for their hard\u2014and beautiful\u2014work over the last year or so.\u00a0 Making a book as special as Intuitive Cooking is not exactly a cheap process, but I also want to make it relatively affordable, and the price per copy of 1,000 books is a LOT cheaper than that for 500 copies: the issue is that the overall upfront cost is higher, and that's where Kickstarter and your support comes in. As I want to keep things transparent, \u00a0here's an overview of the costs: How can you support Intuitive Cooking? There are many ways\u2014just check out all our different pledges! For those of you living in the US and the UK, we really recommend clubbing together, ordering with friends and having all the books sent to one address: the overall shipping costs will be a lot lower! Also, if you like the project, it would be a great help in you could a share it with friends and on social media. \u00a0Intuitive Cooking is present on Instagram and Facebook. Give us a like and follow us! We also have a YouTube channel, chock full o' funny videos. And as always with Kickstarter, if we don't meet our goal, you'll get your money back in full. Where has all this\u00a0been cooked up? At Montepallars, a retreat centre in a stunning village in the foothills of the Spanish Pyrenees. There, people get a chance to discover a new passion, explore their creativity or simply focus on what they really like doing. In all its workshops, nature provides the starting point to inspire that creativity. Montepallars offers all kinds of workshop holidays: yoga, drawing, writing, painting and more, as well as cooking, of course! Whatever the subject, I provide the food, always cooking scrumptious, healthy food prepared with lots of love.\u00a0",
  "I've been cooking with my family since I was a young child. My late grandmother was making drop scones with my sister and I in her ancient tiled kitchen before I could even read. My mother taught me how to make risotto and bolognese, goats cheese tart and bean chilli. In part, this recipe book is homage to the women in my family who imparted a love of food that has stayed with me my whole life. It's also a love letter to every busy, exhausted, disorganised home cook who loves food but struggles to manage four different pots at once and follow instructions that seem to contain 100 steps to make one meal. I see you. I am you. I'm an autistic home cook with ADHD, and something I know I'm not alone in struggling with is my executive function - my ability to organise and prioritise tasks, and plan ahead. Focusing on complicated information feels impossible when I'm time limited or already tired from a long day. This recipe book aims to be different. It aims to bring you glorious, nourishing food to bring you comfort or entertain your friends without stressing you out. These recipes are easy to follow, require minimal equipment (hello one pan meals!) and all take under an hour to prepare. Using many of the same core ingredients in different ways, and making incredible meals with everyday spices, your weekly food shop doesn't have to be agonising to plan. What's more, with this book, you'll dish up family favourites without creating a daunting pile of dishes. I'm now hoping to work towards a NEW STRETCH GOAL OF \u00a35,000 for an audio book version after many requests. This will be available a month after the e-book and paperback versions are released, to give me time to record audio files of the highest quality.\u00a0 It's taken ten years of writing food blogs to get here. This recipe book has been a dream of mine since I was a teenager, and I'm just months away from realising it. The money raised on Kickstarter will go towards a professional photoshoot, cover design, formatting and editing, and of course towards your pledge rewards. Thank you for helping my dream become a reality.",
  "ABOUT: F.L.Y. is a labor of love that was born in the heart of the pandemic. \u00a0A slice-of-life comedy with humor and heart that captures the emotions of such time.\u00a0 THE STORY: When two ex-boyfriends (Max and Rafael), who haven't seen each other in five years, reunite -- the covid pandemic hits, and they're forced to quarantine together. In the years that have passed since they last saw each other in New York, Max has built a new life in Los Angeles working as a freelance editor. Max has spent most of his free time with his new boyfriend Hunter, who's a fitness instructor, while Rafael has been rebuilding his identity as a non-binary human who's excited to explore the art of drag with hopes of becoming a drag superstar.\u00a0 POST-PRODUCTION NEEDS: We raised enough money to finish principal photography but now we need your help to raise the remainder and finish the post-production phase and make the movie that we've dreamed of. In our video, you can see some of the incredible footage we've captured. None of this footage will come to life without the help and mastering of the following post-production areas: MUSIC NEEDS: Additionally, music was very important for most of us during the pandemic and there are specific songs that we'd love to include in our film that will add to the magic and tones we envision. These are some of the songs we'd love to have in our film: With your help, we'll be able to hire a music supervisor to help us navigate music licensing. Acquiring songs can be a long and difficult legal process.\u00a0 THE ASK: F.L.Y. It's fun, it's campy. it's a feel-good film, it's a labor of love that was born from a dream. \u00a0But we cannot tell this story without the help of others who feel its spark. And believe in its vision.\u00a0 When we were stuck in the worst part of lockdown, we dreamed up the movie we wished we could watch- one that helped us remember to laugh and not take it all so seriously. One that could feel like a warm hug in the moments of despair and loss. One that could show us the opportunities of healing that only come when we pause and look inside. \u00a0 F.L.Y. \u00a0is a queer film - we need more queer stories - there's a space and a supportive audience for them. But they don't get made without champions. Storytellers need champions. We hope you\u2019ll be ours. \u00a0 Love, Rafael Albarr\u00e1n & Trent Kendrick\u00a0",

  "I started Crust Fund Pizza in August 2020 as a way to making lemonade out of the lemons of my personal shortcomings. People flooded the streets seeking justice, equality, and a better future. I on the other hand, was/am a lumpy fella in khaki shorts whose only identifiable skills were tavern pizza and shameless hucksterism. It's easy, in those moments, to feel helpless and quit. But I figured if I could make pizza, I could at the very least make pizza to benefit the organizations and people with the actual skillset to make Chicago a better place.\u00a0 Fast forward one year and I'm still selling as many pizzas as I can, but the home kitchen's only so big. So here's the logical next step -- a community cookbook inspired by the Midwestern church cookbooks of yore. Spiral-bound, packed with recipes, and featuring all the folks that the editor could harass into unpaid participation. The only difference here is that I know a veritable Avengers of Chicago pizza folks. Throw in on this project and you're getting guidance from:\u00a0 We originally printed Pizza for Everyone with a few advertising bucks and whatever birthday money I could scrounge from people who didn't consider that I am almost 40 and thus not really deserving of birthday presents. But those went fast, so we're turning to this here platform for a larger run. Money raised here will cover a second printing, mailing for some tiers, a pizza party for others, and one very strange plaque should that option get picked. I've looked at this thing roughly a thousand times since we started putting it together in Fall 2020. I still stop to read it, because it absolutely rules. You'll dig it.",

  "Logline: On January 1st, 2000; The rapture begins, leaving Wallace Wexler, (the owner of the pet insurance company, \u201cY2K-9\u201d), to fulfill his empty promises. Along the way, Wallace seeks dogs, meaningful connection, and for purpose in an empty world. Welcome to the Kickstarter for, \"Y2K-9\". A 12-minute Short thesis film written and directed by me, Liam Kimmons.\u00a0 We have come to Kickstarter to ask for additional funding to assist in the post-production process. This story requires a fair amount of visual effects elements, a full original orchestral score, as well as a full festival run + distribution. Every little bit counts and even your time and attention alone means the world to me as well as the rest of the Y2K-9 crew.\u00a0 When the world ends in biblical rapture on Y2K-9 Wallace Wexler is left alone to their own devices. Without his mother; Wallace attempts to follow through on the promise he made to his customers. Along the way, Wallace befriends Fergus, the 14-year old owner of Bruce. Unfortunately, Bruce is nowhere to be found. This leads to Wallace and Fergus joining forces in hopes of finding the teen\u2019s best friend. Will they find Bruce, or will the pair be left stranded once more? The major theme of, Y2K-9, is, \u201cWho are We Without the Ones We Love?\u201d; a question that is meant to be aimed directly at the viewer. Without those who hold us accountable, what holds us into the personality trait made on our own. This film is being made with the direct intention of trying to raise spirits after a particularly tumultuous time in modern history. As a way to decompress and re-evaluate what\u2019s important in life. This story has been easily the most challenging one I have ever tried to make. The script has been in development for the better part of two years, with nearly twenty drafts completed. I based the experiences shared in, \"Y2K-9\", on my time growing up in blue-collar Ontario and how the middle class struggles to make an honest living. I was also inspired by some of my earliest influences as a filmmaker, specifically Steven Spielberg. I have always found his mastery of tone between scenes to be particularly impressive. With, \"Y2K-9\", we want the audience to feel each tonal shift naturally, allowing for us to infuse the happy with the sad. To tell a story of happiness surrounded by a world of despair. We have already assembled our crew, are in the process of finalizing our casting decisions and have locked all of our locations. We are nearly ready to go and our start date of shooting in about a month has our team excited beyond belief. Though we have our production costs covered, we need your support in order to make, \"Y2K-9\", the crowd-pleasing Dramedy we know it can be. Please consider donating. It would mean the world to us to see this off-kilter vision come to life. \u00a0\u00a0",
  "Do you remember your first time? It was probably awkward at the best of times. But do you remember what you did moments before? Transparency tells the story of a young couple who have decided to have sex for the first time. We follow their experience at their local liquor store where they go to pick up condoms. As much as our two main characters, Rosalind and Hugo, have mentally prepared for this day, they quickly come to realize they don't actually know what they're doing. Their sex education has completely failed them. They know they should get condoms, but which ones? Latex? Flavored? Ribbed? What does it all mean? To add to their experience, an older eccentric couple have decided to help the younger couple by offering unsolicited advice.\u00a0 While uncomfortable, each character walks away learning something new.\u00a0 This is a comedy that is meant to start a conversation around the subject of our poor sexual education system in America.\u00a0Entertaining through Educating. Not-so-fun- fun fact: Less than half the states require sex ed, fewer require it be medically accurate and even less states require that students are taught about contraception and sexuality. It's kind of outrageous that for as long as humans have lived, sex has been a part of life and yet it's still a taboo subject to talk about.\u00a0 The fact is, kids are having sex and many are not protecting themselves against std's and unwanted pregnancies. This can be easily avoided if these kids are taught proper sex education that covers contraception, sexuality, awareness, and guilt free guidance.\u00a0 With your donation, you can help spread awareness that we, as in the human race, have to learn to be comfortable talking about sex to our youth. Because they need it as much as we did.\u00a0 Every cent of your donation goes directly in funding this project. Costs for the project include our location rental, equipment rental, prop and set design, and meal and crafty for our hardworking cast and crew. Anything extra will be used to market the film and help spread awareness as far as we can.\u00a0 We are Ariely Garcia and Capucine Salvi-Offer, both filmmakers in Los Angeles, passionate about telling stories, advocating for female empowerment in film production, and pushers of sexual awareness for our youth so that they are protected from disease and unwanted pregnancy. We are asking that you help us take on this issue by supporting us in making this film possible.\u00a0 We thank you so much in advance and we appreciate your time clicking to this link.

  "Being basically a human right's reporter, my most interest is to stay among the people, see how they live, tell stories of poverty, of rights that mostly are trampled. Stories that mainstream media would not tell. I am based in London, for question of time and study. But now, with the \"Majid AlSadi Changing Lives Programme\" I have the chance, also as professional experience and as course of study, to do a 9 days trip (from the 16 to 25 September this year) in Jordan. My partecipation on this \"Changing Lives\" in Jordan, creating a journalism photo documentary, would make aware citizen that people in need are not alone. I will depart with a group of 13 other students, and i want describe how is this experience, in images. I am used to travel abroad, and I have been almost anywhere in Europe, and 2 times in Iran, but still I had not yet a chance to do a photo journalism project outside Europe (In Iran I didn't go as reporter, just as tourist, and I practiced on photography, using analogic cameras)  I am interested in Journalism (Photo and video) and in human\n     rights, apart other subjects such as sport, facts and events\n     happening in local areas of London.\n     I am much interested in the relationships between Middle East and\n     Western culture, both political and belief, and socially.\n     Although I am Christian, I think that other religions, such as\n     Islam, should not be discriminated or manipulated for political\n     or economical interests, such as human trafficking, weapons\n     traffic and wars.\n     I cover very often, as camera operator and photographer, events\n     related to Middle East and Africa. My last related work, this\n     January, was a conference in Ireland, about \"Irish and Muslim\n     Brothers Behind Bars\", a campaign that supports political\n     prisoners.\n     I have also been in Iran in the past (in 2005 and 2006) as\n     tourist, and I felt that, apart our different beliefs and\n     cultures, there was something that unites us: we both are\n     humans, with feelings and mind, often similar. It was interesting\n     to find words very similar to other languages, such as Italian\n     comparing to Farsi. I found the atmosphere of oppression that\n     reigns among them, the strong desire of freedom and democracy,\n     and of peace. In 2013 (February and June) I covered, as press\n     photographer, the 10 International Conference of the NCRI\n     (National Council of Iranian Resistance) in Paris, and I had the\n     chance to meet in person its president Maryam Rajavi. That event\n     signed a significant step in my professional career as\n     photojournalist.\n     Apart my personal ideology, which is moderately on left side, I\n     prefer to keep myself independent and instead of participating\n     actively on an organisation, I remain critical and open to watch\n     the different sides of a coin.This does not mean that I agree on\n     organisations and their ideology, but I aim to document facts as\n     I perceive them.\n     Other events includes conferences with important human rights\n     lawyers, such as Dennis Hedney, who defended political prisoners\n     at Guantanamo's Bay, and Clive Stafford Smith, legal director of\n     the human rights's organisation \"Reprieve\".\n     I met, and recorded a interviews with Norman Solomon, author of\n     the book \"War made Easy\", and the reporter Jeremy Scahill, who\n     created the interesting documentary \"Dirty Wars\", about the\n     difficult relationship between wars and the economical/political\n     interests that those wars hide behind the legitimacy for\n     democracy proclaimed to justify a militar intervention in Iraq,\n     Afghanistan and Syria.\n     My last report was, on the 6th this month, a pacific protest in\n     front of Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, where inside it\n     was the presentation of the Chilcot Report.I am also interested in landscape, night, travel, social/ethnic\n     photography and in video documentaries. Per gli Italiani:  Salve Ragazzi,  Mi chiamo Santino. Studio Media Contemporanea (Contemporary Media Practice) all'universita' di Westminster a Londra. Ora sono an terzo e ultimo anno.  A tempo perso faccio il freelance Foto/Video reporter su temi quali diritti umani, politica, sport ed eventi, fatti di attualita' e altro. Ho registrato parecchie conferenze, tra cui una con Marco Travaglio e due con Beppe Severgnini, e con avvocati di diritti umani di fama internazionale quali Dennis Hedney, che ha difeso diversi prigionieri di Guantanamo Bay, E Clive Stafford Smith, professore di diritti umani, e responsabile dell'organizzazione \"Reprieve\". Nel 2013 sono stato anche a riprendere il 10mo annual meeting dell'NCRI (National Council for the Resistance in Iran, in Febbraio e Giugno 2013) e ho avuto l'occasione di incontare il suo presidente, Maryam Rajavi, di cui ho ripreso in una conferenza stampa.  Il mio intento qui e' di partecipare al \"Majid AlSadi Changing Lives Programme\" In Giordania, un'organizzazione che aiuta bambini e persone bisognose in paesi disastrati, in mezzo a guerre e carestie. Il mio intento qui e' di creare un foto documentario su questo programma, seguendo passo a passo le attivita' dell'organizzazione. il Programma sil solge tra il 16 e il 25 Settembre in Giordania, e faro' parte di un gruppo di 14 studenti della Westminster. L'iniziativa e' appoggiata e finanziata dall'Universita' di Westminser, infatti. Questa per me e' un'importante esperienza sia per il conseguimento dei miei studi e come tappa fondamentale nella mia carriera giornalistica. \nMa soprattutto partecipo a questo programma perche' penso che i diritti fondamentali dell'uomo, quali la sopravvivenza e un adeguato servizio sanitario, una buona istruzione, siano diritti inalienabili per ogni signolo essere umano, non riservati alla casta eletta. \nQuesto documentario ha lo scopo di valorizzare questi diritti, e anche il diritto di informazione e di espressione, e il diritto di stampa.  Ovviamente questa campagna costa a me parecchi sacrifici, e rischi (la Giordania non e' un paese molto tranquillo, trovandosi nel mezzo di una guerra fratricida). Ho anche bisogno di apparecchiature adeguate, quali una macchina fotografica professionale (Io attualmente ho una Nikon D7100, ma per questo progetto vorrei usare una D810) un flash dedicato, e lenti adeguate (supergrandangolari e teleobiettivi).  \nIo supporto la campagna devolvendo parte dei fondi che raccolgo in questa pagina. Supportate me, e non ve ne pentirete. In cambio quello che offro e' questo: \n- Un libro fotografico di almeno 100 immagini, del costo di \u00a3100 (equivalente a circa 118 Euro). Il libro sara' disponibile da Dicembre 2016, e puo' essere spedito in ogni parte del mondo. \n- Un album fotografico con una selezione delle 10 immagini migliori, ad un costo di \u00a315 (circa 17.70 Euro). L'album fotografico sara disponibile da fine Ottobre Hai letto sino alla fine queste righe? sei convinto che questa sia una buona e lodevole iniziativa per aiutare persone bisognose ? Supporta questa campagna.  Grazie  Links: https://www.facebook.com/MajidAlSadiChangingLivesProgramhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3t_f3O2Eochttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wAGIwDhSCc",
  "The Interruption is a Lancaster/Harrisburg/NYC based music crew spearheaded by Douglas Thomas. Five years ago Douglas pulled together a diverse group of talented musicians to help him craft and perform a collection of songs he'd composed. \u00a0Michael Ray Fisher, a Broadway singer from New York took on lead vocals. DeJuan Rosado, AKA Spoken Musik, a prolific and accomplished percussionist known for his work in the local gospel scene came on as the drummer. Benjamin Weiss, who goes by the stage name Teheru, was recruited to write and perform rap/spoken word verses. But after playing just a few gigs, a series of mishaps resulted in the disintegration of the project.\u00a0 Fortunately, four years later the stars aligned and The Interruption was reborn in spectacular fashion. The group added masterful Congolese guitarist/bassist Emmanuel Nsingani. They began playing shows again and built a local following. The five musicians started recording an 11 song album. After working for months on the first five songs, it became apparent that the collection of music would work best as two short EP's with the names \"Foreplay\" and \"HindSight.\" The first EP is set to be released on Friday May 13th. To celebrate, The Interruption will host an album release party at Zoetropolis Cinema & Stillhouse in Lancaster featuring three live sets of music performed by the band.\u00a0 Five songs of Hip-Hop/R&B bliss for your pure enjoyment.

  "With its cinematic style and pacing, The Pale has often been compared to a mix of shows like True Detective, Fargo, Twin Peaks, and The X-Files. The character driven story-line and the unique twist on a familiar genre will definitely resonate with fans of those shows. The comic follows Franklin Ink, one of the FBI\u2019s top linguists and translators, as he searches for a mysterious killer from his past.\u00a0Franklin has a condition called prosopagnosia, more commonly known as face-blindness-- the inability\u00a0to retain facial information. \"A lone FBI agent teams up with a sheriff, his deputy and a Navajo cop while investing a mysterious body that is linked to a long string of killings. He must navigate through the small-town landscape while hiding the fact that he is not acting on behalf of the bureau... all while keeping his face-blindness a secret from the Sheriff.\n\n\u00a0He will soon discover that he\u2019s not the only one keeping secrets.\" - The Pale website\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The series trailer (combines art from original Chapters 1 + 2)\u00a0 \"The Pale is absolutely stunning.

  "Virtual Acoustic\u00ae TS-2 True Wireless Earbuds are designed and manufactured using Qualcomm\u00ae QCC3020 chipset of BT 5.0 and Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122 audio encoding & decoding technology, which brings you the solid connection and high quality sound. It comes accompanied with a base box that has a built-in battery and is applied as a charger and a BT speaker. Starting $59 per set True wireless earbuds are common in the market. However due to the use of different brands chipsets, the quality of earbuds from different providers vary from one to another, and some of them have the quality issues like bad connection, signal drop, unclear sound, much power consumption, short play time \u2026\u2026 etc., which have caused much inconvenience to end users. Virtual Acoustic\u00ae TS-2 true wireless earbuds are DIFFERENT ! Our true wireless earbuds TS-2, is professionally designed using world leading Qualcomm\u00ae QCC3020 chipset of BT 5.0 and Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122 encoding & decoding technology. It differs from others. The highlights are :\u00a0\u00a0 Virtual Acoustic\u00ae TS-2 true wireless earbuds use advanced Qualcomm\u00ae QCC3020 chipset of BT 5.0 technology, to meet the needs of the industry as the global wireless standard for simple, secure connectivity, and to ensure the super stable stereo sound is obtained. This transformative BT 5.0 technology significantly increases the range and speed of connectivity, thus the super stability of wireless connection. With application of Qualcomm\u00ae QCC3020 chipset of BT 5.0 technology featuring 4x range, 2x speed, 8x data traffic, as well as PIFA antenna, our TS-2 secures you a super stable and an uninterrupted connection even in data crowed places. Unlike other wireless BT earbuds that one earbud receives BT signal and then transmits to the other, both of two earbuds of Virtual Acoustic\u00ae TS-2 receive BT signal \u00a0independently and simultaneouslyfrom audio devices. This strongly enhances the stability of BT signal connection and transmission. Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122 audio codec is widely used on world\u2019s finest smartphones, speakers, tablets. With application of this technology, our TS-2 earbuds deliver audio of more consistent, higher resolution and lower latency to enhance the much better wireless sound quality. Previous wireless BT earbuds in market can ONLY have one earbud working when making/taking a call, so you listen to the call only in ONE ear. Benefited from Qualcomm\u00ae QCC3020 chipset and BT 5.0 technology, both of two earbuds of our TS-2 are connected to smart phones independently and simultaneously, meaning when making/taking a call, you listen to it in Both of Ears. A different experience. Due to the limitation of chipset used, two sides of most of the existing wireless BT earbuds in the market cannot receive audio signal simultaneously, namely one earbud receives audio and then transmits to the other. This eventually consumes more power of battery. Needless to say, the earbuds play time is shortened. With the application of advanced Qualcomm\u00ae QCC3020 chipset of BT 5.0, Virtual Acoustic\u00ae TS-2 is professionally designed to have two sides of earbuds receive audio signal independently and simultaneously with no more extra transmission, which saves battery power consumption by 50% at most and extends the play time. With analysis of dozens of different ear shapes, Virtual Acoustic\u00ae TS-2 is finely engineered to have the best ergonomic fit for ears. It brings you the pleasure of not only enjoyment of high quality audio but also experience of more comfortable wearing, even you are on a move. Virtual Acoustic\u00ae TS-2 earbuds are accompanied with a holding box and a base box. Each box has a built-in battery already installed. There are two ways to charge TS-2 as follows : With smart pairing technology applied, Virtual Acoustic\u00ae TS-2 earbuds are required to pair with BT devices manually only for the first time. After that, any time the moment TS-2 is taken out of holding box, the moment it is instantly and automatically connected to the same BT device that has been paired. No hassle or extra process. Many wireless earbuds in the market are set some touch controls on one side of earbuds and other touch controls on the other side. This is confusing and hard to remember. Our TS-2 is designed to provide you with much easier and more convenient operation of touch controls by tapping EITHER of two earbuds. Placing holding box that has TS-2 earbuds in onto base box turns base box into a Bluetooth Speaker automatically and immediately. Yes it\u2019s that simple. Enjoy music via this BT Speaker. Under this circumstance, base box is also a Charger.",
  "With the support of a generous backer we were able to already place an order at our factory in China. They started making some samples which we can show to you. In the other part of this Kickstarter page you'll find pictures of the black cable which is not the reward you'll finally get, it will be the awesome premium cable as seen below. The JackSavior black edition is an instrument cable with a black JackSavior jack plug and a comfortable cable. The JackSavior plug is a jack where the wires are connected inside the plug resulting in a smaller, flexible and 10x stronger audio jack. With this cool looking black jack instrument cable you can enjoy playing your favorite instrument without being afraid of breaking the output jack of your instrument or amplifier. The JackSavior Black edition instrument cable is a 10 ft comfortable instrument cable with 1/4\u201d (6.35 mm) JackSavior black jack plugs. The black nickel plated plugs are one of a kind, which gives you a unique looking cable. The final product that will be your reward for supporting us will include a braided cable, which is not yet included in the pictures of this campaign.\u00a0 Specifications: The JackSavior plug is an audio jack where the wires are connected inside the plug resulting in a smaller, flexible and 10x stronger audio jack. This prevents any external forces from touching the connection, preventing jack plug and jack input failure. The JackSavior plug is the smaller connector in the picture below: We have already produced a batch of products\u00a0with our newly found OEM partner for our first B2B customer! We have made a 10 feet (3 meter) cable for an awesome acoustic electric violin from Eastman Strings! Our goal is to prevent jack plug failure, so you can keep on playing your instrument. We try to do this by offering our JackSavior technology to well known cable and plug manufacturers or brands to incorporate it in their products. We make the JackSavior technology implementation easier for the factories by running a project with them, which we offer to pay for. This offered instrument cable is such a project. We aim to reach as much people as possible with this project to get the following word on the street: There is a new jack plug in town which is smaller, flexible and 10x stronger. The beginning The design of audio jacks found in modern headphones dates back to 1876 and was invented by Tividar Pusk\u00e1s. It is by no means a bad design, but at JackSavior, we feel that an update is long overdue. Audio jacks break frequent between the wires and the plug. We solve this by connecting the wires inside. But selling headphones makes no sense, as there are already many great brands selling audio products and our founder Bouwy is not Dr. Dre. We are licensing out the technology to these brands but apparently, no manager is interested in preventing jack failure problems for their customers. So we ran a crowdfunding campaign to pay for the first tooling and convince big brands to incorporate the JackSavior plug into their products. What happened after the first crowdfunding campaign? We shipped all the promised rewards/perks and our goal of convincing big brands succeeded as multiple brands want to have it. They requested a quotation from their factory, who did not give any reply to that request. They said that they cannot give a quotation as they cannot estimate the planning sufficiently to comply with planning rules and involved penalties. This is because they have no experience with making a million JackSavior plugs. We have to buildup to those order sizes\u00a0and increase manufacturability to achieve predictability for those big manufacturers. Small OEM partner to grow\u00a0predictable manufacturing We decided to find\u00a0a smaller\u00a0factory to cooperate with us and increase manufacturability and thereby the predictability of the whole process. We will be growing from this factory towards the big factories to ultimately\u00a0supply to the big headphone brands. We need to produce products to identify optimizations in the production process. This campaign will help us to pay for these production batches and save the world from jack failure. We've been around in the jack plug business for a couple of years and often wondered why plugs don\u2019t have any color, except silver or gold. We stumbled on some sample material with a black zinc coating. Unfortunately, this was not wear resistant, it was easily scratchable. In the discussion with our local metal supplier, black nickel came out as a possibility! Why aren\u2019t there any other black jacks? We think it\u2019s because it is harder to solder. But with the JackSavior production process we can solder this difficult material. This gives you the opportunity to be rewarded with a cool looking cable and spreading the JackSavior technology. The first prototype of the JackSavior black edition is demonstrated in the video below. You'll hear that the black nickel plating is not affecting the performance of the cable. We furthermore tested the conductivity in the factory and confirmed that the black plating doesn't affect the signal transfer. The cable in this prototype is just a sample, the reward will be shipped with a premium 5 mm braided cable. We solder the wires inside the plug that goes inside your device. This part is not moving constantly, which results in the 10x better test results. Thanks to https://max.guitars/ who where so kind to let us film some cool shots in their store.",

Our goal is $20,000, when everything is added up together, that's the minimum of (half! of) what it will take to make a second season that lives up to the quality of the first. \u00a0With your help, we can do this!\u00a0",

  "\u00a0We\u2019re Remace Active and we believe fitness should be fun. This is why we created the Remace Jump Rope system, so anyone, at any level of physical strength, could feel better and get stronger. We want our community to be motivated to stick their fitness goals by how jumping makes them feel each and every day. We chose to create a jump rope because of how effective jumping rope really is. Jumping rope engages more muscles than any other form of cardio. The weighted ropes add resistance so you can get a great upper body workout while building strength and gaining endurance. Our design is one-of-a-kind and our Jump Rope System considers the everyday obstacles a person might face on their fitness journey. Bored? Attend one of our free jumping classes. Want more of a challenge? Switch to a heavier rope. Traveling? You don\u2019t have to worry about breaking up your routine, you can easily take your jump rope with you wherever you go. Short on time? A ten-minute workout can burn up to 300 calories. Like working out with a partner? Share one with a friend. With the Remace Jump Rope system, you\u2019re set up for success. Cardio never felt so good. You don\u2019t need a personal trainer, gym membership or expensive equipment to get in shape. The Remace Jump rope is a fraction of the price of other, more costly, traditional fitness options and more effective. Doing long workouts everyday is unsustainable for most people. Using The Remace Jump Rope for just 10 minutes a day can burn up to 300 calories. We value your support which is why we use transparent pricing so you know exactly what you are paying for and why. Sharing the Remace Jump Rope campaign with friends and family is a great way you can help to support this project. To show our appreciation to those who do so, we will include a free jump rope carrying pouch to anyone who helps us spread the word. Just let us know in the comments when you do so and we\u2019ll add the pouch to your order. \u00a0Our solid aluminum handles are coated with a high-quality gripping material so you can go as hard as you want and never have to worry about wear and tear. Our ropes are made to be used in any environment and condition. With tons of live and prerecorded classes to choose from, our app is the perfect way to hold yourself accountable and stay consistent. Keep your routine fresh and fun. Get the Remace Training app Free Forever with any pledge amount during our Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. After the campaign ends and our digital services officially launches the price will be $9.99 per month or $99 per year.\u00a0 Use our size chart to determine which jump rope size is right for you. Sizing is essential working out with comfort and ease. We\u2019ve spent the past year designing and redesigning the perfect rope. One that was both durable and effective. Our ropes are designed to be used daily and on any surface. To make The Remace Jump Rope a reality we need to meet the volume and manufacturing requirements. We chose to go on Kickstarter because we saw it as a way of including our community in some of the behind the scenes of what it takes to bring an idea like this to life.",

  "Appalachia is a region of the country largely ignored and misunderstood. While traveling to my family's house in bigger cities, I have learned that many people do not have the correct image about this place. They think it is just the Beverly Hillbillies before they struck oil. Sad to say, this is not the case. People have to live in campers in homes that are falling into the ground and there are no jobs to be found anywhere. People are on drugs and the stories get sadder to where government agencies are telling people that they will not get a job even if they have an impressive and experienced resume in an industry that can be used here (Story from a heavy machine operator who became unemployed when the mine shut down) I intend to expose this story to the rest of the world and show the nation how the other half lives in the rural ghettos of America. These people only resort to crime and drugs out of depression and despration of the lack of ability to make a living in this region. Most people don't want to live off the goverment for the rest of their lives, but they have to. This book is intended to prove to the world what life is really like, the horrors and to hopefully inspire bigger action to be taken to help boost this forsaken region of the nation.\u00a0",
  "ToeJam & Earl\u2019s Funky Fresh Foods of Funkotron is a colorful, weird, and funky cookbook coming to you soon. This official cookbook draws inspiration from the classic ToeJam & Earl video game series as well as real world foods and flavors. You don't have to be a fan of the series to get behind this cookbook. Just like the game series it's based on, Funky Fresh Foods is designed for beginners and pros alike. You don't have to be familiar with the series to jump in and enjoy the recipes in this cookbook! There is something for everyone in this book. It's weird, it's alien, it's interesting! \u2604\ufe0f Funky Fresh Foods of Funkotron tells the story of how the groovy extraterrestrial duo, ToeJam and Earl, embark on an epic quest from the Funkapotamus himself to bring new tastes, interstellar peace, and funky, fresh flavors to planet Earth. This cookbook is chock full of classic dishes re-imagined with a vibrant, otherworldly vibe. How about a funky beat cake made with real beets? Would you try some Tomato Jam and Earl Grey shortbread cookies (a specialty of Mama Flo)? Oh, maybe Big Earl will finally share the secret recipe behind his world famous hot dog! Sounds weird, looks weirder, but all tastes amazing. Funky Fresh Foods will teach you to prepare meals that will take your taste buds to the moon and back. \ud83d\ude80 ToeJam & Earl is all about fun and trying out new things, just like our recipes! The series has always been about bringing people together and showing them new cultures and ideas with excitement, mystery, and imagination. This cookbook continues that tradition. We won't just show you new recipes, we'll also teach you a lot about how to cook and how much fun it can be. This isn't the first time we've made a cookbook either. Members of the team behind this cookbook have previously worked on two incredible culinary projects that were both major successes: Mother's Cookbook and The Legend's Cookbook. With all that experience and a brand new intergalactic setting, we\u2019ll expand your mind and taste buds with far out dishes that will change the way you think about yourself, the universe, and food. \ud83d\udef8 If you're not familiar with the ToeJam & Earl series, that's ok! We'll give you a super quick rundown. The series debuted on the SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive back in 1991 and was a cult hit with three more entries made since then. The newest game, ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove, released in 2019 on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. \u00a0The games star intergalactic alien rappers, ToeJam (the red one) and Earl (the yellow one), who crash their ship on our planet. Not only do they make a mess, they also run around collecting the parts of their ship, getting into trouble, and eating everything they can get their hands on (even though sometimes they probably shouldn't eat that moldy bread). The gameplay is fun and fast-paced with an emphasis on randomly generated levels, a funk-inspired soundtrack, and a healthy dose of 90's nostalgia. You don't have to be a TJ&E fan to enjoy this cookbook, but if this cookbook has piqued your interest, check out the games. They're a lot of fun. \ud83d\ude42 Now that we've covered the source material, we can talk about the book more! ToeJam & Earl\u2019s Funky Fresh Foods of Funkotron will be available in digital, paperback, and hardcover formats so you can choose (I always opt for the hardcover because I always get too much butter on my fingers to use my tablet). The book will be 8\" x 10\" (20.3cm x 25.4cm) and contain over 100 pages of funktastic photos, art, and recipes. You'll find over 44 original recipes (with the possibility of more with stretch goals \ud83d\ude09). This is a quality-made book too, unlike certain spaceships. It\u2019ll hold up to kitchen use with a strong smyth sewn binding, deliciously heavyweight internal paper stock (makes the pages sauce-resistant), and a hardy matte laminate cover to keep the stains away. \ud83d\udcaa Food has been a longtime staple in all manner of video games. The ToeJam & Earl series is no exception to that. The dynamic duo have been running around and chowing down on all kinds of comfort food ever since the first game. As a kid, I always wondered what an alien's take on pizza or ice cream would be and now I finally have the opportunity to show everybody! I also figured aliens probably ate a little bit healthier than most Earthlings, part of being an advanced civilization and such. With that in mind, this cookbook will heavily feature healthy recipes and vegetarian options and won\u2019t contain any recipes that have red meat (then what\u2019s in Earl\u2019s hot dog??? Guess you'll have to back it to find out.) Here's a link to seven sample recipes! Not to mention, the food in our cookbook looks absolutely out-of-this-world and we know you'll want to show it off on social media. Hopefully it'll inspire some of your friends to try out some of our nutritious nosh. That being said, we want you all to live long and prosper. \ud83d\udd96 Hi! My name is June Kirsch and I'll be your fresh chef today on this funky adventure of a cookbook. I have been cooking forever. I just love it. I went to the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York and graduated in 2016 with a degree in Culinary Arts and Applied Food Studies. Or, as I like to call, \"How to Make Food and How to Make it Good\".\u00a0 My philosophy about cooking has always been about bringing people together. Meals are best shared and sometimes even if you can't be in the same room as someone, you can share a recipe with them and be a part of their life. I was born in Kenya and spent most of my childhood moving all over the planet, but we always made a point to share our meals together. It brought us together no matter the distance. I learned a lot about cooking from all of my travels and my experience in culinary school but the best place to learn how to cook is your own kitchen. ToeJam & Earl resonates with me because they came to a new place, tried different things, and went outside their comfort zone, and these are all things I'm hoping to bring to this cookbook! I'm happy to be your pilot and I hope we don't crash land, but even if we do, I'm sure we'll have a great time making all manner of Funky Fresh Foods! We\u2019ve been working on this cookbook for quite a while! We started cooking almost a year ago, coinciding with the release of ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove. \u00a0A few of them have been tweaked a little since then, but you should check out our awesomely funky cooking videos. \ud83c\udfa5 Our plan is to wrap up our taste testing and finalize our recipes. We\u2019ve been at it a while so that\u2019s nearly done. Then we finish up all our art and photos. Then we get the books printed and shipped out to all you hungry backers. \ud83e\udd61 We have a few unlockable recipes waiting for only the funkiest of funklords. We're talking, of course, about our new Community Challenges! Community Challenges are a fun way for you to join your fellow fans and unlock additional recipes just by posting on social media.

We held our very first exhibition booth at the \u00a0Hong Kong Trade and Development Council's Spring Electronic Fair 2019. It was truly inspiring to be in contact with the potential clients face to face. Soilife aims at the provision of smart lifestyle products that supports human beings in all contexts.

  "Could we take the sound of an analog legend and craft it for the future? The answer\u2013after years of development\u2013was the creation of the SB01 (Space Bee) analog synthesizer. \u00a0 An instrument that puts classic sound in a modern package and adds a number of essential upgrades.\u00a0 The SB01 is the world's thinnest and first rechargeable analog synthesizer. While the SB01 is a new form of synthesizer, it may sound familiar to many\u2013our inspiration was one of the sonic engines that laid the foundation of electronic music. We worked with Open Music Labs to create and carefully hone a 1:1 version of the signature circuits that bring it to life. \u00a0 A 3340 voltage controlled oscillator feeds into a 4-pole OTA filter that makes for an iconic and unmistakable sound. Make it snap and sing with responsive analog envelopes, modulation, and portamento, or bring in external CV for deeper VCO and VCF control. For us, true portability meant incorporating fully rechargeable battery power. A generous 16-hour battery life allows for extended usage between charges. In addition, the battery is user-replaceable to ensure an instrument that lasts many years into the future.\u00a0 - Nick Kwas (WANDERTALK)\u00a0 We created a flexible new step sequencer for the SB01, centered around fluid live performance and intuitive for all skill levels. Simply load a sequence by entering notes in order, along with rests or slides, and hit play. Patterns with up to 256 notes can be saved in 64 different locations. \n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While playing, queue up stored sequences with CHAIN mode or start them immediately with JUMP. In addition, we've included a unique MODULO mode for interleaving sequences. A sequence direction modifier and transpose latching function enable new possibilities, while the arpeggiator gives you several modes including random play.\u00a0 A dual-sequencer means two different independent sequences can run simultaneously on internal and external tracks. This means you can drive external CV or MIDI gear with the SB01 keyboard, arpeggiator, or sequencer while having the same freedom onboard. To aid with performance, a color-coded layer feature always lets you see which track is active. Earlier this year we brought several SB01 prototypes to the Superbooth tradeshow in Berlin, where we showed the synth for the first time and got our first feedback from musicians. Check out press coverage here: Our instrument not only reimagines what a modern synthesizer can do, but how it can be made. Machined out of a single block of aluminum, the SB01 was an exercise in distilling a synth to its most essential form.\u00a0 Full-size tactile keys rise from a rugged, yet portable casing that is compact enough to fit into a carry-on suitcase, or our accessory tote bag.\u00a0 \u2014AXEL HARTMANN\u00a0 Ultra-compact form was enabled by a newly-developed keyboard design based on a quiet, fast-action rubber dome switch. Each tactile and electronic element was custom developed for optimal performance, using the highest quality components. Our fundamental goal was to build something that lasts. Built in the US, using the highest-quality components, the SB01 is a no-compromise performance instrument.\u00a0\u00a0 From the individual component selection to the keyboard action and metal construction, every aspect of the SB01 was designed to be long lasting and repairable. With a background in music performance and vintage synthesizer restoration, our founder and designer Ben Stamas understood the need for reliability that spans the life of the instrument. True to these values, we are planning to release the circuit schematic and firmware of the SB01 and future products to allow for longevity well into the future. The SB01 is the first synthesizer from Superlative,\u00a0and also one that demonstrates our vision going forward- truly portable, next-generation performance instruments that are built to last. We are working on several new products, but excited to bring you the SB01 as our debut.\u00a0We look forward to hearing from our backers and giving them a chance to provide feedback as we put on the final touches. To indicate where we are in this process, we have: More support lets us add more features to the SB01, so here's what we want to add if can reach these targets:",
  "You have hundreds of CD which are sitting there waiting to be digitalised. \u00a0Dedicated CD ripper are expensive , reusing a PC takes up space and use more electricity than needed.

  "So Slim...Yet oh so functional... Work has changed.\u00a0You don\u2019t count the hours in a drab cubicle: you join conferences from the living room, you respond to emails from the coffee shop, you execute mission-critical plans from the park\u2026and you do it on your tablet. The work-from-anywhere lifestyle is ultralight, low-profile, highly functional, and everywhere\u2026so why isn\u2019t your bag keeping up?\u00a0 The Story behind Console Once COVID hit and travel was limited, I needed an office that wasn\u2019t in my office. Something that I could quickly grab at a moment\u2019s notice and run out the door knowing I have EVERYTHING I need to get my work done. It needed to be slim, organized, highly mobile (even packable into other bags), but also suitable for a professional setting. Console keeps all of your tools quickly accessible, and safely organized--no matter where you are. The Console sling has dedicated pockets for everything you might need for your workday from docs and pens, to loose cables, chargers, keys, and cards. \u00a0 Size: Briefcase -- Sling pack -- Stowable Organizer.\u00a0 A bag that can go anywhere needs to fit in anywhere.\u00a0Console easily transforms from a hands-free sling to a professional briefcase to a one-bagger's tech kit.\u00a0",
  "The Jig Jug was created as a simple solution to help fishermen organize their large salt and freshwater lures. The Jig Jug keeps the lures easily accessible while actively fishing, yet keeps the hook points concealed so you\u2019re not snagging pant legs or dumping them out when you\u2019re running the deck and fighting fish. Having all your lures at the ready allows you to rig up or switch tackle swiftly without worrying about the hassle of putting things back in a tackle box to rust or spill in the process. Just swap and drop right in to the jug and stay focused on fishing! We are seeking funding to bring the Jig Jug 2.0 to an injection molding production line! Please check out the story below to see what the product is really about! www.jigjugtackleorganization.com We created the Jig Jug 1.0 as a simpler garage-made affordable version (3D-printed prototypes are $400 or more) to prove that the concept was practical and see how the public reacted. The 1.0 version was a great success and showed us it's no-brainer tool to keep tackle organized in a simple, yet neat and tidy manner. \u00a0We made a few, slapped them on our buckets, and went fishing!\u00a0 After trying these out ourselves and receiving feedback from other fishermen we'd given them to we knew we had to continue pursuing the development of this product. \u00a0 We sold several hundred of the 1.0 hand-made version via word-of-mouth and Facebook in Alaska, California, and Florida. We now also have them on shelves of local sporting goods stores in Anchorage and Seward, Alaska including BnJ Sporting Goods, LFS Marine, and The Fish House. The Jig Jug 2.0 is what we believe will be the optimized design surrounding this solution as it will recess the hook hanging point lowering the center-of-gravity as well as providing an additional bucket rim on top to allow for installation of a lid, bucket seat attachment, screw-top lid, etc.\u00a0It also includes dedicated slots for bait knives and needle-nose pliers. We think ALL fisherman will want and need this product for everything from bouncing jigs for Halibut, pulling plugs for Salmon, chucking big baits for Musky, or trolling for Tuna, Marlin and other large offshore fisheries around the world.\u00a0 Pictures of the T-Shirts and Hats below!",
  "I am raising money to stop police brutality one step at a time.I have become involved because of my own personal experience. I am going to expand as far as possible with others giving attention and help to, and a website showing information, stories, and pictures of the subject.. I\u00a0want to work on a media outlet/website that shows everything that's going on with normal brutality with the police, not shootings. My team would head out with cameras and catch action when possible, as well as take in others information, pictures, and stories about there bad luck.

  "I personally have suffered with multiple mental health issues since being a teen. I have experienced many different therapist for many different kinds of reasons, as well as hit some of the worst lows I could have ever imagined. Though my journey to understand my mental health and to come to a healthy cohabitation with my mind I found writing journals the most therapeutic way for me to deal with my emotions and feelings. It was a way to let go of how I felt and move on fully well knowing I didn\u2019t lock it up somewhere in my mind and refuse to deal with it. I always found it came back to haunt me one way or another. We all need a way of relieving stress and pain and prompted writing can be one of them. How many times have you sat down to write about how you felt and couldn\u2019t find the words? Well I found it was easier to use prompts for getting my emotions out. In therapy I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk about an issue unless my therapist specifically asked me about it. By using writing prompts I was about to use this technique outside of therapy. So how should you use this journal?Well, that\u2019s the magic. It\u2019s entirely up to you! You can follow it through day by day following the writing prompts, or you can have a flick through and find a page that resonates with your day. You may take only the 60 days to complete this journal or you may take ten years. Go at your own pace and don\u2019t force yourself if things are too painful. For every page you fill out please remember I am proud of you for being able to do that. You should feel proud too.I promise things do get better. Taylor",
  "In a 1999 interview with \"Salon,\" Frank Houston asked Kurt Vonnegut, \u201cIf you could write an epitaph for the 20th century, what would it be?\u201d Vonnegut replied, \u201cI have written it. \"The good Earth\u2014we could have saved it, but we were too damn cheap and lazy.\" The Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library (KVML) is dedicated to championing the legacy of writer Kurt Vonnegut and the principles of free expression and common decency. This year, our tenth anniversary, KVML presents The Good Earth: Vonnegut and the Environment, bringing you a year of virtual programs that provide opportunities about caring for our good Earth. Like so many other museums, KVML was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We had to close our museum doors. But we didn\u2019t stop. We learned how to bring you a virtual museum and programs because during these challenging times, we need Kurt\u2019s wit and wisdom more than ever.The funds raised through the generosity of backers like you will go toward the various costs of operating our organization and bringing you virtual exhibitions and programs that share Kurt\u2019s calls to care for the good earth. Throughout this year, KVML will bring you innovative virtual programs such as the following: During The Good Earth: Vonnegut and the Environment, we\u2019re asking people to reflect on these questions: We\u2019ll be using Vonnegut\u2019s novel, Galapagos, as well as other Vonnegut books, essays, and short stories, as jumping off points for discussions, virtual book clubs, interactive forums, and presentations. This year will feature a community book club by our Vonnegut and the Environment Chair, actor and scientist Drew DeSimone, that will explore books about environmental justice. We\u2019ll also offer community-calls-to-action about environmental care in KVML\u2019s Indiana Avenue neighborhood in downtown Indianapolis, environment-centered creative writing opportunities for Indianapolis students, and a veteran\u2019s writing program in an Indiana state park, Turkey Run. KVML will partner with Earth Charter to host a children\u2019s climate change camp and will highlight artifacts that encourage reflection on the good earth in our Virtual Museum. Please back The Good Earth: Vonnegut and the Environment. This year is our tenth anniversary, and your support will help ensure KVML can educate and inspire people globally to reflect on and care for our world this year and for many years to come. Few writers are as beloved as Kurt Vonnegut and few speak to the mess of being human with such candor, wit, truth, and encouragement. A World War II veteran, pacifist, satirist, humanist, environmentalist, visual artist, and internationally acclaimed writer, Kurt Vonnegut is one of the most influential American writers and thinkers of the 20th century. Many times, Kurt took up the call for environmental justice, urging his readers to think about consumerism, resource consumption, and preservation. His humor and captivating storytelling offer a unique lens for educating about and encouraging action for environmental care. The Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library (KVML) is a 501c(3) nonprofit in Indianapolis, Indiana. Our mission is to champion the legacy of Kurt Vonnegut and the principles of freedom of expression and common decency, and we accomplish this by:",
  "In a time when humans have long since left Earth for other worlds, physical contact has become an outdated concept and an embarrassing social faux pas. But there are some, it would seem, who feel otherwise... Abeille and Miel are unable to forget the accidental touch they shared and decide a more hands on approach might help them understand what it all means. While great in theory, they are now finding it harder and harder to deny the feelings blooming between them despite their strictly educational experiment. LOVE NOT FOUND is a sci-fi romance series written and illustrated by Gina Biggs (Red String, Erstwhile Fairy Tales, & Blissverse). This campaign is funding the second volume of Love Not Found (collecting chapters 8-14 of the series). The book will contain nearly 300 remastered pages of FULL COLOR comics and bonus content including concept art, story notes, and character bios.\u00a0 Funding will go towards an initial run of the book, shipping, merchandise/goodies, Kickstarter fees, and taxes. Love Not Found is a series exploring love and intimacy in an era when humans choose to forego physical contact similar to themes found in The Naked Sun and Demolition Man.\u00a0 The series features a sweet, sincere main character who smiles through her own emotional difficulties and a richly developed ensemble cast with multiple LGBTQ+ couples. Fans of Steven Universe and Sailor Moon will enjoy the strong themes of love, friendship, and romance that are at the very core of the series! \u00a0 This book is intended for TEENS+ due to mild sexual situations exploring love and intimacy.\u00a0 ADD ON ITEMS are an a la carte menu where you can add additional reward items to your pledge.

  "Dear friends! We're very excited to share with you our cookbook! It have been extraordinary times for all of us. Hopefully this project brings you as much joy as we had in making it!\u00a0 \u00a0'When is the cookbook coming?'... 'That is a good question! It would be wonderful to make one! Maybe next year?'. Next year: 'Can we buy your cookbook already?!'... 'Oooh, I wish... it is a big project!'. 2020: 'Yes! It is ready!' What a journey it has been! After serving over 40000 meals to over 5000 different people visiting us in the forests of Mundekulla in the last three years, it is time: we have made our cookbook! All our love for food, nature, people, farming and creativity has manifested in 256 pages of recipes and inspiration. Over the years we have been inspired by the many wonderful people we've met and we have worked hard to delight each and every retreat and festival with beautiful food that nourishes the body and the spirit. Our aim: making vegan and vegetarian food that makes everyone happy - no matter your normal diet - and in a way that helps us cherish the earth.\u00a0 In October 2019 we started fantasizing and making a plan. In November we cooked and shot all the content! (it was crazy cool roller coaster ride of creative explosions!). In December we struggled to get things on paper as the holidays were just so cozy and computer screens not so much. In January we pumped out over 80 recipes and 10 chapters of theory and cooking inspiration from our heads on to paper. In February we finalized graphic design and received the illustrations. In March the last details were finished. And now... we are ready to print! \u00a0What will you find in the book? This book is the result of a creative collaboration. We all contributed from our passion for food, sustainability and art in our own time! Our main goals is to make a beautiful and valuable book that spreads yummy, healthy, inspiring and creative recipes.\u00a0 This book would not have been possible without the art and love poured into it by all of these many amazing people: Irena Krajnc (beautiful styling & design and amazing friend), Elaine Lilje (incredible and spirited photography), Emma Ljung (fantastic handmade ceramics) and Lovisa Wendt (magical flower power!). And of course, the many chefs who have inspired the Mundekulla Kitchen with their amazing flavours and creations: with special gratitude to Elise Briccolani (amazing forager and chef of all things flavourful, fresh and colourful), Gunilla Blom (master of kombucha, ayurveda and fermentation) and Kristian H\u00e4gglund (Temple Food, Indian and Korean Flavours). Last but definitely not least: we are so grateful for the incredible support and help from volunteers, friends, family, neighbours and the Mundekulla community! With special mention of Clint, Marte, Mikael, David, Lennart, Pernilla, Nils, Ann, Arturs, Gunnel, Anna, Jonne, Simone, Samira and Peter. Thank you all so much for your support, little nudges, curiosity, creativity, co-reading, music, hard work & laughs!\u00a0 Will you support us to make the print of the book happen? Printing is a great cost and we can only make a paper version with your support. And of course, we've made quite some costs already, like ingredients and travels costs for the team.\u00a0 Let's put this beautiful book in print!\u00a0 Love! Stephanie PS.

  "What is the 'How to eat your Christmas tree' project: Evergreen trees are pillars of winter. Across the western world, they are seen as symbols of strength, resilience and everlasting life. But, once Christmas is over, the streets are flooded with millions of discarded trees, ready for landfill.\u00a0'How to eat your Christmas tree' is a cookbook born from the sold-out, annual supper club of the same name, which encourages us to extend the life of our Christmas trees - by eating them instead of throwing them out! This self-published cookbook not only offers twenty two recipes for reusing Christmas trees, be they spruce, pine, fir or lesser known edible evergreens, but also encourages much needed reflection around food waste and resourcefulness in an age of deforestation and climate crisis.\u00a0 So, how did it all start... Almost five years ago, the 'How to eat your Christmas tree...' supper club was born in London, where I served up delicious edible conifers over a four course meal to encourage diners to celebrate their tree around the table instead of sending it to landfill. Each year, as the noise surrounding climate crisis grows louder, the supper club has grown in popularity, and so I decided to collate some of the recipes to share the project with a wider audience. Why is it important? \u00a0Trees are commonly considered one of our best weapons in the fight against climate change. And yet, so many of them are being destroyed, including the 40 million Christmas trees that are harvested each year in the US & UK alone. Christmas trees were once respected, used in sacred ceremonies and protected. Nowadays they are merely commodities of Christmas and this practice is destroying our environment. The 'How to eat your Christmas tree' cookbook is a first step into re-thinking how we treat our Christmas trees and the planet!\u00a0 What your donation will do... I have self funded and self published this little, green cookbook so that I can spread the word of tree. Your donation to the project will help me get this book off the ground by paying for the first print run, selling the first batch of books and paying back all of the wonderful friends, designers and photographers who got involved in this project.\u00a0 Making this book... The'How to eat your Christmas tree' cookbook has been printed with a lot of love and respect for the environment. The book is printed by environmentally sympathetic print house St. Austell's in Cornwall, UK. Packaging and delivery methods are as sustainable as possible.\u00a0 All that is left to say is thankyou for supporting my project. I hope that you will enjoy the recipes in my cookbook as much as I have enjoyed concocting them over the last few years!\u00a0 Just give me the trees!\u00a0 Julia\u00a0 Please be aware that all food and drink photography used on this page are by the wonderful Lizzie Mayson!\u00a0",
  "Durch dieses Projekt entsteht ein Bluetooth-Audio-Modul f\u00fcr h\u00f6rbert, den MP3-Player aus Holz f\u00fcr Kinder. Mit dem Modul kann man Kopfh\u00f6rer mit h\u00f6rbert verbinden und au\u00dferdem h\u00f6rbert als Bluetooth-Lautsprecher verwenden und noch mehr...\u00a0 Das Modul kann in jeden h\u00f6rbert nachtr\u00e4glich eingebaut werden. English translation: Please see below \u00a0\u00a0/ \u00a0\u00a0Traduction fran\u00e7aise : Voir ci-dessous Hallo, mein Name ist h\u00f6rbert. Ich werde im Dezember 8 Jahre alt und habe in meinem Leben bereits viele tausend Familien als Freunde gewonnen. Manchmal leben wir h\u00f6rberts auch zu zweit oder sogar zu dritt in einer Familie. Die Kinder lieben uns, tragen uns hin und her und nehmen uns mit in jeden Urlaub. Das ist wundersch\u00f6n! Und als Gegenleistung spielen wir Musik und Geschichten und bringen ganz viel Freude. Mein Erfinder hat im Jahr 2011 extra f\u00fcr mich eine Firma gegr\u00fcndet, die Firma hei\u00dft WINZKI und befindet sich in Frickenhausen in Deutschland. Die lieben Leute, die uns h\u00f6rberts bauen, nenne ich immer die WINZKIs. Die sind richtig nett und bauen jeden h\u00f6rbert mit Liebe und Leidenschaft in Handarbeit zusammen. Meine H\u00f6rb\u00fccher und Musik spiele ich immer \u00fcber meinen eingebauten Lautsprecher ab. Auf seinen Klang bin ich sehr stolz. Ab und zu wollen mich die Kinder jedoch ganz f\u00fcr sich alleine haben, ohne dass die Anderen mith\u00f6ren. Oder es ist so laut, dass die Kinder mich nicht verstehen k\u00f6nnen. Dann w\u00fcnschen sie sich Kopfh\u00f6rer f\u00fcr ihren h\u00f6rbert. Also f\u00fcr mich. Und weil ich keine Kabel mag, die man mir ausrei\u00dfen kann, oder die sich den Kindern um den Hals legen, haben sich die WINZKIs etwas Neues ausgedacht. Sie haben beschlossen: \"Wir entwickeln ein Bluetooth-Modul f\u00fcr h\u00f6rbert: F\u00fcr Bluetooth-Kopfh\u00f6rer!\" Das l\u00f6st alle m\u00f6glichen Probleme: Ich bin dann im Auto laut genug f\u00fcr das Kind und auf dem Familienfest leise genug f\u00fcr die Leute drum herum. Eigentlich wei\u00df ich schon, dass die WINZKIs mich immer noch ein bisschen besser machen, als sie eigentlich m\u00fcssen. Die finden das toll, weil mich meine Familien dann noch viel mehr liebhaben. Damit Du unendlich viele Inhalte \u00fcber mich abspielen kannst, kannst Du auch Dein Handy mit meinem Bluetooth-Modul verbinden. Dann spiele ich als Bluetooth-Lautsprecher alles ab, was Du von Deinem Handy per Bluetooth an mich streamst: Deine ganz privaten eigenen Aufnahmen oder Deine Musik und H\u00f6rspiele von Spotify oder Audible und den ganzen anderen Internet-Radios. Wenn ich die Lieblings-Playlist zum Einschlafen f\u00fcr Dein Kind spiele, schlummert es oft nach ein paar Liedern sanft ein. Damit meine Akkus nicht schon nach ein paar durchgemachten N\u00e4chten schlapp machen, haben die WINZKIs bereits letztes Jahr etwas f\u00fcr mich zum Nachr\u00fcsten gebaut: Einen Timer zur automatischen Abschaltung. Und den bauen die WINZKIs auch gleich in das Bluetooth-Modul mit ein. Du stellst dann ganz einfach ein, wie lange ich noch f\u00fcr Dein Kind spielen soll, bis auch ich mich dann leise schlafen lege. \u00dcbrigens: Ungef\u00e4hr so wie dieses Teil - nur etwas gr\u00f6\u00dfer und mit mehr Kabeln - stellen wir uns das Bluetooth-Modul vor. Das erfolgreiche Konzept dieser Bauart m\u00f6chten wir gerne \u00a0beibehalten. Du und ich, wir lieben die Umwelt. Darum gehen wir beide schonend mit ihr um. Damit Deine tollen Akkus, die mich versorgen, m\u00f6glichst lange leben, passt das Bluetooth-Modul auf sie auf. Du sagst mir nur mit einem Schalter, ob Du mich mit Batterien oder Akkus betreibst. Aus Batterien hole ich n\u00e4mlich alles heraus, damit sie nicht halb leer weggeworfen werden, und trotzdem nicht auslaufen. Auf Deine Akkus passe ich besser auf, denn sie m\u00f6gen es nicht, ganz leer gesaugt zu werden, das macht sie ganz schlapp. Diese Funktion haben die WINZKIs auch schon in den Timer zur automatischen Abschaltung gebaut, das kennen sie schon. Die Akkus erz\u00e4hlen mir immer, dass das die totale Wellness f\u00fcr sie ist. Du kannst das Modul in jedem h\u00f6rbert seit Nummer 1 aus dem Dezember 2011 nachr\u00fcsten. Wenn Du ein bisschen geschickt mit den Fingern bist, dann kannst Du das Bluetooth-Modul zuhause selbst einbauen. Das kenne ich schon, das haben die WINZKIs mit der automatischen Abschaltung auch schon so gemacht. \u00a0Bisher hat das Nachr\u00fcsten immer prima geklappt, auch wenn mich das an der Stelle immer wie verr\u00fcckt kitzelt. Die WINZKIs erledigen den Einbau f\u00fcr Dich auch in ihrer Werkstatt, wenn Du willst. Kitzelt genauso. Weil an dem Modul sp\u00e4ter mindestens vier Kabel h\u00e4ngen, die Du beim Einbau aus- und ein- und umstecken musst - keine Angst: Mit Anleitung und ohne L\u00f6ten - haben die WINZKIs dem Bluetooth-Modul offiziell einen klingenden Namen gegeben:\u00a0 \"Das Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel\" Immer lustig, die WINZKIs ;-) Die Auswahl des Bluetooth-Moduls und des Prozessors sind getroffen. Der Prozessor, der das Bluetooth Modul steuern wird, steckt bisher noch als separate Platine auf dem Evaluations-Board des Bluetooth Moduls. Der Prozessor kann schon die einzelnen Anwendungsszenarien abwickeln, wie Du oben im Video siehst. Die n\u00e4chsten notwendigen Schritte w\u00e4ren jetzt: Was machen die WINZKIs mit Deinem Geld? Sie haben mir erkl\u00e4rt, wie knifflig es ist, die richtige Anzahl an Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddels zu fertigen, damit nachher jeder eins bekommt. Wenn die WINZKIs zu wenige bauen, endet das mit traurigen Familien, wenn sie zu viele bauen, k\u00f6nnen ganz schlimme Dinge passieren, \u00fcber die sie gar nicht gerne reden. Jedenfalls kosten die ganzen Chips und Kabel und Platinen und Tests und Pr\u00fcfungen und die SMD-Best\u00fcckung der Platinen beim Zulieferer im Nachbarort so viel, dass die WINZKIs das nicht einfach so im Voraus bezahlen k\u00f6nnen. Und jetzt bitten sie um Deine Unterst\u00fctzung: Wenn Du ein Unternehmen mit Fertigung in Deutschland unterst\u00fctzen m\u00f6chtest oder Du Dir Dein Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel als Vorbestellung sichern willst, oder wenn Du sogar einen ganzen h\u00f6rbert mit eingebautem Modul vorbestellen m\u00f6chtest, dann klicke jetzt gleich auf Unterst\u00fctze dieses Projekt! Mit Deiner Unterst\u00fctzung gibst Du den WINZKIs die Chance, das Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel serienreif zu bekommen und noch vor dem Winter zu verschicken. Der Prototyp auf diesem Bild funktioniert schon, Du kannst ihn im Video sehen und h\u00f6ren. Das Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel werden Alex und Rainer entwickeln, bis es produktionsreif ist. Die Pr\u00fcfung im Labor \u00fcbernimmt ein Labor in Stuttgart, und die Produktion eine Firma in einem Nachbarort. Mit diesen Firmen arbeiten die WINZKIs schon l\u00e4nger erfolgreich zusammen. Christine wird mit den Lieferanten verhandeln und daf\u00fcr sorgen, dass Dein vorausbezahltes Geld sparsam ausgegeben wird. Jacqueline, Christian und Simon werden die Endproduktion der Bluetooth-Module und den Test in unserer Firma durchf\u00fchren. Sandra und Ulla werden sich um Deine Fragen zur Abwicklung k\u00fcmmern.\u00a0 Unsere Sandras, Bianca und Simone werden sich darum k\u00fcmmern, dass so viele wie m\u00f6glich in der weiten Welt \u00fcber mich und meine tolles neues Zubeh\u00f6r erfahren. Esther, Gabi, G\u00fcnter und Tanja werden sich um den Einbau des Bluetooth-Module f\u00fcr die Paketangebote und die Nachr\u00fcstungen k\u00fcmmern. Thilo wird Dich in technischen Fragen unterst\u00fctzen, falls ein Problem beim Einbau auftritt.\u00a0 Madlen und Miriam werden die ganzen Kickstarter Belohnungen verpacken daf\u00fcr sorgen, dass jede Belohnung schnell bei Dir ankommt, sobald sie verf\u00fcgbar ist. Nicole und Stefanie k\u00fcmmern sich mit Personalplanung und Teampflege um die Menschen, damit das Projekt die WINZKIs nicht aus dem Tritt bringt. This project creates a Bluetooth audio module for h\u00f6rbert, the wooden MP3 player for children. With this module you can connect headphones with h\u00f6rbert and also use h\u00f6rbert as Bluetooth speaker and even more...\u00a0 The module can be retrofitted into any h\u00f6rbert. Hello, my name is h\u00f6rbert. I will be 8 years old in December and have already made many thousands of families friends in my life. Sometimes we h\u00f6rberts live also in twos or even in threes in a family. The children love us, carry us back and forth and take us on every holiday. That's beautiful! And in return we play music and stories and bring a lot of joy. My inventor founded a company especially for me in 2011, the company is called WINZKI and is located in Frickenhausen in Germany. I always call the dear people who build us h\u00f6rberts 'the WINZKIs'. They are really nice and build every h\u00f6rbert with love and passion in manual labour. I always play my audio books and music through my built-in speaker. I am very proud of its great sound. From time to time, however, the children want to have me all to themselves, without the others listening in. Or it's so loud that the children can't understand me. Then they want headphones for their h\u00f6rbert. For me, that is. And because I don't like cables that can be torn out of me, or that may wrap around children's necks, the WINZKIs have come up with something new. They decided: \"We are developing a Bluetooth module for h\u00f6rbert: For Bluetooth headphones!\" This solves all kinds of problems: I'll be loud enough for the child in the car and quiet enough for the people around at the family party. Actually, I already know that the WINZKIs always make me a little better than they actually have to. They think it's great because my families love me even more. In order for you to listen to an infinite amount of content with me, you can also connect your mobile phone to my Bluetooth module. Then I work as a Bluetooth speaker and play everything you stream from your mobile phone to me via Bluetooth: your very own private recordings or your music and audio books and podcasts from Spotify or Audible and all the other Internet radio stations. When I play the favourite playlist for your child to fall asleep, it often falls asleep gently after a few songs. So that my batteries don't wear out after just a few nights, the WINZKIs already built something for me last year to retrofit: A timer for automatic switch-off. And the WINZKIs are going to also integrate this into the Bluetooth module. Then you simply set how long I should play for your child until I go to sleep quietly, too. By the way: About the same as this part - just a little bigger and with more cables - we imagine the Bluetooth module to become. We would like to keep the successful concept of this design. You and me, we love the environment. That's why we both care for it. The Bluetooth module takes care of your rechargeable batteries so that they last as long as possible. You just tell me with a switch whether you are using batteries or rechargeable batteries. I squeeze as much as I can out of primary batteries so that they are not thrown away half empty and yet do not leak. I take better care of your rechargeable batteries, because they don't like to be sucked completely empty, that wears them out early. The WINZKIs have already built this feature into the timer for automatic switch-off, they already know how to do that. Btw: The rechargeable batteries always tell me that this gentle treatment is like wellness for them. You can upgrade any h\u00f6rbert with this module since h\u00f6rbert number 1 from December 2011. If you are a bit clever with your hands, you can install the Bluetooth module at home yourself. I already know that, because the WINZKIs have already done that with the automatic switch-off. \u00a0Up to now, retrofitting has always worked great, even though it always tickles me like crazy. The WINZKIs can also do the installation for you in their workshop, if you like. (It tickles just the same) Because at least four cables hang from the module later, which you have to plug out and in and change during installation - don't worry: with instructions and without soldering - the WINZKIs have officially given the Bluetooth module a sounding name:\u00a0 \"The Bluetooth kuddelmuddel\" ('the bluetooth muddle') Always funny, the WINZKIs ;-) The Bluetooth module and the microprocessor have been chosen. The microprocessor, which will control the Bluetooth module, is still plugged as a separate board on the evaluation board of the Bluetooth module. The processor can already handle the individual application scenarios, as you can see in the video above. The next necessary steps would be now: What do the WINZKIs do with your money? They explained to me how tricky it is to make the right amount of Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddels so that everyone gets one afterwards. If the WINZKIs build too few, it ends with sad families or children, if they build too many, bad things can happen that they don't like to talk about. In any case, all the chips and cables and circuit boards and tests and inspections and the SMD assembly of the circuit boards at the supplier in the neighbouring town cost so much that the WINZKIs cannot simply pay for it in advance. And now they're asking for your support: If you want to support a company with production in Germany or you want to secure your Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel as a pre-order, or if you even want to pre-order a whole h\u00f6rbert with abuilt-in bluetooth module, then click on Support this project right now! With your pledge you give the WINZKIs the chance to get the Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel ready for series production and to ship it before winter. The prototype already works, you can see and hear it in the video. The Bluetooth Kuddelmuddel will be developed by Alex and Rainer until it is ready for production. The testing in the laboratory will be done by a laboratory in Stuttgart, and the production by a company in a neighbouring town. The WINZKIs have been working successfully with these companies for a long time. Christine will negotiate prices and amounts with the suppliers and make sure that your prepaid money is spent sparingly. Jacqueline, Christian and Simon will carry out the final production of the Bluetooth modules and the test in our company. Sandra and Ulla will take care of your questions about the handling.\u00a0 Our Sandras, Bianca and Simone will see to it that as many people as possible in the world learn about me and my great new accessories. Esther, Gabi, G\u00fcnter and Tanja will take care of the installation of the Bluetooth module for the package offers and the retrofits. Thilo will support you with technical questions if you have a problem during the installation.\u00a0 Madlen and Miriam will pack all the Kickstarter rewards and make sure that every reward arrives as soon as it is available. Nicole and Stefanie take care of the people with personnel planning and team care so that the WINZKIs do not get out of step during the project. Ce projet cr\u00e9e un module audio Bluetooth pour h\u00f6rbert, le lecteur MP3 en bois pour enfants. Avec ce module, vous pouvez connecter un casque avec h\u00f6rbert et utiliser h\u00f6rbert comme haut-parleur Bluetooth et plus encore....\u00a0 Le module peut \u00eatre install\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement dans n'importe quel h\u00f6rbert. Bonjour, je m'appelle h\u00f6rbert. J'aurai 8 ans en d\u00e9cembre et j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait des milliers d'amis dans ma vie. Parfois, nous vivons dans une famille avec deux ou m\u00eame trois d'entre nous. Les enfants nous aiment, nous portent d'avant en arri\u00e8re et nous emm\u00e8nent en vacances. C'est magnifique ! Et en retour, nous jouons de la musique et des histoires et nous apportons beaucoup de joie. Mon d\u00e9veloppeur a fond\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement pour moi en 2011, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 s'appelle WINZKI et est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Frickenhausen en Allemagne. J'appelle toujours les \u00eatres chers qui nous construisent les WINZKIs. Ils sont vraiment sympathiques et construisent tous les h\u00f6rbert avec amour et passion en travail manuel. Je joue toujours mes livres audio et ma musique avec mon haut-parleur int\u00e9gr\u00e9. Je suis tr\u00e8s fier de son son son. De temps en temps, cependant, les enfants veulent m'avoir pour eux tout seuls sans que les autres m'\u00e9coutent. Ou c'est si fort que les enfants ne peuvent pas me comprendre. Alors ils veulent des \u00e9couteurs pour leur h\u00f6rbert. Donc pour moi. Et parce que je n'aime pas les c\u00e2bles qui peuvent \u00eatre arrach\u00e9s de moi ou qui s'enroulent autour du cou des enfants, les WINZKIs ont trouv\u00e9 quelque chose de nouveau. Ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 : \"Nous d\u00e9veloppons un module Bluetooth pour h\u00f6rbert : Pour casques Bluetooth!\" Cela r\u00e9sout toutes sortes de probl\u00e8mes : Je serai assez fort pour l'enfant dans la voiture et \u00e0 la f\u00eate de famille assez calme pour les gens autour. En fait, je sais d\u00e9j\u00e0 que les WINZKIs me rendent toujours un peu mieux qu'il ne le faut. Ils pensent que c'est g\u00e9nial parce que mes familles m'aiment ainsi encore plus. Pour que vous puissiez jouer une quantit\u00e9 infinie de contenu sur moi, vous pouvez \u00e9galement connecter votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable \u00e0 mon module Bluetooth. Ensuite, je joue en tant que haut-parleur Bluetooth tout ce que vous diffusez de votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable vers moi via Bluetooth : vos propres enregistrements priv\u00e9s ou votre musique et vos \u00e9missions radio de Spotify ou d'Audible et de toutes les autres radios Internet. Quand je joue la playlist pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e de votre enfant pour qu'il s'endorme, il s'endort souvent doucement apr\u00e8s quelques chansons. Pour que mes batteries ne s'\u00e9puissent pas apr\u00e8s quelques nuits, les WINZKIs ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 construit quelque chose pour moi l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re pour la modernisation : Une minuterie pour un arr\u00eat automatique. Et les WINZKIs l'int\u00e8grent \u00e9galement dans le module Bluetooth. Ensuite, vous fixez simplement combien de temps je dois encore jouer pour votre enfant jusqu'\u00e0 ce que je m'allonge aussi pour dormir tranquillement. D'ailleurs : Nous imaginons que le module Bluetooth est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame que ce composant - juste un peu plus grand et avec plus de c\u00e2bles. Nous aimerions conserver le concept \u00e0 succ\u00e8s de ce design. Vous et moi, on aime l'environnement. C'est pourquoi nous le traitons tous les deux avec douceur. Le module Bluetooth s'occupe de vos piles rechargeables pour qu'elles durent le plus longtemps possible. Il vous suffit simplement de me dire \u00e0 l'aide d'un interrupteur si vous utilisez des batteries ou des piles rechargeables. Je retire tout ce qui se trouve dans les batteries pour qu'elles ne soient pas jet\u00e9es \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 vides et qu'elles ne fuient pas. Je prends mieux soin de vos piles rechargeables, parce qu'elles n'aiment pas \u00eatre suc\u00e9es compl\u00e8tement vides, ce qui les rend tr\u00e8s fatigu\u00e9es. Les WINZKIs ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 int\u00e9gr\u00e9 cette fonction dans la minuterie d'arr\u00eat automatique, ils le savent d\u00e9j\u00e0. Les piles me disent toujours que c'est le bien-\u00eatre total pour eux. Le module peut \u00eatre install\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement dans n'importe quel h\u00f6rbert depuis le num\u00e9ro 1 \u00e0 partir de d\u00e9cembre 2011. Si vous \u00eates un peu habil\u00e9 avec vos doigts, vous pouvez installer le module Bluetooth vous m\u00eame chez vous. Je le connais d\u00e9j\u00e0, les WINZKIs l'ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait avec l'arr\u00eat automatique. \u00a0Jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, la r\u00e9adaption a toujours bien fonctionn\u00e9, m\u00eame si cela me chatouille toujours comme un fou \u00e0 cet endroit. Les WINZKIs peuvent aussi faire l'installation pour vous dans leur atelier, si vous le souhaitez. \u00c7a chatouille quand m\u00eame... Parce qu'au moins quatre c\u00e2bles sont suspendus au module par la suite qu'il faut debrancher, \u00a0brancher et changer pendant l'installation - ne vous inqui\u00e9tez pas : avec des instructions et sans soudure - les WINZKIs ont officiellement donn\u00e9 un nom sonore au module Bluetooth :\u00a0 \"Le Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel\" (le Bluetooth-embrouillamini) Toujours dr\u00f4le, les WINZKIs \u00a0;-) Le module Bluetooth et le microprocesseur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis. Le microprocesseur, qui contr\u00f4lera le module Bluetooth, est encore branch\u00e9 comme une carte s\u00e9par\u00e9e sur la carte d'\u00e9valuation du module Bluetooth. Le microprocesseur peut d\u00e9j\u00e0 g\u00e9rer les sc\u00e9narios d'application individuels, comme vous pouvez le voir dans la vid\u00e9o ci-dessus. Les prochaines \u00e9tapes n\u00e9cessaires seraient maintenant : Que font les WINZKIs de votre argent ? Ils m'ont expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point il est difficile de faire la bonne quantit\u00e9 de Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel pour que tout le monde en re\u00e7oive une par la suite. Si les WINZKIs en construisent trop peu, cela finit avec des familles o\u00f9 des enfants tristes, s'ils en construisent trop, de mauvaises choses peuvent arriver dont ils n'aiment pas parler. En tout cas toutes les puces, les c\u00e2bles, les circuits imprim\u00e9s, les tests et les inspections ainsi que l'assemblage CMS des circuits imprim\u00e9s chez le fournisseur dans la ville voisine co\u00fbtent tellement cher que les WINZKIs ne peuvent pas simplement les payer \u00e0 l'avance. Et maintenant, ils vous demandent votre soutien : si vous voulez soutenir une entreprise avec une production en Allemagne ou si vous voulez s\u00e9curiser votre Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel en pr\u00e9-commande, ou si vous voulez m\u00eame pr\u00e9-commander un h\u00f6rbert complet avec un module int\u00e9gr\u00e9, alors cliquez sur Support ce projet d\u00e8s maintenant ! Avec votre soutien, vous donnez aux WINZKI la chance de pr\u00e9parer le Bluetooth-Kuddelmuddel pour la production en s\u00e9rie et \u00e0 l'envoyer avant l'hiver. Le prototype fonctionne d\u00e9j\u00e0, vous pouvez le voir et l'entendre dans la vid\u00e9o. Le Bluetooth Kuddelmuddel sera d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par Alex et Rainer jusqu'\u00e0 sa mise en production. Les tests en laboratoire seront effectu\u00e9s par un laboratoire \u00e0 Stuttgart et la production par une entreprise d'une ville voisine. Les WINZKIs travaillent avec ces entreprises avec succ\u00e8s depuis longtemps. Christine n\u00e9gociera avec les fournisseurs et s'assurera que votre argent pr\u00e9pay\u00e9 est d\u00e9pens\u00e9 avec parcimonie. Jacqueline, Christian et Simon se chargeront de la production finale des modules Bluetooth et du test dans notre entreprise. Sandra et Ulla s'occuperont de vos questions concernant le traitement.\u00a0 Nos Sandras, Bianca et Simone veilleront \u00e0 ce que le plus grand nombre possible de personnes dans le monde apprennent \u00e0 me conna\u00eetre et \u00e0 conna\u00eetre mes nouveaux accessoires. Esther, Gabi, G\u00fcnter et Tanja se chargeront de l'installation du module Bluetooth pour les offres packag\u00e9es et la r\u00e9adaption. Thilo vous assistera pour toute question technique en cas de probl\u00e8me lors de l'installation.\u00a0 Madlen et Miriam emballeront toutes les r\u00e9compenses Kickstarter et s'assureront que chaque r\u00e9compense arrive le plus vite chez vous d\u00e8s qu'elle sera disponible. Nicole et Stefanie s'occupent de la planification du personnel et du soin en \u00e9quipe afin que le projet ne perturbe pas les WINZKIs.",

As Good Good Comedy, we put up these shows every damn week in intimate theater spaces across the city. After hundreds of Good Good shows and three Five Dollar Comedy festivals, the time has inevitably arrived for us to open our own dedicated space. 2016, meet Good Good Comedy Theatre. \u201cThere are tons of local comedy scenes of all sizes out there, and now it\u2019s time for good old PA to have its time in the spotlight.\u201d Splitsider on Five Dollar Comedy Week In the summer of 2014, Aaron Nevins and Kate Banford put on the first-ever Five Dollar Comedy Week. Frustrated by the lack of opportunities to produce out-of-the-ordinary, hybrid shows that don\u2019t just follow the typical comedy formats of improv, sketch or stand-up, they concocted a weeklong festival of over 30 brand new shows and workshops from a diverse lineup of Philly comedians. The results were so well-received and liberating that the second Five Dollar Comedy Week happened a mere six months later, kickstarting a bi-annual tradition with an all-new set of 30 original high-concept shows, completely different from the first festival. In late 2015, Five Dollar Comedy Week had yielded over 100 distinct, sometimes batshit crazy new shows and thus, Good Good Comedy was born - to keep the spirit of Five Dollar Comedy Week alive every week of the year. The impact was immediate, resulting in a string of sold-out shows and an ever-expanding roster of new performances, not to mention a rapidly growing audience for this specific brand of odd, interactive and sometimes even weirdly poignant live comedy. Now we can hardly even find the schedule space to accommodate our dozens of recurring shows, bizarre one-off performances and unusual workshops. We\u2019ve got no choice but to finally put all of Good Good Comedy under one roof. We\u2019re happy to announce that Good Good Comedy has officially signed the lease for a permanent home in Center City Philadelphia and we are planning to begin construction next month.  That means you\u2019ll now be able to count on something awesome to do in Philly every night of the week. It also means comedians will have ample opportunities to flesh out their wildest ideas, collaborate, and create all kinds of new comedy for you, the almighty audience. And most importantly, we\u2019ll be able to keep our shows cheap as F - the majority of \u2018em will remain at $5 a ticket.  It also means Good Good Comedy will be able to offer full classes for the first time ever. Exciting! Our classes will focus on a wide spectrum of comedic fields of interest, many of which have never been offered in Philadelphia before, and all of which will be available at fair, affordable prices just like our shows. Creating a new theater is a huge undertaking and one that we don\u2019t take lightly. We\u2019ve already been hard at work at making this dream a reality for the past year. This Kickstarter will not be our sole source of funding for Good Good Comedy Theatre, but the money we make here will go a long, long way toward some of our most significant expenses. Here\u2019s some of what your contribution will go toward (estimates only):  GOAL - $12,000 We\u2019re offering a literal shit-ton (2,060 lbs) of rewards over there on the right. You really oughta scroll through \u2018em. But if you\u2019re the kind of person that watches movie trailers for entertainment or something, we can give you a juicy little preview right here. We\u2019re giving away things like free tickets, an exclusive t-shirt, a limited edition art print from renowned artist / funny person Andrew Jeffrey Wright and more. You can get your name carved onto a plaque that will be displayed in our theatre FOREVER, and you can even write whatever the stank you want on one of our theatre chairs!  Plus, this Kickstarter will be the ONLY place you can get a discounted full week pass for the next Five Dollar Comedy Week, which is huge. And if that wasn\u2019t huge enough, we\u2019re even offering an exclusive FULL MONTH PASS to a month of your choosing at the new space. That means you can see everything all month for FREE just for donating here. Don\u2019t miss these hot, hot chances. Please share our Kickstarter - the more people that know about it the more awesome Good Good Comedy Theatre can be! As always, hit up the Good Good Comedy website, and follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. You can also write to us with your keyboard at hello[at]goodgoodcomedy.com.",

  "The Kreis Cup is a biodegradable and reusable cup made from used coffee grounds and plant-based materials, free of petroleum-based plastics. It is heat resistant and designed to keep your coffee hot longer. It comes in two versions: Kreis Travel Cup and Kreis Latte Cup. Both are break resistant and dishwasher friendly, which makes them suitable for home and commercial use. Kreis means circle, resembling our circular economy model based on the regeneration of natural materials into a sustainable product. The Kreis Cup is an alternative to disposable paper cups and aims to replace the end-of-life concept of used coffee grounds. Our story is very simple.\u00a0 Just like most of you, we drink coffee every morning and are left with a dirty coffee filter containing wet coffee grounds that need to be discarded and washed away, many times creating a nice smelling mess.\u00a0 Just like disposable coffee paper cups, these coffee grounds end up in a landfill, where they take months to decompose. As an experiment, we started accumulating this \u201cwaste\u201c daily in our home and reached 4 pounds of coffee grounds in one month.\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t stop thinking about all the coffee grounds thrown away in coffee shops and asked ourselves: \"What if this waste is not really meant to be waste?\" By using used coffee grounds collected from local coffee shops, restaurants, offices and hotels we are recycling millions of tons of coffee waste that otherwise ends up in landfills causing numerous problems such as the production of greenhouse gasses and acidic leachate, which can damage the surrounding soil where they are disposed. The Kreis Cup is free from petroleum-based plastics or any other environment harming substances. It is 100% sustainable, reusable and recyclable. The Kreis Way, our recycle program is intended to collect Kreis Cups at the end of their life span and repurpose them into new cups, never touching the landfill. The Kreis Cup is designed and engineered to last for years in homes, coffee shops, offices, hotels or restaurants. Made from recycled coffee grounds and innovative ecological materials, our Kreis Cup will take your coffee experience to the next level due to its natural coffee scent. The Kreis Cup is designed to keep your coffee hot longer and your iced coffee cold until the last sip, thanks to its double-walled insulation.* The Kreis Cup is heat resistant and dishwasher safe. We understand no one wants to do more work. The Kreis Cup is half the weight of regular reusable cups. *Kreis Travel cup comes with double-walled insulation.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ricardo and Daniela are a married couple that share the passion for coffee. They have visited the best coffee farms in the world located in Colombia to learn about every aspect of the coffee industry.\u00a0 Together with their Team,\u00a0they've built a sustainable process to create products from the coffee waste. Their Team includes professionals from product design, engineering, and manufacturing, who have partnered with coffee roasters, shops and distributors to fulfill this dream of transforming the coffee industry. This has given them the expertise and knowledge to create an innovative solution to the coffee waste resulting in The Kreis Cups. First time backing a Kickstarter project? We figured you could use some help! Try talking to our friendly chatbot, Sebastian! We\u2019d love it if you could tell your friends, family, and the rest of the world about The Kreis Cups!

  "Employing Japanese press die casting technology with extravagent alloy, this puzzle is perfect for passing the time! What\u2019s more when finished, it makes for a brilliant interior piece. While it looks simple, it will puzzle you for ages, thanks to the 8 outer pieces which surround the inner design of the puzzle. While each piece looks the same, each piece only has its own place! You\u2019ll be thinking to yourself, \u201cWhy is it so hard? Why can\u2019t I complete it?\u201d, while you spend hours lost in concentration trying to solve it, and feel that amazing sense of accomplishment when you finish it. A solution isn\u2019t included with the puzzle. Complete this puzzle on your own back, and feel the thrill when it all comes together!\u00a0 A look at the media introduction for our original design that was widely well received! The Sakura Model! mono magazine May 2021 Japanese TV Show\u300c\u884c\u5217\u306e\u3067\u304d\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u76f8\u8ac7\u6240\u300dOA When you finish the puzzle, in the middle several symbols of Japan appear. Instead of being printed onto the metal, the pictures are made due to the gaps and spaces between the pieces. As the pieces form together, you can find a samurai warrior in armour and holding a katana while riding a horse. In the background, Mt. Fuji stands tall, giving a brilliant backdrop for the puzzle, which we get to experience everyday as our company is located near to Mt. Fuji in Yamanashi Prefecture.\u00a0 This version when compared to the symmetrical sakura model, this Kickstarter model is not as difficult. If you want to try a much harder puzzle we recommend you pick up the sakura version as well! As we are a precision parts maker, we have used this chance to show off the best of our abilities. Each side has a mirror finish to it, which makes it impossible to tell which side goes up or down, which helps to hopefully double the time you\u2019ll be pondering over this puzzle. We hope that the pieces of the puzzle are something you\u2019ve never seen before! We have put a lot of attention to detail into the creation of the pieces. Each piece may look similar to the next, but when you look closely, in order to create a puzzle that has only one solution, each one has very minute differences. This also means that when you fit the right pieces together, they have a very satisfying feel as they slide effortlessly into each other. For most general puzzles, between the pieces there will always be some gaps. With our ZIREL puzzle, the gaps between the pieces are just 0.004mm, which means when you slot them together, they slide into place and the lines seem to disappear before your eyes, thanks to the brilliant fit.\u00a0 0.004mm is extremely thin! The average width of a Japanese girl's hair is about on average 0.08mm, meaning that this gap is 1/20 thinner! Making a gap this thin takes extreme precision and skill to do so.\u00a0 Thanks to the mirror finish on both sides, when completed it makes for a beautiful interior piece. As it is made to be a self standing 8 sided puzzle, it looks great when displayed. Weighing 196g, it is 58mm x 58mm with a depth of about 10mm. While it is small it can act as a great paperweight. Design details The motif of the puzzle as we stated before is a samurai general in front of Mt Fuji while riding a horse, with sakura flowers around the outside. Made to be a octagon, the number 8 is said to be quite auspicious in Japan, bringing good luck. The character used for 8 [\u516b] opens up at the bottom and it is said to symbols growth or development. When celebrating someone, it is often recommended to send something which incorporates 8! Goods made in Japan have for a while been seen as being high quality all over the world. So even though we are making items for playing with, we wanted to create the best, hence the focus on making a puzzle with such a small gap between the pieces, creating a puzzle that many adults can enjoy. Why can we make items that have just a 0.004mm gap then? \u00a0The press that we use is a punch and die method of processing items. A punch is pressed into the material forcing the material into the correct shape. With this method, if the punch and die machinery isn\u2019t set correctly, it can create burrs and bends to the pieces, which make them unusable. Much care goes into making the pieces and then into quality control after, to make sure each puzzle is the highest quality that they can be. It\u2019s thanks to this that we are able to produce these on a large scale. One of our strengths as a company is the fact that we can design and then press and process everything in house. This item is no exception, with each puzzle being made by us. We hope that you take the chance to try out high quality metal work items that bear the Made in Japan mark. Iwai Press Message From the Owner Iwai Press Co. is a precision parts metal working company. We make parts for items that you probably use daily, such as connectors and so on for phones and PCs, or ic card readers. These parts are often found within your phones or cars and so on. We deal mainly with other businesses so we don\u2019t have much contact with regards to dealing with users of our items directly. We take pride in making the smallest gap possible between items. We are able to make a space that is thinner that the width of a single strand of hair.\u00a0 We hope that through our puzzle, you can find the joy and sense of fulfilment when you slot a piece in that slides and joins almost seamlessly. We would love to hear from you about your experience of solving the puzzle when you receive it!\u00a0 Material used\uff5cStainless Steel Specs\uff5cWidth ~57.4mm\u00d7 Length ~54.7mm\u00d7 Depth~10mm Display wooden box\uff5c\uff5cWidth ~73mm\u00d7 Length ~73mm\u00d7 Depth ~38mm \u25a0How the puzzle will arrive Regarding other puzzles The puzzles that we originally made that were available via Japanese crowdfunding which were both well received are also available during this Kickstarter campaign! Ume (Plum Blossom) Sakura (Cherry Blossom) We can not prepare spare pieces. Each puzzle is made from scratch and therefore we would need to remake the entire puzzle.\n\u00a0 The following are main points for enjoying the Zirel puzzle!\u00a0 We recommend you read before trying to solve the puzzle.\u00a0 There are no instructions for completing the puzzle.\u00a0 1. Keeping safety in mind When using the puzzle, please be careful when doing so. We don't wish others to come to harm when you use this puzzle, so please take care when trying to solve.\u00a0 \u2460Don't allow for the puzzle to come into contact with water.\u00a0 \u2461Try your best not to cut yourself on the edges of the puzzle.\u00a0 \u203bThe fibres on cloths and towels that you use to polish the pieces or completed puzzle may catch, so please take care when doing so. \u203bBecause of the small parts, it may cause choking if swallowed. We recommend keeping out of reach of children.\u00a0 \u2462Please solve the puzzle on a durable and flat surface. \u203bPlease don't throw the pieces about.

  "We are The Overtime Theater, San Antonio\u2019s only home for live, local, and original theater!  We bring you completely new, never before seen productions that otherwise might never have seen the light of day.  On occasion over the years we have asked you, our wonderful and supportive audience, for help to continue our efforts at supporting new plays  - and we need your help again.  When we moved into our current location at 1203 Camden we knew we had our work cut out for us.\nWe were taking over a building that was never meant to be a theater and turned it into two. Yep. Our building was a lab! That's right! It has ugly white and green linoleum flooring. We want to put down a new floor and paint the plain white walls a nice warm tan color. We would also like to paint the outside and do a nice mural to let everyone know we ARE A THEATER!  Now it\u2019s time to give our little corner of downtown another makeover.  We ask for your help to give our theater a few much-needed changes:  replace the floors in the lobby and hallway, replace the ceiling tiles and light bulbs, get an external sign for the theater, and give the outside of our building paint job. Help us make our space more inviting and welcoming to our audiences! With your generous donations we will be able to do all of this  - and hopefully more!  And if you\u2019re not able to help us out, please consider coming out and supporting us by seeing one of our shows.   You can find information on our MainStage shows, our late night specials, and much more by finding us on Facebook, visiting our website at www.otsatx.org or by giving us a call at\n(210) 557-7562. Help us make our space more inviting and welcoming to our audiences! And from all of us at The Overtime Theater... thank you! \n",

Thanks to our community of supporters, we are ready to expand our reach AND our space. Friends, it is time for Arlekin Players Theatre to have our own residence for rehearsals, events, and performances. Currently the growth and production capabilities of our troupe is limited by our space's small size, forcing us to rent venues from other companies in the region to host events and performances.   With your generous support, we will remodel the space adjacent to our studio as an addition and stationary residence for our company's season. Our dedicated volunteers are ready to get their hands dirty by scrubbing, painting and cleaning the new studio, but we need the help of professionals to get the space up to code and make sure our renovations are both smart and safe. We are all excited begin building and embark on our journey to expansion. Your donation in any amount is meaningful for us as a non-profit organization, for we rely on the funding from our supportive community to continue our work. The Catch: This is an all or nothing campaign. If we do not raise our pledged amount of $8,300, we receive none of your donations, so it is imperative we spread the word and inspire the community to help us build our home. ABOUT US\n\n Arlekin Players Theatre was created in Boston in 2009 under the leadership of Artistic Director Igor Golyak. Arlekin Players Theatre has toured in New York, Chicago, and Hartford, Conn., and was a guest participant of the International Festival \u201cGolden Lion\u201d in Lviv, Ukraine. In September 2012, Arlekin Players Theatre was invited to perform its production of \u201cThe Guest,\u201d by Alexander Pushkin, in Moscow Art Theatre School. Performed on one of the most admired stages in Moscow, the production was greeted with a standing ovation. In 2013 we were honored to represent the United States at the prestigious Mondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre in Monaco, hosted by Prince Albert. Currently, we are planning the spring premiere of Natasha's Dream, our first production in English. Our company takes strong pride in our emphasis on self-identity; we are viewed as a Russian troupe to our English audience yet we are not viewed in the same regard to our international audience. Essentially, we are a company of immigrants performing works that play on the ideas of cross-culture, home, and traditions, challenging the idea of nationality, and finding common themes that unite us all.

  "This venture is the dream of couple Joseph Houston and\nWilliam Whelton. Both professionally trained performers they were inspired by\nthe calibre of work being produced in the London fringe scene and the growing\nnumber of creatives in Manchester and set out to bring a new platform for\nfringe theatre.  We propose to create a permanent Fringe Theatre venue in Manchester: Hope Mill Theatre. The theatre will hold up to 100 seats with a varied programme of shows running all year round. Musicals, Plays, one night Cabarets, Gigs, Movie Nights, Comedy Nights etc. it will be primarily a fringe theatre offering a platform for new writers, performers and entertainers alike. The theatre space will also be used as a studio space to be hired out as a rehearsal space for local theatre companies, dance schools and for auditions. We plan each year to be part of the annual Manchester Fringe Theatre, offering a performance space for theatre companies. We want to offer a platform for young writers every year with the opportunity for their work to be produced and performed for an audience. We also want to offer the same opportunity for film students to premiere new movies/ documentaries etc.\u00a0The venue will also hold The Engine Room Caf\u00e9 and Bar. A quirky space that offers great coffee, food, craft beers and wines In order to do all of this we require seating for our\ntheatre. We have been looking at non fixed seating as it helps to make the\nspace more diverse and it is not always easy to find a theatre getting rid of\nseats. We will be purchasing 100 seats and hope that half of them can be\nsponsored by friends, family, Mancunians, businesses, theatre lovers, creatives\u2026anyone\nwho is eager to support this exciting new space!",
  "What is BassMe?

This brings your senses a new dimension of an elevated auditory experience, immersing you in your music, movies and games. Today, more and more entertainment content such as video games are consumed without sound systems or via mobile devices. The problem is that when listening with earphones, you don\u2019t get that full feeling. You don\u2019t feel the sounds.\u00a0 Unfortunately, many listeners raise the volume to crazy high levels in an effort to get that \u00a0\u201ckick\u201d, an emotional auditory we all want when playing games or listening to music. BassMe delivers the vibes exactly to where we like them: straight to your core.\u00a0 The vibes are so pronounced that with BassMe, users often reduce the headset volume because they are receiving the tactile sensation, so you're also protecting your hearing. BassMe \u00a0was designed by music lovers looking to ehnance their sound experience. \u00a0No matter what activity you are doing, BassMe can be there with you.Regardless what shape or size, adapting to your comfort is priority through its ergonomic design and \u201csoft touch\u201d material. Connect your headset via Bluetooth\u00ae, place BassMe on your right shoulder and start your music, video games or movies for a unique experience. The subwoofer should be installed in the center of the chest, at the sternum to use the ribcage as a sounding board.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dive as if you were in action. Be at the center of your favorite movie. Hang on to your plane seat while you enjoy the rhythms of your favorite band.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feel the sound in your bones as you discover what's behind your system. BassMe has the capacity to completely immerse users in sound when coupled with other mobile technologies, such as gaming consoles, smartphones and audio devices. The story of BassMe started at the Startup Weekend Perpignan competition in October 2017. For 50 hours, we worked and gave life to the project. Finishing first in the contest, we decided to continue the adventure together. The company STUDIO-DUROY begins its activity with the marketing of BassMe, the accessory that gives life to sound. We are a team that understands the relationship between sound, emotion and immersion. We are a group of passionate people. We believe BassMe can improve many areas and bring people closer to the immersive content of today and tomorrow. We are very excited to introduce this device.

  "In today\u2019s digital world, everyone deserves the unbeatable sound of true wireless earbuds, free from cables and comfortable enough to forget they're even in your ears. Aoumini is a 2 in 1 Earbuds & Speaker with unparalleled sound performance, state-of-the-art technology and refined design. \u00a0Its ergonomic design is guaranteed to never fall out\u00a0and never cause soreness in ears. Let the music on the go. Aou-mini is not only a wireless earbuds and a wireless speaker. It can fit confortably in your pocket and have non-stop Hi-Fi music anytime, anywhere. In addition to being a portable bluetooth speaker, Aou-mini integrates a wireless earphone that delivers 40 hours of clear voice with one full charge. \u00a0 The Aou-mini provide a rich, high-quality, bass boosted, AAC audio. It\u2019s a great-sounding music, movies, and more to your ears. With our proprietary in-ear ergonomic design, cancel out external \u00a0sounds, other voices, and ambient noise when you\u2019re listening to music \u00a0or on a call.\u00a0 Aou-mini wireless earbuds implemented a Qualcomm QCC302X chipset, which is \u00a0compatible with the latest Bluetooth version 5.0, on each side of the \u00a0earbuds. \u00a0\u00a0 More Stable BT Connection The latest Bluetooth 5.0 chipset features 4x range and simultaneous \u00a0connection of both earbuds. And along with PIFA antenna, Aou-mini secures you uninterrupted connection even in crowded places.\u00a0 The existing true wireless Bluetooth earbuds only have one side of \u00a0earbud that has signal receiver. And the receiver side transmit the \u00a0signal to the other earbud. Now, the two sides of earbuds could receive \u00a0signal from your audio devices simultaneously, which largely increased \u00a0the connection stability of Bluetooth signal.\u00a0 \u00a0 Bluetooth 5.0 is the ubiquitous wireless technology\u2019s latest iteration which enhances connectivity within a 10m range and maintains a super stable wireless connection. A stronger connection means that music is streamed flawlessly with lower power consumption that translates into less recharging and longer playback times. With Bluetooth 5.0, you get the strongest, most reliable connection and seamless\u00a0connectivity between your devices. Strong connection and speed \u00a0allows more detailed and robust audio fidelity transmission and zero \u00a0audio-video lag.\u00a0 The built-in bluetooth speaker and wireless earpiece, allowing you to stream your music anytime, in anywhere. As active, digital natives, we understand the need to go longer between recharges. Aou-minni were designed with unrivaled battery life. They provide up to 5 hours of play time off of a single charge and when used in conjunction with the patented charging case, 40 hours of total play time can be achieved. It will get you through any workout and entertain you during days of travel. The ergonomic shape of Aou-mini is based on the analysis of dozens of different ear shapes, to achieve the best comfort and grip for most ear shapes in every situation. Just pop the it into your ears and play your music.\u00a0 \u00a0Aou-mini are engineered to stay comfortably in your ears on the go during any activity. With a lightweight, comfort-fit design, you won\u2019t feel anything except the music. The Aou-mini's charging compartment is designed as a built-in speaker. Using a unique digital signal processor, and customized ultra slim dynamic speaker, we eliminated every bit of wasted space and shrink the speaker down to a compact dimension without giving up high performance audio fidelity. When you put the earbuds into the storage box and turn on theswitch, you can enter the audio mode.\u00a0 Make your video accessible in other languages and to deaf and hard-of-hearing backers. Aluminum body and let music go wherever you go Aou-mini is designed to go wherever you go. And it's as durable as it is portable, with an aluminum body that delivers a quality and luxurious feel. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another problem of the existing true wireless Bluetooth earbuds is when \u00a0taking calls, there is only one side of earphone working. Cause one \u00a0channel would be used for mic audio output. Benefit from the Bluetooth \u00a05.0 tech, both of the earbuds could be the receiver of audio signal and \u00a0only take one channel. So when taking phone calls, \u00a0Aou-mini allow you to fully listen in both ears.\u00a0 With a gentle tap on the smart button on the Aou-mini, you can play/pause musics, answer/end calls and call up the digital assistant.\u00a0 With Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122 audio codec ensures high quality audio of Aou-mini wireless. Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122 audio coding algorithm provides a means to consistent, low latency and high-quality audio via Bluetooth. It has been used by major consumer electronics products, like the Samsung S9\uff0cB&O Beoplay H9, etc. Aou-mini automatically turns on, enters pairing mode and turns off when you are done using it. IPX5 rating makes Aou-mini earbuds & speaker perfect for outdoor activities on the beach, \u00a0poolside, car, boat or golf cart. It can resist gentle water spray and splash but not submersion in water. The charging case is small and lightweight enough to be stored in your pocket. We have added a hangable opening when designing the product, you can hang the product where you want to prevent it, or carry it anytime, anywhere.\u00a0 You can listen to music anytime, anywhere, in any outdoor activity, whether you want to use it as a earbuds or speaker.",
  "STRETCH GOAL #2 WOW! \u00a0 We smashed through our first stretch goal in just a matter of hours! \u00a0 THANK YOU!!! So now we're setting another stretch goal to reach \u00a36000 before our campaign ends tomorrow. \u00a0 Any additional money raised will go towards boosting our post-production budget, including colour grading, sound-mixing and festival fees. OUR CAMPAIGN ENDS ON MAY 19 at 1:00PM BST, so there's still time to get behind the project and choose a reward, and with your help we can make this thing look and sound amazing! CANNED LAUGHTER is a short film that tells the story of Deirdre Gossamer, a retired comedian who has knitted herself an audience in lieu of performing to a real one.\u00a0 But when one of her home-made punters comes to life and destroys her career memorabilia, she\u2019s forced to re-think her attachment to the \u2018glory days\u2019 and face the once unthinkable prospect of moving on...\u00a0 Deirdre Gossamer is a woman caught in the grip of nostalgia for her own career.\u00a0 She's very much a character close to my own heart, caught in limbo between lauding her former glories yet feeling anchored down by them. Clinging on, not moving on. Looking back on my own fledgling comedy career over a decade ago, I often wonder where I'd be now had I pursued it further. \u00a0But unlike Deirdre Gossamer I always try to look ahead with fresh eyes instead of over my shoulder with rose-tinted ones. CANNED LAUGHTER builds upon a common theme in my work; of fringe figures and outsiders projecting their neuroses onto the inanimate.\u00a0 In Deirdre's case, her hand-knitted antagonist \u2018The Heckler\u2019 initially appears to embody the dissatisfaction she has with her lack of a career as it rampages through her memorabilia collection. \u00a0But by the time its trail of destruction peaks, Deirdre comes to understand something deeper about its actions, and ultimately herself... The Heckler is trying to teach her to let go. Loss is a rite of passage that everyone experiences, but what makes us human is how we react to that loss and what aspects of it we carry forward as we continue to move through life.\u00a0 In CANNED LAUGHTER Deirdre finds herself at that very juncture, confronting her own constructed stage-persona and being forced to re-consider her attachment to it.\u00a0 Without uttering a single word, The Heckler asks Deirdre the question at the heart of the film... What defines you? Deirdre Gossamer's antagonist in the film is the humourless, destructive audience member of her own making; The Heckler.\u00a0 Like everyone else in Deirdre's self-constructed crowd, The Heckler is cobbled together from a mix of tatty old clothes and junk, with his hands and face stitched together from one of Deirdre's trademark wooly jumpers. To bring this unusual character to life, we'll be using puppetry. I've always had a huge fascination and appreciation for the use of puppetry in films, which I was lucky enough to put into practice on my previous short film SCRAPS:\u00a0 The choice to animate the character of The Heckler this way, as opposed to using a creature costume or a live-action actor, is rooted in the idea that objects can take on lives of their own.\u00a0 Deirdre's collection of career memorabilia becomes more than just an assortment of nostalgic knick-knacks. \u00a0They become ghosts of a time in her life that haunt her. \u00a0 The Heckler just takes this torment to the extreme. \u00a0OLIVER JAMES HYMANS is an award-winning London-based puppet artist. He trained on the MA Scenography course at Central Saint Martins in 2006 and has since worked on a variety of theatre projects as a director, designer, performer and puppeteer.\u00a0 His work has been presented in theatres and beyond, including at the Little Angel Theatre, Tate Modern, The National Gallery, Camden Roundhouse, Museum of London, Almeida Theatre and Blind Summit Theatre. Oliver has also worked across short films and music videos, designing and puppeteering the eponymous puppet for Chris Brake\u2019s short film SCRAPS, as well as the title character in HOW A KITE FLIES, voiced by Sir Ian McKellen.\u00a0 He also served as director of puppetry on a music video for The Correspondents and provided puppeteering for the Hot Chip video SPELL. CANNED LAUGHTER is the story of one woman's obsession with her glory days, and her inability to move past them. It follows in the footsteps of other 'faded star' films that explore the trappings of fame and its toxic allure for those who have lost it. \u00a0Films like WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE and SUNSET BOULEVARD that have characters in a state of arrested development at their heart.\u00a0 The look of these films, with their heavy shadows and high contrast lighting, is something we also want to draw inspiration from as we create the dark and dingy basement 'comedy club' where Deirdre relives her greatest moments. Throughout the film we'll also be using warped and cracked reflections as a recurring image, suggestive of both Deirdre's inability to escape her own reflections upon her career and her increasingly fragile state of mind as The Heckler's rampage takes its toll. \u00a0 It's a motif that's used to powerful effect in other films as diverse as THE OLD DARK HOUSE, THE WRONG MAN and BAIT. For the handmade members of Deirdre's audience we'll also be taking inspiration from the paper bag masks of cartoonist SAUL STEINBERG, with their rictus grins that are permanently locked into silent laughs. \u00a0 This odd assortment of inanimate punters are all that Deirdre has for company, so saying goodbye to them will be a true test of whether she can ever move on from the past.

  "After I started cooking on my own, I realized my mom had been trying to kill me. Okay, that\u2019s not really true. But I did realize that some of her recipes, while still delicious, could use a little California makeover. That\u2019s what Family Style is all about. It\u2019s been a labor of love turning my childhood favorites into healthier, wholesome dishes that still taste amazing.\u00a0\u00a0 A COOKBOOK FOR THE CONFLICTED MIDWESTERNER IN US ALL These days, most of us are seeking out healthier options\u2014and all of us have less time to fuss in the kitchen. That\u2019s why Family Style is made for everyone. Sure, you\u2019ll find gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan recipes, but it\u2019s designed to use however it fits your life, whether that\u2019s as an everyday cookbook or as a go-to when you\u2019re craving a taste of home but need both nourishment and comfort. Every dish in the book features my mom\u2019s original recipe alongside my modified version, so you can follow step-by-step or make modifications of your own! I\u2019ve made them easy to follow and accessible to make\u2014after all, I\u2019m just a home chef trying to cook like mom. I\u2019ve also filled Family Style with my own notes and my mother\u2019s wisdom, accompanied by beautiful photographs from my talented friend Jenna Peffley.\u00a0 WHERE IT ALL BEGAN Family Style began over lemon bars. My mom was visiting me in L.A. and we were preparing ingredients together. As she began reciting \u201cbutter, sugar, flour,\u201d I was echoing with \u201ccoconut oil, coconut sugar, gluten-free flour.\u201d She stopped me. \u201cYou can\u2019t make these healthy! They won\u2019t taste good!\u201d But I knew that was far from the truth. And the idea for this cookbook was born. \u201cMom,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m going to write a book, just like you always wanted me to.\u201d GETTING TO HEALTHIER Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014my mom is an amazing cook. I ate whatever she put in front of me (usually at 5:30pm) and never really thought about what was in it or whether it was good for me: Oreos, mac \u2018n cheese, and all the meat, butter, and carbs you could ever want. But all that changed when I left home and I started cooking for myself.\u00a0 For one, I naturally gravitated away from meat. I didn\u2019t love handling it and it was expensive! Then one of my friends was diagnosed as Celiac, and I made a pact to go gluten-free with her. This was a time when the gluten-free life was not trending, and options were seriously limited. I learned to get creative with substitutions, and these little changes gradually introduced me to the world of clean eating. That\u2019s when I noticed a real change in my body. My skin cleared up, I had more energy, and I just felt good. I realized that cleaning up my diet actually changed my life. MAKING A CAREER OUT OF EATING (AND WRITING ABOUT IT) My own diet was just the first step. While I was experimenting with new ingredients in my tiny apartment kitchen, I was also studying journalism at Indiana University. After I graduated and moved to L.A., I started working as a TV host. My first gigs were in entertainment news covering celebrity gossip. It gave me valuable experience, yet it quickly burned me out. I began searching for what else was out there, and landed on a show called Food Feed on the Young Hollywood channel. That was it. Even after just the very first episode I felt this crazy excitement stirring up within me, and a new wish revealed itself: I wanted to make a career out of eating\u2014or at least being in the world of food. So I continued to host Food Feed while also immersing myself in wellness, lifestyle, and food writing to bring it all together, contributing to Refinery29, The Chalkboard Mag and Angeleno Magazine. I\u2019ve interviewed chefs, toured amazing restaurants, rolled up and my sleeves in kitchens, continuing to learn and eventually bringing these experiences to Family Style. MAKING AND PUBLISHING FAMILY STYLE Just like my entry into clean eating, my transition to writing a cookbook has been all about experimentation and learning. I had the idea (thanks to the lemon bars) but no idea on how to start. Luckily, I had an expert in my circle. Victor Gonzalez, founder of GR\u00d8SS Magazine, offered to help me publish it, and also helped me assemble my rockstar crew: Casey Martin of Play Studio to lend his design expertise, Jenna Peffley to photograph, Bridge Stuart to help with video and production, and Lisa Plachy to bring the writing together. Your contribution supports not just me and this endeavor, but all the partners who made Family Style possible. Meanwhile, it\u2019s been my full-time job schlepping back and forth (and back and forth again) to every grocery store in L.A. as I assemble, bake, test and retest every recipe in Family Style. A special shoutout to every friend who received an assignment from me to also test the recipes to make sure it worked for everybody, not just me. But then, of course, I had to call mom. Over the past year we\u2019ve exchanged endless texts and phone calls to share recipes. Most of the ones in Family Style came to me as pictures of post-it notes. Like most good cooks, my mom\u2019s recipes were more in her head and heart than formally written down. It gave me extra room to make them my own, and of course, plenty of space to make them yours, too.\u00a0 THE MONEY We're printing a batch of 1,000 premium books which takes up a major portion of the funds we're raising. The remainder of the funds we raise go towards the branding & design, photography, videography, shipping, writing and overall production of this exciting book.\u00a0\u00a0",

  "\u00a0Our helmet has improved lights compared to the standard competitor\u2019s. When was the last time you heard of abduction on the news? \u00a0Odds are, not too long ago. The LIT LIDZ helmet can help prevent this by providing global tracking in real-time. The helmet is equipped with a GPS device and an SOS button. If the child wearing the helmet is lost or in danger, emergency agencies can use the GPS to locate your child. The SOS button can also be manually activated to send out a distress signal. This innovative new safety helmet can help keep children (or anyone) safe and give parents back a new standard of peace. While keeping the skull safe is the #1 priority, what about helmet safety beyond the traditional sense? Lights Global Tracking As a parent, your child's safety is always your number one priority. But what about when they're enjoying outdoor activities? How can you be sure they're safe? Avoid becoming another statistic with The LIT LIDZ helmet. As bike and skateboarders riders, we\u2019re no strangers to the concept of helmet safety. We\u2019re avid supporters of a quality helmet during outdoor activity. Wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of head injury by up to 85%. Of those injuries, 62% of deaths can be prevented with helmet use. But what if we could add a new protocol for safety? Emergency Camera We didn\u2019t overlook the invaluable purpose of the helmet - we just perfected it. Running, skipping, skating, and biking are all pleasures of outdoor leisure. If you\u2019re spending time outside, you need a helmet that goes all the way. Other helmets may look cool, or have a fancy price tag, but what if you could strap on a one-of-a-kid safety experience that looks like an ordinary one? We\u2019ve designed our helmets to look normal and user-friendly. We want anyone, child or adult, to go about their regular activity but with an enhanced state of well-being. Our helmet is perfect for keeping your head and peace of mind safe while you play. It's easy to use, too - \u00a0just unpackage it, plug it in to charge, and you're already in the process of beating the odds. Our helmet features bright LED lights that will keep you visible on sidewalks, roads, or courts. Forget bulky designs or unaffordable price tags. The LIT LIDZ helmet does it all. We just want you to strap it on. Customization Speakers We want to make our packaging as simple as possible. We make sure to offer minimal packaging and delivery tracking support. Warranty First Time On Kickstarter? No worries - We\u2019ve got you! Here\u2019s how to secure your pre-order: Prototype & Design We worked on the design tirelessly, making sure our helmets are the safest ones on the market for your peace of mind and your child's sake.

Thank you for your continuous support! At the moment, the only challenge we can see is that the development of generation II comments and software cannot begin until this campaign is over. That development is estimated to take 37 weeks, which would mean that production couldn't begin until after the start of 2023, with delivery to our donors happening in mid-to-late April. We are confident that we can overcome this hurdle, but it is something that we are keeping a close eye on. With your help, we can continue supporting our software development team.",
  "Good day beautiful Kickstarter people! My name is SassyBlack and I am a multi-dimensional musician. I have been studying and honing in on my musical skills for over 15 years, having toured nationally and internationally for the last 8. You may know me from my work as half of THEESatisfaction or my appearances on the first two Shabazz Palaces albums released on Sub Pop Records. Since starting my solo career as SassyBlack in 2014, I have released 12 projects (2 albums, 4 EPs and several beat tapes) all of which I wrote, produced and performed and available here.\u00a0 I am very excited to share my new work on my third album, Ancient Mahogany Gold. This record dissects my journey into my current state of self as well as how I\u2019m moving in the world. It deals with complex and relatable experiences through my lens as a Black Queer woman. I will be producing, writing, singing, rapping, and speaking on all the songs. I'll be taking a big step in a new direction by having special guest appearances from several talented instrumentalists. These artists will present their take on my production and experience, bringing another perspective to the story.\u00a0 WHAT'S THE PLAN MA'AM? WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\u00a0 In an effort to demystify the successful musician and what that looks like, I am interested in redefining the relationship between artists and fans, making it so you can directly support me and my efforts without the middle person. I am campaigning to raise $12,000 to record, mix, master and promote this album. We know the importance of music, art and storytelling in all cultures. It is also widely understood that these stories can be erased from history. All funds go towards the production & release of my album:\u00a0 Grand Total = $12,000 REWARDS! I like receiving things, what kind of goodies do you have?\u00a0 I am elated to share with you a few awesome rewards for your pledge to my campaign. There are fun musical themed goodie packs (named after some of my releases), buttons, tickets to one of my shows and of course a sweet digital download and signed CD for Ancient Mahogany Gold.\u00a0",
  "Hi friends. Time to get real with y'all for a minute and tell you that the whole music business is in your hands. That's right! Labels are dying. Record stores are dead -- streaming is in. But wait, there's more! : ] Streaming services like Spotify pay between nothing to half a penny per stream.\n Why? Music royalties rates were written in the 1950's before streaming music was invented. So it's a new frontier, and currently songwriters like myself face a challenging road ahead. That's why a direct connection to an audience is the one saving grace for an independent musician like me.\u00a0 Even a million streams a year equals around $13 per day.\u00a0 Old music business:\u00a0Artists would spend a bunch of money (or borrow from a label), make a record, and hope to sell enough to make the money back and stay afloat till the next project. My first studio record, Congress Hotel cost upwards of $50,000 to make, distribute, and promote.\u00a0\u00a0New music business:The artist launches a pre-sale for the record before it is made. If there isn't enough demand for the project (i.e. the artist doesn't reach their funding goal), all the people who backed the project get their money back and the record doesn't get made. If the campaign is successful though, the artist can make the record without having to worry about the initial costs or if they'll sell enough to make it back.\nThis is HUGE for 3 reasons.\u00a0 1. Y'all are the new record label. Which is good because I'm making music for you, not for the music industry.\u00a0 2. Kickstarter offers something the traditional music business doesn't. EXPERIENCE AND COMMUNITY. I've done 2 Kickstarters in the past, and saw how much more FUN it is to launch a record this way. Having you along for the process of making it, sharing the updates, getting your feedback on the song choices, artwork, etc., is a way better experience than it would be just making it on my own and putting it on iTunes / Spotify.  3. Lastly, I know not everyone wants to pay as little as possible for music. I know that there are many out there that truly believe in artists, that care about and want to see independent artists continue making art. If you're reading this, you're likely one of these people already (thank you!). So this is where Kickstarter makes such a difference.\u00a0Pre-purchasing a record or any of the extra rewards through a\u00a0campaign like this provides the absolute biggest bang for the buck in terms of what the artist gets to keep. So your contribution here has a bigger impact than nearly any other way of buying or streaming music.\u00a0 You're not just getting something you enjoy, you're protecting the survival of those who make it! Thank you, thank you, thank you!! The expense of making a record includes\u00a0 Mixing FeesMastering FeesSession Musician FeesArtwork DesignT-shirt Design / ProductionCD DuplicationVinyl Mastering / ProductionThe upfront costs alone are close to $10,000 -- and that's with doing some of it myself and pulling favors from friends.\u00a0 This is the first project of original songs I've done in 5 years and I'm SO EXCITED to share it with you. By some miracle I've been given an opportunity to record in a historic studio, home to some of the most famous and recognizable songs in the history of popular music. But all of this is on the down low, done late at night, in secret. I'm dying to tell you more, but I can't yet. I can't even tell you why I can't tell you. But I'm hopeful that some day I'll have the green light to share with y'all the full story.\u00a0But regardless of where I'm recording, I've finally gotten the chance to record some music the old-school way. Live, with everyone playing together in the same room. One full take at a time, no mistakes. The only thing left to re-record (or overdub as we would say) will be my vocals. (Something that wasn't uncommon back in the day either).\u00a0Here's a little sneak peak, with the original scratch vocals.\u00a0 If the following stretch goals are met, backers get the following bonuses!$20,000! WE DID IT! WE GET TO MAKE A RECORD.\u00a0Also every backer at the $25 level and above gets an\u00a0\"Ernie Halter \u2764\ufe0fs Me\" Sticker\" $25,000! Online listening party / chat with all backers!

All backers at $15 level and above will get the ORIGINAL HOME STUDIO DEMOS to the songs that made the record. $40,000! All backers at $15 level and above will get a special AUDIO INTERVIEW explaining the story behind the recording, and the songs on it. $45,000!!I\u00a0 WILL WRITE A SONG WITH ALL THE BACKERS VIA AN HOUR LONG WEBCAST.

  "From the age of 5 in my parents\u2019 kitchen, experimenting and playing with food, to becoming vegetarian at the age of 11 and figuring out what do I like to eat and how to make it (with the help of my lovely family of course), to hosting dinner parties for my friends in high school, then finding my first cooking job.\u00a0 Later on I continued to explore food in my travels around the world (24 countries and counting...!)\u00a0 And then I moved to Canada..

  "Jamie Roberts is neither a boy or a girl. They're a PIRATE! And recently, Jamie and their two friends, Thomas and Daniel, have...found, an unfinished map. What can they do with this map? And so begins the winding, magical, epic adventure that is The Legend of Jamie Roberts. With your help, we want to get the first 4 chapters of this legend into one beautiful, shiny book. (Some say \"graphic novels,\" some say \"trade paperback.\" I say, \"beautiful, shiny book.\") Ok, it's the royal \"we,\" because it's me - Kelci Crawford, maker of fine comics for nearly 8 years. And I've run KickStarter campaigns nearly every year since I started, so I know what I'm doing. The Legend of Jamie Roberts is under my small-press company, Fantasyville Productions, LLC. Sounds like a fancy title, like Captain O'Malley. But sadly, I am a one-person operation on a tight budget, which is why I'm on KickStarter to begin with. This is the story I needed when I was a teenager - confused about my gender identity, wanting to sail the seas and go adventuring away from my positively crap-tastic circumstances. I'm making this story for all those out there like teenage-me, sailing the chaotic seas of their own identity, wanting something new and exciting and adventurous!

  "Help us print the third book (out of four) of the queer webcomic Go Get a Roomie! Go Get a Roomie! can be read online for free HERE! Book 1 and 2 are sold HERE! Chlove, the author of\u00a0Go Get a Roomie!, is teaming up with Hiveworks again to print the third book of the now completed webcomic! This third printed book will contain chapters 24 to 33, plus some special bonus material, and of course, it\u2019s printed in color - specifically in the pink tint you know and love. A lot can happen within a group of friends. Sometimes they become roomies. Sometimes they grow into something more, all of them forming different kinds of families together. Go Get a Roomie! is the light-hearted and tender story of the evolving relationship between Roomie, the fun-loving sensual hippie, and Lillian, the sleepy story-teller and vivid dreamer. Gravitating around them is a cast of diverse characters including Ramona, the angry a-dolt, and Richard, the bubbly sub. The third book follows these characters as connections shift, tempers rise, and understanding and hugs are found. Where is Roomie going, with that happy smile and drunken saunter? How is Lillian changing, still safekeeping her precious dreams and stories, but growing accustomed to Roomie's chaste presence in her bed... to a point where sleeping alone feels off? Why is Ramona so reluctant to explore her soft and spiritual side, unable to compromise the hardcore image she's been building for so long? And little Richie boy... just go get that prince of yours and be careful with them, okay? Go Get a Roomie!\u00a0can be described as a sensual, dreamlike, and spiritual comedy, built lovingly over ten years. The story is told in a strip format and focuses on the themes of joy, connectivity and personal growth. It's also very gay. Unbelievably gay. Most of the cast is queer (LGBT+) and much of the story is focused on queer romance. The comic is aimed at an adult audience and contains (non-sexualized) nudity. Go Get a Roomie! was distributed online through the publisher and studio Hiveworks. While the webcomic has now completed its decade-long run, it is still welcoming both new and old readers with open arms, as the strips are being \"re-run\" with author commentary during 2021 and 2022 while Chlove prepares a new comic for online serialization. Books 1 & 2 of Go Get a Roomie! have been Kickstarted (and printed) in 2014 and 2018 respectively, with the 2018 edition including a reprint of book 1. Thanks to the success of those Kickstarters, we can now bring you book 3! Book 3 contains chapters 24 to 33, along with some bonus material. It is designed to match book 1 & 2 perfectly. The books are printed in color, measuring in at 9x7 inches and are available in three formats: ebook, softcover, and hardcover. We'll be producing brand-new merchandise to sweeten the deal on higher tiers! Here are the different options you can select as a backer: The rewards in the Goodie bundle include a double-sided bookmark, a mini print, and a sticker sheet. Higher tiers include signed bookplates - a stylish adhesive plate autographed and numbered by Chlove herself. Bookplates will be received with a lining covering the sticky side. Backers can then remove the lining and stick the bookplate wherever they please in their book.\u00a0 Fans who have not yet purchased any of the books but find they have a Roomie-shaped gap in their bookcase have the chance to purchase books 1-2-3 in a trilogy bundle. A few lucky fans will be able to back the tiers to receive one of the original traditionally drawn strips. * We will consult backers to see which strips they would like, but not all strips are available. As the two previous Kickstarters included a special stretch goal to print a limited hardcover edition of book 1 and 2, we decided to include the hardcover option in this project from the start. We are not including any stretch goals in this campaign so as to focus the collected budget on the production of both editions. The Hiveworks team will be assisting Chlove during the campaign by managing updates, backer contact, as well as printing and shipping. However, this campaign faces a unique challenge - book production and shipping to backers will be heavily impacted by covid. 2021 is still carrying the issues created by the pandemic of 2020. We will, as always, do our best to meet the suggested estimated delivery date and have made sure to pad the estimated dates to work around potential delays. However, those potential delays are harder to predict and circumvent in the current situation. We thank you all for your kindness and patience in this trying time! Thank you for your continued support!\u00a0\u2606\u2606\u2606 Thank you for helping us print Go Get a Roomie! Book 3. You can find more of Chlove\u2019s work on her Twitter and Patreon, and be sure to give the comic a read if you are discovering it for the first time! Special thanks to Megan Lavey-Heaton for doing the pre-press work on the comic.\u00a0",

  "We are Odisei Music, a young company based in Barcelona that helps saxophone players improve their playing skills much faster and easier.\u00a0 We've created Travel Sax, the smallest and lightest electronic saxophone\u00a0in the world.\u00a0\ud83c\udfb7\u27a1\ud83d\udcf1 \ud83d\ude80\u00a0 This small electronic saxophone is the perfect partner to help you practice anytime, anywhere.\u00a0 It's so small and light weight that you can carry it anywhere you go and use your free time to practice your saxophone licks! \u00a0*Case design might slightly vary it's final design (always looking cooler) Three years ago Ramon Ma\u00f1as, the founder of Odisei Music moved to Berlin to study Song Writing. While living there, he started learning how to play the saxophone his cousin gave him. At that time he was sharing a flat with 2 other musicians and he started facing the first serious problem.\u00a0 PROBLEM 1) It's a loud instrument - so practicing late at night was impossible and practicing at other times was not easy because you disturb your family and neighbors. (Even if you are a superb PRO player).\u00a0 One day his neighbours even called the police \ud83d\udc6e\u200d\u2642\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude94 because he was playing the saxophone at 10 pm. Fortunately, nothing serious happened. At that time however, he had no choice other than start practicing in different places like public parks. This was cool until the winter came.\u00a0 On top of travelling a lot for business, he started facing a second problem.\u00a0 PROBLEM 2) Carrying the saxophone when travelling is very expensive and it is not convenient because it is a heavy instrument. He started looking for solutions in the market to solve his problem and he found very few options \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642. The electronic saxophones he found where too big to carry them on a daily basis and the keys weren't feeling like playing a real saxophone. At that point, he decided, together with his friend Guillem to start building the first real electronic Travel Sax prototype.\u00a0 While developing Travel Sax we interviewed more than 50 different saxophone players and we noticed that all of them had the same two problems (noise and transportation). So, we set out design objectives. 1. Design the smallest and lightest electronic saxophone in the market. 2. Make sure that the position of the Keys and the pressure needed to play them where as similar as a conventional saxophone. 3. Create a user-friendly instrument that helps saxophone players practice without disturbing anyone. 4. Develop a smartphone app that helps you set practicing routines and teaches you cool saxophone concepts. The reason why we chose Kickstarter is because we believe that sharing Travel Sax with this great community will help us reach many more saxophone players. We want you to become part of this project from the beginning, and feel part of the Travel Sax community. We are sure that Travel Sax will change the way Saxophone players practice and it will help them improve much faster. \u00a0We have set our retail price at 499 \u20ac, \u00a0approximately 50% more affordable compared to a basic saxophone. To reward your support we have decided to offer these special discounts! CHARITY TRAVEL SAX Our mission at Odisei Music is to spread music all over the world. We love music and musicians and we believe that every single human being deserves the opportunity to have musical education. Unfortunately, there are people who can't afford it! To help , we will be giving away a Free Travel Sax to SONA ACCI\u00d3 MUSICAL, when we reach our goal. This associacion is based in Barcelona and its mission is helping people who suffer from social exclusion to get free musical education. They already have 3 saxophone students \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb! 1) We will be limiting the number of Travel Sax's produced to 100 units now, so you will be one of the first 100 users worldwide to have a Travel Sax.\u00a0 2) We will be personalizing your Travel Sax with your Name or a phrase you want to have on your Travel Sax (20 characters max.) \u00a0 3) Limited Edition: all of the saxophones will be having a serial number. Each one different so they will be completely unique. \n\u00a0 We are a team of musicians with engineering and business backgrounds that started Odisei Music to help Saxophone players learn their instruments faster and easier. Our love for music, hard work and your support will be the key to make Travel Sax a success.\u00a0 \u00a0KEY PARTNERS Our registered Design\u00ae has been developed in Barcelona by our engineering team you just read about\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffc.\u00a0 Travel Sax will be manufactured at D-Factory in Barcelona, the biggest Digital Factory in Europe using the latest 3D Printing Technology. Every single Travel Sax will be personalized thanks to the use of the HP Multi Jet Fusion 3D Printing Technology.\u00a0 HOW TO PERSONALIZE YOURS? Don't worry, we will contact you after the kickstarter campaign finishes and ask you what you want us to print on your Travel Sax (max. 20 characters). \n\u00a0 UPS is the company that we will be working with to deliver your Travel Sax fast* and safe to your home. We have chosen them because they are the most reliable shipping company in Spain and they ship internationally. \u00a0\n\u00a0 * You will be receiving your Travel Sax in order of purchase - starting July 2019.\u00a0 We love music just like you do, and this project means a lot to us. We have been working really hard for more than a year to get to the point where we are now and it makes us really proud to be able to share it with you. Your support is extremely important for us because it will help us make Travel Sax a reality and help many saxophone players navigate their daily challenges. We are extremely thankful for your support and trust. See you soon! \u00a0\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

While he imagines himself returning quickly to Paris, the return paths will shake his illusions.\u00a0 Director Sylvestre Bary's first long film movie, In Vino Veritas is a bridge between the peoples and cultures of France and Romania. A comedy-drama that looks with tenderness and humor at the deep discomfort of a generation. By probing the heart of a man of our time, this comical, offbeat and moving road trip asks the fundamental question: what makes life worth living?

  "Hello, my name is Anna (also known as private.milk on most social media). Around last year I got invested into Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor, and noticed how little merchandise there is from the show and manga. Simply put, this is a passion project born from my love of the series and my want to see plush toys from it! I decided to create designs of Kaiji and Kazuya as their relationship was one of the more impactful to me from the series. The plush is sized at 20 cm (or ~7.9 inches) and would be be made with fleece materials and embroidery. This kickstarter is to help me gauge how many others feel the same way and to fund this project (as ordering plushies from a manufacturer is an expensive venture). IMPORTANT NOTE (PLEASE READ BEFORE PLEDGING): This kickstarter is targeted to fund the Kaiji plush first and foremost. This is because of my expectations of how many people will help to fund this project. HOWEVER, if the project gets more funding than expected, the Kazuya plush will get made, as well. I included both designs to gauge people's interest in the project. The funding will cover the cost I took out on both samples and if the Kazuya plush gets made, you can sub him in exchange for Kaiji (on either the single or double plushie pledge), but note that this is by no means guaranteed. Leftovers will be put on my Etsy shop.\u00a0Put more simply, Kazuya is a stretch goal plush if and only we get past the initial $3,000. Please do not buy the 2 plush pledge under the expectation that Kazuya is guaranteed to get funded. Thank you! Finally, production of the final plush will only start once and if the Kickstarter gets funded. Seeing as I'm giving this campaign a 60 day trial, I wanted to plan around the possibility around any delays in shipping, so I'm guessing the delivery of the plush would be around September (but I will keep everyone updated if that changes!). To keep up with any major updates, please check out either my instagram (private.milk) or my twitter (@Private_Milk_). If you wish to support the project without actually getting a plushie, any shares or small donations are greatly appreciated. I'm not the type to ask of things like that, but I would love to see this project get off the ground. Thank you so much for reading and considering supporting my little passion project! :D Zawa Zawa~ \u00a0 \u00a0Out of curiosity, I also made a poll for interest in any future FKMT themed plushies: https://strawpoll.com/polls/XmZRj88MPZd\u00a0",
  "Thanks so much for taking time to give to my very first studio album:\u00a0 \"DAY 1\" I have been dreaming of the day that I could release a solo studio album since I was 11 years old and first played bass in church. Since that day, I have sought to play music that inspires hope in people and gives glory to the creator. Which is why I am over the moon excited to be recording and releasing this album!\u00a0 Utilizing crowdfunding is empowering me to make an album that is true to my vision and doesn't compromise it's message of the overwhelming and incredible love of the Father, shown through His son Jesus and given to us by His Spirit. Also this album is just plain funky! So if the lyrics don't grab you the hard grooves and expert notes layed down by musicians: Tom Amend (Keys), Julian Carey (Bass), and Brian Claxton (Drums) will make your booty sway all day long. \u00a0 I held nothing back on this album. There are songs with full percussion breaks, songs with fat horn lines and even songs with a gospel choir! \u00a0I am so proud of this album and can't wait to blow you away with what myself and some incredible people have created. \u00a0 I have grown up playing music in many different fields and have garnered connections all over the world.  This record will be promoted and used to build up people in all walks of life and will lead to opportunities for more people to get involved and create music that brings hope and love to this earth.   When you give to this project simply tell me what \"You want\" and I will deliver it to you. Whether it is a copy of the album, a personalized singing message or a song written just for you; I want to give you something that shows my immense gratitude for you helping me create this album. Thanks for taking the time to check out this project and I can't wait to share the finished product with you!",
  "Hey guys, I took two years out, no performances, no new music, stayed low key. Studio- home- studio-home and endless writing sessions. I had to compromise many friendships to get to this space, because staying focused has been The Priority and I do hope many of you can forgive me for being so absent. I finished 4 or 5 projects during that time, but nothing was good enough, nothing was truly ME. I've gone through a break up, a\u00a0 creative depression, lost some good friends, reached a quarter life crisis and then ... it finally came, 5 months of inspiration that lead me to writing my best work yet. \"Situationships\" is going to be a playlist, with a new song released every couple of weeks, a collection of my thoughts, feelings and experiences all in one place. Drawing references to social media, infidelity and passion, the music will leave you pondering the complexity of your own relationships. It truly speaks for the emotional state of this generation. I'm a very proud person, but the truth is - I can't do this alone. I shot two videos already, the first one will be dropping on the 9th of May. I need to do more, I MUST do more and I need your support. I must shoot another two videos. I've put my everything into this, literally everything I have, so I just need a little help. I need a minimum of \u00a3800 just to cover the costs of videos, if we can get more, that would be amazing, I will use the rest for PR.\u00a0 I can't tell you how much this means to me. I live and breathe music, I can't wait to get back on the stage. I would appreciate every contributions whether it's \u00a31 or \u00a350, does not matter, I will be extremely grateful. You can share this with a few friends or people you think might support it. Thank you so SO much x \u00d2LAH",
  "***A note about delivery date: I hope to have the cookbook completed and delivered by the end of this year (2019). The projected delivery date on the campaign of Dec. 2020 is the absolute latest date considering all possible delays that may arise in production. Chef Bear is teaming up with Chef Osa Bear and their cub Lil' Osito Bear to bring you the first ever cookbook from Cow by Bear. Equal parts mouthwatering recipes and amusing biography, the book will be accompanied by gorgeous photography and whimsical illustrations. With an estimated 200 original recipes, this fully-colored, hardcover cookbook promises to be like no other on your shelf.\u00a0\u00a0 Hello you beautiful human! My name is Chef Bear. I imagine I've had the great pleasure of mingling with many of you at one of my Cow by Bear gastronomical experiences, but if this is our first meeting please allow me to introduce myself. I was born many moons ago in Kodiak, Alaska. I spent my youth like any other cub, playing caribou eyes and raiding the tents of unsuspecting campers. My idyllic world all came crashing down, however, when I was witness to my parents' grizzly murder by the hands of poachers. I was kidnapped and sold into a traveling circus. While in France performing stunts with the bearded lady, I seized an opportunity to flee my circus-performing captors. I was quickly befriended by a group of local artists who introduced me to human culture and cultivated my \"awakening,\" in which I learned to walk, talk and, most importantly, cook. I ultimately worked my way up to head chef at a famous Parisian restaurant before taking my talents on the road all over the globe. It's so crazy to think about now, but I have cooked on every continent and in over 100 countries, bringing people together with my wild dinner parties. In 2011, after a series of traumatic events, I arrived in San Diego and opened the first official Cow by Bear location.\u00a0\u00a0 Cow by Bear is a 'dinner party experience experiment' started out of my downtown San Diego den in 2011. It has grown more than I ever could have imagined since then, operating nearly every night in secret locations around San Diego, Seattle and Savannah (GA). Reserved to just 14 guests in a communal, social setting, the experience is designed to bring strangers together at one table, connecting them via the best food, drink and story imaginable. It's a place where you not only eat a world class meal cooked by a bear, but leave with new friends and stories to remember.\u00a0 Now with Food by Bear, I'll be sharing my tales and giving you the recipes and tools needed to bear fruit with your own dinner parties, bringing people together around your magical table.\u00a0 I have wanted to write this cookbook forever, but between the rigorous Cow by Bear dinner schedule and intermittent hibernating, I haven't been able to find the time to write a truly great memoir (and yes, this is a memoir. I can't write a cookbook without writing about what got me to this place). After recently deciding to wind down the Cow by Bear dinner series, I've taken a deep dive into my diaries and recipe journals to organize the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me into this book. I've been writing a monthly newsletter with stories and recipes for years now, but this cookbook will contain nearly 200 new and original recipes never before published. Hardback and fully colored, it will be every bit as epic as our guests have come to expect from Cow by Bear.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Food by Bear will be structured by my experiences cooking and hosting dinner parties in eight different countries that have a particularly raucous significance in my journey. Beginning in France where I had my awakening and ending in San Diego with the creation of Cow by Bear, the book will take you through everything I've learned along the way in my fabled journey. Mix and match recipes from various chapters or stick to the script, I'll give you everything you need to create your own dinner party experience experiment. Cow by Bear would never have sustained for so long without the support of so many of you fine humans and it's my hope we can draw from that same spirit to bring this book to life. Let's do this together!\u00a0\u00a0 Much of the content for this book has already been created, and I'm now testing a series of new recipes and the stories that inspired them. I have a wonderful team assembled to produce the photography and illustrations that will assist in making this a truly unique cookbook. I can bearly wait to put it in your paws. I originally intended this book to be traditionally published, but after conversations with several publishers it became clear they wouldn't allow me to write the book my way. My spiritual advisor, the Great Oso, suggested Kickstarter. I've consulted with a sloth of human professionals and concluded the $35,000 fundraising goal is the minimum needed to produce, print and deliver the first run of this book in a way that I would be proud to put my stamp on. Any amount raised above that will go towards further enhancing the quality of the book (recipe count, paper type, dimensions of the book), marketing and to print more copies once it sells out. Your support will go directly towards creating the best book possible with each and every one of my special creature powers.\u00a0 Cow by Bear began as a grass roots experience. There was never any money or outside backing involved, just a wild idea and even wilder guests that were interested in something fresh. That's exactly what I'm aiming for with Food by Bear - a cookbook like no other and enough humans out there crazy enough to want to be a part of it. Thank you all from the bottom of my big bear heart! I'm pleased to offer not only several levels to pledge for the Food by Bear cookbook itself, but other exciting ways to be involved with and help support the project. The Collector's Package gets you the cookbook along with the essentials from every Cow by Bear dinner: my apron, a flask to carry your Haitian rhum, four dinner plates and four sets of cutlery.\u00a0 The remaining Cow by Bear dinners on our calendar are sold out and I don't plan on offering that (un)traditional experience in the future. Exclusive to this campaign, however, we're offering two ways to attend a Cow by Bear dinner: pledge for 1) your own private party of 14 guests or 2) two seats at a small run of special dinners we're putting on to support Food by Bear. Both experiences come with a signed copy of the book for every guest in attendance.\u00a0",

  "Hello people My name is Ivan and I'm cook from Bulgaria. My idea is for publishing a book with North-West Bulgarian dishes. I like to share my family's recipes and preserve the North-west Bulgarian culture(let say that is like Bavarian in Germany, Andalusian in Spain or Scotland in UK). Also I have some almost forgotten dishes from the past.\u00a0 Until now I have around 120-130 different recipes, mostly of them vegan and vegetarian. Thank you for your help. So I need around 300 euro for the publishing 200 samples - just the text*(without pictures) in Bulgarian language and around 80-100 for the book cover design. If the goal is going better than I expected - around 200 euro more than I will plan a English version too. All the money that I make from the\u00a0 book selling\u00a0 I will donate back to recreation center in Mokresh, Montana. So if you help me you help them also. Than\u043a you for your donations.

  "HELLO! Welcome to my 5th Kickstarter (4th comic based Kickstarter)! After having such a blast with the previous MAKE 100 campaign last year with my short comic Homecoming I decided to give it another shot! This year I bring you another short spin off comic - all about Jamie, the one character from my Webcomic everyone always wants to see more of! This comic is not directly tied to the main storyline of my comic and it's a standalone cute little comic - I would appreciate it if you checked out my webcomic too tho! This is the second short comic in a series of\u00a0spin off minicomics I'm planning to make alongside my main webcomic - just mini stories with the characters! Have you ever bought that one thing that you thought you're gonna be great at and you're going to discover your hidden talent? Picking up new hobbies always sounds fun - in theory. After ending up with an unexpected espresso machine, putting it to good use might just result in an unexpected visit to a professional coffee store, lots of Youtube tutorials and failed latte art attempts. And lots of coffee! MAKE 100 is a great occasion to make exclusive limtied edition bundles...\u00a0 The comic is A5, full colour, staplebound, 11 pages long + extra exclusive behind the scenes content! More previews will be revelaved throughout the campaign! This bundle is exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign and is limited to 100. This is the only chance to get all the extra goodies compeltely for free! If these bundles sell out, a new book only reward will be added if you missed out on the limited bundles but would still like to preorder the comic. There is also a Digital reward if you'd like to support the project! Since the campaign has reached its goal in less than 1 hour and the bundles have sold out in 24 hours, I'm happy to announce the 2 stretchgoals! If one stretchgoal is reached, everyone gets the reward - even if you missed out on the bundles. (exc for digital tier) First stretchgoal features this very threatening sticker. Second and last stretchgoal features a 1.5 inch hard enamel pin!",

A long time ago, in a far, far away galaxy... being a teenager in the 80s, without the internet, with the only tv, cable telephones, and music on vinyl in which motorbikes started with the Force... of the right leg, discovering the unknown Planet Sex was really hard! Our first story is the story of a generation that has to learn sex by crashing into it with no airbags! Not to forget the heroes of that enterprise! The other ones are about the travel of life, driving Go-Karts, saving dogs... make a family! ...above all living a life that seems to be the life of all of us!\u00a0 Please notice that contains nudity and sexual content, so it's an ADULTS ONLY project.",
  "Hello, friends! Thanks for dropping by! My name is Anthony Holden, and my favorite things are my family and drawing cartoons. Let's be friends! (Maybe we already ARE.) If we're not, you can find my work on social media, super easy peasy: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Patreon. It's been a few years since my last campaign, and I've got a bunch of new comics and drawings that I want to share in the form of TWO NEW BOOKS! That's where you come in. I'd love to have your support to help with the cost of printing these books so I can share them with the world. \u00a0Precious Rascals is a slice-of-life comic strip that documents the happenings of our household. I started making the strips as a way to record family memories, so in a way it's like a family album that I'm sharing with you! It's been fun to look back and watch the style of the strips evolve over time as our kids grow up. Come by and hang out with our family!\u00a0 \u00a0A few sample strips: \u00a0The Doodle Quest series is a drawings collection, including sketchbook work, rough pieces, ink drawings, and other artwork. I work in animation for my day job, but drawing is also my hobby so I doodle a lot in my after hours. Doodle Quest 3 collects work from the last 3-4 years that I've been making off the clock when it's safe to indulge in fan art and dreaming about comics projects. I hope looking at some of my drawings will get you excited to have your own sketchbook adventures! \u00a0As a special Kickstarter exclusive, I want to offer extra goodies to backers. \u00a0\u00a0Each bookplate will be hand signed by me before being lovingly packed by child labor in my own house. (Don't worry, they get paid in dessert.) These fashionable bookmarks will help you keep your place in that Haruki Murakami novel you've been reading. Or if you prefer the philosophical works of Kierkegaard, they work in those books too. Also works in comics. But let's be honest. You finish reading your comics in one go. \u00a0Weatherproof vinyl stickers to liven up your favorite boring surfaces! Do you have a dull or otherwise functional-yet-bland surface that you love, but needs a little pep? Get these stickers! Maximum stick, maximum fun. \u00a0These limited edition 6\u201d x 8\u201d prints will look so good on your wall. Your friends will see them, and want them for their own walls. Maybe you could share some, or maybe not. Depends on how good of friends you are. \u00a0What are the benefits of helping this campaign, you wonder. Well, friend! There are loads. Let me share some with you. \u00a0Digital rewards are for those who live the truly modern life. If you like to read your books on the go while multi-tasking on your phone, then these rewards are for you! Why get just one book when you could collect all five?! \u00a0Physical rewards are for those of us who just love having something to hold in our hands. Something that doesn't need to be plugged in or charged in order to read. As a bonus, each purchase of a physical book comes with a PDF copy that you can put on your device\u2014so you can have the best of both worlds! \u00a0I'm aware that international shipping rates are really expensive, and that's crummy. I wish there were something I could do about it. If you live outside of the USA, you can absolutely still get books sent to you if you don't mind paying the shipping costs (roughly $29 USD for a single book or $43 USD for two books). For international backers that would love to get PDF downloads but still want to get a little something in the mail as well, I'm offering a pack of all the extra goodies: stickers, bookmarks, and prints. And because they can all fit in one flat envelope, they're less expensive to ship. Thanks so much for your support of this project! Because of people like you, I'm able to continue making stuff that I really believe in. I am truly appreciative of anything you can do to lend support. Thank you!!",

  "Glo uses interactive technology to transform the sounds of your world into a melodic ambient soundtrack. Relaxing, meditative and fun, it matches your mood with the push of a button.\u00a0 There are four basic soundscapes or \"channels\". Each one has a different rhythm and background texture, inspired by one of the elements: Earth, Air, Water and Fire. You can enjoy forests with birds, howling winds, waves of the sea and fantastic space frequencies.\u00a0 You create your own musical theatre, designed to invoke positive emotions. Your polyphonic whale composes these soundscapes by integrating surrounding sound \u2013 your singing, humming, tapping on a surface, leaves rustling in the trees or under your feet, a barking dog or laughing child. There is no doubt that sounds of nature have positive effects on our minds. That's why we\u2019ve chosen only natural sounds as a base for your ambient soundscapes. Waves lapping on the sea shore, birds chirping, wind playing in the trees. All this evokes feelings with psychological benefits, from nostalgia to optimism, social connectedness and self-esteem.\u00a0 These uplifting and calming sounds play a big role in regulating our emotions and attitude towards our own self.\u00a0 We believe that Glo can help you to find your voice and be confident in it. Singing or humming makes us happy, relieves anxiety... Music has great healing powers.\u00a0 The way Glo reacts to your voice is very interesting; you can imagine it as oscillating strings that resonate with your singing. When you hit the correct note, Glo responds by amplifying it further into its characteristic deep, bright tones, giving you instant feedback.\n Motion Algorithm\u00a0 The Whale is aware of its orientation in 3D space. To make your track even more interesting, variations are introduced depending on roll and pitch. For example, when you are in the \u201cWater\u201d channel and you dive the Whale\u2019s head down, the sound of sea waves increases. When it emerges back from the deep, the waves will slowly fade away, giving more space for the environmental ambience. When the Whale rolls around, effects are applied to the sound making it even more mesmerizing. \nThe Prototype - Currently implemented functionality\u00a0 The videos below are a raw and unedited recording from the whale, no added effects or post processing (only cut to make the demo shorter).\u00a0The external sound is not mixed in apart from a few seconds here and there to demonstrate what comes in from the environment.\u00a0 \u00a0All glitches and hisses included :)\u00a0In the final version the plastic buttons will be replaced with silicone (currently they are very crackly).\n\nThis is exactly how we recorded sounds for the Kickstarter video (you can find the music without voiceover here). There are other demos on our Youtube Channel.\u00a0 The Whale does not have a built-in speaker although it might look like it does, thanks to the \"gills\" (or grills? :) these are there so the sound can reach microphones.\u00a0 Listening to these demos on headphones will give you a precise idea of what would you hear from the whale itself. It is very easy to grasp the controls and understand how different movements translate to sound effects and variations. You don\u2019t need to be a musician to play it; you will be in a full control of the soundscape in no time. However, the mighty whale may have a surprise for you here and there.\u00a0 There is no screen to guide you through channels and options. We designed it this way to minimize distractions. Simply press \u2018ON\u2019 button and channel 1 will start. To switch between channels press ON button repeatedly. Be creative and explore sound possibilities. If you want to give your brain a special treat, enable the binaural beats mode by holding the \u2018ON\u2019 button for 4 seconds.\n\u00a0 We recommend you use this option sitting or lying down with your eyes closed. Do not overdo it if you are just starting, it is quite a workout for your brain and you need to give it time to adapt. Just 10 minutes is enough in the beginning. To switch back to the normal mode, just press the \u2018ON\u2019 button once again.\n The case is made from a combination of maple and american chestnut-tree wood with eco-friendly beeswax finish. Each durable case is beautifully handmade and unique with a responsive silicon keypad.\u00a0 Pocket Size: The device fits into your pocket comfortably, however you will be tempted to fish it out very often! :) It runs on two AA batteries.\u00a0 This is optional and experimental feature. You do not have use it and it is not something that can get activated accidentally. At the moment it is not integrated into the main firmware, only exists in a separate code branch.\u00a0 \u00a0It works by alternating one of the polyphonic voices by a frequency difference. We want to work with people who are interested in this subject to gather feedback and fine tune the functionality. The goal is to make it work well, while soundscapes keep their pleasant sound. What are binaural beats?  For example, when you are studying, your encephalogram may show patterns with frequency around 20 Hz which we call Beta waves (12.5 Hz to 30 Hz). When you are relaxing with your eyes closed, your EEG will show frequencies around 10 Hz, Alpha waves (7.5 Hz to 12.5 Hz). In 1839 German professor Heinrich Wilhelm Dove discovered that we can actually stimulate the brain to activate these frequencies by creating external sounds with certain properties - binaural beats.\u00a0 So imagine you would like to use your lunch break to meditate, but it\u2019s difficult to quiet down your mind during a busy day. With binaural beats, you can \u201cslow down\u201d your brain to Theta frequencies and enjoy an effective meditation in a short time. How this works is that each of your ears receives sound of different frequencies through headphones and your brain recognises the difference. If one ear is receiving 87 Hz and another 82 Hz, your brain focuses on the 5 Hz gap and actually generates the illusion of that frequency, which you can hear.\u00a0 \u00a0There are four basic types of brain waves that can be triggered by a binaural beats program. They are defined by a frequency at which neural signals oscillate:\n\n\u00a0 We are Anna and Mario, designer/developer team based in Ireland.\u00a0Our background is in design, programming and arts & crafts.\u00a0 In 2016 we ran our first Kickstarter - Gecho Loopsynth, a polyphonic pocket synthesizer, which was successfully funded and fulfilled to everyone's satisfaction. \n\nThis is our second venture where we are evolving our proven concept of digital synthesizer into a more portable format.\n\n In the heart of the whale ticks a powerful dual\u2011core signal processor, as found in many digital synthesizers (but hardly ever in this form factor, the board is only 53x25mm). We also included a dedicated high quality, low noise audio chip to handle inputs and outputs to ensure nothing is lost when Glo sings.\u00a0 If you are not afraid of the soldering iron, there are more possibilities for you. Make your own music instrument, designed in any way you want or \"circuit bend\" an existing toy. This tier is offering the same board as used in the wooden whale tier, with all SMD elements in place but allows for modifications. The additional SMD elements are for alternative powering scheme - rechargeable cell, also for Rx/Tx indication of USB-serial line (uploading and downloading firmware).\u00a0 You do not have to solder everything on to make it work; if you want to put the board into an enclosure of your choice and keep it powered with two AAA batteries as usual, you only need to solder 2 wires\u00a0- positive and negative wire to the battery holder. More information about DIY options (diagrams, schematics and wiring examples)\u00a0can be found here.",
  "TUNNELS is a new type of Eurorack utility module that allows you to duplicate and route signals across your modular synthesizer.  We call it the \u201cInfinite Multiple,\u201d but you could also describe it as an \u201cInter-Panel Buffered Multiple,\u201d or perhaps a \u201cMult Bus.\u201d \u00a0 TUNNELS is comprised of two distinct modules : TUNNEL IN and TUNNEL OUT.  The TUNNEL IN module by itself is a buffered multiple, duplicating an input signal to create multiple outputs.  The TUNNEL OUT module expands the TUNNEL IN module to add additional outputs at another location in your synthesizer.  TUNNEL OUT modules can be chained together infinitely to create massive buffered multiple banks or send common signals like clocks and 1v/oct signals to strategic locations in your synth. The TUNNEL IN module has three inputs, each routed to a pair of outputs.  When disconnected, the inputs are normalled to the previous input, allowing for a variety of configurations.  With the first input connected it is a 1 in : 6 out multiple.  Using the first two inputs makes a 1 in : 2 out multiple and a 1 in : 4 out multiple.  With all three inputs connected, it acts as three 1 in : 2 out multiples. The TUNNEL OUT module receives the three channels from TUNNEL IN via a TUNNEL LINK cable, adding three additional buffered outputs per channel. \u00a0With one input connected, for example, you would now have a 1 in : 15 out multiple. \u00a0Add additional TUNNEL OUT modules to expand your TUNNELS system however you see fit. Because TUNNELS is a buffered (non-passive or powered) multiple, critical signals like 1 volt per octave control voltages are able to maintain their integrity regardless of the size of the TUNNELS system.    TUNNELS is engineered with live-patching in mind.  Normalled connections between inputs are also buffered, preventing the momentary short that can happen with other multiples. This means no dropped clocks or audible glitches in modulation or pitch while working on your patch. Both TUNNEL IN and TUNNEL OUT modules are 4 HP and have a depth of 1.5\" (38mm)\u00a0from the backside of the front panel to the top of the Link cable when plugged in. Max Current Draw :TUNNEL IN\u00a0+12v 33mA\u00a0-12v 20mA+ 5v 0 mA TUNNEL OUT+12v 36mA\u00a0-12v 26mA+ 5v 0 mA The TUNNEL LINK cable will initially be available in 5 foot lengths, which should easily accommodate (and then some) most systems. \u00a0 Olympia Modular is the first collaboration between Olympia Noise Co. developer Ben Kamen and Buchla Development Engineer Charles Seeholzer. \u00a0Kickstarter is a great way for us to navigate the production process, gauge interest and raise funds to make it a reality. \u00a0While we've already invested quite a bit of time and money into the process, this Kickstarter will allow us to minimize our financial risk going forward with this boutique product.

  "In Japan there is a concept of \"michi\" (\u9053) often meaning road or path, where the kanji character is used for tea ceremony (\u8336\u9053), flower arrangement (\u83ef\u9053), judo (\u67d4\u9053), and kendo (\u5263\u9053). It is so much more than just learning techniques or skills, it is about how to move your body, how to handle the tools, starting and finishing, how to show respect to the other person, etc. Cherishing the sincerity of the heart. Basically, it is a place of learning to live as a person. \u00a0I noticed that the calligraphy box set that many of the adult students would use were the exact same ones made for children that you buy in elementary school. This was something disappointing to see. I searched all over but just could not find a nice box set anywhere. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t one, let\u2019s make one!\u201d So when I made up plans for a calligraphy box set that would be suitable for adults, I got a big response and support from people, some even saying they wanted to start up calligraphy again using this box set. Then I started hearing people from other countries also saying how they thought calligraphy looked cool and that they wanted to try too, but didn\u2019t know what sort of supplies they needed. So I started to think how about I\u2019d like to introduce this calligraphy box set to foreigners too and have them experience the comfort and pleasantness of calligraphy. Today we are surrounded by a lot of information and are busy every day. As technology advances and everything becomes more convenient, the brain actually feels more exhausted even if things are physically easier to do. This might be why many people are looking for healing and comfort in yoga, meditation, and Zen teachings. In Japan, calligraphy is also considered something to create calmness. Calligraphy is so much more than just writing practice. \u00a0For example, while arranging the brushes, inkstones, sumi ink sticks, calligraphy paper, etc., one by one, you gradually shift away from all the thoughts in your head, and the rhythm of rubbing the ink stick calms your breathing. Then once you start writing your breathing adjusts again, and the comfortable tension and black-and-white graciously unravels your mind as the sound of the brush running along the paper and the scent of ink takes you into even further relaxation and enjoyment. When you have finished writing you put the tools back in their place, and once there is nothing on the table, you will find a new and refreshed you, your work, and your calligraphy kit quietly dazed. Japanese calligraphy is when you write letters or characters with a brush, which uses a special ink stick (\u201csumi\u201d) that you can adjust its density/boldness with water. The brush itself is very expressive. Depending on how it is used it exhibits a variety of expressions. For example, \u201ckasure\u201d, a more harsh scratch looking drybrush streak is one of the most dynamic, greatest features in Japanese calligraphy. By having these strokes, it can express many different feelings and emotions such as a sense of movement and force, happiness or loneliness, even joy or anger.\u00a0 Another feature is \u201cnijimi\u201d, a completely different technique that creates the ink to naturally bleed. Depending on the property of the paper and the thickness of the ink, you will get a completely different expression and look. You can express warmth and coldness, softness and hardness, and some people even sense the passing of time or seasons, weather, and brightness. Just like any other piece of art, each person is able to both express themselves and perceive it differently. How do you interpret it? What sort of impression does it leave? \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with that, let's get to writing characters! This is the kanji (Chinese character) for \"cloud\" (\u201ckumo\u201d in Japanese). It is necessary to practice like this, but even though you only black ink, you will be surprised at all the various expressions you can give off with the same character. Already, it is art. Next, let's write someone\u2019s name. For example, Noah and Emma. There are three types of characters in Japanese; kanji (Chinese characters), hiragana, and katakana. Among those three, there are many characters that have the same pronunciation but use different kanji to create a word. So for the name Noah for example, you can use some kanji characters you like to create the name like \u4e43\u4e9c or \u91ce\u963f. It is also fun making business cards with the name you wrote yourself. \u3010 \u7d30\u7b46\u30fb\u592a\u7b46 \u3011 - Fine Brush / Thick Brush - The brush is one of the leading tools in calligraphy. There are many types of brushes, such as soft, stiff, long, short, etc., which you use depending on the expression matter and personal taste. Using each of them to learn about their characteristics and features, finding a brush that suits you best is one of the joys in Japanese calligraphy. For this project, the brushes I chose for the set are standard brushes that are easy for anyone to handle and allows one to frankly express themselves. It includes a thick brush that allows you to write large characters/letters and thick lines, and a small brush that you can use when you want to create smaller characters/letters for things like letters to someone. \u3010 \u786f \u3011 - Inkstone, \u201cSuzuri\u201d - An inkstone is a tool in calligraphy that creates ink by adding water to a solidified ink block while rubbing against it. Since the inkstone produces a good amount of ink, it is almost like it is bottled liquid ink in itself. Inkstones are made by carving out natural stones one by one. In recent years, there are many cases where light plastic inkstones are used because they do not break even if dropped, but since you cannot grind against the solid ink, we decided to use a naturally made inkstone for this project. \u3010 \u58a8 \u3011 - Ink stick, \u201cSumi\u201d - There are two types of ink, solid and liquid. The solid ink is a collection of soot that has hardened and takes a good amount of time and effort to be made which is why it is a bit more expensive than its liquid form. Even when using it, you need to grind it against an inkstone until you get the right concentration while adding water. It takes a bit of time to prepare before you actually start writing. In that respect, the liquified ink is already a liquid, so it can be used immediately and is more convenient when you need a large amount of ink. However, there is a slight difference in expression between the ink produced from grinding solid ink and liquid ink which is due to factors like the grain/particle sizes. It is said that the solid ink creates a deeper and more interesting finish. *This set does not contain ink. \u3010 \u6c34\u6ef4 \u3011 - Calligraphy Water-Dropper, \u201cSuiteki\u201d - The \u201csuiteki\u201d, a water-dropper is a water dish used when grinding/rubbing the ink stick ink or to adjust the density of ink in Japanese calligraphy. To have good water-droppers their appearance and shape are very important, but it is essential that you are able to control the amount of water poured. The dropper included in the box set for this project is made by a potter, so not only will fit comfortably in your hand it has a proper pour allowing you to control the water drop by drop. It also looks like a cute little milk pitcher that you would want to collect. \u3010 \u534a\u7d19 \u3011 - Japanese Calligraphy Paper, \u201cHanshi\u201d - This is also an indispensable item for calligraphy, it is called \u201chanshin\u201d and it is the paper used when writing calligraphy. A size of 243mm x 333mm (9.5\" x 13\") is typical, and there are many types such as ones made in Japan, made in China, hand-made and machine-made, easy to bleed (like for the nijimi technique), etc. We have decided to include Japanese-made calligraphy paper for this project which is very easy to write on. While Western-made paper is also very easy to use, it does not absorb moisture as well which makes it hard to dry completely and handle once you have finished writing. In addition, smooth paper does not easily give off the brush's characteristic \"kasure\u201d, the drybrush streak look. It will allow you to write clear and sharp characters, but it will lack the known appeal. \u3010\u4e0b\u6577\u304d \u3011 - Underlay Pad, \u201cShitajiki\u201d - The brush used for Japanese calligraphy contains a fair amount of ink, and since the \u201chanshin\u201d paper is very thin, the ink will bleed through onto the table or floor and the paper will tear if you do not lay anything underneath it. So you use this \u201cshitajiki\u201d pad to prevent that from happening. The underlay pad that is included in the set is made of felt. A pad made from felt has the trait of having a sturdy weave, has a hardness to it, and is less likely to wrinkle which is very important to be able to produce the look you want when writing. Although it is a material that does not easily wrinkle, you can easily put it away by rolling it up rather than folding it. \u3010 \u6587\u93ae \u3011 - Paperweight, \u201cBunchin\u201d - The \u201cbunchin\u201d is used to prevent the paper from moving while writing, essentially a paperweight. They come in many shapes and kinds, like metal ones made from iron or brass, glass, resin, etc. The paperweight we have prepared this time is made using Japan\u2019s representative tree, the cherry tree. Since it contains lead, it has some weight to it despite how it looks playing the role of a proper paperweight. This simple paperweight has a gentle scent of wood which heals the soul. \u3010\u7b46\u7f6e\u304d\u3011 - Brush Rest, \u201cFude-Oki\u201d - You use the brush rest as a holder for the brush before writing or when you want to set down your brush while writing. It is made of wood making it light, manageable, and a lovely appearance. A great point to this rest is that it allows you to set two brushes on it. This is also made of cherry tree wood, adding to the beautiful relaxed feeling. \u3010 \u7b46\u5dfb \u3011 - Roll-up Brush Holder, \u201cFude-Maki\u201d - A roll-up brush holder is originally used to carry a used brush and is made by connecting strips of bamboo with a thread. Also to protect the brush from getting damaged and keeping the tips straight, it is made according to the brush\u2019s thickness and shape. It is designed to wrap up. The holder is designed to be rolled up, so after using the brush, wash it well and dry it thoroughly before wrapping it up in the holder. For the set, you get a beautiful paulownia box to keep all your calligraphy supplies in. We have prepared four colors and a story for each of the boxes. Black (Rain That Falls at Night) The rain that falls quietly in the middle of the night seems to wash away various idle thoughts and feelings, almost resetting you into a new self. There is a similar feeling in the flow of Japanese calligraphy, from setting up to cleaning up. We took that feeling and put it into a jet black box that looks like it was wet in the rain. We hope you enjoy it as a type of scenery in your room as well. White (Fresh Snow in the Early Morning) On an early winter morning, when you see pure white, untouched snow that has piled up over the night, you sense new freshness as if something is about to begin. Even in calligraphy, when rubbing the ink stick and having a piece of white calligraphy paper in front of me, I feel that same freshness and clarity every time. With the hope that we can briefly start fresh, leaving the good and bad and concentrating on the now, we made a white calligraphy supplies case with a special coating that resembles powdered snow. Earth (Forget-Me-Not Flower) I think there are many things that are often too close to us to be seen. The earth we live on is one of them. I have heard that while in space, astronauts are often deeply moved by the beauty of the earth, but it is not like we as regular people can go to space so easily. However, I think that by just imagining something, you are still able to see it clearly. Calligraphy requires the imagination to shape the worldview of words. It is like the act of seeing something you actually cannot. So with that in mind, we created a blue case that reflects the image of the earth. The countless number of white dots on the blue box will stir your imagination each time you look at it. Moon (Bay Laurel) The moon continues to always orbit the earth showing everyone its various expressions. In reality though, the size and shape of the moon itself actually does not change, its appearance changes depending on the position of the sun and the earth, with the sun lighting up different regions of the moon creating its different phases. In short, depending on how you perceive something your feelings will change. In calligraphy too, while writing the same characters with the exact same movement, there is an aspect where notice that you feel differently than you did the day before, from the week before, and are able to realize yourself in the now. In order to adjust and improve oneself, we think it is important to know who you currently are as a person. With that in mind, we made a moonlight calligraphy set box. Just looking at it gushes inspiration. There are two levels of the basic set, a shallow box and a deeper box. The brush rest, water-dropper, and paperweight go inside the smaller, shallower box along with the removable insert board. You get a refreshing swift scent of natural wood when you open it up every time. Just looking at it is will make you feel better. Supplies that are made of natural materials will casually become a part of your calligraphy life. \u25c6 Box size: W 323mm x D 116mm x H 119mm (12.7\u201d x 4.6\u201d x 4.68\u201d) \u25c6 Materials: Box - paulownia, paperweight and brush rest - cherry blossom wood, removable insert board - camphor tree wood, water-dropper - porcelain \u25c6 Coating: Special Polyurethane wood finish *Since natural materials are used, including the insert board, please be aware that the grain is different in each item. The box will perfectly fit in this azuma cloth bag. Japan has given its heart and mind to the moon since ancient times. This is why there are a number of names and words in relation to it. Another word for the full moon is \u201cmochi\u201d (\u671b), and the new moon is also called \"tsuitachi\" (\u6714). \u201cMochi\u201d means \u201cto be full\u201d, and \u201ctsuitachi\u201d means \u201cbeginning\u201d, both representing a cycle. It is with that we made a black and white azuma cloth bag to wrap up the important calligraphy box. Made of durable canvas, it has a chic appearance with a small crimson touch. \u25c6 Size when unfolded: W 500mm x H 500mm (19.6\u201d x 19.6\u201d) \u25c6 Material: No. 11 canvas *A string is attached to the center to keep the bag closed. We\u2019ve prepared a video example of using the calligraphy set! This is just a single part of it. We will provide backers who get the box set with a site address for the example. So we hope that you all are excited for that! Japanese calligraphy has continued to become very popular with those all over the world. However, figuring out how to write yourself is a difficult hurdle for many of those who do buy the supplies. But if you have this box set and example, you should be able to start today! So we hope that you are able to calm your heart and mind, and relax while confronting yourself. - Preparation - 1. Take out the underlay pad and roll-up brush holder from the bottom box and lay out the underlay. 2. Take out the inkstone, paperweight, brush rest, and the ink stick from the top box and set them next to the underlay. 3. Place the brush on the brush rest. 4. Add some water to the water-dropper. 5. Pour water little by little from the dropper on the inkstone and grind/rub the ink stick. 6. Place a piece of calligraphy paper on the underlay pad, then the paperweight on the top corners to prevent the paper from moving. 7. Start writing making sure there is plenty of ink on the brush. 8. Lay the finished paper on something like a newspaper and let it dry. - Clean up - 1. Wipe off the remaining ink on the inkstone on a piece of paper (like a piece of calligraphy paper that you made a mistake on), wash it with water, then let it dry. 2. Wash the ink covered brush in a glass of water until clear. 3. Put the inkstone, paperweight, brush rest, and ink stick in their usual place in the top box. 4. Roll the brush up in the brush holder (please make sure the brush is completely dry). 5. Wrap up the underlay pad. 6. Put the roll-up brush holder and underlay pad in the box that goes on the bottom. We aim to create products that show the creators\u2019 faces. These supplies are made by craftsmen and writers in Fukui and Toyama prefectures. The woodcarver Kazunori Ichihashi creates the paperweight, brush rest, and insert board. Starting off with transoms and Buddhist statues, from traditional to modern, Ichihashi has experience doing an extensive variety of wood carving works, creating something that is sincere, warm, and personal. The porcelain water-dropper is made by Manabu Tanaka, an active potter in the port city Mikuni in Fukui prefecture. Tanaka is gaining popularity for his unique character and worldview that came from being in the Department of Architecture. Please get the full sense of how well this water-dropper allows you to control its water flow as you work. The two-tiered box is made by Keizou Urata from Urata Co., Ltd., who mainly manufactures paulownia boxes in Takaoka City, Toyama prefecture. For requests for detailed measurements and specification changes, he is a reliable craftsman that responds promptly and throughly. It is Urata that made moving forward in making of the calligraphy box for this project possible. The one responsible for the azuma cloth bag that holds the box is Rieko Kataoka of KATA+. She makes things using canvas and is active in various craft exhibitions and events, solo exhibitions, etc. The calligraphy box is painted by MARUHIRO SPRAY\u2019s Yasuhiro Hirose. He works with urethane resin coating in Kawada, Fukui Prefecture, the producing are of Echizen lacquerware, and continues to explore unique expressions that are different from traditional/regular \u201curushi\u201d lacquer. Without MARUHIRO, the calligraphy box\u2019s image and beautiful look would not be what it is. Then, for brushes, roll-up brush holder, inkstones, ink stick, ink, and underlay pad, you have the cooperation from a book store in Nara prefecture, Sasakawa Bunrindo. Sasakawa Bunrindo is a long-established bookstore on Sanjo-dori in Nara, and has been making traditional Nara brushes for over 160 years as well as having a large selection of calligraphy supplies. 1.

If you put the brush away while it is still wet you risk the chance of it getting moldy and damaged. So please make sure it is completely dried. - Inkstone - Thoroughly wash the used inkstone with water. If you put the inkstone away leaving the remaining ink on it, that ink will harden and the next time you use it, the solidified ink will come off and mix with the new ink resembling residue. - Sumi Ink Stick - Just a caution, it is extremely difficult to remove ink from clothing. While writing calligraphy, be careful not to wear or have anything that you don\u2019t want stained or ruined nearby. Once it dries it will not come out. - Underlay Pad - Please do not wash the underlay pad with water. If you wash it with water or fold it to store, it will create a crease that will make it difficult to write nicely and evenly. When the pad is not in use, roll it up to store. - Azuma Cloth Bag - When new, the fabric is a little stiff so it may be a bit difficult to tie. But it does get softer and easier to handle the more you use it. You can wash it with water, but it will lose its tension and shrink a bit. You can restore the tension of the fabric bag by ironing. Culture is backed by history and is seen as having a very important element in human activity. We are always thinking about how to make the world more enjoyable and how to make use of its wonderful essence in the present age. We started this project with the hopes and desire for people all around the world to know, feel, and utilize the culture of Japanese calligraphy. We are sure there are many people that are under the impression that calligraphy is difficult and time-consuming. And yes, in today's busy world it might be a bit of a hassle. However we feel that it is within that inconvenience that there are a ton of important things. And then there is writing characters/letters by hand. We think that it is about knowing who you are and touching the story the characters hold. But these are things you feel the first time you try. In order to make it even more possible to touch such a wonderful world, we decided to create equally wonderful calligraphy tools and supplies! There must be something important here since we are in the day and age where immediate results and answers are required. So how about continuing to live in the now and start your new calligraphy journey with someone close to you!",

  "Hello, friends! My name is Anna, I'm from Ukraine, Kharkiv. I was born in a small town with a population of 10 thousand people in the Kharkiv region. I lived in Kharkiv for 12 years, where I studied, worked, got married, made wonderful new friends, and developed my business. Not only that, but I woke up from the explosions at 5 am on 24.02.2022, and it was hard to believe that the war has started. It took me two days to realize it! In the early days of the war, I tried to volunteer online from my phone, sitting in the basement of the house! I helped people find lodging and food and looked for transportation to meet their needs. When I was in a small village in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, the first thing I thought to myself was: \u201cHOW CAN I HELP PEOPLE IN WAR AND BE HELPFUL TO PEOPLE AROUND?\u201d I don't want to just take the money and give it away, I want to give something useful in return! SO I CAME UP WITH AN IDEA. I had the idea of creating a planner with quick and easy planning technology, which I have been using personally for 4 years. I can say that 97% of the time my goals and plans come true, not only because of my efforts, but also because of effective planning! Furthermore, I came up with the planner in a day, the cover design was created in 5 minutes, and it took me 4 weeks to develop it. My husband, a translator and graphic designer, is helping me to publish the planner. We have found one of the few printing houses now working in Ukraine, and we are collecting the funds to print it ourselves. The edition will be in 3 languages: -Ukrainian -English -Russian (for those who are used to speaking and writing in the Russian language, it is the whole of eastern and central Ukraine). I tried to promote the sales of the planner, which has not yet been published on my account and many people are already willing to buy it, even with my signature as an author! This confirms that it is NEEDED and people see its value. All that's left is to get it into printing. It is expensive to print on your own. We designed it in color, and I included instructions for filling out the week and day with examples of \u201chow I keep it\u201d to make it easier and more interesting for the user to keep it. To whom I have already shown it, they said: great, I already want to hold it in my hands! My goal is to raise \u20ac20,000 for the first edition. This amount includes a print run of 500 copies of the notebook: 200 in Ukrainian 50 in Russian 250 in English Marketing and advertising (targeting and advertising from bloggers) are included in the funding. Delivery is possible worldwide with service the Mail of Ukraine, which is now resumed work in Ukraine and can do international shipments. I have already invested personal money in the design, layout, and translation. But the printing and distribution are unaffordable for me at the moment, so please help me! Each person's \u20ac40 contribution to the campaign will help make this project a reality, and consider it as you've already bought a signed hardcover planner. I would like to add that this is not just a planner, but it is the symbol of freedom and victory! The important thing is that 50% of the sale of the planner will go to the psychological recovery of the victims (women, men, and children) of the hostilities. The money from the sales of the planner will pay for consultations of the best psychologists, who have already had the experience in rehabilitation of victims of military actions. I want to show concern not only about the economic growth of the country, but also about the psychological health of the population. I think it is very essential, and I hope you will support me. As in any crowdfunding campaign, donations are the key. But the sharing and spreading of this are also influential. If you share on social media and tell your friends, it will help bring the project to life. Thank you very much for supporting the project and for your open heart! Anna G. Description: ForU Planner.

  "I plan to take still and moving photos of police partaking in actions that put the public in danger. The majority of these actions are the illegal and dangerous parking of vehicles. NYPD continually blocks fire hydrants, crosswalks, and curb cuts while not performing official police duties or responding to calls. This practice endangers all pedestrians and drivers especially the elderly and infirm who have trouble safely navigating the streets while the police are parked in this illegal and dangerous manner. Almost all of the time when parked like this, the police are shopping while on duty, picking up lunch, or having casual conversations with friends on the street. All of the time there are plenty of safe spaces to park close by. I have seen empty police cars blocking fire hydrants for hours at a time with no police in sight. Shiny badges to not grant special rights. All people whether law enforcement are required to follow the \u00a0 traffic and parking laws except in an emergency. These officers are abusing their badges to park so that they can more easily shop or pickup lunch. You or I would get a summons in a second if we did any of these things. Equal rights for all means that the law should be applied to police the same way it is applied to citizens.\u00a0",
  "I am a Journalism and Mass Communications major from the University of Iowa and have worked as a journalist and a photographer for the university. In the last several years while traveling and studying Spanish in Colombia I have made many amazing friends and have become more aware of some of the great struggles of the country.\u00a0 One such struggle is the battle for the Putumayo. A department of southern Colombia which has been overwhelmed with violence and instability for over 60 years.\u00a0 http://www.culturalsurvival.org/ourpublications/csq/article/the-battle-putumayo The main focus of this particular exploration will be the daily lives of children in the region. Educational opportunities in this area are scarce and the risk of falling prey to militant groups of drug traffickers and bandits is great. In this way the cycle of poverty, violence, and instability has been perpetuated for generations.\u00a0 https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/countries/colombia/ I will be accompanied by a professor from a university in Bogota with experience and contacts in the region. We will observe and photograph the lives of students in one specific region of Putumayo. We will interview teachers, officials, and other citizens in the region, in hopes that this project will bring about more general awareness and support for the children of Putumayo. \u00a0 Work will be published through a blog, and I will seek to have it published elsewhere upon completion. I thank you all for your support and generosity. The budget for this project will consist mostly of travel expenses. Airfare from Florida to Bogota, Colombia for one, from Bogota to Southern Colombia for two, and the journey by bus into Putumayo for two. Other expenses will include a camera lens, photo prints, and small photo books.\u00a0",
  "I will be photographing subjects, buildings, gestures, and moments\u00a0 that capture the Christmas spirit as the beginning project for a unique travel blog. The finding Christmas Magic project will be used to launch a paid website and continue the travel blog portion over the next year. We plan to create a blog where you will be able to find and submit stories, ideas, crafts and videos that capture the essence of Christmas. This will also serve as a travel blog where you will vote on what destination to send us to! Of course this will be dependent on just how much money we raise but I can tell you Iceland is a photographers dream in the winter and I have never been. That being said, we live in the beautiful state of Oregon which also has some\u00a0 incredible places that shine with Christmas Spirit this time of year. The small resort town of Sun River is a short drive from us and will serve as our first destination review. I would love the opportunity to capture the Christmas Spirit near and far. We live in another small town in Oregon where people still greet one another on the street and we all know our neighbors.  Just for fun we will Photoshop some of you into our travel pics! (but only if we have prior permission and a request to do so!).  We want this site to be interactive. It is our hope that we will create more than just another travel blog, but a place where lifelong friendships can be born and nurtured (for those of\u00a0 us who will always be kids at heart and for those who will never forget the true meaning of Christmas). Come join our family and celebrate the magic of Christmas.  Please check our website often as it is a work in progress in its beginning stages! I will also be attaching a rough budget so you can see how the money will be spent. Basically we will break it down into travel/transportation to photo shoot locations and destinations, any additional camera equipment that may be needed (we have most of what we need), craft supplies, cooking ingredients for the recipes we will be demonstrating and other supplies needed for demonstration videos, printing costs for prints, etc.\u00a0 I think it is important for those who are considering making pledges to have a clear idea of where that money is going and what an important part it will play in this project. If there are left over funds we would like to pay it forward with small acts of kindness as well as a trip to New York to capture New Years Eve in Time Square!\u00a0 Like the others, these photos will be shared on our website and discussed in our blog. We cannot do this without your support and appreciate everyone who backs\u00a0 us in any way that they can. Purchasing prints from our website is another great way to lend your support. These will be available for purchase beginning the first week of December. It has been our dream to go to New York City for New Years Eve. If our \nbudget is exceeded, after paying it forward, we will take you along by \nphotographing / video-graphing and blogging about this trip! We hope to \nsee you in Times Square on January 1, 2015! Lets make this the best Christmas ever and bring back that Christmas magic and then celebrate the New Year.\u00a0 If we find there is enough support we will offer our story to the local news and who knows where it will go from there! Lets make it viral! Perhaps together we can make spreading Christmas Magic a world wide project. So, lets get started in our search of Christmas Magic...",
  "I'm so thrilled that you've made it this far and have interest in learning more about this project.  Below I'll describe how this whole idea came to fruition, what it means to me, and what bringing this 5-6 song EP to life will entail!  I've enjoyed experimenting with songwriting for years now, but until last summer, it was never a \"serious\" pursuit for me. That changed June of 2016 when I attended Kristin Andreassen & Laura Cortese's magical \"Miles of Music Camp.\" The expansive songwriting classes and professional guidance and encouragement of the instructors there gave me the push I needed to gain confidence in the contemporary songwriting realm. A class called \"Band in a Box\" gave me the opportunity to hear an original song, usually played just me and my ol' guitar, complete with a backup band of bass, drums, keys, and horns. I couldn't ignore the possibility of groove that existed in these songs when arranged with a larger band, and after that June, I couldn't stop writing.  Here is that \"Band in a Box\" recording-- a good example of what this EP will sound like when my original songs are energized with a full band.\u00a0Joined by local drummer Jabin Baxter, Stray Birds bass player Charlie Muench, & a TBA horn section, I will bring my acoustic folk songs to life with a discernible R&B and jazz edge.  https://soundcloud.com/nina-de-vitry/baby-in-the-shade The songs on this EP are a collection I wrote while questioning the avail of following dreams, resenting transitions, and wrestling with the passage of time. With its themes of trusting your heart & believing life will take you where it should, my aspiration for the album is that it will communicate the boundless reaches of hope to people of any age.  Over the past few months, I have been working to collaborate with different musicians, schedule gigs, and put samples of my original material online. On Youtube you can find a few more original songs that may appear on the EP with groovier, full band arrangements...  There is a beautiful sense of liberty that accompanies being an independent artist, but with this comes the call for considerable community support. In short, I quite honestly could not be doing this project without all of you! As a person who can talk about, share, or donate to this project, YOU are acting as my record label. YOU are empowered to bring this project to life & win some cool rewards in the process! It will truly take a village to pull this thing together, but in choosing to spread the word or back this thing, YOU will cause a domino effect & become implemental in the creation of a new piece of art in our community.  Starting in May and continuing through the end of August, I will be busy in the Sugartank Recording Studio in downtown Lancaster, PA arranging, tracking & mixing the songs that will appear on the EP. Once these tracks are perfected, they will be sent off for mastering. The final step is getting the product onto CD discs & ordering digital downloads so that I can give it to all of you! Based on this timeline, the reward shipments will begin in November and the official release date will follow.  Every dollar donated to this campaign will go towards the creation of the EP and compensating those who contribute their time, talents, and resources to the project. Any funds raised beyond the goal will go towards refinement of the EP & promotion and marketing of the product.  Production: 2400  Studio musician costs: 700  Post-Production: 900 Reward Fulfillment Fees: 500  Kickstarter/Amazon fees: 500  Now that is A LOT of money. Where is it all going to go??? Here's a further cost breakdown to let you know exactly where your donations are headed! With that, I invite you to get involved in this project in any way you may be able.\u00a0  We have 30 days to reach our $5,000 goal, and with your support & involvement, I know we can make it happen. I so, so appreciate your time & consideration; feel free to reach out if you have any questions at all.  So many thanks, Nina de Vitry  P.S. Stay tuned for the addition of amazing NEW REWARDS along the way! If you can't find a reward tier that suits you & you think I may be able to offer something more suitable to your tastes, feel free to reach out and we can make something work :) ",

  "For the past twenty years, the IPRC has been a pillar of the Portland maker, DIY, art, design, writing, and publishing communities. Through our certificate program, zine-making, printmaking, letterpress workshops, outreach programming, zine library, special events, and other programs we have impacted the artistic and personal lives of thousands of Portlanders and visitors from all over the world.   As Portland continues to experience growing pains, the need for an inexpensive arts education resource center, a low-cost alternative to institutional arts instruction, and a publishing, design, and arts community, has never been greater. The IPRC is one of the most Portland things about Portland\u2014it's a vital part of the fabric of our city, serving a diverse community, and keeping the DIY spirit alive and thriving. Last year, we learned that to keep our home on Portland's recently gentrified SE Division St. would cost us three times what we'd initially agreed to when signing our lease. We elected to move and asked for support from our community to do so. The Kickstarter campaign A New Home for the IPRC was fully funded and the move was executed in June of this year. We were fortunate to find a new home for only twice what we'd been paying in an historic building on SE Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd and reopen for studio hours and classes in July.\u00a0 Our new space is bigger than our old space and we're working to expand both our in-studio and outreach programming. We're reopening our screen printing studio and adding a Risograph printing studio; we're restoring, rehabilitating, and revitalizing our 8,000+ item zine library; and we're continuing to provide the space, tools, and education that our members and students have come to rely on for the creation of their own published media.\u00a0 We have some lovely incentives for all pledge levels, including: When you contribute to the IPRC, your support helps to: \u00a0",

  "THE BOOK: Cooking for Conservation is part cookbook, part travelogue, part detailed account of the challenges of conservation in the African bush. Jamie Sparks's beautiful new book on her experiences and time in the canvas kitchen at Camp Nomade in Tchad's Zakouma National Park takes the reader on an evocative journey into the heart of Africa, its people, flavors and incredible wildlife.  THE GOAL: Defending what's left of the natural world is no easy task \u2013 protecting the wilderness takes courage, and international NGO African Parks has made conservation their mission.\u00a0This book shares that mission. $100,000 of the book\u2019s profit will go to African Parks, and 25% of all profits will go to African Parks thereafter. With your support, Tchad: Cooking for Conservation will be a beautiful cookbook/coffee table book filled with spectacular images of Zakouma National Park donated by professional guides and conservationists. Interwoven between scenes from the bush and the daily happenings at camp is a gastronomic safari. As you turn the pages, you taste your way through a week at Camp Nomade.  HOW IT ALL STARTED: Jamie\u00a0was tasked with setting up Camp Nomade with a food experience equal to its wildlife experience. Hours were spent searching through dusty market stalls, attempting to explain to chef Abdoulaye in broken French the nuance of flavors in fine dining, and introducing the eager group of Tchadian staff to waiting tables and hosting.\u00a0 THE SPARK: Evenings were spent around the table with the park managers, who told stories of the passions and personalities of African Parks, the organization that rescued Zakouma's animals from poachers and helped raise the park out of decline.Inspired by her surroundings and the stories she heard, Jamie knew almost immediately that she needed to write a book about this place - this connection between food and community, between conservation and sense of place. Ms. Sparks will be sharing her recipes, created in Camp Nomade's canvas-tented kitchen in the middle of Zakouma's dry, dusty planes. Cooling melon in vanilla syrup for when temperatures reach 45\u00b0 Celsius in the middle of the day, pizzas cooked straight on the coals, sweet sesame snaps found in the sticky hands of cheeky local children, and spiced falafel served to guests out in the bush. This book does a lot more than tell tales of safari: it's a book on the lighter side of Tchad, a place that is complex, enchanting, and quite unimaginable. ZAKOUMA: During her time at Camp Nomade in Zakouma, these are just a few of the things Jamie came to learn:\u00a0 AFRICAN PARKS: Zakouma's inspiring success story is not unique. African Parks has stories like this from their other parks too. Currently African Parks manages 15 parks in nine countries, making up the largest and most ecologically diverse portfolio of parks in Africa under the protection of any single NGO. The money raised by Cooking for Conservation will help African Parks continue this amazing work in Zakouma and in every park under their care across the continent. People are quick to give money to support majestic elephants and big cats, but what about the snakes, beetles, rodents and bats? What about funding grassland, beehives or fisheries? African Parks protects ecosystems, rather than particular species. And the money raised through Cooking for Conservation will be used with their wisdom where it is needed most. ONGOING UPDATES: African Parks will provide regular updates on how the money donated is being utilized, which we will share here on Kickstarter and on the Cooking for Conservation website, to let supporters know how their money is helping the cause. Sign up to our newsletter to get all of our updates.\u00a0 SOPHY ROBERTS (foreword) \"On my first morning on safari in Chad, I trip up in an elephant's footprint. It is January 15, and I'm the first guest at Camp Nomade, a new mobile safari camp in Zakouma National Park... We penetrate deeper into the bush, and I hear it for the first time: the trumpeting pitch, like the creak of the Earth's crust. In a small clearing emerges a phalanx of steel skins lined up like shields. Their wide ears face us \u2013 about 40 elephants in view, with many more implied in the rustle of feet... I feel the infinite possibilities of this place... I realise I have been completely seduced \u2013 by the optimism Zakouma represents...\" Sophy Roberts, writing FT Weekend 31 january 2015. Sophy Roberts is an award-winning UK-based writer, who contributes regularly to the Financial Times, among other publications. Her stories focus on remote places, where travel meets conservation, with much of her time spent in Africa and Siberia. She visited Chad for the first time in 2015, a guest at Camp Nomade.\u00a0 Sophy has written the foreword for the Cooking for Conservation book. KATIE DE KLEE (editor) Katie de Klee has lived in South Africa for the last six and a half years, working as a journalist and editor. For over two years, she worked as editor in chief for Design Indaba, the largest creative platform on the African continent. Originally from England, she is passionate about travel and story telling, especially stories of how creativity can help overcome obstacles. MICHAEL LORENTZ (contributed scene photographs) Michael Lorentz is a prominent South African guide who believes that travel, conservation, and philanthropy is an increasingly important place and one that he feels he can play an active role in. He also cofounded and is acting CEO of Passage to Africa and he cofounded\u00a0Safarious.com, a social networking site for safari-goers.\u00a0 Michael is a passionately talented photographer and when speaking to him about the book, without hesitation, he offered to hand over years of Zakouma photographs for the project. The beauty of the book is in large part thanks to his generosity. JEAN LABUSCHAGNE (contributed scene photographs) Jean Labuschagne is not only a dedicated conservationist, having grown up in national parks in South Africa, Malawi, and Tanzania, but she also has a keen eye for photography. Jean introduced Jamie to Tchad, African Parks, and Zakouma, where her parents acted as park manager and special projects manager. Through her captured images she manages to open your eyes to her world. WHY KICKSTARTER? By using Kickstarter to pre-sell books we have a greater chance of raising the funds needed to print the number of books necessary to reach the $100,000 donation goal to African Parks. If we hit our goal of $36,000, the first print run of 3000 will leave us with paid-for books that we can later sell in order to pay for a second print run. With a portion of the profits from those sold books, we will also be able to start donating to African Parks. Jamie Sparks took a nine month sabbatical from work in order to write, recipe test, photograph, and format this book into something both visually pleasing, informative and fun to cook with. Once the funds from this campaign are confirmed she will proceed with a print test run, with printing and distribution to follow. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pledge $5 or more No reward required, you just love wildlife or are friends with the author or contributors and want to help get this project off the ground.

Decimated by years of poaching, Zakouma's elephants are now receiving the protection they deserve and are hopefully recovering, but this recovery depends on the the ongoing conservation efforts of African Park and the continued value the people of Chad are placing on this unique wilderness area.

  "Slightly Damned is a webcomic that debuted in 2004 and can be read for free (always!) at sdamned.com! It is the story of Rhea Snaketail, a girl killed through mysterious circumstances, who escapes the afterlife and returns to the land of the living. She is joined by her friends, the kindhearted Demon, Buwaro, and the shy Angel warrior, Kieri, as they uncover the secrets of an ancient feud between Heaven and Hell. Slightly Damned won two Ursa Major Awards in 2012 and won two more in 2013 for \"Best Graphic Story\" and \"Best Literary Work\", and was nominated again in 2019 for \"Best Graphic Story\". In 2014, its first Kickstarter campaign was successfully completed to manufacture plush dolls based on the comic's lead characters. In 2018, another Kickstarter campaign was held in order to fund the reprinting of Book One. The comic is currently published online in collaboration with Hiveworks, and copies of Book One are available through its online store! This campaign will be its third campaign, and it's all about continuing the printed versions of the series by focusing on Book Two! Slightly Damned: Book Two contains the \u00a0webcomic's pages from #188 to #376, proofread by several editors. The word balloons have been redone to improve legibility, and some pages have been reformatted in order to fit properly on physical pages. The art has not been altered in order to preserve the original story, but the book IS filled with exclusive new artwork! Slightly Damned: Book Two will contain new chapter covers, new gag strips, and a few select redrawn pages! Also, some rewards allow backers--like you, perhaps!-- to add new content to the bonus section in the back of the book, like writing your own gag strips and nominating old pages to be redrawn with new art! User-generated content... how modern! Our main goal is to create softcover physical copies of Book Two, and to sweeten the deal, we're also including the opportunity to get your hands on a new bookmark, prints, bookplates, and stickers.\u00a0 The Signed bookplate is a stylish adhesive plate autographed by Chu. Bookplates will be received with a paper covering the sticky side. Backers can then remove the paper and stick the bookplate wherever they please in their book.\u00a0 Just like the book 1 Kickstarter, four original pencils pages from Chu's private archive will be available as rewards. These are the original pencil sketches, on paper, from which a comic page was created. Since the original pencils to each Slightly Damned page are one-of-a-kind items, some pages are unavailable. We're keeping things simple and only have one goal: if this Kickstarter campaign reaches $40,000, then we will have the funds to make everything AND we can skip right ahead to printing the second edition of Book Three without the need for a separate campaign! Book Three will also come with its own set of brand new bonus material, including redrawn covers and new comics. For a couple of years, I used a print-on-demand service to produce copies of Slightly Damned: Book One, Book Two, and Book Three. They were sold online and at conventions. Unfortunately, print-on-demand is not practical for printing full-color, 200-300 page books. The books were expensive, flimsy, and sometimes I even had to discard copies because they were assembled incorrectly. Therefore, the first editions of these books have long since been discontinued. The books made through this campaign are of higher quality and will cost less per copy. To make the second edition more special, I've worked hard to include TONS of bonus material. If you've already got one of those first edition copies, then I am still very grateful for your support! But if you like the comic and would like to help it succeed, then I hope you'll find it in your heart to pledge towards the creation of the new versions. Even if you don't want a second copy, they make great gifts for getting your friends hooked or even as a donation to your local library! And, of course, there are the backer-exclusive rewards to consider! For as little as $5, you can get your name in the book and be able to download a digital version so you can check out the bonus art and comics, which are not uploaded anywhere else.",
  "Its a Circus show! But right now we cant afford the amazing venue we've confirmed for the 22nd, 23rd and 24th July.\u00a0 http://www.the-vaults.org/#!gallery/ck0q We also need funding for costumes, lights, set and aerial equipment to make it really happen.\u00a0 Tangerino is our events company that will be putting on the show. We specialise in performance and visual arts. It was set up by Sisters Lil and Kitty Rice early last year. We wanted to find a way of mixing our love of music, art, theatre and Circus and so in June 2013 put on our first show. Our first two shows were a huge success but we did it all on a wing and a prayer AND a shoestring!\u00a0 We are so excited to have started this company and we're really keen to evolve and expand. Kitty and Lil work closely with the artists to create several short \u2018acts\u2019. A circus artist or dancer works with a band or musician writing original songs or learning covers to form a forty minute show. This show will feature the amazing Marika Hackman.\u00a0 Lil Rice and Ollie Clark will also be playing\u00a0 While Lil focuses on directing and choreographing the show, Kitty is learning to build sets and organises the aesthetic of the show. We also would like to let you know that this is an ongoing and hopefully long term project. So if we're lucky enough to make our financial goal thanks to all of you, any extra pledges will go into future plans for shows, like The Red Shoes.\u00a0 Please help fund our venture. Please come and see us, we want to meet you and show you what we're up to. Have a look at these links to see our various projects: http://kittyricedesign.tumblr.com/ http://tangerino.co.uk/",

  "Fck Me is a podcast documenting all those conversations you\u2019ve had with your friends, partners, and even parents. Every sexy, sticky, and awkward moment of sex will be talked about from everyone who has sex (and those who don\u2019t!). As a gay man in his 20\u2019s, sex is all I think about - but I\u2019d like to know more about it. Sex is so much more interesting than just the regular grindr hookups I have become accustomed to. I would love to hear how women view sex, how other queer people view sex, how people who don't have sex view sex. My hopes are to provide people a platform to talk about sex openly and safely to people who are rarely given the opportunity to do so. With that in mind I\u2019d like to invite you all to join me on my journey to becoming a sexpert.\u00a0This podcast will be available on Spotify, Apple and Google Podcasts, Sticher, Instagram, and Youtube.",

  "So like, who are you?  We\u2019re The Rooks! Don\u2019t you remember us from that time you were wandering around the lower east side and stumbled into Pianos? Or that time at Alpha Delt? Or that time at Brittney\u2019s bachlorette party? We were wearing those track suits\u2026  OK It\u2019s coming back to me\u2026 what do you sound like again?  Imagine if Frank Ocean and D\u2019Angelo got a little too hyped at a Carly Rae Jepsen concert, so they left to go chill at a dive bar with David Byrne.  I don\u2019t get it.  Neither do I. We\u2019re still working on that one. But here's our music: http://www.TheRooksBand.BandCamp.com https://open.spotify.com/artist/0qr2Bvt16E5RDOlPSjxmge. So why are you doing this?  We\u2019ve been working for 5 years to perfect the sounds that we\u2019ve been hearing in our heads, and after two EPs, several tours, and more hours spent watching Beyonce live videos on youtube than we care to admit, it\u2019s time that we finally put all of that energy into a full-length album. A recording we can be proud of\u2026 Something we can point to and say, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s us.\u201d  OK, I get it. So where is my money going?  If you give to our campaign, the bulk of your money will go to help us pay for: Is that all? Even if we hit our goal, there are many more things that your dollars can help us do to make the album even bigger and better. Any additional money you contribute can go towards things like: I\u2019ve heard that Garth just lip-synchs to a pre-recorded track. Is that true? I don\u2019t understand the question--- and I won\u2019t respond to it.  OK. Anything else? Thank you all so much for your love and support over the past five years, and we can\u2019t wait to bring this album to your ears soon. With your donations, we know we can create something that will make you proud.\u00a0",

  "Mother\u2019s Cookbook is a beautifully quirky and tasty EarthBound-inspired cookbook written by Hillary Froemel with original recipes developed by Chef Bryan Connor. We\u2019re excited to be joined by additional professional artists, photographers, and a slew of other collaborators such as Alyssa Browning, Nick Lauer, and Patrick Ryan Deasy. Be sure to follow @MothersCookbook on Twitter and MothersCookbookEB on Instagram to stay up-to-date about our project and our campaign. Join us on this incredible, edible adventure!\u00a0 You might be unfamiliar with the quirky charm of the cult classic game EarthBound. Originally released on the SNES in 1995, EarthBound (or MOTHER 2 as it is known in Japan) is a role-playing game (RPG) designed by Shigesato Itoi and developed by APE Inc. The game stood out among the thriving role-playing game market due to it\u2019s unique setting. While games like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest were bringing the genre over to the US with fantasy medieval settings, EarthBound put the RPG style of gameplay in a modern time period. The game is set idyllic, yet satirical, version of America. Gone are the dragons and magic potions of classical fantasy games. In their place are angry ducks, hippies, and \u201cAll-American Foods\u201d like cheeseburgers and pizza.  EarthBound is a heartwarming and strange game that is impossible not to fall in love with. It's a cult classic filled to the brim with memorable characters,\u00a0constant pop culture references, and\u00a0an overwhelming sense of charm.\u00a0The wacky and sometimes outlandish food in the game struck a chord with many of its fans, us included. Who can forget Trout Yogurt? Our goal is to capture this game\u2019s unparalleled charm in a brand new package; a cookbook! Our book includes over 50 original recipes inspired by the game\u2019s memorable characters, fantastical locations, and sometimes odd food items. This 8\" x 10\" cookbook will be available in hardcover, paperback, and digital form. We're pulling some recipes straight from the game like Mammoth Burgers, Magic Cake, and Peanut Cheese Bars. However, we are also creating recipes inspired the game\u2019s characters and locations such as New Age Retro Hummus, Tessie Watchin' Stew, and Lier X. Agerate's Famous Roasted Garlic Bread!\n Don\u2019t worry, the game may have stunk but all the recipes in this book will produce delicious and funky fresh dishes! We hope you enjoy over 140 pages of full-color professional photos, easy-to-read cooking instructions, delightful doodles, and endearing notes from mom herself. \u00a0 Our fellow EarthBound fans at Fangamer\u00a0are Kickstarter veterans who have pledged their support for this project. They\u2019ll be handling production of the book as well as fulfillment of the physical rewards in the $95 and below tiers. This book is not only a must-have for all you EarthBound/MOTHER series fans out there but also completely accessible and enjoyable for anyone looking for a fun time cooking original and interesting recipes. The recipes in this book range from beginners snacks to advanced baked goods.\u00a0We made it our mission to strike a balance between simple dishes that could be whipped up from ingredients found in any kitchen to more involved exotic dishes which might require a trip to a specialty food store. Our book explores the themes of exploration, overcoming the odds, and trying new things just as the game itself does. Not to worry; if you get homesick there\u2019s even a recipe for steak done just how Mom used to make it!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *Preview photos of Mother\u2019s Cookbook design are for preview purposes only and are subject to change.\u00a0 \u00a0A Quick Rundown of What\u2019s in the Book: \u00a0 The team behind this book is comprised of professionals with decades of experience working both in the kitchen and the writer's room. Every one of us is an EarthBound/MOTHER superfan. This series of games has had a huge impact on our lives and driven our creative projects.\u00a0 A rising trend in games is the addition of cooking and unique foods to help flesh-out a game\u2019s universe or feel. You can see great examples of this in games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Final Fantasy XV, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\u00a0 \u00a0 We have spent the last 10 months creating recipes, writing drafts, photographing fresh produce, testing, tasting, and playing video games. We\u2019ve gone as far as we can on this project without additional funding, so we are here to ask for your help. We need backers to help us fund the development of the remaining recipes, as well as testing in our test kitchen, and covering the print cost for the initial run of cookbooks and backer rewards. The group behind this book is dedicated and driven. So many wonderful people have already committed their time, taste buds, and kitchens to working on this project. After 10 months of hard work, we are ready to show our work to the world. We cannot emphasize enough that the recipes in this book are for everyone. You don\u2019t have to be a fan of the series, nor do you even need to be a gamer. \u00a0 \u00a0 Now, the part you're most interested in. The sweet rewards!

This tier is limited to 2 available spots AND USA only. Work with us to set up a night to remember!  We are only asking for the bare minimum to get this book to print. Recipe testing and development, along with printing, proofing, and publishing is not cheap. We had to scale back aspects of our original vision but with stretch goals we could bring them back and make something truly amazing.\u00a0 *OBTAINED!* $11,000 Jackie\u2019s Cafe - A slew of mind-boggling and intensely playful cocktail recipes inspired by various characters, sayings, and PK/PSI powers in the game. Ever wanted to find out what exactly a PK Fire Omega might taste like on the rocks? Here\u2019s a clue, a lot of whiskey. We recognize a lot of our backers might not be of age to purchase alcohol but EarthBound was released over 21 years ago, so we wanted to do something special for the fans who really did grow up with the game. *OBTAINED!* $12,000 Octopus Erasing Machine - Did you know that in the Japanese version of EarthBound the \u201cTrout Yogurt\u201d item was initially \u201cStrawberry Tofu?\u201d That wasn\u2019t the only item changed either! With this stretch goal, we hope to bring a distinctly Japanese flair to this cookbook by including recipes for some of the region-locked items only available in the Japanese version of the game, where the game went by a much different title, MOTHER 2. (Do you understand the cookbook name now? It is a pun, cause the EarthBound series is called the MOTHER series in Japan. We're so witty.)\u00a0 *OBTAINED!* $14,000 Wel come to moo nsi ns dem oons ide - In the game, there is a uniquely wonky town known as \u2018Moonside\u2019. A magical, technicolor place where everything\u2019s reversed and weird. \u2018Up\u2019 means \u2018down\u2019 and burgers are a bun sandwiched between two patties! This stretch goal will allow us to include some insane twists on standard food fare recipes. Hot ice cream? Frozen sandwiches? MADNESS!\u00a0 *OBTAINED!* $16,000 - Handy Dandy Hand-aid - Feel like you might need a hand finding you way around your new cookbook? Well we'll do you one better and give you a hand, with this Stretch Goal, the Handy Dandy Hand-aid! Named after the eponymous \"Hand-aid\" item from EarthBound (think \"Band-aid\", but with less trademark infringement). This stretch goal, will allow us to add a robust section dedicated to cooking tips, tricks, and general advice from mom. It will include helpful guidance with topics such as cooking methods, knife skills, kitchen equipment, and how to convert recipes to your liking (and even into metric measurements!) This section will be useful for both beginner and advanced cooks. Mom\u2019s tips will help you be the best darn cook you can be!   *OBTAINED!* $20,000 - Abstract Art - Like the art in the book? Hitting this stretch goal adds an entire artist's gallery, featuring a few pages of original art from all of this project's artists. You'll see a little behind-the-scenes of the creative process that really added a lot to this project! *OBTAINED!* $25,000 - Sunflower Fields - Reaching this goal adds even more recipes to every version of the book! What kind of recipes you might ask? Well, we'll be adding MOTHER 3 recipes! For those who don't know, MOTHER 3 is the sequel game to EarthBound. The Japanese-only game was originally released in 2006 and has never been localized. Die-hard fans have been waiting over a decade for an official English release that has just not appeared but with this stretch goal, we'll give you a little taste of what it might be. We'll add quite a few recipes inspired by the Tazmily Village area. With all your support we'll actually be able to add some of Hinawa's recipes to the cookbook! Some examples are nut cookies and fluffy omelets! The pages in this chapter will be inspired by the beauty and emotion in her letters. *OBTAINED!* $35,000 - I (oo) NEW PORK -\u00a0DO YOU WANT MORE RECIPES IN EVERY COPY OF THE BOOK?! WELL WE CAN DO THAT! We'll add more recipes to the book inspired by the New Pork City area of EarthBound's sequel, MOTHER 3.\u00a0If our project raises $35,000, we\u2019ll be adding dishes inspired by some iconic food items such as Hot Dog Sushi, Rich Kid Stew, Pasta with a Past, King Burgers and more! Bring the flavor of his royal porkness into your very own kitchens! **OBTAINED!!** $45,000 - PK SECRET\u00a0\u03a9 -\u00a0There's more?! Your bet there is! If our project raises $45,000 or more in this final push, we will make a special secret behind-the-scenes mini-documentary for the production of the book! This will be available to all our backers at the $5 dollar tier and up! \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "Funded! With a record-setting sum that's hit two stretch goals! We're getting an extra-long Volume 3, and a cool new custom-drawn fantasy map of the Leif & Thorn world. \u00a0Leif & Thorn is a original, LGBTQ-centric, fantasy webcomic, about a magic knight trying to have a romance in his second language. Also, trying to shield his love interest from a tangled web of shady debts, shadier politics, and spelltech-enforced behavior controls. Also: going to the opera. Read Leif & Thorn online to get caught up with the backstory, follow the latest strips, and stay on top of news about future books... Volumes 1 and 2 have already been printed, using the funds we raised with Kickstarter! This is the campaign where we fund Volume 3. If you like song parodies, Madoka Magica, worldbuilding, Arthurian mythos, romantic solos, or Hamilton...there's something for you in this book. The story so far: Thorn has been on Embassy guard duty for a year now, and it's going great. His team of knights has expanded! Their magical-girl-in-training is about to level up! He has a boyfriend, sort of! He's won free tickets to the opera! That's right, the smash-hit historical musical Leachtric is in town. An Embassy diplomat is taking his daughters, so they need a few guards to tag along. Just as a formality. What could go wrong? ...except for backstage smugglers, rival secret agents, a magical boy suppressing his powers, a time traveler who almost blows her cover, a knight who calls in sick because he's growing wings, and, oh yes, somebody let a giant monster plant loose in the pipes. Leif wants to be a supportive sorta-kinda-boyfriend, but he only has clearance to know about half the stuff Thorn's involved in. Luckily, he also has plenty of experience working around secrets. For teens and up. (Don't give this one to small children -- it includes \u00a0mature topics like character death, mind control, consent issues, government corruption, and predatory lending agents.) Leif & Thorn Volume 3 covers the daily strips from early 2018 to the middle of 2019, along with info pages, AU side stories, and other bonuses. Like Volumes 1 and 2, it'll be 8.25\" X 10.25\", full-color, with a wraparound cover and a bunch of exclusive art inside. Previous volumes were 180 pages, but thanks to a record amount of funding, Volume 3 has gotten bumped up to 192. Here's a quick taste of the interior: \u00a0At the time I was drawing these strips, Volume 1 had just funded! Which means Volume 3 is the first in the series that was consciously planned for print. I had the basic layout all sorted. I knew how many pages each book would have. And although Leif & Thorn has always had overarching plot arcs...this is the first time I was able to deliberately place a lot of setup at The Start Of The Volume, and schedule the resolutions for within the next 180 pages. Not only that: it's also when I spruce up the lettering, upgrade the shading, and branch out with lighting techniques. There's a lot of reasons the first storyline in this book is called \"Level Up.\" A sampling of the other storylines inside: THE SHOW MUST GROW ON (Act I) - Magic swords are cool! Magic swords that reveal you're the reincarnation of your country's greatest legendary hero are terrifying. A national history lesson told in song parodies. A lot of these strips have been color-adjusted to look fancier in print -- and the bonus material includes a bunch of never-before-shared extended lyrics. THE SHOW MUST GROW ON (Intermission) - Rowan had to take a week off from being a knight because he's growing wings. Luckily, his siblings are around to help in his time of need...by reminding him that there are worse pains. THE SHOW MUST GROW ON (Act II) - The opera building -- full of actors and cosplayers, with special-effects \"magic\" and prop swords -- gets overrun by an all-too-real plant monster. \u00a0A NIGHT TO REMEMBER - Thorn tries to reconstruct what really happened during the opera rescue, working around mind-altering powers and top-secret pasts. GRASSIE KNOWS HER HISTORY - A time-traveling older Thorn winds up in a century before his own - where the comedy is classic, the spelltech is antique, and his cover story needs work. CAN'T YOU READ THE SIGNS - Back at the present-day Embassy, Leif is busy setting up subplots for Volume 4. That is, if he can get his co-workers on board. HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED - Holly, the magical girl who's been working with Thorn's team, prepares to graduate to her next job: tutor for a recently-superpowered teen pop star. BONUS STRIPS - Alternate-universe adventures, worldbuilding tidbits, one-off jokes, and other extra moments.\u00a0 Your writer/artist/creator is Erin Ptah. I've been doing this webcomic thing for 15+ years now - inspired first by newspaper comics like Doonesbury or Calvin & Hobbes, then by manga like Sailor Moon and Hellsing...and these days, by other webcomics. Keep up with my work on Twitter, on Deviantart, or on Patreon. (Come for the public announcements, subscribe for the patron-locked bonus art!) Current webcomic projects: Leif & Thorn (of course) and But I'm A Cat Person (a full-page adventure comedy, about broke queer millennials with battle monsters). I told you above that this book was LGBTQ-centric, so I should probably show some of the representation, huh? The title characters are both guys, they're from two different races and nationalities, and they are In Love. In spite of the language barrier, in defiance of all kinds of cultural baggage: they make each other so starry-eyed, you could see it from space. Their supporting Cast Full Of Gay includes cute goth teenagers with f/f crushes: Cute pop-star teenagers with m/m crushes: Historical lesbians who have healthy friendships with their exes: Rival transgender secret agents, a single trans woman and a married nonbinary showoff: Butch/femme wives who get each other, even when nobody else does: Ace people who get to have a good night's sleep: And more! (In this world, the default assumption is that most people are bi. But don't worry: even though straight people are a minority, we can still love and respect their confusing non-traditional ways.) Don't just take my word for how good Leif & Thorn is! Take the words of comments from satisfied readers. Like these: \"I\u2019ve been raving about this comic to anyone who would listen.\" ~komorebikore \"I really like the mix of \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201cold\u201d technology in this world. \u00a0They have smartphones made out of magic crystals! And seal envelopes \u00a0with wax. It\u2019s just really neat.\" ~Lielac \"Got my copy of the published book today! It looks great!\" ~MsM \"Erin likes to break all of our hearts but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to inflict any more horri\u2013I JUST REMEMBERED FUTURE THORN IS MISSING AN EYE AND NOW I\u2019M QUESTIONING ALL MY ASSUMPTIONS\" ~Cal \"DAnsffspnzlsx \u00a0I\u2019m having feelings\" ~shizamura \"Thorn is just a cinnamon bun. I love how he has a realistic worldview, \u00a0analyzes situations quickly, makes his own decisions based on logic and \u00a0how a person is NOW, but is also being sensibly cautious. Go Thorn!\" ~Dinglehopper \"I had completely forgotten about the existence of Artie, because they \u00a0had never really had the limelight. I just went through every page with \u00a0their character tag, and now I love them.\" ~Nova \"I AM MAKING AN UNDIGNIFIED AMOUNT OF NOISE AT MIDNIGHT\" ~Lielac \"This is a very satisfying reveal and I\u2019m SUPER pumped to see where things are going to go from here.\" ~Diva \"I just wanted to say, as part of a diverse community I really appreciate \u00a0you creating a comic universe in which wearing pretty makeup is not \u00a0something the characters feel must be a flamboyant thing done for \u00a0attention. And being nonbinary is also a normal thing. So it will be \u00a0cool to see whichever way you go.\" ~Nora \"*clutches heart* ugh he still has his original eyes ow\" ~Kiwi The part you've all been waiting for! All claimed on Day 1! The\u00a0first 15 backers who pledge at least $15 get a Leif & Thorn bonus sketch!\u00a0 Almost any characters, any \u00a0scenario, canon or AU. The only restrictions are (a) the content has to be safe-for-work, and (b) it has to involve characters who appear in Volume 3. See, these go in the book - to fill spaces that would otherwise be blank, at the bottom of pages or the end of chapters. Like so: As with Volumes 1 and 2, the sketches I do for Early Bird requests are book-exclusive. That means you'll have to pick up a copy to see them. (Totally worth it, btw. People have some great ideas.) Early backers will also get a special thanks on the credits page, no matter what tier you're in.\u00a0 Speaking of which... Whether you want the first volume or the latest, the starter pack or the complete set, the low-stress ebooks or the special signed paperbacks with all the trimmings...there's a tier for you. Don't see the exact combination of swag you want? Scroll to the end for the add-ons menu. Want an extra book? Got a friend, family member, and/or local\u00a0library \u00a0who would appreciate a copy? Or maybe you want more merch than I offered in any of the regular tiers. Good news: Kickstarter is beta-testing a built-in Add-Ons feature, and this campaign is one of the first to get it! Here's what to do: \u00a0And here's a preview of the add-ons available: Some financial and technical details: Why Kickstarter? Because I can't pull a \u00a0couple thousand dollars out-of-pocket to do a print run (even knowing I can sell the books afterward). A Kickstarter campaign lets \u00a0me bring a bunch of people together for pre-orders, so I can fund the \u00a0printing upfront. Where exactly is the money going? Mostly to printing and shipping the books. Especially the shipping costs of those full 3-book sets. Here's a detailed pie-chart breakdown: How long will it take me to get my book? Here's the planned timeline: So, listen, you follow the news, right? I don't need to explain that there are Problems In The World that could slow down the mail. Or any other part of this process. But I've gone through printing and shipping with two books already. I know how to deal with unexpected challenges. And I'll always keep backers in the loop when they come up. (Also, I'm washing my hands, wearing my mask, and my early-voting ballot is cast.) What happens if we make more than the goal? Well, first of all, that means we have more backers than expected - so \u00a0some of the extra cash goes toward making and shipping more rewards. But if we seriously over-fund...for the first time, we have stretch goals! Making the book is just the first step. Here's some bonuses we could add to it. UNLOCKED: $3,323: More Book! Instead of another 180 pages, the length of Volume 3 will jump to 192! Enough to add a bunch of extra comics and bonus material, but not so much that it raises the shipping cost. UNLOCKED: $4,100: Fancier Map! Commissioning a new artist to do a beautiful, detailed map of the Leif & Thorn world, to replace the computer-generated one in the front of the books. Too expensive to impulse-buy, but with your help we can afford it. (Not actually sure how long it'll take to get this right -- if the work pushes back the printing, I'll keep you posted on why.) Maybe Next Year: $5,100: Extra Merch! Don't worry, now that the map is funded, this will be able to come back as one of the first stretch goals in Volume 4. This has been Leif & Thorn Volume 3! Thank you for your interest and support. Don't forget to watch the comic's website for new updates, future books, and (as always) the latest strips. See you next year in Volume 4...",
  "We hit our funding goal (which was admittedly pretty low) so that means the book will be made and everybody that orders it will get one! 300 Comics About Frogs is the first collection of Frog Crisis comics by creator Greg Hyland. The book is 312 pages, featuring the first three hundred Frog Crisis comic strips originally seen on Facebook (@FrogCrisis) and on frogcrisis.com (where you can see \u00a0samples of the comic strip). The book also features a look at the history of Frog Crisis, which started as an animated film in 1991. The loose, hand-drawn style of Frog Crisis is due to the fact that I treat the making of the comic as an exercise, limiting myself to 15 minutes to draw the comic and then post it on-line. \u201cFrog Crisis is the essential exploration of a Canadian, self-employed, artistic, hockey-playing amphibian with a sharp sense of humour.\u201d -Glenn Kay (Monster Atlas) The names of all backers will be listed in 300 Comics About Frogs. Add-ons for the campaign include five reproductions of Frog Crisis minicomics originally done in 1992, an \"animation cel\" print using artwork I did in 1991 for my animated Frog Crisis college film, an original customized frog sketch by me, and a page of an original Frog Crisis comic strip that was used in the book! Stretch Goal Achieved! If we raise $700 our first Stretch Goal will be two 5x7\" reproductions of mini-posters that were made in 1992 for the Frog Crisis minicomic.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Get more information and become a Frog Friend by joining the Frog Crisis Patreon at patreon.com/frogcrisis !",
  "The Sodapop speaker has been designed to solve the main problem for small portable loudspeakers: They struggle to reproduce low frequency bass, resulting in a somewhat feeble sound.\u00a0The Sodapop invention solves this problem by connecting the speaker to its own carrying case or any other suitable plastic bottle.\u00a0This offers a compact portable wireless speaker that provide you with louder music, twice as much bass and an overall superior sound. The Sodapop is designed and developed in Oslo, Norway by a team consisting of award-winning industrial designers, acousticians, tech enthusiasts, speaker nerds and music loving entrepreneurs. Sodapop combines Scandinavian design, quality and innovation to form a new type of compact portable speakers that looks great and sounds amazing.\u00a0 Scandinavian design - characterized by functionality, quality, simplicity and clean lines - ensures that playing music from your mobile devices\u00a0is intuitive, easy and fun. The custom made bass bottle doubles as a protective carrying case for the speaker unit. Even so, the threaded interface that fastens the bottle is compatible with most regular plastic beverage bottles just about anywhere in the world. This makes the Sodapop speaker the perfect travelling companion: You can find a suitable bottle everywhere; in your hotel room, the local store, at the beach etc.  Using the Sodapop speaker is a fun, low-cost experience with a significant wow-factor, all the while creating a new use for the drinking bottle, extending its life cycle and adding value to the empty container. The Sodapop speaker forms a natural link between people and popular music. In a fun and social setting, when friends are hanging out and playing music, the Sodapop speaker and a soda bottle can be the center of attention. The speaker creates an exciting, new functional value for the bottle, and the users will be able to compare and evaluate different bottle designs, sizes and materials. So there you have it, real bass requires real space. By utilizing the characteristics of the bottle material and the air inside the bottle, the Sodapop speaker can increase the sound volume in the bass range by as much as 10dB.\u00a0 To the human ear a 10dB increase will sound approximately twice as loud, so in other words the Sodapop speaker can generate twice as much bass, just by connecting an ordinary soda bottle. The effect is striking once the bottle is attached. We have tested the Sodapop in a professional sound lab and the results are exactly what we were aiming for. As the frequency response graphs shows, the Sodapop speaker delivers unmatched power\n throughout the whole audio spectrum. Our goal is to achieve the best sound quality in a portable wireless speaker, with as much bass as possible without loss of definition, and at a very consumer-friendly price.\u00a0 The Sodapop team has been working with professionals in the music and product development industry. They have provided us with regular feedback on prototypes and helped us to get closer and closer to the ultimate sound experience.\u00a0 Hundreds of sketches and prototypes have been 3D-printed to find the optimal combination of sound, functionality and design. We have teamed up with Permafrost, a Norwegian design studio based in Oslo consisting of five industrial designers. Their design philosophy is all about creating consumer products that are user friendly, simple and safe, with just enough personality to make them stand out.\u00a0 At Permafrost they are particularly fond of projects that bridge the gap between technology and art, and believe designers have an obligation to turn all the world\u2019s technological achievements into meaningful innovations for people. We have spent a lot of time finding the right manufacturer for the Sodapop speaker. After several trips to China we finally found the perfect manufacturer in Shenzhen. Having developed and produced speakers since 1999,\u00a0they have tons of experience and a great track record. Currently, our manufacturer produces 4 million units pr. year. We are very confident that they are up for the task and ready to deliver the high-quality product that meets our Scandinavian expectations and demands. It\u2019s difficult to present sound in a video! Make sure you connect some good headphones, so you can get an impression of how the Sodapop sounds like. But still the reproduction of the sound will not be as good as live listening. The founders who came up with the Sodapop idea all share a passion for music and technology, and they have a lot of experience in electronics and consumer products.\u00a0 The founders gathered experts in multiple domains such as audio design, Industrial design, music-, speaker- and tech industries. Between them, the team members have over 20 years of experience in audio, technology, product design and manufacturing.\u00a0 Getting Sodapop from idea to reality has been a tremendous team effort. We\u2019ve worked on it full time since 2016. Our Sodapop portable speakers are now ready for production, and we\u2019re so excited to share what we\u2019ve built with the Kickstarter community. Early after the birth of the idea of Sodapop, the original founders of the Sodapop concept initialized a cooperation with Permafrost design studio.  Permafrost is a groundbreaking Norwegian design studio with multiple Red-Dot award including best of the best awards. Permafrost was established in 2000, founded by 4 industrial designers all educated from the Oslo School of Architecture. Today Permafrost consist of 5 brilliant industrial designers and is leading and carrying out the design process for the Sodapop speaker. \u00d8yvind Warp, Co-founder of Sodapop, and head of Product Development, has significant knowledge and experience with speakers and tech-business in general from over 20 years working with electronics. He is also a passionate part-time designer and has done the artwork on this Kickstarter campaign including videos and animations. \u00d8yvind is also taking care of the marketing for this Kickstarter campaign. Priding himself on being very hands-on, \u00d8yvind spends a lot of time in Norway and China ensuring that the Sodapop is developed using the very latest technology, whilst making no compromises on quality. \u00d8yvind's passion for tech was the very motivation to start up the company \u2013 and he was the one bringing the Sodapop from idea to reality by making the first prototypes in the back office of his electronics store. \u00d8yvind has great passion for music, his music taste was a bit stuck in electronica in his early years, but luckily his taste for music has expanded to almost every genre you can imagine. \u00d8ystein Lien, Co-founder of Sodapop, is educated in marketing from the Norwegian Business School (BI), has a long experience in customer relations and service and has worked for more that 15 years in the payment industry. Together with Nicolai, \u00d8ystein will take care of Sales and Distributions of the Sodapop. And together with \u00d8yvind he is bringing his marketing skills to the test.\u00a0\u00d8ystein has a passion for football and he is often referred to as \"Factastein\" as he has knowledge of things nobody else has the brainpower to remember. His taste in music spans from 70\u00b4s Bowie and 90\u00b4s grimey hip-hop in Wu-Tang Clan, to the 00\u00b4s Norwegian golden age of electronica and rock music personified in Queens of the Stoneage, Foo Fighters and The White Stripes. Ole Nicolai Olsen, Co-founder of Sodapop, is educated within maritime disciplines from Southampton University, has worked within the shipping business for the last 18 years. Nicolai is head of the company board and our financial guru. Together with \u00d8ystein he is also in charge of Sales and Distributions of the Sodapop speaker. Nicolai has a big heart, and he is a funny guy to hang out with, but he can also be very focused and disciplined, and that\u2019s a good thing when he uses that to keep the project on the right tracks. Nicolai also plays the guitar, used to be in a band, and is a huge Pixies fan. Tom Alexander Trones, Acoustician, is educated from The Norwegian School of Science and Technology and have worked as a sound consultant on the Sodapop project. We knew it would work, Tom explained to us why it did. Tom also has a great passion for guitars and he used to have long hair to go with it, today he has cut his hair but still loves his guitars, so much he is even building his own on his free time. It looks like his music taste all spans around bands that frequently uses the guitar in their songs. We like that about Tom, he\u00b4s got passion! We are all audiophiles here. Every member of our team participates in different ways in the product development process, from the conception of the idea to fulfillment. We develop the kind of product we would love to have ourselves. \n We have already spend a lot of our own money on the development of this speaker, now we need your help to make this project come to life. We love cakes! Let us\u00a0visualize\u00a0the spending for you. The production and development of the moulds + the speakers itself carries the largest cost, after that comes marketing costs of this campaign, because we need to boost our campaign-related posts on Facebook and Instagram in order to stand out from the crowd.",
  "** NEWS FLASH!! ** Aug. 12, 2020 \u2013 Although we are set with our funding for a DVD single-disc release of 5 Edward Edward Everett Horton silent comedies, if we can get the funding tally over the $19K line before noon EDT on August 17, this project can expand to a 2-disc set containing all 8 Horton comedies! If you haven't done so yet, your pledge to this Kickstarter will mean the entire group of films \u2013 unseen by and unavailable to the public since 1928 \u2013 will be back on screens for fans to enjoy. If you've already pledged and wish to adjust your pledge amount to help out, follow these steps to do so. _________________________________________________________ (Aug 2, 2020) -- This Kickstarter will fund a project that brings 5\u00a0rare Edward Everett Horton silent comedy shorts from 1927-1928 to DVD. Yes, you read that right -- silent comedy film shorts starring Edward Everett Horton.\u00a0 These comedies were produced by Harold Lloyd and released by Paramount, and have been preserved in 35mm from original nitrate elements. They are charming and hilarious, and boast excellent production values. They have not been seen by the general public since 1928. The films that will be on the DVD will be seen in new 2K digital scans of archival materials preserved by the Library of \u00a0Congress, and will be scanned by the Library of Congress' lab. I will\u00a0create a brand new custom musical score for each film. The films on the DVD will be: No Publicity (1927), Find the King (1927), Dad's Choice (1928), Horse Shy (1928), Vacation Waves (1928). This\u00a0Kickstarter covers all costs for the DVD's production and\u00a0release, as well as the making and shipping of backer DVDs. The DVD box art will be created by professional graphic designer and silent era aficionado Marlene Weisman.\u00a0The films will have digital cleanup and stabilization work done on them, as well as dedicated video gradung (exposure correction).The DVDs will be professionally authored and they will be made\u00a0available for sale online as MOD (manufacture-on-demand) discs. The\u00a0finished DVD will be available via outlets like Amazon.com, TCM Shop, DeepDiscount and more, as well as international online retailers. The release will be publicized and reviewed. The DVD\u00a0will be NTSC format, and will be region \u201c0\u201d (region-free).\u00a0 This is the same workflow as I have been doing successfully for all 23 of my DVD releases. I expect to be able to have the DVD finished for you by the end of January 2021, and ready for the public for a March 2021\u00a0release. It is entirely possible that, because of the pandemic, the project might finish a month or so sooner...or later. Backers of this project will receive a copy of the DVD. Kickstarter backers will get their copies of the DVD before it becomes\u00a0available to the general public. I make a point of sending regular updates with behind the scenes information about the films and about the restoration and production process. Some of these are done in text form and some as videos. Last year, during a 2-3 month pause while waiting for digital restoration work on the Douglas MacLean films to be done, we sent out an update every day or two with reviews of each of MacLean's 26 feature films; MacLean is completely forgotten and most of his films are lost or survive incomplete, and these updates gave backers the opportunity to become experts on MacLean's filmography. We've\u00a0all heard of great silent films having been preserved at a\u00a0film archive and thought, \"wouldn't it be great if somebody put that\u00a0out on DVD?\". Here's a chance for you to be part of that \"somebody\"!\u00a0Make your pledge\u00a0to \"The Edward Everett Horton DVD\u00a0Project\"\u2026and participate in a unique silent\u00a0film enterprise. I've been accompanying silent movies on piano and organ for nearly 4 decades; I play for silents at The Museum of Modern Art, Library of Congress, Silent Clowns\u00a0Film Series (which I also produce) in NYC, and at\u00a0festivals, historic theatres, schools and universities throughout the US and\u00a0internationally. I've scored dozens of silent films for DVD release by companies like KinoLorber, Milestone, ReelclassicDVD and Thanhouser, for my own label (Undercrank Productions) as well as for broadcast on TCM. Over the last 7 years, I've produced and distributed 23 DVDs of rare silent films\u00a0\u2013 great silent films you've never heard of\u2026but should \u2013 fan-funded via\u00a0Kickstarter. The films have been sourced either from\u00a0collectors or from\u00a0the Library of Congress, with whom I have a co-branding arrangement.

  "My ultimate goal is to document the private space exploration industry, and this campaign is a small step toward that ultimate goal. In this campaign, I hope to document the early stage of building Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX)'s new spaceport in Texas, the world's first private spaceport. Ideally, I will begin photographing their property before they begin major construction, then continue in later campaigns to documenting further changes as they progress toward completion. I could use a little help getting there, though. That's where you come in.\u00a0 For a small contribution, you can help me make a trip to Boca Chica, Texas, where I can photograph and document the area. In appreciation for your assistance, I will share with you some copies of my photos that I've shot of SpaceX facilities and the surrounding area. Some of the photos that I will share were shot on previous trips, and reduced resolution copies of these images are already available on my Flickr Photostream.\u00a0 Thank you for your consideration and support!\u00a0",
  "Hello from Australia! -Matt Hello from America! -Jorgey He's going to school for Graphic Design and loves to collect coins. She's going to school for missionary work and would rather spend coins than collect them. But together, these two make an unstoppable pair.  It's been over two years of Matt going to America, and Jorgey went to Australia once. Why the difference? Turns out leaving America is a lot more expensive than going to it, and for nearly broke college (or uni) kids, it seems that being together for good might prove to be impossible. That's where you come in.  Any amount will help tremendously toward their goal of buying a ticket so Jorgey and Matt can finally start the journey or their relationship that doesn't include the 15,000 mile gap in-between. The rewards offered will mostly be done by Jorgey because although Matt is amazing in the graphic design field, he can't draw to save his life. Unless you want a picture of chair, which he happens to be unnaturally good at drawing. Seriously. ",
  "\u00a0 . Hello everyone! My name is Letbia Rej\u00f3n and today I'm here to present to you a project to create my first cookbook in both English and Spanish with delicious and traditional Mexican foods and desserts! For many decades, I have always been very passionate about cooking delicious food from here in Mexico as well as baking beautiful & delicious cakes and desserts. My years of experience back me up, as well as the over 3,400 followers in my official Facebook group which you can find at the end in the contacts section. My motivation began last year, after having to deal with many hardships, I had two surgeries, one of them for thyroid cancer. Thankfully, after many months of struggle, I overcame this and now I'm moving forward. My love for my family and determination to fulfill my dreams are what made me come through this stronger than ever! \u00a0 . After these events, decided to finally go ahead and make an attempt to create my own cookbooks to share my delicious recipes to everyone, delicious all-natural and authentic Mexican food and desserts. I always prepare my food with love for my family and friends and I want to share my recipes to the world from the bottom of my heart. \u00a0 \u00a0 . You will be delighted with the amazing quality of the food that can't be called other than culinary art, you will have access to many of my secret recipes which, unlike many other cookbooks, will have extremely accurate measurements and instructions to bring the amazing flavors of authentic Mexican food and desserts to your table for you and your family to enjoy! But that's not all! My knowledge is not limited to Mexican food and desserts only. I will share with you amazing recipes for dishes and desserts from other countries as well! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The main goal is $283usd, the idea is to start with one cookbook, which will be volume 1, with handpicked national and international recipes for dishes and desserts. Due to last year's events, my budget to pull this off by myself is, quite frankly, none. The main goal of this campaign to make a good start and create the first copies of the book EXCLUSIVELY for backers, being able to sell it online and get more tools and budget to keep doing what I love. The stretch goals will determine how much further I can get this year, which goes from being able to make more vol. 1 cookbooks, a Vol. 2 to sell online, making YouTube videos based off the books recipes (which require getting the ingredients for each video), and even getting my books on some bookshelves in stores! All of you will get very good rewards and certain tier backers will even get physical copies of both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 book when it's out! If you want to know more, here's a more detailed table with what the goals and stretch goals will achieve: \u00a0 Your help will not only allow me to make my dream a reality, it will also allow me to help bring new flavors to everyone who's willing to learn more about gastronomy. I'll be able to, if enough funding is reached, reach more people with my videos and help them create even more dishes that will blow everyone away. Kickstarter is the best crowdfunding website that exists and it has helped a lot of people make their dreams come true. I have hopes that my dream will succeed and people will love and appreciate this project. As I said above, I do have a Facebook group with over 3,400 people in it, you can message me there or you can message me here, however, in all honesty, my English is very bad, my son is helping me with the translation, so if I take too long to reply to your messages it's because he's not available yet to help me translate. Here's the link to my Facebook group, feel free to become a member and share food related links and topics! https://www.facebook.com/groups/164570833741043/",
  "Ever since I can remember, I've always wanted to be a professional singer. Singing is what gives me my voice. It's what makes me smile; To know my voice makes others feel inspired.\u00a0Now, after having graduated from college and landing some amazing performing opportunities, I am ready for my dreams to take flight. I've grown to the point of understanding my true artistry and my potential to use my talent to effect others in a positive way.\u00a0 I am at a turning point in my journey. It's now or never, and my goal is to invest everything I have into the production my first real work of art: My first album.\u00a0 Music is my life, and this opportunity would change my life, because it would afford me the opportunity to change the lives of those most important to me...

  "UPDATE: I am so blown away by the support I have received so far!!! \u00a0Thank you from the bottom of my heart!! Stretch goal: If we get to $6000, that additional funding will go towards the production of my first music videos!\u00a0 *Cue Rafiki voice*\u00a0 \"IT IS TIME.\" WAfter years of studying and making music, I have finally decided to create something of my very own. All mine. I have worked in this industry for almost a decade now, and I feel that I have the experience, knowledge, and tools to make something truly special.\u00a0 However, releasing music is more expensive than most realize! Even on a smaller project, the combination of producer and engineer fees, studio rental, mixing and mastering fees,\u00a0merchandising, marketing, and creating a tangible, non-digital product has the potential to put an artist several thousand dollars in debt. However, by funding the project independently (i.e. without a record label backing me), I will own \"the masters\" of each song. That basically means I have the power to do WHAT I want to do with my music it WHEN I want to do it. After many years working in this crazy industry, I have learned that to be invaluable.  Furthermore, I have made the [apparently] revolutionary decision to use REAL HUMAN MUSICIANS to play my original songs. This project is essentially an homage to my upbringing in Memphis, surrounded by soul music and soul artists. Digital instrumentation simply cannot provide the heart and grit that I hope to have on this project. I grew listening to music that was recorded live. They were all together, all in a single room, just playing some tunes, and thriving on the creative experience. It wasn't \"pop-perfect,\" but you felt the music.\u00a0That's what I hope to do. This EP calls for the organic, old-fashioned relationship between a singer/songwriter and her players.\u00a0 However, they're starving artists like me, so I want to be able to pay them! With your support, I'll be able to compensate my musicians for all their incredible work and facilitate a truly collaborate environment for creativity.",
  "This project is brought to you by Sue Heale and Joshua Sibley, who have led the non-profit Kirkland Academy of Music and Performance in Kirkland, \u00a0Washington for the past 13 years. \u00a0Our goal is to bring live theater and film back to the Audion for the first time since 1942, making the facility a hub for community cultural events and education. Kickstarter pledges for this project are tax deductible! \u00a0We are a 501c-3! \u00a0 Originally built as a mercantile and boarding house in 1889 after the July 4, 1889 Ellensburg fire destroyed much of the town, the Audion theater building became the Orpheus theater around the turn of the 20th Century and began live theater productions. \u00a0In 1912, the boarding house was closed by the City for being a brothel. \u00a0That floor of the building looks as if everyone walked out in 1912 and left the upper floor of the building frozen in time. \u00a0Some of the rooms even have the original beds and desks/dressers in them! \u00a0Who knows? \u00a0Maybe there is even a ghost or two in the cavernous space! In 1914, the theater celebrated a grand re-opening as the Colonial Theater which it was until the Farrell family remodeled it into the art deco form it is now. \u00a0Silent films were the hit then with the theater showing famous silent films by Charlie Chaplin and Hal Roach. \u00a0Traveling shows from Broadway came to town on the railroads and Ellensburg was hopping with four live performance venues. After decades of decline and empty buildings and storefronts, this community of 16,000 residents is seeing a robust revitalization thanks to the many hard-working and visionary folks who have a stake in Ellensburg. \u00a0The community has surrounded us with support-- the Chamber of Commerce, the Ellensburg Downtown Association, \u00a0Valley Musical Theater group, Boulet Productions in Roslyn, and more! \u00a0 Theater and music events bring people into town! \u00a0Those people eat in restaurants, they shop in stores, they support the other local businesses around theaters. \u00a0Our work is about much more than getting to do what we enjoy so much which is theater! \u00a0It's about sustainability and revival of a small community just 90 miles from Seattle. \u00a0 Our goal is to purchase and restore the building using loans from Craft3, a non-profit lender, and grants from the National Historic Preservation Trust and the National Endowment for the arts, combined with grants and funding from other Washington trusts and restoration groups. \u00a0Combined with some private funding, our goal is to have the theater operational within 2 years of the purchase. Goal #1-- $35,000 to get the organic coffee shop open in the lobby! \u00a0With 10,000 CWU students just a few blocks away and the Ellensburg community of 16,000, we're hoping that an organic coffee shop and place to grab an acai bowl or quick lunch will thrive. \u00a0The Coffee House will have Open Mic nights, poetry slams, and other community gatherings to engage the community in the theater restoration process and produce funds for the renovations. Goal #2-- If we reach our $35,000 goal, the next $50,000 will go towards opening the Boarding House on \u00a0the upper floor. \u00a0With 8-10 rooms, the goal is to have a place for artists residences and AirBNB options for those who might want to stay in a historic hotel space from the early 1900's. \u00a0Wouldn't it be fun to spend the night in a former brothel?? \u00a0Honeymoon suite??\u00a0 Goal #3-- If we keep hitting our stretch goals with amazing support from the community, the incoming funds will be directed towards the renovation of the theater space itself which is a lot of work. \u00a0The old dressing rooms remain as well as the original wooden fly system. \u00a0The rake is there underneath levels of flooring that were added for the antique mall that operated in the building beginning in the early 1980's. \u00a0The art deco style remains throughout the space, particularly in the lobby area. \u00a0We are working with a historic preservation architect to restore the theater to it's original character as much as possible. We hope to bring musical theater education and performance to Ellensburg as we have in Kirkland. \u00a0Our community theater group in Kirkland performs 2-3 shows per year with an all ages cast that consists of regular members of our community-- teachers, bankers, tech workers, stay-at-home moms and more! \u00a0With our over 4000 piece costume collection, we'll be able to continue our tradition of high quality original shows, written from public domain material. \u00a0We just landed a publishing deal with Chatwin Books of Seattle for our full length and school shows. \u00a0We will be publishing 1-2 per year as well as continuing our original writing.\u00a0 We are also excited to bring our musical theater restorations to Ellensburg. \u00a0Since 2013, we've restored the 1903 Wizard of Oz and the 1904 George M. Cohan work, Little Johnny Jones. \u00a0Our restoration work is very unique and well received by audiences. \u00a0These very shows would have played in theaters like the Audion in the early 1900's when George M. Cohan ruled Broadway and took his shows all over the United States.\u00a0 We have very few resources ourselves. \u00a0We cannot do this project without your support. \u00a0We are not seeking major donors, but, rather, everyday people who love music and theater who can support our project with small gifts. \u00a0Our goal is to get 2000 people to contribute $50 each. \u00a0 Sue and Josh have a dream. \u00a0With our video garnering over 12,000 views in the first week we had our Facebook page, the Ellensburg community and surrounding areas are clearly very interested in our project. \u00a0Sue has met with several key community members already --Chamber of Commerce and Ellensburg Downtown Association leaders, \u00a0professors and students from CWU, members of the community who are doing other arts-related renovations, store and restaurant owners whose businesses in Downtown Ellensburg would benefit from the Audion being open and thriving and MORE! \u00a0All of these people have expressed a high level of support for this project! \u00a0 Can you join us??",
  "We're dusting off the vintage radio and giving it a chance to sing again. Introducing Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speakers.\u00a0 Bluetooth 4.0 connected speakers built from beautiful vintage radios.\n\u00a0 Beautiful objects have been built to produce music throughout history.  Some continue to be used for decades or centuries, while others collect dust, as their music sources become obsolete.  Throughout the last century, millions of wonderful, unique AM radios were produced around the world to proudly broadcast from tables, bookshelves and mantles, yet when was the last time you turned one on? We're dusting off the vintage radio and giving it a chance to sing again.  Introducing the Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speaker.\n\n\u00a0 These beautiful musical relics deserve a chance to shine again.  We're bringing them back to life by replacing their aged electronics with a brand new 8W Bluetooth 4.0 amplifier.  This transforms these obsolete radios into beautiful universal Bluetooth speakers, ready to play any music your heart desires. Mixing old and new not only produces completely unique Bluetooth speakers, it is also environmentally friendly.  As the only new components are the circuit-boards, power cords, and a little wiring, every Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speaker produced is one less vintage radio in landfill and one less new speaker and casing produced.\n\n\u00a0 With an unlimited number of unique styles, there is a Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speaker for every room of your home, office or workshop. Each converted radio comes with a brand new amplifier for reliability and peace-of-mind, while retaining the original speaker for a classic sound. Simply plug it in, turn on your phone's Bluetooth and turn up the tunes! The amplifier runs Bluetooth 4.0, so will work with a huge range of devices.  No special apps needed, just connect and hit play.  \n\n\u00a0 Take your Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speaker with you wherever you chose. Power is supplied via a special USB cable, allowing your new speaker to be powered just about anywhere, via your phone charger, in the car, or add a USB battery bank* and play music anywhere.\u00a0 Anything with a 1.5A or higher USB output will get the tunes cranking. By connecting to your existing battery bank* or charger, we're avoiding making unnecessary batteries and power supplies, making our speakers even more environmentally friendly.\n\n\u00a0 *Battery banks must have an output of 1.5A or higher to succesfully power our bluetooth speakers. Boe Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speakers are the first product range in our effort to breathe new life into beautiful old objects. At Boe we love the look of 1930s to 1970s mantel and tabletop radios, but with their aging electronics and AM only reception we don't have a use for them. Bluetooth speakers are popping up everywhere and we love their convenience, we don't want yet another throw-away electronic device.  We decided to fill two needs with one deed, giving old radios a new life and getting a bluetooth speaker without the waste. Our grand plan is to continue to blur the line between new and old, by developing quality products that meet the same needs as new devices, but with unique style and reduced environmental impact through re-use. We carefully hand pick every radio that we convert. All our converted radios proudly show the battle scars of a life well lived. They have chips or scratches, marks or fading, but they are solid and they are beautiful. Every one tells a story, and with our conversion, every one now has another lifetime to live. We all have a story to tell, so too should our possessions.\n\u00a0 If you want to be one of the first in the world to get your hands on one of our Bluetooth speakers, you are in the right place. Take a look at the speakers shown below, and if one in particular jumps out at you make sure you grab it in the rewards section before someone else does. Remember, no 2 are identical, so if you see something that you love, make it yours. All speakers ship with a USB power cable, making it easy to power them anywhere in the world. Don't see your dream speaker yet? Grab yourself a voucher to put towards the perfect one when it becomes available down the track through our website.  \n\n\u00a0 Love surprises? Pick the 'Surprise Speaker' reward, and not only will you get a discount over the retail price, you will also receive one of the first speakers to be built, delivered to your door, and the style will be a complete secret until you open the box!  \n\n\u00a0 Already have a beautiful old radio collecting dust? If it is of a similar size and style to the ones shown here we can convert it for you. Grab our 'Have your radio converted by Boe' reward, and when the campaign is over you will be able to send your radio to us, we will convert it and return it to you.\n\n\u00a0 Introducing the Big Speaker - Agostino! We're so excited that people are really connecting with our bluetooth speakers, so excited in fact, that we've decided to release their big brother a little earlier.\u00a0 Based on larger, non-portable Big Speakers come with dual functionality.\u00a0 As well as a 20W amplifier, all Big Speakers also come with a new speaker fitted in addition to the original, which can be connected to your home theater for the perfect period looking centre channel. Our goal is to produce a range of products across all fields that blur the line between new and secondhand by offering the best of both worlds.  We want to produce products that are so good that people will want them regardless of their age or environmental credentials, not because of them. Your support will help us to finance the testing, compliance and certification of our beautiful Vintage Radio Bluetooth Speakers. This will help us to offer you more amazing, unique, re-created products in the future.  \n\n\u00a0 All my life I have tinkered with old things, found ways to repair them or re-use them.\u00a0 I have always been fascinated by how things are made, especially those with handmade touches, whether that be pinstriped paint, man-made welds or hand soldered electronics.\u00a0 In an era where almost everything is machine made for efficiency, there is something beautiful about products where no 2 are ever perfectly identical. As a trained designer and engineer, I have spent years finding new ways to make use of old products.\u00a0 With the recent birth of my first child I feel the time is now right to put all of my energy into creating a better world for our generation and the ones following, by re-imagining the re-use and re-creation of products. If you want to follow this journey, please keep an eye on Instagram, Facebook and Builtonenthusiasm.com Boe bluetooth speakers are proudly made in Australia, and are designed to meet Australian legislation.  We are happy to ship our radios worldwide, however please note that we have not undertaken product testing for any specific requirements relating to countries outside of Australia.\n\u00a0 You won't have to wait long to receive your reward with Boe.  We have sample radios built already and have our testing house lined up.  All of our suppliers for parts are lined up and we have access to a great range of donor radios to fulfill Surprise Speaker pledges.  With no overseas manufacturing to undertake, and no tooling to make, we promise you won't be waiting long to get your hands on your reward.\u00a0 Speakers shown in this campaign will be the first to ship, followed by Surprise Speakers.  We promise to fulfill every Surprise Speaker pledge before we make any available to the general public through our website.  As soon as we have radios up on our website we will notify all voucher pledgers to give them first pick of our bluetooth speakers as they become available.  Website retail price is intended to be $280.\u00a0",
  "\u00a0******** UPDATE: STRETCH GOAL 1: \u00a311,000 We hit our initial goal in just 3 DAYS!!! All additional funding will go towards making the project BIGGER, BETTER and with FEWER calories. More cinemas! More add-ons! More everything! Help us reach our new goal of \u00a311,000 and we'll mix and release the soundtrack as a full album, made up of a few classics and a tonne of brand-spanking-new songs. Free to all our backers! \u00a0******** WEDNESDAY IN SPACE is a low-budget sci-fi comedy written and directed by Hudson Hughes. A small diner in the galaxy's armpit is turned into a crime scene after the staff find a man's body lying on the bathroom floor - his head decorating all four walls. Not an uncommon sight for the diner's staff, but this was no ordinary space-sucking citizen - this was a Boogeyman. Traffic warden Lucha Flax is no detective but she's the only one for the job, and possibly the only one who cares. With starving musicians, government spooks, French rebels and increasingly aggressive TV commercials, this will be anything but a normal Wednesday. Wednesday in Space is a laugh-a-minute sci-fi comedy, heavily inspired by 70s space movies but with a unique and twisted sense of humour (or humor, if you're into American comedy). I have been creating comedy films (and stage shows) for several years and in 2019 I decided to push myself and a group of 20 talented friends into the creative unknown - the final frontier, if you'll pardon the pun (please). It took the contents of my piggy bank and a metric ass-load of favours to obtain all the costumes, prop and set required to shoot this crazy film. The space diner was built over the course of a month in my reasonably-sized garage. The film was shot in the space of 7 days, again pardon the pun. The unique blend of improv and sleep deprivation is what lends Wednesday in Space its signature flavour. After the main shoot, it was time for some old-school visual effects using detailed miniatures and compositing techniques. Additionally, the film is broken up by intermittent TV commercials with a variety of whacky presenters, sometimes passive-aggressive and sometimes aggressive-aggressive. These were all shot on the same day and almost entirely improvised. When I started this project I knew I had the tools required to see it through to film festivals, where it has successfully been selected and awarded, but after an early cut received raucous laughter at a private cinema screening I knew WEDNESDAY IN SPACE could have a life beyond the festivals. As a certified 'crowd-pleaser', we plan to take this baby to cinemas in the UK before online streaming services. This is where you come. Just like Ocean's Eleven. You're Matt Damon and I'm George Clooney. And I'm also Brad Pitt. And Don Cheadle. Screw it, I'm all eleven of them and you're Julia Roberts. The point is, we need your help. As explained in the video, the money is split between marketing, distribution and getting the film cinema-ready. Getting an age-rating certificate from the BBFC (the UK's organisation for film classification and censorship) ain't cheap, nor is getting the video and sound in a playable cinema format. Within our marketing budget is the cost of a fancy premiere at one of London's best independent cinemas. You can attend this black-tie event yourself or if you're too far away then look at our pledging options where you'll see the option to join our virtual premiere months before the film reaches streaming services (you can still wear a tux in front of your computer though). Costs also go towards the (might I venture to say:) epic rewards on offer, such as posters, prints, stickers, badges, tote bags and shipping! Lovely, expensive (and included in the pledge price) shipping! Besides the tremendous work of all the cast and crew, we have a dedicated and experienced Marketing & Distribution team that is driving this metaphorical ship full-force through the front wall of a cinema near you. Look at them all. Look how HOT they are. You can always trust hot people. Our Kickstarter is not just aimed at gaining monetary support, we're looking to build a community which includes people who are able to assist with expertise and experience. If you or someone you know thinks they know a thing or two about film distribution, please contact us! Alright, you bunch of dreamboats. Here's the lowdown. We're not charging $200 for a wet napkin with my signature on - I only do that when I need to forge a cheque. We're giving value-for-money rewards to our backers. Finally, follow us on social media to stay up-to-date and share our project with your friends, enemies, frenemies and enefriends.

  "What is Ronald's Little Factory, and who the F is Ronald? In 1976, a top Mormon leader gave an anti \"Self touching\" talk to young men. He likened their reproductive systems to Little Factories. The talk was used for decades to create young obedient Mormons . It was known as \"The Little Factory\" talk. Ronald is a good young Mormon in the year 1989. Like all good Mormon men who turn 19, Ronald is preparing to go on his 2 year mission for the church. But the night before he leaves, \u00a0he becomes tempted to commit the horrible sin of \"Self loving\" his little factory. So he decides to take measures into his own hands and handcuffs his sinful hand to the bedpost. Success...until he can't find the keys. What follows is a crazy satire about Religion, bondage and sex...with oneself. Who are you? Brent Bokovoy was raised in San Diego. He was raised a Mormon and went on a 2 year mission to Seattle. Just like Ronald, Brent was the perfect little Mormon boy...but then he found Rated R movies and it went all downhill from there. Brent is pretty much Ronald...except Brent is probably a lot more awkward. Perhaps YOU can find a little or a lot of Ronald in yourself! How offensive is this to Mormons? The point is not to make fun of Mormons but to have fun with the culture of Mormonism. It is certainly geared towards ExMormons and Post-Mormons but my hope is that active, open minded, Cards of Humanity playing Mormons can find it enjoyable as well. Why Crowdfunding and where will the money go? Ronald's Little Factory is a niche film that will probably not appeal to an ultra wide market, making the film hard to make through a conventional studio. So we are going directly to the fans to help produce the film and in return there are some great rewards! Where will the film be distributed?\u00a0 The plan is to have several theatrical events in Utah. Each event will be hosted by someone in the post-Mormon world and there will be a Q&A after the show with the filmmakers and audience. Soon after the limited theatrical events, the film will be released worldwide for online purchases and rentals. Did someone say rewards? Hell yeah! Check out the rewards (to the right) you receive for pledging and becoming part of the team! The rewards range from receiving a copy of the finished film, invites to events and parties, crazy merchandise, producer credit roles, sponsorship, filming an advertisement for your company and more! Just a couple of the 80's style merchandise mock-ups.",
  "\"Testosterone: It's one hell of a drug\" 'Numbleypeg' isn't high brow. Its meaning isn't shrouded in mystery. It is the story of two brothers, one vintage Randall Knife and how quickly 'sh*t gets out of hand'. 'Numbleypeg' is a short short. We're here for a good time not a long time. The film is funny, occasionally gross, and also completely heartfelt. It's about the weird rivalries and deep understandings that exist between siblings. \u00a0'Numbleypeg' stars Garth Hodgson (Resident Alien, The Twighlight Zone) and Matthew Graham (Heel Kick!, Supernaturals) as two estranged brothers trying to reconnect on a weekend camping trip in the bush. But when a dispute arises between the pair and neither is prepared to compromise, things take a turn for the deadly. 'Numbleypeg' will be shot in one day, using outdoor locations. A production crew of just 8 people will make it happen. All of the crew members will be working for minimum wage, plus expenses. This means we can create something of exceptional quality technically that is far below the market rate of production. In short, the money goes on screen, not in anyones pocket. Also, you can get a sick T-shirt in a choice of colours and sizes.",

  "After years messing around baking in my kitchen, I finally decided to start writing down my (successful) recipes to put together into a cook book. Because I also have a love for art and illustration, hand drawing each page has become my ultimate labor of love. The joy I get from combining all of my interests including pastry, art and graphic design into one huge mega project has been the driving force behind me spending hours in my kitchen baking and creating. While reading this cook book I hope you are pleasantly surprised by all the time and effort I put into its design and take the time to discover all the delicious recipes within.\u00a0 This cook book is completely hand drawn and designed by me, filled with all sorts of recipes from tartlets to eclairs to cupcakes, but with entirely new and unique flavor combinations. Ever tried black sesame and lemon curd together? Or wondered what other colors of sweet potato pies there are? What about making a cupcake filled with \"the other carrot\" and topped with tangy, sweet maple cream cheese frosting? Throughout this cook book you will enjoy the wonderful recipes (all created and baked in my home kitchen and tasted by most of my neighborhood) along with the beautiful and fun artwork decorating each page.\u00a0 \u00a0 This whole process begins with the recipes themselves. I draw inspiration from classic dishes but infuse anything-but-classic flavor pairings into them. This will hopefully \u00a0expose the reader to ingredients they never thought would go so well together and maybe even ones they have never tried or even heard of. After many trials to fine tune my recipe idea, I make the final version and write down all of my steps, ending with a few nice photographs of the bake. I then use these photographs to draw each of the recipes and ingredients and think up a fun name. The drawings themselves are not super fancy: just black ink on white paper. Its after scanning them in that I am able to transform and color them on Adobe Illustrator.\u00a0Armed with a somewhat witty title and all my images, I go about designing the rest of the page and layout then the page is finished.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The timeline for this project is pretty fast paced due to the fact that when I'm excited about a project I go full force into it. I plan on the entire recipe creation and design process to take about 5-6 weeks. The rest of the time is dedicated to working with a publisher to fine tune the book and get it printed! I expect the entire process to be done sometime in July or August at the latest, with books widely available in September.\u00a0 Your generous donations will help make this book a reality. I've decided to divid the budget into two main categories: materials and book (including printing and publishing costs). Materials include all of the ingredients and supplies I go through creating the recipes and will receive about 25% of the funds. The other 3 quarters of the budget will be saved for printing and publishing costs associated with creating, making and marketing the book.\u00a0 \u00a0",
  "Celebrating food and culture, The Recipe Box Project gathers more than 50 passionate chefs and creative vendors to share their recipes in showcasing Vancouver's diverse flavours.\u00a0 The recipes cover a wide range of tantalizing items from breakfast to midnight snacks flavoured by sugar, spice and everything nice! There are even cocktails and concoctions!\u00a0 With 100 recipes, there is something for everyone...including the vegans!\u00a0 \u00a0 Vancouver is a place where people welcome diversity and embrace cultural backgrounds \u2013 these qualities are very well integrated into the food community. But it is only through traveling in different countries around the world that confirms how diverse the food scene really is. Italian, Japanese, Thai, Greek, Arabic, Caribbean, Burmese - name it and you can find it, done well.  When there is a lot to offer, we often expect the quality scale to tip one way or the other. Not here, where, chefs share strong passions toward their roots. Evidently, the level of authenticity for each cuisine is striking. Vancouver is also home for food startups that consistently reinvent, mostly driven by the large amount of \"foodies\" on a constant search for the next it food.\u00a0 Unmistakably a major centre full of gourmet fanatics, passionate chefs and creative vendors blessed with an abundance of fresh Pacific Northwest ingredients, it's no surprise that Vancouver ranks 14th on Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler\u00ae Best Food Cities in the World \u00a0 This ultimate recipe collection features some of the best chefs in the city including celebrity chef, Vikram Vij, California-roll creator, Hidekazu Tojo, mastermind of asian-fare empire, Angus An, upscale \u201chaute Italian\u201d pioneer, Pino Posteraro, and internationally acclaimed chocolatier and pastry chef, Thomas Haas.\u00a0 Restaurant participants include the iconic Caf\u00e9 Medina, Miku, Bauhaus, Torafuku, Havana, Nuba, Kingyo, Earnest Ice Cream, Japadog and many, many more. From casual grub to upscale dining, every contributor engaged in this project is locally acclaimed and a paragon to its genre - many which are well recognized by Van Magazine's Best Restaurant Awards, Georgia Straight's Golden Plates, and a few listed on \"Canada's 100 Best\". \u00a0 The \"box\" is a metaphor for Vancouver\u2019s cultural melting-pot. And, because old-school is the new cool! We all remember grandmother's index-card recipe box - why not bring it back with a modern twist? Cookbooks and big coffee table books are great to look at but people rarely bring them into the kitchen.\u00a0 Keeping functionality and beauty in mind, the box format allows a contemporary design with wooden surface suitable for kitchen space and on book shelves.\u00a0 The recipe cards are water-resistant, beautifully printed on 4\" x 6\" format showcasing drool-worthy photographs along with clear, approachable instructions that will guarantee to inspire home cooks and food enthusiasts alike. A card stand is also included for ease of recipe reading and display.\u00a0 The Recipe Box is the perfect gift for the holidays, fantastic for housewarming and birthdays and great add-on to any foodie's collection. \u00a0 While this project stems from the idea of food and cultural sharing, for the life of The Recipe Box, a portion of its proceeds will go towards MealShare, a platform that partners with many Canadian restaurants to help fight youth hunger. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you've read this far, you must believe in this passion project in one way or another! Thank you so much! It's understandable that not everyone can support with a pledge of dollars. But widely spreading the word is equally helpful in bringing The Recipe Box closer to reality.\u00a0 There will be lots of updates and postings of behind-the-scenes between now and the official launch, so follow along!\u00a0#TheRecipeBoxYVR \u00a0 \u00a0 This project is no one-man job. Deepest gratitude goes to the support from many affiliated chefs, restaurants, friends and family throughout the year-long progress.\u00a0 I especially want to thank the following who have devoted their time and talent in making this campaign possible: Video Producer: Premier Productions Inc.3D Illustrator: Victor KamAuxiliary: Niki Chung,\u00a0Derek Tam",
  "After living in Fishtown, we can tell you that we grew  spoiled. One of the really amazing things about Fishtown is the sheer amount of offerings in such a small radius.  Coffee Houses, ice cream shops, restaurants, bars, bakeries, art galleries, and glorious, GLORIOUS pizza \u2014 all within walking distance!  But every silver cloud has a grey lining. We looked around and realized that the nearest movie theater was a 45-minute walk from home. We decided to drive to a different theater 30 minutes away, and suddenly a Saturday night movie seemed more like a chore than a night out, and a rip-off, rather than a treat.. \n\u00a0 Two movie tickets? \"That will be $30.\"  \n\u00a0 A little something for that sweet tooth? \"$7, please!\"\u00a0 Oh, that salty popcorn made you thirsty? \"Yup, that\u2019s another $6 for a drink.\" There had to be a better way.  Why don\u2019t Fishtown and Kensington have a movie theater of our own? We already have indoor mini-golf and a BYOB ax-throwing place... was a movie theater too much to hope for? After a fair amount of \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if\u2026,  we decided to just DIY this thing. Start with a 1-screen community BYOB movie theater, and grow from there, depending on what the community demands and what our budget can bear.\u00a0 Knowing our audience also means we can provide better service at a more reasonable price point. Most importantly, we can engage our community in a way that the big boys can\u2019t touch\u2014  by treating people like neighbors, friends, and family... not just profit centers.\u00a0 \u00a0 Some of what you can expect to find at Brass Ribbon Cinema:\n\u00a0 These are just a few of the ideas we have to make Brass Ribbon Cinema a Fishtown favorite.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's no place like home!\"\u00a0\u00a0 Like most of Philadelphia, Fishtown is in the midst of a great revitalization. The neighborhood has changed so much even in the past few years. As we scouted potential sites , we kept in mind that we had to find a place that could not only accommodate fully-functional single-screen theater, but also honor Fishtown's history.\n\n\u00a0 Enter Adam Cramer. The owner of Liberty Vintage Motorcycles, resident of Fishtown for over a decade, and Brass Ribbon's future landlord. From his Massive 4000 Square Foot Warehouse on Sepviva St.,  he's seen the neighborhood transform into what it is today. Real estate prices being what they are, he could have sold the garage, closed the shop, and made a tidy sum years ago. However, he was intentional about seeing the space turned into a neighborhood hub. . ...And it started with a Facebook post. We connected with Adam through a community Facebook page. Adam had put up a post looking for a tenant that would make use of half of his Garage in a way that would be fun, and would add value  the neighborhood we call home. It didn't take long for us to fall in love with the space, and after meeting Adam and hearing his story, we knew we had found the perfect location.\n This means that while half of the 4,000 square foot garage will be renovated to accommodate Brass Ribbon Cinema, the other half will remain as a haven for vintage motorcycles\u2014 some of which will be on full display for everyone to enjoy! We are so excited to be working with Adam to create a truly unique movie-going experience. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing is impossible. Even the word itself says 'i'm possible' \" So, we\u2019re turning to our community of neighbors (cue your entrance!), and crowdfunding this project on Kickstarter. In order for us to have this accessible alternative to the big chain theaters, we need your support - both financially and vocally. Make a donation, make your support heard by attending the zoning/committee meetings, share it on social media or just tell your friends what we're up to! Your backing will help us start off strong and lay down a solid foundation for our community movie theater...\u00a0It also helps let us know that we\u2019re not crazy and this is something you actually want to see happen in Fishtown! We understand that making a contribution to a project like this can feel like a big leap. So, we want to make sure we are transparent with your donation. Below you will see a general breakdown of our startup costs, and what your pledge will be supporting.\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Total: $108,500 Those with an eye for detail may have noticed that our budget total is larger than what we intend to raise here.\u00a0 We have reached out to contractors, architects and business consultants to understand the minimum amount needed to open our doors. It is our intention to make up the discrepancy using a combination of private investors, a business loan, and personal funds.\u00a0 \"As a real estate investor and a resident of Fishtown, I feel really fortunate to live in and work in such a vibrant and diverse community. I feel that film is a great medium for finding common ground and engaging new perspectives, something that I see every day in my own neighborhood. What better way to celebrate that than to create a space for it.\" - Miguel \"During my Public Administration studies, I learned how to balance the mission and heart of nonprofits, with the efficiency of a business. I believe movies have the ability to teach us empathy in a powerful and effective way. The carefully crafted stories that are lit up on the big screen can make us feel sad, angry, nostalgic, pity or pure joy, all in the span of hours. The beauty of this is that it gives all of us an equal opportunity to take something good from a story that we may never live ourselves.\" - Mairobi",

  "Eight Beat Measure needs YOU to help them make their full-length album, \"Polarized\" a reality. \u00a0\n**\nHelp the hard working college students of the all-male collegiate a cappella group Eight Beat Measure fund the release of \u201cPolarized\u201d, an all new concept album. Just what is that concept? It's an R&B genre only album featuring some of your favorite and soon to be favorite songs. ** No collegiate a cappella group has produced an all R&B album. Eight Beat Measure would like to take this opportunity to not only convey their music, but also as chance to start a new trend in a cappella helping to define Eight Beat as innovative and once again place them at the forefront of collegiate a cappella. \u00a0 Who is Eight Beat Measure? Well, they are all full-time students at Rochester Institute of Technology, all majoring in non-music fields, who simply come together with a passion for music. Eight Beat Measure is one of the nations top collegiate a cappella groups with a long range of accomplishments: What does this project means to Eight Beat Measure? Eight Beat has been hard at work towards arranging, performing and recording this album. This project is a concept that is very rare in the world of a cappella, a single genre album. Most conventional storybook albums convey an entire year or two of songs sang by a group, this album covers songs from only one genre sang by Eight Beat over the course of two years. What does your money go toward? Any money received from the backing of this project goes toward the final production. This includes the final recording, mixing, editing and mastering. Many hours spent toward perfecting every track, note & rhythm produced by Eight Beat, not including the two years to learn, practice, perfect & record each song. What happens if we exceed our $10,000 goal?\u00a0If this amazing opportunity were to happen Eight Beat plans to use excess money for two amazing opportunities: $15,000-\u00a0This would fund a high school tour for Eight Beat Measure, where they will not only perform for but work with high school students interested in music and spread their passion for music. These students would learn how to arrange, blend when singing, record, vocal percuss and how to network themselves. $20,000-\u00a0Eight Beat would professionally record a music video of one of the tracks off the CD in collaboration with Dangerous Signs, a deaf sign language performance troupe at RIT, bridging deaf culture with a cappella music in a way never done before. How can you help? Simple, just click the \"Back This Project\" button on the top of the page, you know that nice green one. Eight Beat Measure would like to say \"Thank You!\" to everyone who has made their dream become a reality. They could not do it without all of your generous donations.",
  "The MEGAschino Amplifier (or simply \"MEGA\")\u00a0is an audio power amp combining massive headroom with outstanding sonics.\u00a0 The MEGA is offered\u00a0in Stereo and MONO versions.\n\n BRIEF HISTORY We started producing the DAC4800A amplifier in 2006.  It was a pro-sumer type product with a Run/Stand-By toggle button and Power/Clip/Protect/Run LEDs on the front. We later put the LEDs inside (they shine through the lid vent holes) and added a red anodized 3/8\" thick brushed aluminum faceplate.  This was our first Cherry Amplifier \u00ae.  Later, we moved to a simple lineup: Stereo or MONO and Standard or ULTRA.  Several faceplate options were added, like silver, black, and even cherry wood.  We still make these amplifiers today.  The ULTRA versions have 1500W transformers and GOLD WBT posts with improved output filters and double power supply capacitance on the MONO ULTRA version. After years of successful production and great reviews, we introduced the Maraschino Amplifier.  The Maraschino was a new circuit design able to reach 100kHz bandwidth with end-to-end DC coupling for response down to 0Hz and no bass phase shift.  The ground of the amplifier is locked to the preamp (or DAC) ground to eliminate hum and ground noise.  The result?  Customers and pro reviewers alike praise the Maraschino for sonics that go way beyond today's cookie-cutter \"me-too\" module based high-end amplifiers. The Maraschino Amplifier product line grew to include Desktop Maraschino, a new shape for monoblock amplifiers, In-Line Maraschino, amplifiers so light, you can hang them from your speakers, yet so powerful, they can deliver up to 1000W into 1.8\u03a9, and Stereo Maraschino, an integrated amp with front and back inputs plus volume control. Although the Maraschino's power delivery into 4\u03a9 is an admirable 400W (with 60V 1kW power supply), what if you crave even more power with that signature super-clean-and-fast Maraschino sound?  How about more than double the power? CULMINATION Enter the MEGAschino: Maraschino sound with Classic Cherry power ....and so much more. This is the new level of amplification.\u00a0 We combined what we learned from the Maraschino with a few new ideas (years of R&D), allowing higher voltage plus higher current carrying capability. This was no easy feat. The result is simply amazing sound. This graph shows sonic performance versus power output of the Cherry Classic, Maraschino, and new MEGAschino:\u00a0 About the Technology ---- How does this affect the SOUND? The MEGA uses 12 output devices per channel, and the Maraschino uses 4.  This is like comparing a V4 engine to a V12 engine. The result is essentially 3 times the current handling capability. We also developed a superior method for removing spurs in the passband at low levels, thus allowing an even lower \"spike free\" noise floor than Maraschino.\n The huge headroom and DC coupling of the MEGA deliver stunning bass with \"hit you in the chest\" transients.  This amp can deliver serious current (peaks above 50A)!  With a super strong toroidal transformer based power supply and ultra low output impedance into the upper registers, instruments and voices are rendered with unrivaled clarity on even power hungry speakers.  It's like a bottomless pit of super clean power!  Plus, the highs have a silkiness that allows the proper fade to cymbals, and super fast transients are no longer inhibited.  The most surprising thing of all is the performance at low volumes.  You don't need to crank it up to get refined focus and locked-in imaging. The MEGA is capable of a feather touch as well as the brute force of previous \"super amps\". The MEGAschino Upgrade ! Classic Cherry owners can upgrade their amps to MEGAschino level. We do this by replacing the boards. Everything else stays the same, including the transformer and connectors. With the MEGA's even lower output impedance and wider pulse differentials, you can get approximately 10% more power into your speakers from the same power supply. This gives you more \"slam\" for bass dynamics. New MEGAschinos New MEGAs come with black faceplates and 750W transformers.\u00a0 That's per amp, so MEGA MONOs have one 750W transformer per channel while a Stereo MEGA drives two channels with a single 750W transformer.\u00a0 Options include 1500W transformer upgrades and double or quadruple capacitance.\u00a0 Note that quadruple capacitance is only available on the MONO MEGA.\u00a0 We plan to offer a 2000W transformer upgrade in the near future. Early Acclaim Customers and reviewers have already praised the MEGA for it's sound quality.... \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Outrageous detail even at the lowest levels!\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Nick M / Allentown PA \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Best Class-D I've ever heard and probably the best high power amp.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Jack Roberts / The Audio Beatnik \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Nothing makes my Legacies sing like the MEGA.\u00a0 Amazing!\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Brian F / New Port Richey FL \u00a0 \u00a0 \"....it sounded just perfect to me.  Besides the point that I think the MEGAschino and the Tektons are a perfect match.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- John J / Freehold NJ The MEGA has similar sound quality to the Maraschino, with more authority and refinement.\u00a0 There are many reviews of Maraschino and MEGAschino amplifiers HERE. What's Inside? The MEGAschino uses key parts of the Classic Cherry design, such as a large toroidal transformer and a built-like-a-tank 16 gauge steel chassis. The MEGA board set consists of a motherboard and one or two channel boards.\u00a0 The channel boards are oriented vertically.\u00a0 Large power capacitors (up to 8) are mounted to the motherboard.

  "A twist on a classic effect, with plenty of delay time and endless tweakability. Our high-quality digital hardware platform allows you to experiment like never before. Create sounds ranging from subtle echos, to mind-bending reversed multi-delays. Modulation Mode\u00a0 Four modulation types including\u00a0volume, low-pass, high-pass and resonant filtering. Choose from three modulation sub-modes, allowing you to decide where the modulation occurs; at signal input (PRE), before feedback (MOD) or after feedback (POST). Control modulation rate/speed (rightmost knob) and depth (middle knob), turning the rate knob fully clockwise allows you use the filters without modulation. This is especially useful in 'POST' modulation mode, where you can repeatedly feed the sound through the filter. ProTip: In 'PRE' modulation mode, you can turn the decay knob fully counter-clockwise to use the pedal for modulation/tremolo without delay! Multi Mode A delay with multiple copies of your repeats. Real-time pattern creation and sixteen customizable repeat patterns. Three multi-mode playback settings including standard, reverse and octave. Allowing you to change the way individual repeats sound. In Multi Mode, the middle knob allows you to select the repeat pattern. The cluster of four LEDs shows the pattern you are selecting. ProTip For Geeks: The pattern LED arrangements represent binary numbers 0000 - 1111.\u00a0 Pattern 0 (or 0000) is real-time creation mode. When this pattern is selected, you can use the black button to tap your pattern between delays. Swell In any mode, holding the tap footswitch will swell the decay setting. Releasing the footswitch will allow the decay to decrease until it settles back to its original setting. This feature is great for emphasizing repeats, and creating monstrous walls of sound. While swell mode is engaged, the middle four LEDs will indicate the swell level. Swell attack and decay times can also be configured in our MIRAGE Tools application. Tap Tempo Dial in your delay time using the tap switch or an external footswitch.\u00a0 Expression Control and External Switch The MIRAGE features 3.5mm expression and switch inputs. The function of each of these inputs can be configured on-the-go, defaults can also be set up in the MIRAGE Tools application. An expression pedal can be mapped to any of the top 3 knobs or the mix control.\u00a0This is accomplished by holding down the middle button and selecting using the decay knob. The top three LEDs indicate which knob the expression input is controlling. The external switch can be mapped to any of the bottom 3 switches/buttons.\u00a0This is accomplished by holding down the middle button and selecting using the rate|var knob. The bottom three LEDs indicate which switch will be controlled externally. MIRAGE Tools Web-Application We've developed a simple web application that allows you to create and edit patterns, and modify a variety of the MIRAGE's core settings. This application works in conjunction with our firmware update software. Some available settings: MIRAGE Tools will continue to be developed after this campaign, and MIRAGE owners are encouraged to give feature recommendations.",

  "Hello and thank you for taking the time to read our Kickstarter campaign!\u00a0 We are looking for help to finish a wonderful short film 'Numb'. ALL money raised will go towards the edit, grade, sound design, score, and delivery.\u00a0 We are using this short to raise awareness for a feature film (also called Numb), so please dig deep and become a part of this wonderful project! The Story \u00a0 Numb is an intimate portrayal of a struggling father-son relationship in the face of loss. Through the mix of comedy and pathos, Numb is able to explore a complex subject in a way that is more realistic to life and our personal experiences of grief. The Project \u00a0 Numb is to be a 12-minute extract from Ali Hughes' feature script (also titled Numb). We treated it as a stand-alone short film to give viewers and potential investors a chance to view the world Ali has created. Shot at four beautiful locations in the Cotswolds over two days, our lead cast members (Philip Jackson & Rory Fleck Byrne) worked tirelessly with director Natasha Jatania and twenty additional cast and crew members to ensure the story maintained its charm from script to screen.\u00a0 What we need from you is help getting it over the finishing line. We want to do our project justice and make sure it is edited, graded, and delivered professionally. We have already done all the filming and it is ready to move into the next phase! \u00a0 Thank you so much for taking the time out to read our Kickstarter, love all the Numb Cast & Crew.",

  "I am excited about this project because I feel like I have a new love in my spirit this time. \u00a0I recently went out of the country and traveled to Athens, Greece to be with a closed friend for 12-days. \u00a0It was mine first time visiting an International country. \u00a0I could feel God's spirit around me tugging at my heart to pick up my work. \u00a0I also want to contribute something to my late grandson Titan who has been deceased for about 2 years. \u00a0I am inspire to keep moving in pushing my dreams into reality. What I am raising is, the funds that I need to help me fund for my books and magazines of getting them printed, published, book signing, traveling to speak at conferences and other things. \u00a0It is to help me get connected and network with others who are successful in the world. \u00a0 Why do I care about it, is important to me and I have a passion for wanting to help those who have lost hope in their life. \u00a0I am the only one pushing my dream and believing that the work that I am doing will someday be great among all people in the world. \u00a0Although, we may be scarred but not forgotten because WE let others know that God loves us. \u00a0My work and projects have great potential and I see it in myself. How do I plan to make it happen, is through my websites and social media of letting others know that my work will be ready for them to see and read. \u00a0I will also begin to make homemade Butterscotch pie to help increase my funds. Last thing look into taking out a personal loan to help pay for expenses. Who I am, is a Writer, Author, Songwriter, Movie Script and an Visionary with a passion for those who have been scarred but not forgotten. \u00a0Let them know that there is still hope in their scars. \u00a0Encourage those who have went through death, tragedy, violence, hatred and hopelessness. \u00a0Become a Better Me and You. The rewards are great because God said that my latter years shall be greater. \u00a0If I work my faith around my projects and push my dream into reality. \u00a0I just learn to work hard and keep pushing my dream into reality. \u00a0I have plenty of books and magazines to write. \u00a0I have a story to tell to those movie producers and others. \u00a0The purpose in my life has great reward and others will begin to see it as well. \u00a0Because I do have what it takes to be successful in this world. \u00a0I have swag in my style and different from the rest. It's within me.\u00a0 In addition, Swag In My Style started out to be a book, but I decided to put it in a magazine because magazines are easier to read and short. \u00a0Most magazines issues come out monthly so it is easy to keep up with my work and projects. My project was uploaded but slides may not be in order. \u00a0I apology for not having a photographer because I did the work myself. Please polish it up for me. If you need details please let me know and I will walk you through it. I hope you enjoy magazine and books and other things to come!",
  "'The recipes here are an ethereal mix of hearty and delicate, of simple and complex\u2026 I could eat any and all.'Shaun Hill, Food writer, broadcaster and Michelin-starred chef/patron at The Walnut Tree Inn I've written my first cookbook for 20 years and I think it's a cracker. It's a collection of the very best recipes from both my cafes and my home life. The best of the best. I'd like your help to get it published. Thanks to all the wonderful backers Bill's Kitchen has now reached its initial Kickstarter funding target of \u00a315,000. If we can get to \u00a320,000 before 31st May then I'll know that the interest in it is even stronger than I'd hoped for and I'll increase the print run. I created my first restaurant  \u2018The Place Below\u2019 in the crypt of St Mary-le-Bow \u00a0in 1989, followed by Caf\u00e9 @ All Saints, Hereford (1997), The Refectory at St David\u2019s Cathedral (2005) and the Michaelhouse Caf\u00e9, situated in St Michaels Church in Cambridge (2008). My previous 2 books (Food From The Place Below and Feasts From The Place Below) have been much loved and have sold between them around 20,000 copies and are still selling today. But my cooking has moved on and I'm excited and delighted to have the opportunity to write another cookbook with everything that is most delicious from my life of food over the last 20 years. Having been a vegetarian for 10 years, for the last 20 years my cooking and the menus in my cafes have been thoroughly omnivorous. In Bill's Kitchen you'll find recipes for pulled brisket and rabbit with cider and mustard alongside roast aubergine ratatouille with spiced chickpeas and lentil, leek and parmesan bake.\u00a0 And throughout the book you'll find a commitment to local sourcing and attention to provenance - indeed there's a chapter devoted to this subject. Whenever we recruit a new manager at the cafes I take them to visit the Tudge family's pig farm where we source all our bacon, sausages and ham. Our goat's cheese and apple juice come from local producers in Cambridge and Herefordshire. We only use free range chicken and it all comes from beautiful Springfield farm near Leominster. These connections inform my cooking and this cookbook. But I don't want any of this beautiful, carefully sourced food to go to waste. So there's a chapter on leftovers and another on 'family weekday suppers'. Both chapters focus on delicious strategies for using what happens to be in your fridge. The decision to crowdfund the publication of the book has been incredibly liberating. It's meant that I have complete control over what the book is like rather than having to negotiate with a publisher. So it will be a top quality hardback with coloured cloth place-markers and with each copy shrink-wrapped to make sure that they reach you in tip-top condition.\u00a0 Financing the project this way means that I've been able to build my own team. Michael Phillips has created an elegant, appealing and practical design. Jay Watson has taken tinglingly good photos that bring every recipe to life. And Marianne Ryan, the editor, has made sure that the text and recipes are all clear and consistent and that the index makes it a great book to use. The recipes are all clearly laid out. Each one is beautifully illustrated and and introduced in an entertaining and informative way. It will be a book that will be a pleasure to use. Like my first two books I'm hoping that you will still be cooking from a food-splattered copy in 20 years time. Here's a Taster so you can get a feel for the style of the book\u00a0 http://www.billscafes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/A-Life-of-Food-TASTER-low-resolution.pdf\u00a0 The money raised by this campaign will go to printing the book, paying the editor and some of the photography costs. The designer and myself will only be paid out of subsequent books sales after the book is published. If we can raise more than the target amount then that will be a clear sign that demand for the book is high and we'll increase the print run. \u00a0",
  "It's a way to turn your kitchen into an adventure zone! Cooking with Dice\u00a0is like a traditional tabletop role playing game, but it comes with a delicious twist. You take on the role of a chef-adventurer, and cook your way out of trouble... in real life... in your own kitchen.\u00a0 Whether you're looking for a way to make your friendly game night more delicious, or a way to make your family dinnertime more fun... we've got you covered.\u00a0 Neither have we! That's why we created it! Cooking with Dice combines the best parts of an RPG with real-life cooking. You're presented with a set of character sheets, a scenario, a selection of formulas, roll tables, and a scoring system that allows you to level up  your characters.\u00a0You can play solo, cooperatively, or competitively with friends and family.\u00a0 On the contrary - The Acid Test is all ABOUT appetizers.\u00a0It's the first book in the Cooking with Dice\u00a0series, and includes at least 140 pages of scrumptious content by Jennifer Howlett and delectable illustrations by Yuribelle. We're hoping you'll love it and will beg us to create more books.\u00a0 You could say that this book will be the ACID TEST for the whole Cooking with Dice concept.\u00a0 Hehe.\u00a0 Sorry. Puns are my weakness.\u00a0 We'd like to use the Cooking with Dice series to break some of the basic assumptions about cooking. In this case, the assumption is, \"Cooking requires heat.\"\u00a0 In The Acid Test, you're tasked with helping a pair of acid dragons to impress their friends and neighbors with a legendary cocktail party. But there's a catch: they want to feature appetizers cooked with acid, rather than fire.\u00a0 No need for an oven or stove - you'll be using acidic ingredients like vinegar and lemon juice to take the place of heat (though you might use the microwave here or there to speed things up a bit.) You'll be using acid to 'cook' a variety of foods, and will be learning a bit about food chemistry along the way! Your goal is to use your superlative cooking skills to blow the socks off of the dragons that hired you. It's going to take some effort, though. These dragons aren't easy to please. \u00a0 \u00a0To help you on your quest, you're equipped with ten easy-to-follow formulas (click for photos): No No No... not ten recipes - ten FORMULAS!\u00a0 Each of the ten formulas comes with multiple roll charts to help you create your own unique recipes.\u00a0You can use our roll charts to swap out key ingredients to make THOUSANDS of dishes from each formula.\u00a0 Each formula includes information about the time to complete the dish, the quantity created, the equipment required, the components needed, steps to completing the dish, tips for success, and rolling tables to substitute key ingredients.\u00a0\u00a0 Check out our Quickles formula (click to enlarge image): \u00a0 This is the simplest formula in the book - they get more complex as you go up in levels.\u00a0 Yes! And eating it too! There are lots of 'tabletop' games that incorporate food themes. This is not that. Cooking with Dice is a 'kitchen' game that incorporates RPG elements.\u00a0 Think of it as a Counter-top Role Playing Game. Or maybe a LERP - a Live Eating Role Playing game. That's not really part of this game, but if it helps you get into character, we fully support you. Please send videos.\u00a0 There are eight base characters in the book, each based classic RPG character types, combined with the traditional Brigade de Cuisine in a French kitchen. (click to enlarge image) \u00a0 From left to right: The Book includes a character sheet for each one of them. (click to enlarge image) \u00a0 \u00a0Each character's description and special ability is shown on the character sheet, along with places to record your progress in the story.\u00a0 Each time you cook a recipe using one of the formulas, you earn points that help you move from the rank of Plongeur (dishwasher) to Chef de Cuisine (the head chef). The more adventurous you are with your recipes, the faster you climb the kitchen ladder.\u00a0 \u00a0 It's up to you to score your dishes and to determine whether they were a success. If you're playing the competitive version of the game, you can also vote on a favorite dish.\u00a0 After each dish, depending on how you do, you might be awarded with a chest of gold, or be chased to the edge of the world by an angry she-dragon.  Each formula contains a new challenge, with more opportunities to level up your character. Eventually, when you reach the status of Chef de Cuisine, you'll feel the innate satisfaction of mastering a skill.\u00a0 More importantly, you can rub your success in the face of your friends and loved ones.\u00a0 Cooking with Dice is a perfect family-friendly activity. You can compete or work together to achieve your goals.\u00a0 If you've been looking for a way to get your kids excited about cooking, this could be your answer. With just a few game sessions, we absolutely guarantee* that anyone who plays Cooking with Dice will become highly skilled master chef with their own TV cooking show.\u00a0 *absolutely not a guarantee.\u00a0 The game mechanics and formulas have been created and tested, and the book has been written and illustrated, but we need some help to pay for layout and printing costs. We've also budgeted for marketing costs, including showing off the book at conventions. If the Kickstarter goes really well, we'd love to add extra content to the book, and print it in color instead of black and white. It would also be awesome to create some Cooking with Dice themed accessories! As Head Gnome-Master for Adventure Scents, Jennifer Howlett has put most of this project together, but she's gotten help from her husband and two gnome-younglings. They've gotten to do a LOT of play-tasting, which can be both a blessing and a curse.\u00a0 We've also gotten some help from our friends over at Battlebards, who offered to donate some of their fantastic audio tracks.\u00a0Their tavern keeper voice-overs are hilarious! If you have a game- or cooking-related company and would like to support us with merchandise\u00a0donations, please message us. \u00a0 We're pretty sure that no one has done anything like this before. But we like doing things that no one has done before. That's why we Kickstarted Adventure Scents two years ago.\u00a0 \u00a0Remember? Smell-o-vision for games? You can find more information on the Adventure Scents webpage. Yep! People like you helped us to launch our business. We've been growing ever since, and now have over 60 scent special effects to enhance your games.  You're welcome!\u00a0 Now that we've made games more fun for your nose, we thought we'd give your taste buds some action. The first cookbook has been written, illustrated, and 'play-tasted' by a group of adventure-chefs. It's ready to publish, but we need help printing and marketing it.\u00a0That's where you come in! You can help by backing our project.\u00a0 In return, we'd offer these fabulous rewards packages: ...and as we reach our stretch goals, you'll get even more with your reward packages! We like your enthusiasm! Any funds beyond the initial $2,500 will be funneled into creating more books in the series. In addition, we've set the following stretch goals: \u00a0 The fog of war will clear as we explore the stretch goals together! We'll get your books printed out and shipped out to you ASAP. (Shipping is free within the USA!) We've built in some time to add in backer recipes and upgrade to color if necessary before we go to press.\u00a0 Once we've shipped all of the rewards, we'll be able to get to work on the SECOND book in the series. We're hoping our backers will help us to choose the most delicious theme.\u00a0 You can check out the Cooking with Dice website, or follow us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.\u00a0 You can find more whimsical illustrations from Yuribelle on her Instagram page.\u00a0 You should also check out the other fantastic games created by folks at the Indie Game Alliance! \u00a0",

  "This is the true value of a professionally produced product, and the practicality and environmental friendliness achieved by the town factory's rigorous technology! [Natural Maintenance] Brushing with just water, using natural materials that are friendly to the camp environment! [Ultimate finish] Stainless steel x a hard shell made of special materials inside, sturdy and durable! You care about outdoor brushing and hygiene, don't you? \"I'm going camping and I want to brush my teeth properly when I go to bed!\" \"I forgot to bring toothpaste, but I want to brush my teeth and feel better!\" \"I don't want to throw away my disposable toothbrush, I want to be environmentally friendly!\" An all-in-one new feeling toothbrush set that solves such problems We are concerned about the selection and processing of materials. * \u00a0The inside of the housing is made of special materials. I want you to value oral care even when you are outdoors Toothbrush set specially designed and developed for unlikely outdoor scenarios Very easy to use 1. Turn the tip of the box and remove the toothbrush 2. Rinse your mouth, water the brush and brush your teeth 3. After brushing, rinse your mouth with water 4. Drain the toothbrush and put it back in the box Here's all of it. You can easily use it in outdoor scenes and in style! The first thing that comes to mind is the ease of use of the outdoors and the importance of the environment! Because the planner also likes camping, we thought whether we could make a good and environmentally friendly product. Use of plant resources with low environmental load I think most of the toothbrushes used in the world are made of plastic. We've boldly solved the plastic problem with toothbrushes! \"Is there a good alternative to plastic?\" The answer I chose was \"bamboo\". Brushes made of castor oil The brush part uses castor-derived plant resin derived from castor seeds. Soft, colorless and transparent hair is the same as nylon, characterized by little variation in the feeling of use. Castor oil has been used as a cosmetic and soap since ancient times. Contribute to curbing global warming and marine pollution Because plastics tend to produce greenhouse gases when burned and are difficult to break down by natural forces, plastic waste will continue to drift when it reaches the sea. A toothbrush made from bamboo is less likely to produce greenhouse gases. The handle part also returns to nature due to the power of microorganisms, so it does not lead to ocean pollution. By simply replacing plastic with bamboo, you can make a difference to the global environment. The secret of smoothness, catalyst coating It is an artisan crafted toothbrush that is coated on each bristle tip with a special catalyst for stain removal and anti-staining properties. This coating agent consists mainly of water, which is not only gentle on the body but also has an extremely low environmental load. Brushing with water removes the stain component and is expected to reduce the adhesion of stain to the teeth and keep the mouth fresh. I try to use only water instead of toothpaste. Visit the campground at any time Surrounded by the magnificent view of the early morning Watching the bonfire at night While gazing up at the stars Feel the thrill of brushing your teeth while surrounded by nature You can experience the comfort of toothpaste while camping outdoors. Put in Specially treated suede fabric is applied in special cases. The fabric is specially treated to keep the toothbrush hygienic. Simply put the toothbrush into the special case and put it into the special case for hygienic cleaning. Hygiene management is simply put in. We are surrounded by many stainless steel products, such as cutlery and pots and pans. Stainless steel is a familiar metal that is closely related to daily life. It has excellent properties such as toughness, rust resistance, heat resistance and beauty. I chose stainless steel to take advantage of good design! Easy to maintain, can be used in the outdoor environment, not easy to get dirty. Hope you can use it well for a long time Surprise!? Eco-friendly stainless steel Stainless steel is a very environmentally friendly metal. It does not rust easily, does not become scrap even at the end of the metal's life, and can be virtually recycled. Stainless steel is expected to be used as a resource for the next generation. Anyway, as a companion that can be with you for a long time! We challenge all outdoor toothbrush sets, including processing, to The skill of skilled craftsmen, apparently playing a fine that machines can not do, the sensitivity to the product and a commitment to quality that does not cut corners on details.

  "New names, new jobs, new lives, new husbands...? Two gay men entering a witness protection program find themselves \u201cmarried\u201d to help hide their identities from the dangerous people who want them dead.\u00a0 An Odd Couple for the 2020s. To create the complete first season of a six episode, laugh-out-loud-funny LGBTQ comedy streaming TV series that will entertain audiences from the opening scene and make them clamor for season two! Help us realize our vision. We have the actors, we have the crew, we have the first season, six-episode script--written by the son/father comedy team of Jason T. Gaffney and Ed Gaffney (The Perfect Wedding, Analysis Paralysis)--and we have that incredible Holy Grail of film and TV production: Distribution with Dekkoo! Because of that, we have most of the money we need for this more ambitious project. With your help, we can raise the balance of the budget needed to put together something that you (and we) will love. A kick-ass, laugh-out-loud-funny and (romantic!) comedy series with the highest quality writing, performances, and production, at a fraction of the cost of a typical Hollywood TV show. No excuses, no compromises. We are in pre-production now with filming scheduled for April, 2020, in California, just outside of LA. Post-production will take place immediately after the twelve-day shoot, and we expect to be streaming as a Dekkoo Original by the end of the year. We've produced LGBTQ features, similar to this, four times before. Our first two low-budget features, a romantic comedy called The Perfect Wedding, and a thriller called Russian Doll, were both distributed by Wolfe Releasing. Our third feature, Analysis Paralysis,\u00a0is streaming on Dekkoo, and available to rent and purchase via Amazon, iTunes, and Google Play. We're finishing up post-production for our fourth feature, Out of Body, with a film festival release planned for later this year. We know what it takes to succeed and we plan to do it again with Marriage of Inconvenience. The funds we raise in this campaign will go directly to things you will see on the screen: set design, artistic design, additional crew, as well as lighting and sound. The script was donated, the producers and directors are working for free, the SAG actors are working essentially for minimum wage. We appreciate anything you can do to help us, and we will treat your contributions with the care and respect they deserve. We've set our funding goal pretty low, and we'd love to crush it. In our wildest dreams, we'd raise enough to hire even more additional crew to lighten our production team's heavy load. At small or LARGE and My Pet Hippo Productions, we think the world is a far more diverse and interesting place than Hollywood would have us believe. Our mission is to create high quality, exciting, and entertaining movies and TV shows featuring a universe where: The six-episode script for season one of Marriage of Inconvenience was written by Jason T. Gaffney and Ed Gaffney. They are a son/father comedy writing team who have also written\u00a0the California Comedy Series of m/m romance novellas as well as the screenplay for 2018's Analysis Paralysis, and 2011's The Perfect Wedding. An Odd Couple for the 2020s. Franklin is an even-tempered English professor who prides himself on his attention to detail in every area of his carefully structured life. Owen is a street-smart dropout with anger issues, forced into a life of crime against his will. About the only thing Franklin and Owen have in common is that they're gay. Until they end up living together in the witness protection program, with the new identities of Mr. and Mr. Fulton. Now they have something else in common: they can\u2019t stand each other. Marriage of Inconvenience. For better, or worse. Way worse. Producer/Writer/Director/Actor Jason T. Gaffney (Owen) has appeared as Gavin in The Perfect Wedding, as Tyler in Analysis Paralysis, and as Henry in Out of Body. Jason's Marriage of Inconvenience co-star, David Allen Singletary (Franklin) has appeared as Carl in Out of Body, and as Philip in Russian Doll. Our experienced production team is thrilled to be working together again to make Marriage of Inconvenience after the success of Out of Body, Analysis Paralysis,\u00a0Russian Doll, and The Perfect Wedding. The Perfect Wedding premiered with sold-out screenings at the Sarasota Film Festival. It went on to screen at the Spokane International Film Festival, the Long Island Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, and the Garden State Film Festival where it won the best comedy feature film. Russian Doll won the Audience Award at qFlix Worcester. Both films are distributed by Wolfe Releasing. Analysis Paralysis won Festival Favorite at Cinema Diverse in Palm Springs, and went on to screen for three weeks at the Palm Springs Cultural Center. It's currently available for rental and purchase via Amazon, iTunes, and Google Play, and is streaming via Dekkoo. While most of our rewards are digital, a few of our rewards are hard copy books and DVDs. Signed material (other than Jason's or Suz's books) will be autographed by Jason T.

If you're someone who believes that it's never too late to go after your dreams in life, big or small, then this film is for you.

So while it sounds exciting that we shot a film, what we really need help with right now is getting this film finished and out there to the world. Be assured that your help will go toward a product of the highest caliber.\u00a0 We have a positive, absurdly fun, heartwarming, and meaningful story here and we would like to share it with the world. Here's what your donation will help cover: About a decade ago, I was accepted into an artist residency abroad in Italy. While there, I was making strides towards working in feature films - a lifelong dream of mine. When my father was diagnosed with cancer I put those plans on hold and returned stateside to be closer to him.\u00a0 When creating Songs for a Sloth, both co-writer Richard Hollman and I had similar feelings - like we lost our way over the years - and we wanted to make a film that discussed this theme. I didn\u2019t realize how cathartic the process was going to be though. While I was happy to get to express some of the emotions I had over the years through the protagonist, the act of creating the film itself proved to have the real power for me. I\u2019ll never forget that feeling I had the morning after we wrapped. While previously focusing on how slowly it was taking me to take the next steps in my career, at this moment I only felt gratitude that the first step was finally taken.\u00a0 While we approached this topic overall with levity, I\u2019m also hoping that the audience is moved enough by the story that they take inventory of some of their own dreams that may have been sitting dormant for years, and that watching the film inspires them to once again pursue the goals in life that make them happiest. It's never too late, even if we get there slowly. Also, the other bit of inspiration is that I hang out with talking sloths all the time, so that\u2019s probably worth mentioning as well. -Bradley Hasse\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
  "MIDDLEMEN is an episodic, two-hander, comedy that depicts two young 'everyday' men struggling to navigate a world that has quickly upped its game. There's much out there that addresses important and timely issues, and rightly so. But the majority of it is sincere, hard-hitting, 'worthy' and dare we say 'serious'.\u00a0 Not with MIDDLEMEN. MIDDLEMEN's protagonists Sam and Rich sincerely try but often fail, to understand modern expectations when it comes to political correctness and contemporary issues. The episodes cover everything from gender fluidity, #metoo, to race, to veganism. But rather than simply watch these characters debate, we see their relationship evolve and have them experience the themes and issues they discuss.\n\n \u00a0This is a warm, quietly provocative, compassionate, funny portrayal of normal guys thrust into the centre contemporary 'hot topics'. Written and created by comedian/screenwriter Lewis Charlesworth. Starring Jon Massey and Lewis Charlesworth. Watch our pilot scene, HORNY (below).\u00a0 Hopefully, this reflects the standard we looking to surpass. (5 minutes long) We have lofty dreams for the project. We want to take an incredible script and create something that could stand up against your favourite television sitcoms.\u00a0 Filmmaking is not a cheap process; working with the best collaborators costs money. We know this. Luckily we have some incredible supporters who believe in MIDDLEMEN and who are willing to work at a reduced rate. If we raise \u00a31000 we will be able to fund the production of three episodes.\u00a0 It will cover the costs of hiring industry-leading: filmmaking, cinematography, equipment hire, location hire, sound recording, editing, colour grading.\u00a0 In order to get the project complete, both Lewis and Jon will not be getting paid. But this is more than a labour of love. It's a project that has a huge amount of potential and a concept that has been road-tested in front of very receptive audiences. Please make a pledge today so you can be part of our exciting journey to the screen! Lewis Charlesworth Lewis is a playwright/screenwriter/actor/director from the North of England. He has written and directed a number of scripts that have appeared at various theatres and film showcases across the UK, such as The Lowry and Home Cinema/Theatre.\u00a0 His work is largely\u00a0dialogue-driven comic satires, which consistently receive critical acclaim. Highlights include: being longlisted for the 2018 Lancaster playwrighting prize and being nominated\u00a02 years in a row at the Greater Manchester Fringe Festival. Once for Best Comedy \"Cheaters: A Play About Infidelity\" and once for Best Drama for \"The Greek\". \u201cI highly recommend catching the show before it closes\u201d \u00a0\u2013 North West End\u00a0 \u201cOn this evidence, Charlesworth\u2019s transition from comedian to playwright has been a success\u201d \u2013 Manchester Theatre Awards.\u00a0 \u201cCharlesworth has a knack for characterization and impeccable dialogue\u201d \u2013 Talawa Theatre. \u201cThe Greek was a real high point to end on. An honest, funny and compassionate script, coupled with three pitch-perfect performances, made for an enjoyable, thought-provoking and surprisingly hopeful piece of theatre.\u201d \u2013 Shewolf reviews \u201cIn the current period of overheated intolerance and mud-slinging, the gentle but very funny approach taken in\u00a0The Greek\u00a0is a welcome breath of fresh air.\u201d \u2013 British Theatre Guide Jon Massey Jon trained at the Independent School of Actor Training. Since 2018 he has regularly worked in theatre, film and radio. Highlights include three productions with collaborator Lewis Charlesworth A Quiet Drink (Dukes Theatre / The Lowry), Belief in Christmas (King's Arms) and FLUID (HOME).\u00a0 He most recently played Ryan in ENTER ANDROMEDA (BBC), Ben in the Mercy Seat, Gus in the Dumb Waiter (Hope Mill Theatre) and had a guest-starring alongside Freddie Flintoff (BaByliss). Mat Johns Mat is a freelance writer, director, cam op / DP\u00a0and editor\u00a0based in Manchester, UK. Mat's narrative films have been selected by film\u00a0festivals around the world, and have been featured on film websites such as\u00a0shortoftheweek.com.\u00a0 Mat is currently in post-production on a BFI funded short film called INERTIA which he has written and directed. So why do we want to make this series? Well once it's produced we want to distribute it far and wide. We will submit it to numerous relevant film festivals across the world and submit it to our TV and film production companies.\u00a0 We believe this story is fresh and funny enough to grab the attention of influential people out there, and this deserves to be seen on a large platform.",
  "I am a self-published author who writes philosophical memoirs, poetry, and short stories. This project includes all of these categories and is sure to broaden your perspectives \u2014 If you are a lover of literature and enjoy having your brain tickled, this is the book for you!\u00a0 Notable parts of this book:\u00a0 Poetry: Beneath the Floorboards I say, do not you hear that sound? The sound from down the hall? You answer me not, still sleeping, of course And I lay and think abroad About all of those times I had looked around And thought to myself, what a life That I should hear from down the hall A voice break through the night. Philosophy:\u00a0 Whatever happens in the boundless worlds around you, you will always be a part of it. Beyond our bodies is a state of apprehension greater than anything you have imagined. It does not have to be ethical, only individual. Love will come. Alas, this is how the world goes round. Love will come again. It\u2019s kind of odd that way, isn\u2019t it?

He wants to work outdoors and be close to nature. Meanwhile, he thinks it\u2019s important to have his last will and testament drawn up. But his highly dramatic actress girlfriend thinks he must be dying and that he is just too brave to tell anyone. The rumor spreads and soon everyone he knows\u2014and some he doesn\u2019t\u2014are crowded in to his small apartment to say their last farewells. During my Kickstarter campaign for the Henry Fool Trilogy in 2017 I suggested I would also include in that boxed-set edition a documentary film reflecting on my life and career. This was to be called, Where To Land. But I could not do it. I am not a gifted documentary filmmaker and I'm not crazy about writing my autobiography either. However, I am not bad at making up stories! So I started making up a story about a guy, kind of like me, and what he thinks about. Specifically\u2014what he thinks he should do with the rest of his life. I'm sixty-years-old now and have been making films professionally for thirty of those years. I do sometimes wonder if I want to continue\u2014even though I know it\u2019s the only thing I can do halfway well. But might there not be other ways of engaging with the world and continuing to learn\u2014even new ways of supporting myself? The unbelievable truth of it all is: one keeps changing. I'm asking myself the same questions I asked at twenty: What do I want to be? How do I want to achieve that? When\u2014if ever\u2014will I know I've arrived? Where will I land? As I thought about these things, the story became a series of portraits of the different people our hero, Joseph Fulton, knows and loves: his girlfriend, Muriel, who is a famous television actress eager for some deeper artistic commitment; his friend Eric who is an aging rocker concerned with putting his daughter through graduate school; his college age niece, Veronica; his ex-wife, Clara, who is still his best friend; his lawyer, Laura; his 100-year-old friend, the philosopher, Elizabeth; and others\u2026\u00a0 I think it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve written.\u00a0 But don't take my word for it. My good friend and long time collaborator, Bill Sage, who will play Joe Fulton says: \u201cWow! I\u2019m absolutely blown away by this script. It\u2019s a brilliant symphony of hilarious and heartbreaking love and friendship.\u201d I cannot improve upon that except to add that Robert Burke, who will play the cemetery\u2019s chief groundskeeper, Leonard, texted: \u201cexquisite,\u201d and left it at that.\u00a0 Elina Lowensohn, who will play the remarkably well preserved 100-year-old philosopher, Elizabeth, wrote from Paris: \u201cOh Hal! I am so, so impressed. So moving, wise, always extremely funny, bright and witty. And what I love also is that it is filled with generosity and humbleness towards those who might read it and, later, watch it. It draws such an intimate picture of who, for instance, Hal might be right now\u2014the workingman, the working artist. Perhaps a picture of us all\u2026\u201d Parker Posey (the one and only Fay Grim), who will play Laura, Joe\u2019s lawyer, texted: \u201cI only needed a glance and I\u2019m in! xo!\u201d Finally, Tatiana Abracos (the one and only Girl From Monday) who will play the hysterically dramatic Muriel: \u201cShe is very lovely! I think she is brilliant. This is all very real about people\u2019s feelings and emotions. I just feel it is well done, Padre!! OMG and in the end they are singing in the apartment and ordering food delivered! Amazing!\u201d Thank you all!

Il souhaite travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur et \u00eatre proche de la nature. Simultan\u00e9ment, il pense qu\u2019il est important de faire r\u00e9diger son testament. Mais sa petite amie, une actrice pour le moins tr\u00e8s expressive, se persuade qu\u2019il est mourant mais aussi trop courageux pour en parler \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un. La rumeur se r\u00e9pand et rapidement, toutes les personnes que Joe conna\u00eet \u2013 ansi que d\u2019autres qu\u2019il ne conna\u00eet pas -, se rassemblent dans son appartement pour faire leurs adieux. En 2017, durant ma campagne Kickstarter pour la trilogie Henry Fool, j\u2019ai \u00e9mis l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9ventuellement inclure dans le coffret un documentaire portant sur ma vie et ma carri\u00e8re. Ce documentaire devait s\u2019intituler Where To Land. H\u00e9las, je n\u2019ai pas pu le r\u00e9aliser. Je ne suis pas dou\u00e9 pour r\u00e9aliser des documentaires et \u00e9crire mon autobiographie n\u2019est pas exactement ma tasse de th\u00e9 non plus. Cependant, je ne suis pas trop mauvais quand il s\u2019agit d\u2019inventer des histoires. Alors j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire une histoire portant sur un type un peu comme moi et ses pens\u00e9es. Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, sur ce qu\u2019il pense devoir faire du reste de sa vie. J\u2019ai aujourd\u2019hui soixante ans et j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9 de ma vie \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser des films. Il m\u2019arrive de m\u2019interroger et de me demander si je souhaite continuer - m\u00eame si en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 c\u2019est la seule chose que je sais \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s faire. Je me demande dans ces cas-l\u00e0 s\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas d\u2019autres mani\u00e8res d\u2019envisager le monde et de continuer \u00e0 apprendre - et, pourquoi pas, d\u2019autres mani\u00e8res de gagner ma vie. L\u2019incroyable v\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans tout \u00e7a, c\u2019est qu\u2019on ne cesse de changer. Je me pose encore les m\u00eames questions que quand j\u2019avais vingt ans : Qu\u2019est-ce que je veux \u00eatre\u00a0? Et quelle que soit la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question, comment y parvenir\u00a0? \u00c0 quel moment - si jamais cela arrive - saurai-je si j\u2019y suis parvenu\u00a0? Quelle sera la destination\u00a0? Je r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissais \u00e0 tout \u00e7a et l\u2019histoire s\u2019est transform\u00e9e en une s\u00e9rie de portraits des diverses personnes que notre h\u00e9ros - Joseph Fulton - conna\u00eet et appr\u00e9cie : sa petite amie, Muriel, une c\u00e9l\u00e8bre actrice de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui souhaite faire du grand art\u00a0; son ami Eric, un rocker vieillissant qui se demande de quelle mani\u00e8re il paiera pour les \u00e9tudes de sa fille\u00a0; sa jeune ni\u00e8ce, Veronica\u00a0; son ex-femme, Clara, qui demeure sa meilleure amie\u00a0; son avocate, Laura, son amie centenaire, la philosophe Elizabeth, et bien d\u2019autres... Je pense que c\u2019est ce que j\u2019ai \u00e9crit de mieux. Mais je ne vous demande pas de me croire sur parole. Bill Sage, ami de longue date avec qui j\u2019ai souvent travaill\u00e9 et qui incarnera Joe Fulton, m\u2019a dit : \u00ab\u00a0Mon dieu ! Ce sc\u00e9nario est g\u00e9nial. C\u2019est une superbe symphonie d\u2019amour, d\u2019amiti\u00e9, pleine d\u2019humour et tr\u00e8s touchante.\u00a0\u00bb Difficile d\u2019entendre plus plaisant que ce compliment mais ajoutons tout de m\u00eame que Robert Burke, qui incarnera pour sa part le gardien du cimeti\u00e8re, m\u2019a envoy\u00e9 un court message suite \u00e0 la lecture du sc\u00e9nario. Celui-ci disait sobrement : \"C\u2019est exquis\". Elina Lowensohn, qui incarnera pour sa part Elisabeth, la philosophe centenaire incroyablement bien conserv\u00e9e, m\u2019a \u00e9crit de Paris : \u00ab\u00a0Oh, Hal ! Je suis tr\u00e8s impressionn\u00e9e. C\u2019est si touchant, si intelligent, toujours extr\u00eamement dr\u00f4le, brillant et tr\u00e8s spirituel. Et j\u2019aime particuli\u00e8rement le fait qu\u2019il y a une grande g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 et beaucoup d\u2019humilit\u00e9 envers ceux qui liront le script ou plus tard verront le film. Cela donne \u00e0 voir un portrait tr\u00e8s intime de ce que Hal pourrait \u00eatre aujourd\u2019hui : un homme, un artiste qui travaille. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre notre portrait \u00e0 tous...\u00a0\u00bb Parker Posey (l\u2019iconique Fay Grim), qui tiendra le r\u00f4le de Laura, l\u2019avocate de Joe, m\u2019a \u00e9crit : \u00ab\u00a0Je n\u2019ai pas eu besoin d\u2019en lire beaucoup, je suis partante !\u00a0\u00bb Enfin, Tatiana Abracos (l\u2019iconique Girl From Monday), qui incarnera la tr\u00e8s d\u00e9monstrative actrice Muriel, m\u2019a \u00e9crit : \u00ab\u00a0Elle est adorable ! Je pense qu\u2019elle est fantastique. Les \u00e9motions et les sentiment que tu d\u00e9cris sont tr\u00e8s authentiques. C\u2019est du bon boulot, Padre ! Et mon dieu, \u00e0 la fin, ils chantent dans l\u2019appartement et commandent \u00e0 manger ! C\u2019est g\u00e9nial\u00a0!\u00a0\u00bb Eh bien merci \u00e0 tous. Hal Handlung Joseph Fulton, ein angesehener achtundf\u00fcnfzigj\u00e4hriger Regisseur von romantischen Kom\u00f6dien, m\u00f6chte stellvertretender Platzwart auf einem \u00f6rtlichen Friedhof werden. Er m\u00f6chte gerne im Freien arbeiten und der Natur nahe sein. Ausserdem denkt er, es w\u00e4re wichtig sein Testament zu machen. Aber seine hochdramatische Freundin, eine Schauspielerin, glaubt, dass er sterben muss und dass er einfach zu trotzig ist, um es irgendjemandem zu erz\u00e4hlen. Das Ger\u00fccht verbreitet sich und bald dr\u00e4ngen sich alle die er kennt - und einige, die er nicht kennt - in seiner kleinen Wohnung, um sich von ihm zu verabschieden. W\u00e4hrend meiner Kickstarter-Kampagne f\u00fcr die Henry-Fool-Trilogie im Jahr 2017 hatte ich vor einen Dokumentarfilm f\u00fcr diese Boxed-Set-Edition zu machen, eine Art Reflexion \u00fcber mein Leben und meine Karriere. Der Name sollte sein: Where To Land. Aber ich konnte es nicht. Ich bin kein begabter Dokumentarfilmer und ich bin auch nicht sehr begeistert davon meine Autobiografie zu schreiben. Ich bin aber nicht schlecht darin, Geschichten zu erfinden! Also fing ich an, eine Geschichte \u00fcber einen Typen zu schreiben, der mir \u00e4hnlich ist und dar\u00fcber, was er denkt. Speziell - was er dar\u00fcber denkt, was er mit dem Rest seines Lebens anfangen sollte. Ich bin jetzt 60 Jahre alt und mache seit 30 Jahren Filme. Ich frage mich manchmal, ob ich wirklich damit weitermachen m\u00f6chte, auch wenn ich wei\u00df, dass es das einzige ist, was ich halbwegs gut kann. Aber g\u00e4be es nicht auch andere M\u00f6glichkeiten, sich mit der Welt auseinanderzusetzen und zu weiter zu lernen - eventuell sogar neue Wege, mich selbst zu versorgen? Die unglaubliche Wahrheit dazu ist: Man ver\u00e4ndert sich st\u00e4ndig. Ich stelle mir die gleichen Fragen, die ich mir mit zwanzig gestellt habe: Was m\u00f6chte ich sein? Wie will ich das erreichen? Wann - wenn \u00fcberhaupt jemals - werde ich wissen, dass ich dort angekommen bin? Wo werde ich landen? Als ich \u00fcber diese Dinge nachdachte, wurde die Geschichte zu einer Reihe von Portr\u00e4ts der verschiedenen Menschen, die unser Held Joseph Fulton kennt und liebt: Seine Freundin Muriel, eine ber\u00fchmte Fernsehschauspielerin, begierig nach tieferem k\u00fcnstlerischen Engagement; sein Freund Eric, ein alternder Rocker, der besorgt ist, ob seine Tochter die Hochschule schaffen wird; seine Nichte im College-Alter, Veronica; seine Ex-Frau Clara, die immer noch seine beste Freundin ist; seine Anw\u00e4ltin Laura; seine 100-j\u00e4hrige Freundin, die Philosophin Elizabeth; und andere\u2026 Ich denke, es ist das Beste, was ich je geschrieben habe. Aber ihr m\u00fcsst euch nicht auf mein Wort verlassen. Mein guter Freund und langj\u00e4hriger Kollaborateur Bill Sage, der Joe Fulton spielen wird, sagt: \u201eWow! Ich bin absolut begeistert von diesem Drehbuch. Eine gro\u00dfartige Symphonie aus urkomischer und herzzerrei\u00dfender Liebe und Freundschaft.\" Dem kann ich nichts hinzuf\u00fcgen, au\u00dfer dass Robert Burke, der den Platzwart des Friedhofs, Leonard, spielen wird, mir eine SMS geschrieben hat: \u201eExquisit\u201c. Dabei hat er es dann belassen. Elina Lowensohn, die die bemerkenswert gut erhaltene 100-j\u00e4hrige Philosophin Elizabeth spielen wird, schrieb aus Paris: \u201eOh Hal! Ich bin so beeindruckt. So bewegend, weise, immer extrem lustig, clever und geistreich. Und was ich auch liebe, ist die Gro\u00dfz\u00fcgigkeit und Demut denen gegen\u00fcber, die es lesen und, sp\u00e4ter, anschauen werden. Es zeichnet ein so intimes Bild davon, wer, zum Beispiel Hal, gerade sein k\u00f6nnte - der Arbeiter, der arbeitende K\u00fcnstler. Vielleicht ein Bild von uns allen ... \" Parker Posey (die einzig wahre Fay Grim), die Laura, Joes Anwalt, spielen wird, schrieb: \"Ich brauchte nur einen kurzen Blick und bin dabei! xo! \" Zu guter letzt Tatiana Abracos (das einzig wahre Girl From Monday), die die hysterisch und dramatische Muriel spielen wird: \u201eSie ist absolut liebenswert! Ich finde sie gro\u00dfartig. Das ist alles so echt in Bezug auf die Gef\u00fchle und Emotionen der Menschen. Ich finde, es ist einfach sehr gut gemacht, Padre!! OMG und am Ende singen sie in der Wohnung und bestellen Essen bei einem Lieferdienst! Unglaublich!\u201c Danke euch allen! Hal Historia Joseph Fulton, un respetado director de comedias rom\u00e1nticas de cincuenta y ocho a\u00f1os, quiere convertirse en asistente encargado de su cementerio local. Quiere trabajar al aire libre y estar en contacto con la naturaleza. Entre tanto, cree que es importante preparar su \u00faltima decisi\u00f3n y testamento. Pero su novia actriz, quien es muy dram\u00e1tica, piensa que se debe estar muriendo y que tiene demasiado orgullo como para contarle a alguien. El rumor se dispersa y pronto todos a quien \u00e9l conoce\u2014y algunos que no\u2014se juntan en su peque\u00f1o departamento para despedirse. Durante mi campa\u00f1a de Kickstarter para la Trilog\u00eda de Henry Fool en 2017 suger\u00ed que ir\u00eda a incluir en esa edici\u00f3n recopilatoria una pel\u00edcula documental que reflexionara sobre mi vida y carrera. Se titular\u00eda Where To Land [D\u00f3nde aterrizar]. Pero no lo pude hacer. No tengo talento para filmar documentales y la idea de escribir mi autobiograf\u00eda tampoco me entusiasma. De todas maneras, \u00a1el inventar historias no me sale mal! As\u00ed que comenc\u00e9 a inventar una historia acerca de un tipo parecido a m\u00ed, y sobre las cosas que \u00e9l piensa. Espec\u00edficamente, lo que piensa que debiera hacer con el resto de su vida. Tengo sesenta a\u00f1os y he realizado pel\u00edculas profesionalmente durante treinta de esos a\u00f1os. A veces me pregunto si quiero continuar realiz\u00e1ndolas\u2014si bien s\u00e9 que es la \u00fanica cosa que puedo hacer m\u00e1s o menos bien. \u00bfPero pudieran existir otras maneras de comunicarme con el mundo y de continuar aprendiendo cosas; incluso nuevas maneras de ganarme la vida? La incre\u00edble verdad de todo esto es: uno sigue cambiando. Me estoy preguntando lo mismo que cuando ten\u00eda veinte a\u00f1os: \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que quiero ser? \u00bfC\u00f3mo puedo lograr eso? \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo sabr\u00e9 si lo he logrado (si lo hago alguna vez)? \u00bfD\u00f3nde aterrizar\u00e9? Mientras pensaba acerca de estas cosas, la historia se convirti\u00f3 en retratos de las distintas personas que nuestro h\u00e9roe, Joseph Fulton, conoce y ama: su novia, Muriel, una famosa actriz de televisi\u00f3n que desea un compromiso art\u00edstico m\u00e1s profundo; su amigo Eric, un m\u00fasico de rock entrado en a\u00f1os cuya preocupaci\u00f3n es que su hija haga su posgrado; su sobrina Ver\u00f3nica, que va a la universidad; su ex-esposa Clara, quien es todav\u00eda su mejor amiga; su abogada, Laura; su amiga fil\u00f3sofa Elizabeth, quien tiene 100 a\u00f1os; entre otros\u2026 Creo que es lo mejor que he escrito. Pero no me tomes la palabra. Mi buen amigo y antiguo colaborador, Bill Sage, quien hace el papel de Joe Fulton, dice: \u201c\u00a1Vaya! Estoy completamente impresionado por este argumento. Es una brillante sinfon\u00eda de amor y amistad, \u00a0divertid\u00edsima y desgarradora.\u201d No puedo a\u00f1adir nada a eso, excepto que Robert Burke, quien hace de Leonard, el encargado principal del cementerio, me mand\u00f3 un mensaje de texto diciendo \u201cexquisito\u201d, y ah\u00ed lo dejo. Elina Lowensohn, quien interpretar\u00e1 el papel de la bien conservada fil\u00f3sofa de 100 a\u00f1os, Elizabeth, escribi\u00f3 desde Par\u00eds: \u201c\u00a1Ay, Hal! Estoy tan admirada. Tan conmovedor, sabio, siempre extremadamente gracioso, positivo e ingenioso. Y lo que tambi\u00e9n me encanta es que est\u00e1 lleno de generosidad y humildad hacia aquellos que lo leen y que, m\u00e1s adelante, lo mirar\u00e1n. Describe un retrato tan \u00edntimo de quien, por ejemplo, Hal pudiera ser en estos momentos: el obrero, el artista trabajador. Tal vez sea un retrato de todos nosotros\u2026\u201d Parker Posey (la inigualable Fay Grim), quien interpretar\u00e1 a Laura, la abogada de Joe, mand\u00f3 un mensaje de texto: \u201c\u00a1Tan s\u00f3lo necesit\u00e9 darle una mirada para unirme! xo!\u201d Finalmente, Tatiana Abracos (la incomparable Chica del Lunes [Girl From Monday], quien entablar\u00e1 el papel de la hist\u00e9ricamente dram\u00e1tica Muriel: \u201c\u00a1Es encantadora! Creo que ella es muy inteligente. Esto es todo muy real acerca de las emociones y sentimientos de las personas. \u00a1Pienso que hiciste un buen trabajo, Padre!! \u00a1Incre\u00edble: al final est\u00e1n cantando en el apartamento y encargando comida!\u201d \u00a1Gracias a todos ustedes! Hal",
  "Bilbo Berg only ever needed three things in his life: his mother, his best friend, and, above all, his whole milk. He led a simple and happy life. Yet everything changed after the outbreak of the Moobola virus. A mass cow extinction began, causing the world\u2019s temperature to increase severely, and dairy was wiped from the face of the earth almost instantly. When all he wanted was the support of his mother, she had vanished too, with no explanation. His world was completely lost. Until one day, when he discovered a hidden clue: there might be one cow left. With the help of his troublemaking, childhood best friend Alex, the two venture onto a road trip filled with trials, tribulations, and a rusty van. Through this journey, Bilbo must ask himself: what would he truly do for another glass of milk? We're filmmakers from all over the world with diverse backgrounds. Through the past few years, our team has been able to tell a range of stories from a multitude of different genres and characters. As we\u2019ve continued to make films, we\u2019ve developed a sense of comradery with each other and been able to tell bigger stories each time. As absurd as the title and plot are, it is an important story for me. I've been away from home, Vietnam, for the last 10 years of my life. Having this opportunity to live in different countries, as well as meet different people, has taught me many things. I've learned to adapt, to absorb cultures, languages, to treat people with respect, and to work hard. I spent 4 years of high school in Auckland, New Zealand, where I built my second family. I worked for half a year as a waiter in Vietnam post-graduation then backpacked around the country. I then lived in Boston for years studying business before I stumbled into this filmmaking journey, and it's been the best thing that's happened to me. I want to use this absurd story to tell a grounded human story, a journey of a person growing up. With Bilbo, we are venturing into a larger scale epic than ever before, yet we have the tools and the experience with each other to bring such an expansive story to live confidently. Furthermore, we are a group of passionate about telling a story with a social impact. While Bilbo is an absurdist adventure, it is also rooted in a discussion of how we impact the environment and animals around us. \u00a0We want to use this platform to engage in a conversation about being sustainable and responsible for how we live our lives. The story of Bilbo reflects the journey all of us must face: taking chances to make our dreams happen, except with a bit more milk.\u00a0 We're partnering with the absolutely wonderful folks at Cherry Hollow Farm. They embrace our slogan of 'Save The Cows'. They've been saving cows from being slaughtered and bring them back to their beautiful farm. We couldn't have asked for a better partner. Currently, we are in the midst of preproduction as we gear up to begin filming in January 2020. Our Bilbo and Alex have been chosen, and our cow has been found, but there are many tasks ahead of us, including casting our supporting cast, finalizing our many locations for Bilbo\u2019s journey, and fleshing out the world through production design, props, and costumes. JONATHON PAWKOWSKI - BILBO BERG (LEAD) Jonathon Pawlowski is an Atlanta based actor, writer, and director whose work has screened at the Atlanta Film Festival.

You may have also recently seen him on your TV shouting from a Walmart parking lot or shouting from a stage to Limp Bizkit songs for his tribute band, Pimp Trizkit. In preparation for Bilbo, he drank a tall glass of Vitamin D milk every night for dinner as a young boy to teenage boy; he also has attempted the Gallon Milk Challenge and failed. CHRISTINA LEIDEL - ALEX (LEAD) Award-winning stage and screen actress. While pursuing her PhD in Physics at the University of Texas, Christina played several roles ranging from the Great Green Monkey God of Dance in the rock opera Sarah Silver Hands, to Desdemona and Lady Macbeth in Shakespeare's classics.

Since moving to Atlanta, Christina has performed as Annie Sullivan in The Miracle Worker (Suzi Bass Award winner - Outstanding Lead Actress), in WASP and Other Plays by Steve Martin, and as the insane spider-punk Renfield in The Anointing of Dracula and the pink-haired, time-travelling, saxophoning radio actress in TheMeantime. She recently worked alongside the Georgia Ensemble Theatre on Night Must Fall, and also in #ChrisMissed. Looking forward, she is thrilled to be starring in Indecent at Theatrical Outfit this March. Christina is also active in film and television, and has starred in several films currently enjoying successful festival runs: \u00a0Inhaling Red (Best Drama - Freedom Festival International; San Francisco Frozen Film Festival; Louisville International Film Festival), Molly (Audience Choice Award - Rome International Film Festival; Best Comedy Short finalist - Canton Film Festival; Best Comedy nominee - Beaufort International Film Festival), and The Last Filmmaker (Best SC Film - South Carolina Underground Film Festival).

  "So I would just like to take a moment to say that I'm absolutely blown away and humbled by the fact that we've surpassed our goal in merely 4 days! \u00a0I couldn't even begin to adequately thank all of those who have supported this project, it means the world to me and I am forever grateful! \u00a0Being that we still have a fairly decent amount of time left on this campaign I've set up some Stretch Goals, further goals that can help us to cause an even bigger splash with this tour! \u00a0I hope you guys enjoy them and if you have any suggestions as to other goals or ideas I would love to hear them so write me a comment! $5,000 or more: we'll be able to hire a social media guru to help us really make this tour pop online! More exposure, more marketing, more people that we get to share our music and the music of all of these wonderfully talented artists with! $6,500 or more: I'll write a New EP on the road and be able to record it when I get home In April! And the ultimate reach goal (my personal favorite): $10,000 or more:\u00a0If we reach this goal we will be able to donate a percentage of the overall amount pledged to the arts program of a local school in each city we visit!!! It's a way to spread the love of music and art beyond simply sharing the craft itself. What better way to inspire young people to pursue a life of art and expression?? I genuinely thank all of you for being such a major part of this, there's no way I could have done any of it without you! We still have time left, that's time to keep sharing and spreading the word, time to really make an impact beyond just playing shows and making people want to dance. Time to inspire others at their very foundation! Love & Light, Chris Hayzel Hello to all and welcome to my Kickstarter page! \u00a0my name is Christopher Hayzel and I'm a loop based one-man-band from Los Angeles. \u00a0What exactly does that mean? \u00a0Well here, let me show you :). Having grown up in a very creatively inspired family I was immersed in the arts from a very young age. \u00a0Whether it was sitting in the vocal booth with my father Howard Hewett (shalamar) or on set with my mother Nia Peeples (fame/pretty little liars),\u00a0I was constantly surrounded by abundantly creative energy and naturally, as a child does, soaked it all up like a sponge to water. \u00a0However, it was only when I picked up a guitar at the age of 5 that I began to discover my own personal language of expression and from there the wheels never ceased to move. As I dove head first into this new world of sonic landscapes I developed an immense desire for expansion, taking in a variety of influences from Dave Matthews Band to Stevie Wonder to Radiohead and far far beyond. \u00a0It was fascinating to hear and observe the ways that others expressed themselves, especially if they were different from my own. \u00a0As time went on my curiosity drew me to pick up whatever instruments I could get my hands on. \u00a0Drum Kit, Bass, Didjeridoo, Percussion, Keyboards and more began to work their way into my repertoire and through that I started to fill various roles in countless different projects. \u00a0Each new project brought new musical perspectives and experiences and allowed me to share art with many different parts of the world. A little over a year ago, however, after the disbandment of my last band Ellis., I sat down and began to really think, what if there was a way that I could take all of these beautiful experiences and all of the knowledge that I've acquired over the last 20 years and wrap them up in a nice little package complete with a bow? \u00a0And if there was, what would that look like? \u00a0The answer: Looping.\u00a0 Imagine one person sitting on a stage, surrounded by various instruments, and picking them up one by one to build an entire song right before your eyes. \u00a0Beats, guitar, bass, background vocals, all introduced to the song at precisely the right moment, keeping you on your toes and wondering what new sound might come next. \u00a0This is the essence of looping. Having only recently been introduced to the concept of the \"one-man-band\" I made my way down to the local Guitar Center, picked up a Boss RC-300 Loop Station and took it home to experiment. \u00a0Little did I know that I was opening the door to an entirely new corner of creating music and the process changed for me completely. \u00a0 It was the first time I had ever struck out on my own as an artist without a band and I was confronted by apprehension, but quickly it became clear to me just how special this was and within the first month of looping the serendipity began. \u00a0I was approached by a director to film the performance video you see above, picked up an endorsement from Gorilla Ears (a custom in ear monitor company), and was asked to open for The Black Eyed Peas at the Greek Theatre. As I looked around I suddenly began to realize that my music was making people happy, making them want to move and dance and feel alive. \u00a0And even beyond that, they were interested and bewildered at the way that I was delivering it to them. \u00a0It was taking that wonderment and aw that I feel every time I discover new music and sparking it within the listeners, and when it really comes down to it, that's the most rewarding thing that I as an artist could ever hope for. \u00a0Now It's time to take that spark and share it with as many people as I can. This is where you come in. All of 2014 was devoted to honing my understanding of the loop pedal, writing new material, playing every show I could, and crafting my debut solo E.P. \"End Reticence\" all in preparation to take the next step and present this experience to the world. \u00a0 I've teamed up with my good friend Shilo Gold and we are hitting the road with our instruments in hand and our eyes and ears wide open, seeking to share the stage with local indie groups from around the country and aiming to make the world of \u201cIndependent Artists\u201d a little bit smaller. The Indigo Soul Tour will feature up and coming local Indie Artists, each lending their voices to a celebration of their own home town music scene. Backed by a blog complete with professional photos, video, and journal entries about our experiences with these groups, we\u2019ll be spreading the bold, loud, and declarative nature of independent music around the globe! \u00a0 You can connect and keep up with the tour by visiting these links: Tumblr Facebook Twitter The tour will take us through a big loop around the west coast to share our love for music with: Why I Need Your Help Not only is this the first time that I've stood on my own as an artist but it will also be the first tour that I've planned, booked, and routed without the help of managers or promoters which is actually proving to be quite fun! \u00a0However, funding something like this is not an easy feat to accomplish on my own, and after giving it some thought I've decided to reach out to all of you beautiful people and ask for help in bringing this dream to life. \u00a0Your pledges will help me cover the costs of all of the basics including: With the total amounting to an even $4,000. To show my undying gratitude to you I've offered up some fun rewards for your pledges including digital and physical copies of my new E.P. \"End Reticence\" and my last full length album with my band Ellis. \"I Am\" as well as post cards and phone calls from the road, credits in the tour video, prints of my original artwork and handwritten lyrics, and much much more! \u00a0Just browse the column to the right and check out all of the packages! \u00a0Being that some of the rewards require the tour to be completed before they can be fulfilled (such as the tour video) I'm expecting to be able to fulfill them no later than May of 2015! REMEMBER, WE ARE THE MEDIA: \u00a0In today's culture the strongest media presence comes from us sharing with each other. \u00a0After you pledge please take a moment to share this campaign with your friends and family! \u00a0The more the merrier, as they say! Words can not express the amount of gratitude I feel toward each and every one of you for taking the time to check this page out and contribute to this very special project. \u00a0It's not too often that life presents us the opportunities to do something great, something we really believe in, and this is one of them. By pledging you're helping me to create an experience that will allow me to share love with the world in the best way that I know how and for that I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Sincerely, -Chris Hayzel\u00a0",
  "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ordinary true wireless earphones are often too big to fit comfortably into your ear. Not only are they bulky looking, sticking out from your ear, they irritate some parts of the ear after long periods of use. Poorly fitting earphones leak sound and result in poor audio quality. They even just fall off when you are exercising. VIE FIT is the world\u2019s softest, custom-fitting, true wireless earphone, not only the ear tip but the whole housing touching your skin is made from ultra-flexible, low resistance, antibacterial, durable silicone so it seamlessly conforms to your ears' shape. Vie Fit\u2019s 360 rotating speaker system is omnidirectional and moves naturally to fit the angle of your ear delivering optimal sound directly to your eardrum. When combined with the gapless fit, you can enjoy the superior sound quality of the 8mm neodymium dynamic speaker. VIE FIT uses the Qualcomm's latest module which comes with Bluetooth ver 5.0 with the latest audio profile. This module solves many problems existed in the past of audio drop out, caused by the right side & left side connectivity or Bluetooth and WiFi co-existence.It's the true wireless earphone perfected. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 VIE FIT is the world\u2019s softest, custom-fitting, true wireless earphone. Not only the ear tip, but the whole housing touching your skin is made from ultra-flexible, low resistance, antibacterial, durable silicone so it can seamlessly conform to your ears' shape. Everyone's ears are different. Ordinary true wireless earphones are often too big to fit comfortably into your ear, hurting some parts of your ear after long periods of use. Poorly fitting earphones just fall off when you are exercising. The VIE FIT's \"Soft Shell\u201d structure changes shape according to your ear and custom-fits softly and securely, so you can wear the earphones for long periods of time without stress or pain. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Most earphones have a one size fits all assumption. We don\u2019t expect you to fit to our product. We want our product to fit to you. That's why we replaced the traditional fixed angle speaker assembly with a flexible one. Vie Fit\u2019s articulating speaker is omnidirectional and moves naturally to fit the angle of your ear delivering optimal sound directly to your eardrum. The gapless fit allows you to experience the full power of Vie Fit\u2019s high quality 8mm neodymium dynamic speakers while efficiently eliminating outside noise. \u00a0VIE FIT uses powerful 8mm dynamic speakers that produce excellent sound with a frequency response tuned for powerful, deep lows, clear instrumentals, and crisp vocals. Enjoy how they truly sound like with the gapless fit. \u00a0VIE FIT supports Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122 Low Latency. The audio codec ensures your Bluetooth\u00ae wireless-enabled device can deliver sound in sync with visual media. It reduces delay and improves the end-to-end speed of the audio transmission, resulting in a high quality, synchronized user experience. With aptX Low Latency you can enjoy the freedom of wireless for applications such as gaming and watching videos. \u00a0 Hearing loss is one of the most common illnesses around the world. The damage depends on how long you are exposed to high volume sounds. VIE FIT\u2019s no gap fit provides the highly efficient noise reduction. Therefore, you can keep the volume level down while you are enjoying your music which limits the risk of hearing loss. Vie Fit is highly water resistant, rated at IPX5, so you can sweat or even dance in the rain. Some earphone users can experience ear infections after long-term or heavy usage. Vie Fit is made from FDA and EPA approved antibacterial silicone to protect your earphones from any harmful bacteria after longer periods of use. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Many true wireless earphones have connectivity problems. VIE FIT uses Qualcomm's latest module which comes with Bluetooth ver 5.0 and the latest audio profile. This module solves many problems that existed in the past with audio drop out, caused by the right side & left side connectivity or Bluetooth and WiFi co-existence.VIE FIT is going to be one of the first to deploy this superior module in the market for you to enjoy the best connectivity. The other common reason of connectivity problem is poor antenna deployment. When the antenna is buried in the housing and deep inside the ear, the signal gets disrupted. Vie Fit avoids this common problem by optimally placing the antenna on the outer edge of the housing where it can receive the best signal. The 200-degree ellipse design antenna allows for a greater signal reception while keeping you smart looking without sticking out of your ear. \u00a0 VIE FIT comes with 4.5 hours of continuous listening time and 33 hours of playback with the included charging case.\u00a0 Whether you\u2019re at home or out and about, background noise can make having a clear conversation difficult. Qualcomm's\u00ae cVc\u2122 ambient noise cancellation technology provides the highest quality advanced audio enhancements and noise suppression. You get uncompromised call quality with your Vie Fit earphones. \u00a0 After the initial pairing, Vie Fit will automatically connect to your phone as soon as you turn it on. Vie Fit connects with phones, tablets, PCs, smart TVs and many other devices using Bluetooth Technology. Compatible with: Apple: iOS devices, MacOS computers Android: phones, tablets, smartwatches Windows: computers SmartTVs VR Headsets \u00a0 \u00a0 Play, pause, forward, rewind music.\u00a0 Take a call and hang up.

  "This campaign has successfully ended.\u00a0 Orders can now be placed at KVgear.com.\u00a0 Worldwide shipping is available. Other mixers are in the works and will be announced at KVgear.com and KVgear.co.uk in the months ahead.\u00a0 First up will be Eurorack-compatible versions of the Vixen.\u00a0 After that, a mixer for Boutiques is highly likely.\u00a0 And after THAT, other electronic devices are planned. This is the mixer Volca lovers have been wanting for years:\u00a0 8 audio channels, panning, mutes, 2 aux sends/returns,\u00a0and onboard power for 8 Volcas.\u00a0 It can be powered by batteries or the included AC power adapter.\u00a0 All this fits into\u00a0the footprint\u00a0of a single Volca! The images below are of the special limited edition blue version.\u00a0 The standard version will be black.\u00a0 See more info at the bottom of this page. \u00a0 The Vixen has 3.5 mm (1/8\") mini jacks\u00a0on each audio channel for easy connection to small synths without the need for adapters.\u00a0 Your adapter-less existence continues as you connect to/from external effects boxes\u00a0and monitors through standard 6.35 mm (1/4\") jacks. Visibility is important, whether you're in a dimly lit studio or outdoors in the sun.\u00a0 All knobs on the Vixen have painted indicator lines.\u00a0 Graphics on the control panel are crisp, clear and as large as possible.\u00a0 The translucent top panel allows LEDs to be visible for Mute, Power, and VU meters. The Vixen has the same footprint as a Volca, allowing it to fit into most Volca stands and racks.\u00a0 KVgear stands such as the Lobe V3 and V4, Volc 45-2, -3, and -4, and Ramp Racks (3 sizes) are perfect matches for the Vixen.\u00a0 \u00a0 The Vixen can be powered by any of three sources:\u00a0external AC mains power supply (included), internal AA batteries (batteries not included), or an external mega battery that you provide.\u00a0 All synths connected to the power hub (using optional power cables) can draw power directly from the Vixen, eliminating piles of batteries or wall warts.\u00a0  AUDIO Channels 1-6 Channel 7 Channel 8 Aux Send 1 and 2 Aux Return 1 and 2 Main Out (stereo) Phones Out (stereo) POWER:\u00a0 INPUT The Vixen mixer can be powered from any of three sources: \u00a0 \u00a0 POWER:\u00a0 OUTPUT Eight (8) jacks can provide a total of up to 3 amps (3000 mA) of 9 VDC center positive power to connected devices.\u00a0 Connection between the Vixen and your Volcas will be through a set of optional cables that can be purchased on the KVgear website once the first batch of Vixens are ready to ship. \u00a0 The power hub and cables will be compatible with the following: A note about noise:\u00a0 The power hub is a simple daisy chain circuit.\u00a0 In many cases this type of arrangement is low noise.\u00a0 But in some circumstances, one or more devices in the chain can cause noise due to differential ground voltage.\u00a0 There are many solutions to ground hum noise.\u00a0 One simple solution is to resort to battery power.\u00a0 Fortunately, the Vixen can power itself and all connected devices using its onboard AA batteries or an external battery pack.\u00a0 This will allow your recordings to be as quiet and noise-free as possible. This project has been structured to be as lean as possible.\u00a0 In the interest of moving development along quickly, initial circuit prototypes were constructed with readily available components and improvised sources for circuit board substrates. \u00a0 A\u00a0final prototype\u00a0printed circuit board with components has been built.\u00a0 After a few tweaks and adjustments it passed all tests.\u00a0 The design is now updated and ready for production. \u00a0 PROTOTYPE DISCLAIMER:\u00a0 A few issues with the prototype PCB can be seen in the video and photos.\u00a0 The following corrections will be made in the production version:\u00a0 aux 1 and 2 send knob rotation will be correct (clockwise = increasing send level), all of the potentiometers will be of the same style and diameter with white indicator lines, the light pipes on top of the PCB will be of a different type.\u00a0  \u00a0\n Two color options are available for this campaign.\u00a0 A limited number of Vixens will be produced\u00a0with bright blue housings with white inlayed markings.\u00a0 They will look nearly identical to the photos shown on this page.\u00a0 While beautiful, this is a very time-consuming and therefore expensive process.\u00a0 All other Vixens in this campaign will\u00a0be black and will most likely have\u00a0a high quality multi-layer Lexan decal for the front panel markings.\u00a0 The decal will be similar to what is used on the Moog Sub 37.\u00a0 \u00a0",
  "As someone who has lived her life at the intersection of the monstrous and the sacred, I write fiction, creative nonfiction, nonfiction, and poetry to express this. Darkness and monsters have been my friends for a very long time, but so has God in all of the different ways I have understood God. My favorite monstrous creature is the vampire and this is where it all started for me, mostly thanks to P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast for their House of Night series. The best description I can come up with for my work is perhaps psychological horror, along the lines of Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, although I do not claim to be as great of a writer as Jackson. I am not \"that kind of Christian writer\" as in my work is not your typical Christian fiction which I abhor with a burning hot passion, and it contains four letter words that upset sweet church ladies.\u00a0 As for interesting things about me personally that you might like to know as you consider my creative work is that I enjoy flaunting my gay lifestyle by reading, writing, and making prayer beads. I have a M.A. in English and Creative Writing from Southern New Hampshire University. I'm a disabled single mother to four amazing children, some of them with disabilities also. I live in Mississippi and am settled here, but my life started out in a beautiful tropical tourist city in Australia. I lived in my native country of Australia until I was 21. I was born into an abusive fundamentalist cult and managed to escape as an adult. If that's not very interesting, I'll tell you also that my patron saint is St. Mary Magdalene and she features quite a bit in my writing, I love the smell of books, and I'm an addict in recovery which I also write about especially as it relates to the monstrous.\u00a0 What I'm trying to create here is a website home for my work. I have a designer that I am working with, I need to pay for web hosting, and other apps and tools related to the creation of this website. This will showcase my work, as well as give updates on my works in progress and links to my published work. I also have a Facebook author page and a Twitter and Instagram for people to follow and I try to keep up with them fairly regularly.\u00a0 People who have greatly influenced my own writing are Rachel Held Evans, Nadia Bolz-Weber, Eliese Colleen Goldbach, Shirley Jackson, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Kate Chopin.\u00a0",

  "Planning your next camping trip? Don\u2019t suffer through flavorless food. Join us in Kickstarting the Campfire Grill and become a campsite chef this summer!\u00a0 The Campfire Grill makes it easy to grill meat, vegetables and more over the coals from your campfire.\u00a0The angled edges not only add strength, they also turn every grill into a grill basket, keeping your food from falling into the fire. Camping with a grill lets you cook more than just meat and veggies. Use the grill as a pot stand and combine freshly grilled food with pastas, rice, soups and more. The angled edges of the grill work like miniature i-beams, creating a strong and rigid structure while reducing weight. The grill tray weighs only 7 ounces, but can support over 20 pounds!\u00a0 This strength lets you use the Campfire Grill as a stand for a Dutch oven or other heavy pot, so you can grill meat, saut\u00e9 vegetables, and combine everything together to cook a meal for a crowd. Every part of the grill nests together, so whether you\u2019re carrying one grill or several, they'll pack flat and won\u2019t take up any extra space in your pack.\u00a0This lets you mix and match different parts of the grill, so you're always carrying exactly the right amount of gear for your trip. Going on a solo backpacking trip?\u00a0 Take the grill tray alone and set it up using natural materials like logs and rocks. Out for the weekend?\u00a0 Bring the grill tray, legs, and accessories to create a versatile kitchen for gourmet backcountry meals. Cooking for a big group?\u00a0 Bring a second grill kit to roast more food at once, cook up a pot of chili, or both. Use the Backcountry Cutting Board to cut and prep food for the grill, or as a serving platter when everything is ready. Every Backcountry Cutting Board board is handcrafted from abundant US hardwood, packs flat inside of the grill tray, and weighs only 6 ounces.\u00a0 During cooking, the multipurpose Trail Tongs can be used as barbecue skewers or combined with our wooden adapter to become a set of versatile grilling tongs.\u00a0These tongs are perfect for moving hot coals or flipping meat and vegetables as they cook.\u00a0 When the food's ready, the tongs convert into a set of ultralight stainless steel chopsticks, perfect for eating your campsite feast.\u00a0 With your support, we can make this grill entirely in the US, and bring it to you at an affordable price. We'll put this grill into production immediately after the campaign ends, so you'll receive yours in time for late summer camping. \u00a0 Check out the pledge options below, share this project with friends, and thanks for your support! The Solo Pack includes a Grill Tray and Storage Bag - just the essentials for fast and light travel.\u00a0A set of Lifter Legs are not included with this pledge level, but are available as an add-on. However, you might consider upgrading to... The Adventure Pack upgrades the Grill Tray with all of the accessories, including a pair of Lifter Legs, a Backcountry Cutting Board, and a set of Trail Tongs, giving you a wide range of options for meal prepping, cooking, and serving. \u00a0Looking to do even more? You might be interested in... BEST VALUE! The Expedition Pack doubles the Adventure Pack, making it perfect for long road trips, river voyages and bike tours, or extended camping trips with a crowd.\u00a0 Combine two grills together to create a extra-large grilling surface and support for a Dutch oven, or separate the grills to create a two-zone fire for direct and indirect grilling. \u00a0No matter how many grills you\u2019re carrying, the nesting design ensures you\u2019ll be able to fit everything easily into your bag. Planning to go fishing on your next expedition? Then check out... Inspired by my family's trips to a secret fishing spot, the Catch & Cook Pack combines the Adventure Pack with our premium Black Walnut Handreel and a full suite of accessories from the Daggerfish Streamline Deluxe Kit.\u00a0 Designed for handline-style fishing, Daggerfish Handreels have no moving parts - simply tie on a lure, cast out by hand, and reel back in by hand. Full-grain leather accessories include a sheath for carrying your handreel on your belt or backpack strap, a fly wallet for bringing extra gear, and a set of mitten scissors for cutting line and removing hooks. \u00a0 There's nothing like the satisfaction of a meal pulled straight from a mountain lake, and the Catch & Cook Pack is a lightweight, minimalist, and extremely portable way to experience the joy of ultralight backcountry fishing.\u00a0 I'm Adam, founder of the Daggerfish Gear Company, and I've been designing and making outdoor gear since 2019. \u00a0At Daggerfish, we focus on using natural materials in all our products, and so we've made every part of this grill sustainable, biodegradable, or recyclable, \u00a0using stainless steel, domestic hardwoods, and natural cotton fabric. What's more, this grill will be made entirely within the US. This not only supports local manufacturing, it gives us greater clarity and control over the process, and also reduces overseas shipping and helps us avoid the global supply chain issues that the world is still subject to. \u00a0Win-win-win. If you've read this far, I'd just like to take a minute to say thanks. We're incredibly excited to be bringing the Campfire Grill to you and can't wait for you to use it on your next camping trip.

Now, for the first time, I\u2019m collecting Bitty's best TWEETS. (!!!) And I'm doing this in a book I call THE CHIRPBOOK. And on top of collecting Bitty\u2019s Tweets, The Chirpbook will contain new selfies, never-before-seen pictures from Jack Zimmermann\u2019s camera roll, brand new comics, and secret tweets from Bitty\u2019s senior year. (So, SPOILERS!) All of these features and more will be in The Chirpbook, the perfect catalog to round out your Check, Please! Collection. This project is small, simple, and straightforward. No stretch goals or achievements, just (a) the book, (b) some exclusive stickers, and (c) a wonderful mini-print set. (Phew, right?) Important Details You Need To Know THE BOOK - THE CHIRPBOOK. Approximately 168 pages featuring Bitty\u2019s tweets from his sophomore, junior, and senior years. Also chock full of new \u00a0illustrations and a foreword. Available in digital PDF, softcover, or hardcover.\nTHE PRINT SET - \u00a0Five illustrious postcards that you can cherish forever, or mail to your best friends.\nSTICKERS - A set of stickers that might possibly include a post-it note or a goose.\nBOOKPLATE - A signed bookplate you can stick into your CHIRPBOOK. \u00a0Mock up of The Chirpbook by Freepik.",

At the gallery it was described as \"Untitled\" ink of paper...11x14\"... signed... \u00a0This piece is from my collection and I have been the only owner. It's size, simplicity yet imaginative depth intrigued me. It was during this exhibit that he gave me permission to use a quote of his in my first book \"Celebrate Imagination\"..You can tell that Clive has put some extra thought and time into this piece. Not only does it include a complete landscape, he has also created depth and dimension with the use of extensive cross hatching...not a common device used in his pen and inks. Unfortunately I never got the chance to ask him anything about it. Truth be known this is probably best, leaving all up for interpretation...An idea for a future short story...maybe an idea to be used in a future Abarat storyline....Only one person really knows.....One thing is for sure though, this an idea made visible in ink from the mind of our favorite \"imaginer\"...Feel good in knowing that when you donate at this level , not only do you receive an original Clive Barker art piece but you also are supporting the finest podcast out there....\"",
  "Crazy Dumplings is back and is even crazier than ever! Dumplings from around the world and the most unique combinations of ingredients come together in Crazy Dumplings II: Even Dumplinger. From Thailand, Vietnam, India, and of course across China, traditional snacks are given a new twist when stuffed into dumpling wrappers. Sweet, savory, spicy, and all delicious, Crazy Dumplings II: Even Dumplinger will take you where your taste buds have never been before! Hi! My name is Amanda and I am an American who has been living, writing, and cooking in China since 2010. After the success of last year's Crazy Dumplings Cookbook, I can't get dumplings off my mind. Every time I come across a new recipe, the first thing I think is \"how can I turn this into a dumpling?\" So I'm back with dozens of crazy new dumpling recipes you will want to try!\u00a0 China\u2019s favored dish, the dumpling (jiaozi in Chinese), can be found on every street corner, in every restaurant, and in every kitchen in China, but they are all pretty much prepared the same way: a bit of meat, some garlic and ginger, and a bit of vegetables if you\u2019re lucky. Even a visit to the freezer section at any grocery store displays hundreds of packages of dumplings that all look and taste the same. But the dumpling is so versatile! Have you ever tried stuffing a dumpling with chicken? Pesto? Egg tart filling? No? Hardly anyone has! My cookbook, Crazy Dumplings II, takes this simple staple food and prepares it in ways you never thought possible! From Avocado Chipotle Dumplings to Lamb Pomegranate Dumplings to Pumpkin Cream Cheese Dumplings, a world of foods is available to you in an easy dumpling wrapper with Crazy Dumplings. Crazy Dumplings II will contain dozens of new recipes plus dumpling recipes submitted by backers (see rewards for details), the dumpling wrapper recipe, and several original sauce and dip recipes such as Avocado Lime Sauce and Honey Chipotle Sauce. There are dumpling recipes for appetizers, main courses, and desserts. I have done my best to include some vegetarian recipes, but dumplings are so versatile, you can turn almost any recipe in the book vegetarian, and the book will explain how! Cookbooks are crazy expensive to print due to the color pictures. The goal of $3,000 will cover: We have several great add-ons this year: Get an additional paperback version of Crazy Dumplings II for only $15. Get a digital version of the original Crazy Dumplings Cookbook for only $5 in your choice of format.\u00a0 Get a paperback version of the original Crazy Dumplings Cookbook for only $15! Get the new and improved Crazy Dumplings Dumplinger for only $5! This is perfect for people who only bought the digital version last year or are buying extra books as gifts.\u00a0 Get two additional plushy dumplings in random colors for only $5! Get an additional chopstick gift set for only $10! Remember, there are no additional shipping prices for any tiers or add-ons! I have been writing about my life in China for over 5 years on my website Two Americans in China; be sure to check it out. This is where I will also be posting most of my public updates and giving shout-outs to backers. You can also follow me on Twitter and Facebook for more updates and shout-outs. I also post pretty pictures of dumplings on Pintrest. Be sure to join my mailing list for even more updates, information, and free stuff! If you do not have an Amazon Payments account, please send me a message and we will work something out. I can accept Paypal, direct deposit into my Chinese bank account, WeChat payments, and Alipay. \"Amanda Roberts' Crazy Dumplings is a gift from the Dumpling Gods. Having experienced authentic jiaozi firsthand while living in China, the author has taken them to new, transcendent heights.\" ~ Kerah13 \"Crazy Dumplings is the holy grail of dumplings. ..this is definitely not your average cookbook. The cookbook includes traditional dumpling recipes and the not so traditional...there is a dumpling in this cookbook for everyone.\" ~\u00a0Nerisa Eugenia Waterman \"Although I am not the typical cookbook reader (nor cook...), Crazy Dumplings suits me perfectly as an expat. I love the interplay between dumplings - the delicious local cuisine - and the wide assortment of tastes that possibly only a foodie westerner abroad could come up with.\" ~ Ray Hecht \"Crazy Dumplings is immediately enticing with full colour photographs of how to fold your dumplings as well as the finished products...Although it is cheap and cheerful to eat out locally, sometimes we forget how great it is to eat something we have prepared ourselves. With Crazy Dumplings on your shelf or your e-reader, you have every reason to eat in!\" ~ Rachel Dillon \"This is a daring book as so much one would never expect can turn into a delicious dumpling.\" ~\u00a0Maria Catalina Vergara Egan \"This would be a great cookbook to give to a coed in their first apartment, or for a newly married couple, with some accessories and spice mixes.\" ~ Bless Their Hearts Mom \"This was a delightfully informative cookbook. It\u2019s inventive and traditional and made from scratch, like the recipes.\" ~ Dab of Darkness \"I tried the Beef Stir-Fry and even now thinking about it I can still taste the mixture of flavors playing havoc in my mouth.

  "Theaters everywhere are struggling to get and keep people buying tickets and are constantly trying to bring in new subscribers to help them pay the costs of mounting a season's worth of shows. This project is designed to help theaters find new paying audience members by offering the hearing loss community access to theaters that they never had before. \u00a0 I'm talking about Hearing Loops. \u00a0I'm talking about giving people who wear hearing aids (HA) or have cochlear implant sound processors (CI) the ability to walk into a theater and push a button on their hearing device to turn on its built- in telecoil to sit and listen AND hear a show, music and words, more clearly than they've ever been able to before. \u00a0IF they were able to hear it before. And it's completely anonymous. \u00a0No one has to stop at the theater manager's office and announce that they are hearing disabled to pick up a clunky receiver to wear around their neck coupled with a pair of headphones.\u00a0 A hearing loop sends a sound signal to a person wearing an HA or CI via that device's telecoil which is a small, wound piece of copper wire installed in the hearing device. \u00a0The sound is delivered via magnetic induction so the microphones on the HA or CI are bypassed and the end user hears sound that is much clearer and much more robust than what their microphones can deliver. \u00a0The actors on stage sound as if they are talking directly into the ears of the listener. \u00a0Music sounds full with depth and tone. \u00a0The microphones installed on HA's and CI's simply cannot produce sound this clear and this enjoyable. Hearing Loops give the hearing loss community access, much in the way wheelchair ramps give access to paraplegics. \u00a0So people who could not go to the theater because they could not hear the performance can go to a looped theater and enjoy performances there. \u00a0That's a new audience to market to and it's HUGE! \u00a0The Hearing Loss Association of America (The HLAA) estimates that approximately 36 million people in the U.S. alone are afflicted with some kind of hearing loss or hearing disability. That's a significant number of people who have been denied a theater experience. \u00a0Why not give them a chance to enjoy great theater while giving theaters an untapped audience to appeal to? \u00a0\u00a0",
  "Help! is a an epic musical whose cast volunteers in communities world wide, sharing the Gospel message through a theatrical revival of hope. \u00a0\"The stage is an incredible platform whereby we are able to engage audiences in heart to heart conversations about God and share His love.\" \u00a0Your pledge allows us to do this on a very large scale...globally. Help! is a classic tale of good and evil set against the 1930's backdrop of a magicians workshop. It's an epic love story that follows a magician and his fiance as he shows her his workshop, all the illusions he's planned for his upcoming production, and introduces her to his fun quirky team of craftsmen. When an older and wiser conjurer of tricks comes to town, he begins to woo the fiance with his skills. But beware! He's more than he appears to be! When the conjurer kidnaps the fiance, the magician must devise his greatest illusion yet to get her back and he'll do so even if it costs him his own life. A battle of wits takes place between the magician and the conjurer as the workshop is transformed through time into a glitzy futuristic battle of good and evil. The stage is the platform where we engage communities and see lives transformed through evangelism and sharing the Gospel message. When Help! rolls into your city, it's like the circus coming to town. The only difference is, a circus is expensive and costs you the audience mega bucks! Help! the Musical is free to your community.\u00a0 Communities all over the world have called on Help! and their team of volunteers to provide tangible service when a need arises. \u00a0If we're 30 cast members strong - and we roll into your community and work a 4 hour day, that's 120 hours of free labor to your community, organization, or non-profit. \u00a0We generally stay in a town 2-3 weeks, so the opportunity to build in your community is huge! Someone once said, \"hurt people - hurt people, but healed people - heal people.\" Everywhere we go, we find lonely, hurting people who have lost hope. Our team comes along side these people and encourages them. We do this through friendship, and if the situation allows, we like praying for people too. \u00a0We find that if we just spend time encouraging people through conversation and prayer...they generally find something to be hopeful for, something to believe in. Why? Because someone took the time to listen. No staff or cast members are paid. From our technical team to dancers, actors and directors everyone pays to join our tour and be a part of changing the world! So we're a pretty motivated group of people who get our thrills out of traveling the world - pulling off some epic volunteer work and doing what we love most, performing. Help! is always looking for talented musicians, dancers, aerial acrobats, and theatrical designers to maintain our team as we take our production into neighborhoods all around the world. \u00a0Don't just make a pledge, join the tour! While in town we invite the community to come be a part of our setup. During the day you can watch the show come together, and in the evening join us for a time of s'mores, singing and story telling. From the Australian Outback to the Pacific Islands to the great Northwest, we love telling our story...but more importantly we love listening to yours! We desire our production to be as BIG as a Las Vegas show. \u00a0The difference is - our show is family friendly and includes some BIG illusions, special effects, dance routines and aerial acrobatics, and we're mobile - in your city - and it's FREE. How can we do all this for free?  We require the help of Kickstarter to purchase our initial stage pieces.  From lighting and sound to rigging, tents and vehicles, to increase the size of our current production to something epic. \u00a0Performing inside a tent makes it possible to perform year round. \u00a0 Once we have our production built, staff and cast fees pay for our lodging, meals, and transportation costs.  So, we're able to come to you at no cost to your community. Click on the videos to see 3D animations of our stage design and see some of the cool behind the scene details. Here is a run down of the major costs by category and a few of the companies who we are partnering with to make it happen. A big thanks to you from our team for taking valuable time to review our project.    Our goal is to stage our first production during the 2016 New Years events in Byron Bay, Australia, where thousands of people come to spend their holiday.  You can make this possible by making a pledge to Help! World Tour today! The\u00a0Autographed Musical Collection...",

  "Sara and I (Montana) have been best friends for four years. Something about each of us attracts absolute tomfoolery into our lives, so we decided to start writing it all out in an attempt to share our stories with the world. A year ago, we brought Ethan on to help us sort out our ideas and begin the writing process. He quickly became the glue that keeps us together and our fearless leader. (We love you, Ethan.) Together, the three of us have created OK|LA, a tale of two funky, eccentric besties living and thriving and surviving in Oklahoma City. We love this city. We love each other. We love filmmaking. We love the bizarre lives we live. Most of all, we love this story that we have created together. We want to make the world laugh, and with your contribution, we will! We will be using these funds for multiple things! Food for our lovely cast and crew, set dressing + props, lighting and grip equipment, transportation (trip to LA to shoot our last episode, say whaaat?!), and SO much more! We have included lots of cool rewards to ~entice you~, but anything and everything helps us! This project is us living our dream. With two filmmaking degrees + years of real life experience between us, we are collaborating and bringing a world we have created from our own brain cells to life.

  "Hi there! I'm Ash, also known as Midgart, and I'm the creator and artist of the webcomic Theurgy. Together with my co-creator Kayla (or Tulomne), Theurgy Book One has been an (almost) three-year long process in the making. We are so excited and ready to finish up this first part of Theurgy's story and to bring it to print with your help! If you're new to Theurgy, you can read on below or check out the comic at theurgycomic.com! \u00a0Gabriel Matthews and his friends decide to summon a demon. Or rather, to try to summon a demon. They've done the research (a questionable amount, really), gathered the supplies (the wrong ones, actually), and are ready to give it a go (some of them, anyway). What could go wrong? They get started and... nothing happens. Not that they expected much to happen, really - demons aren't real, after all. They go about their night and when Gabe's friends eventually leave, he discovers that the summoning actually worked -- it's just that Desideratus is pretty bad at his job and decided to show up several hours late. Gabe doesn't know how to handle this. Theurgy Book One follows the odd relationship between Gabe and Des. Des isn't very good at collecting souls and Gabe isn't very good at dealing with a demon in his living room. Somehow, they end up growing on each other. \u00a0The goal of this project is to get funding to print the first book of Theurgy. The book will be a 7x10.5\" matte softcover, full color interior, and approximately 112 pages long. It will include the entirety of 'Part One' of Theurgy, as well as extra illustrations and an extra comic about a day with Des & Gabe that will be exclusive to the collected book.\u00a0",

  "I'm a foreigner in Copenhagen, one of the many people who, by moving here, found a small country with a capital city open to welcome us, but with some limits. Being a foreigner in Denmark can be hard sometimes, especially when something you love seemed reserved for Danes only. I'm a passionate literate who struggles to find the right place to enjoy around the city. That's why I'm creating this Kickstarter project: I want to open a place, a spot in the city especially for foreigners, to socialize, drink a good coffee, walking around shelves full of books and much more. My inspiration is one of the most famous bookshops in the world: Shakespeare and Company in Paris. Sylvia Beach, an American expat in France, opened it in 1919. Her bookshop was not only a place to find American Literature, but also a hub for the American foreigners to find help for small expats problems. These people, most of them writers, found in Shakespeare and Company a new home, and there met other Americans who were experiencing the exact same. That's exactly what I'd like to have.",

  "1-800-D-DIRECT is an ambitious, bold and stylised short comedy set in 1960s Manhattan.\u00a0 A little over a year ago, co-producers/writers & actors Haley Bishop and Gemma Yates-Round planted the seed of this film around their kitchen table.\u00a0It happened fairly organically during their usual morning banter, but the true inspiration sprouted from a desire to create the roles they so deeply desired to play. It has since blossomed into a piece of work they are immensely proud to put their names to. Over the last six months, Gemma & Haley assembled a powerhouse of talented filmmakers to pull off this ambitious short, culminating at the end of June with our major shoot where we captured the bulk of principal photography.\u00a0 However the film is far from completion, and we are seeking support in the form of finishing funds to help us bring 1-800-D-DIRECT to life. We are yet to film a major scene that will be shot in the style of a 1960s commercial, which means kit fees, location and costume hire. We also have crucial post-production expenses to cover such as colour grade, music composition & the film festival circuit.\u00a0 This film needs to be told! It explores themes of gender role reversal in an era so limited for \u00a0women in the workplace, as well as presenting us with female empowerment in a hilariously original way. We are so proud of what we have achieved thus far and what is yet to come for this special short film.\u00a0\u00a0 And.... what is yet to come you might ask? Well....we want the spunky ladies of 1-800-D-DIRECT to hit the festival circuit and spread the D love. And that is exactly what we plan to do. A strong festival and marketing plan is being pieced together to give this film the exposure it not only deserves, but needs! We have high hopes for this bright, clever & sassy female driven comedy, so we will be putting a strong emphasis on festivals looking for these qualities.\u00a0 Separately we hope to use 1-800-D-DIRECT as a proof of concept, a launchpad of sorts to garner some feature buzz. 10 minutes just won't be enough for you, trust me.... Click on a pledge, you won't regret it. THANK YOU!\u00a0",
  "The Project Hello, my name is illyanna Maisonet and I'm the writer of food blog, EatGordaEat.\u00a0I currently work as a Web Editor for the San Francisco-based company Broke-Ass Stuart. I'm seeking $2,000 in funding to publish my first cookbook, Gorda Eats: A Puerto Rican Cookbook. A\u00a0Puerto Rican cookbook (designed by Vivian Liberti) featuring beautiful color photographs by\u00a0Dan Liberti,\u00a0stories, traditional and modern Puerto Rican recipes. This book doubles as a gift to certain backers and as a manuscript/proposal to publishers for our larger cookbook. ***Disclaimer: The video says that the book is a hardcover. Things have changed. The booklet is a 24-page, 5.5''x 8.5'' paperback with saddlestitching.\u00a0 Get to know Puerto Rican cooking on an intimate level. It seems like no one knows anything about Puerto Rican cooking. I live in the bay area and it doesn't seem like Puerto Rican food gets a chance to stand on its own. It's often combined with other Carribean cuisines or split as a restaurant that's half Cuban and half Puerto Rican.\u00a0 Not only does this 24-page cookbook make Puerto Rican cooking approachable, it also shows a connection between ingredients that span into other cultures.\u00a0 Sofrito: the soul and base of all things Puerto Rican. My family's recipe includes cilantro, tomato, garlic, onion, jalapeno, green bell pepper. Most of these ingredients are also used in Southeast Asian cuisines. So, I make a batch of sofrito, pour it into ice cube trays and freeze it. On those days when I'm making stirfry, curry, or Tex-Mex chili...I toss a cube in and watch it melt into the pan. Who needs synthetic flavor boosters when you have sofrito at your fingertips?! What qualifies me to sell you a book with my recipes? Nothing. Other than the fact that I finished a two-year culinary school program at American River College and the book includes my grandmother's (and her mother's) recipes that are over 100-years old? Nothing. I'm not an expert on all things Puerto Rican. I grew up in California, an only child to a single mother who came to California with her family in the 1950's and I only speak Spanglish. I'm apart of the bi-cultural paradox, searching for my roots and myself through the only thing that seems to remain true and honest...food. Help me publish + print my first cookbook\u00a0 I'm broke. It's only with your support that this book happens. Your contribution helps us publish the cookbook:\u00a0 To do this book justice, we really felt like we needed to visit the motherland, Puerto Rico. There has to be more out there than the regular seven recipes on rotation in my grandmother's kitchen. Recently, through some research, I found a festival in Loiza dedicated to the Buren; a flat-top metal cooking surface heated by wood that was one of the original cooking methods of the Taino. It is essential that I go to Puerto Rico, see this method, learn this method and do my duty to preserve this method. We are incredibly grateful that you took the time to check out our campaign\u00a0and hope that you'll share it with your family + friends!\u00a0 Background video music by: Madoka Ogitani via FreeMusicArchive",
  "Below you will hear about my amazing mother, Elisa and the contents of her new cookbook. She has already been asked to go on a cooking tour in Tuscany this summer and is working with key names in the Industry. She is an up and coming household name. More about the Artist On Christmas Eve 2013, my mother, Elisa, lost the love of her life of 56 years. At 76, she continues to work and plans on remaining financially independent by sharing her art with you and your families.\u00a0 She was born in August 1938 to farmers, Alfredo and Maria\nFantozzi, in Poggio Valle, a\u00a0small town in the\u00a0province of Teramo, located in the Abruzzo reign of Italy. As the second\ndaughter, and one of six children, she learned to cook at a very young age and\ncontinues today, to use the same simple ingredients to create the most wonderful family\ndinners and desserts.  At 23, she immigrated to the United States with her late\nHusband, Francesco, and daughter Nadia to Philadelphia. Starting from scratch,\nshe built a family, an endless circle of friends and found a career with the\nArchdiocese of Philadelphia caring for special needs children as a housekeeper\nand cook. She continues to work to this day at Divine Providence Village in\nSpringfield, Pennsylvania after 35 years. It as not been an easy road for Mom of the years, leaving her family behind in Italy, but still trying to send money to support them when they first arrived in the United States, raising one child with a medical disability, putting two other children through college, and lastly when it was finally time to enjoy retirement, losing dad. \u00a0 We never had much disposable income as a family growing up, but when it came to meals, Mom always filled the table with her rustic and classic dishes.\u00a0 This book will not be easy to say the least. Like most great cooks, a pinch of this, a pinch of that, is traditionally the way around a stove, so working with mom over the next few weeks and months to capture her secrets on paper will take some time, but a project, as her son, I am committed to seeing come to print.\u00a0 What is in the Book? Antipasti - Some of the most simple but delicious selections of Mom's favorites. Both year round and seasonal dishes, using vegetables from her own garden and homemade sausage. Pasta - Making homemade pasta can be difficult, but mom will guide you through a simple process that is fail proof. And for those calorie watchers, learn how to make your favorite Lasagna with Scripelles instead of traditional dough. \u00a0Breads and Pizza - \u00a0Amaze your friend and family with breads, pizzas and stromboli that you can prepare in less than an hour with what you already have in your pantry.\u00a0 Main Dishes - Although many may serve pasta as an entree, it is always followed by a main dish with meat or fish. Mom's recipes will guide you through the preparation of the best tasting meat and fish dishes, again using simple ingredients and in a timely fashion, for the busiest households. Any Finally Desserts! - Those famous italian cookies you have tasted at parties and during the holidays, unlike the \"Italian cookies\" some bakeries brand as the real deal, these recipes are truly authentic. And the best part is they don't have to look perfect, it is all in the taste! Mom will also share her amazing cakes and Italian creme recipes.\u00a0 We have already begun the publishing process, and Mom's book will be\u00a0available in book\u00a0stores and Amazon. The book is currently in production as should be complete this Spring.\u00a0 We Thank you for your consideration and hope you will support Mom and her goal of sharing her Art with houses\u00a0across the globe.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elisa and Frank P.S.

  "Goal raised - and surpassed! We beat Volume 1's record ($3211), so every backer who ordered the book gets an extra mini-print. \u00a0Leif & Thorn is an original fantasy webcomic, starring an LGBTQ ensemble cast and featuring storylines about time travelers, restless spirits, magical girls, cross-cultural misunderstandings, and unicorn frappes. Read Leif & Thorn online to get more updates, follow the latest strips, and stay on top of news about future books. Volume 1 was printed with Kickstarter last year -- now it's time to do Volume 2. (For those of you with simple needs: this is the one where they kiss.) Leif was exported (almost literally) from his native S\u00f8nheim, to weed the gardens at the country's Embassy in Ceannis. Thorn is a Ceannic knight (with PTSD and a magic sword) on duty at the gates. It's a hotbed of culture clashes, but they seem to be hitting it off. Only in a friendly way, of course. Thorn is happy to pay the Embassy's exorbitant rates to \"rent\" Leif for an afternoon out, but all for platonic reasons. That's also why Leif is so patient as Thorn fumbles with his language, willing to eat risky foreign food, and ready to fight anyone who insults Thorn's dragon-burn scars. Friendship! . . . no, seriously, they're both sitting on Feelings. But Leif has legal reasons for holding back -- and it's about time for Thorn to finally catch on. Also: high tide under two moons, support for the recently reincarnated, vampires complaining about history memes, magic duels over musical tickets, lost-in-time travelers, and karaoke. For teens and up. (Don't give this one to small children -- it includes mature topics like childhood abuse, PTSD flashbacks, international espionage, and health insurance.)\u00a0 Leif & Thorn Volume 2 picks up right where Volume 1 left off. It covers about a year's worth of daily strips -- including storylines from 2017 and 2018 -- plus a gallery of Alternate Universe adventures. Like the first book, it'll be 8.25\" by 10.5\", 180 pages of full-color strips, with wraparound covers and cool bonus features. They will look gorgeous next to each other on your shelf. Here's a taste of the layout: And here are some of the storylines inside! (In the dialogue, different fonts represent different languages. Most characters usually speak in their native language, but Thorn, in particular, spends a lot of time speaking in Leif's.) THE CALLING - A military installation gets put on the spot by a bunch of children, and has to pull off a holiday miracle. TIME & TIDES - Trying to figure out if you have no chill as a result of childhood trauma, or if some people really are Just That Annoying. SWEET SUMMER CHILDREN - The one where Thorn finds out Leif has a control microchip in his neck, and tries to tell himself it's just a \"harmless cultural difference.\" THE PERENNIALS - Orientation for \"long-runners\" -- people who, as kids, recover the adult memories of a past incarnation. SUMMER SUNSHINE - The one with carnival food, amateur pop songs, secret agents, lost time travelers, and some really awkward hallucinations. SUMMER SUNSHINE is also the one with the big confession, the attempted first kiss, and multilingual misunderstandings finally getting dragged out in the open. ONLY 900'S KIDS WILL GET THIS - Vampire problems: inaccurate history memes, human laws trying to limit who you can eat, and the struggle to find a good accountant. \u00a0ALTERNATE UNIVERSES - Versions of the comic that take place in different settings and genres. Like the space opera, the urban fantasy, or one where they're all teenage superheroes, defeating monsters with the power of friendship. Your writer/artist/creator is Erin Ptah. I've been posting comics (and fanart...lots of fanart) on the internet for the past 15 years. Good times. Keep up with my work on Twitter, on Deviantart, or on Patreon. (Come for the public posts, subscribe for the patron-locked ones!) Current webcomic projects: Leif & Thorn and But I'm A Cat Person (which you should also read -- it's a full-page adventure comedy about broke millennials with battle monsters). \u00a0Don't just take my word for how good Leif & Thorn is. Take the words of other people.\u00a0 For instance, words like these: \u00a0\"I have an insatiable need for content and there\u2019s no other comic out \u00a0there that delivers on such an engaging and well-built story and world \u00a0AND updates every day. It\u2019s the perfect comic!\" ~Strontium \"*slaps Leif & Thorn* This bad boy can fit so many LGBT+ characters \u00a0in it that audience members might discover actual words for themselves \u00a0in the ensuing discussions on the pages\" ~Shard \"You do amazing work and I am always impressed by the amount of detail \u00a0that goes into the worldbuilding and character depth. Thank you so much \u00a0for what you do.\" ~Kiwi \"I just found your comic and caught up after binge reading the archive in \u00a0a few days. What an awesome story! I really like how everyone comes \u00a0across as a person and isn\u2019t just a cliche representation of a \u00a0marginalized group. [...] Now I get to wait in suspense like the rest of you. :p\" ~Willow \"This is so cute!! I\u2019m slowly making my way through the archive and holy shit\u2026 everyone\u2019s cute and I can\u2019t handle it.\" ~Nicole \"I\u2019ve always been interested in your webcomic but just never had time to \u00a0sit down and read through it. But a couple days ago I finally got too \u00a0curious, sat down to start, and blew through the archives in less than a \u00a0day. XD I just love\u2026everyone. Especially Bramble.\" ~Solar \"One of the first comics I remember reading that made me feel truly seen.\" - @Super_fluence This is the section where I tell you about that LGBT+ representation! Thing is, I have strong opinions about visible rep. It's very easy to go \"here is a list of the characters' genders and sexualities\" on your cast page. It's much more important to make those things obvious in the story. So I'm just gonna show you the strips. Here's the main slow-burn mutual-pining same-sex couple! \u00a0\u00a0Also has adorable happily-married same-sex couples! \u00a0Casually-accepted young trans people! \u00a0Casually-manhandled-by-a-sexy-vampire adult trans people! \u00a0Both casual and cranky/pedantic adult nonbinary people! \u00a0Inclusion as a regular feature of backgrounds and crowd scenes! \u00a0By this point you can see other kinds of diversity in the cast, too. The main relationship is cross-cultural and interracial, which gives our heroes a lot of complications to work through -- the language barrier is just the start. Granted, it's a fantasy planet unrelated to Earth, so there's no exact 1:1\u00a0representation of real-world races and ethnicities...but you'd still need actors from around the world to play the cast in the big live-action Netflix adaptation. (Full disclosure: There are, currently, no plans for a big live-action Netflix adaptation. Hear that, Amazon Prime? You still have a chance!) The part you've all been waiting for! Exclusive bonus for people who back early: The\u00a0first 15 backers who pledged at least $10 got to request a Leif & Thorn bonus sketch -- any characters, any scenario, canon or AU. They'll be used in the book to fill up extra spaces, at the bottom of pages or the end of chapters.\u00a0 Like this, only more so: If your pledge includes a paperback book, I'll slip the original lineart in the package with it. And you'll be thanked on the credits page as an early backer, no matter what tier you're in. The only limits on the sketches are (a) the content has to be safe-for-work, and\u00a0(b) it can't spoil anything that happens in future storylines. (Hold on\u00a0to those ideas for the Volume 3 campaign!) Open to everyone! Don't see the exact combination of swag you want? Scroll to the end for the add-ons menu. All tiers with paperback books include a Volume 2 campaign-exclusive mini-print, chosen by the results of this poll. If you missed the Volume 1 campaign, don't worry -- there are tiers to get both books together! (You did miss the print that was exclusive to that campaign, though. Sorry.) Want an extra book? Got a friend, family member, and/or local\u00a0library who would appreciate a copy? Or maybe there's a whole combination of merch you want that just isn't covered by existing reward levels. Well, here's how to fix that. As we reached milestones on the way to the goal, we celebrated by revealing a never-before-seen full-cast portrait...one section at a time. The complete piece has 90+ characters, all at different scales corresponding to their popularity -- as determined by this massive reader poll. As of 60 backers, the whole thing has been unlocked! Some financial and technical details: Why Kickstarter? Because I can't pull a couple thousand dollars out-of-pocket to do a print run. (Even when I know readers would buy the book afterward.) A Kickstarter campaign lets me bring a bunch of people together for pre-orders, so I can fund the printing upfront. Plus, it's fun. And it worked beautifully for Volume 1. Where exactly is the money going? Here's a pie chart!\u00a0 The extra $10 is to buy myself a pizza once we're funded. \u00a0What happens if we make more than the goal? Well, first of all, that means we have more backers than expected -- so some of the extra cash goes toward making all of their rewards. If we seriously overfund, I'll add stretch goals, unlocking extra merchandise and other goodies. Details are being kept secret until we pass the original goal. \u00a0How long will it take me to get my book? Here's the planned timeline!\u00a0 This is the same as the Volume 1 timeline. It builds in plenty of time to handle unforeseen delays and mix-ups -- we had some of those on the first round, and because of this careful planning, we still ended up shipping right on schedule. If we're lucky, Volume 2 will come together even faster! Either way, I'll keep the backers up-to-date with every step. That's everything you need to know about Leif & Thorn Volume 2! Thank you so much for your interest and support. After the campaign deadline has passed, watch the comic's website for buying information, news about future volumes, and, as always, the latest strips. See you again in Volume 3!",
  "The first day of a job is never easy, but for apprentice hangman Vincent Knott, it couldn't be worse.\u00a0 Nervous, studious and sweet by nature, Vincent is desperate to avoid performing his first execution- even moreso after meeting the charming, foolish and condemned student wizard Will Sharpe, who is set to hang the following morning. But is Will guilty of the despicable magical crime he's been accused of, or is he a single unwitting thread in a terribly tangled truth? Aided by his best friend, conspiracy theorist extraordinaire Eliza Swift, Vincent has just one night to unravel the mystery,\u00a0before he and Will are due their deadly appointment on the gallows. \u00a0Widdershins is a series of light-hearted Victorian-era adventure stories set in West Yorkshire, England. \u00a0An ongoing webcomic since 2011, it has been nominated for awards, praised for the writing and characterisation, and can be read online for free, starting right here! This volume, the eighth in the series, can easily be enjoyed without having read the prior stories- but since it's always more fun to catch up, every physical copy will come with downloadable high-resolution copies of all eight volumes! That's nearly 900 pages of comic! There's also a Multi Book tier if you missed out on a previous volume or two, or even buy all eight at once with the Complete Collection tier! \u00a0All of the Widdershins books are full-colour, A5 landscape softcovers packed with magical adventures and enjoyable yarns about bounty hunters, accidental thiefkings, food-based time travel, and much more. Hangman's Knot is approximately 100 pages in length, with a little room for extras, if we get past our funding goal! All of the artwork for the comic is completed, so as with previous projects, there should be very little delay in getting it to the printers. Multi Book Tier: We're going to try this one a little differently this year, in an attempt to simplify the reward tiers. If you've missed a few of the previous Widdershins books but don't require the complete collection, back the Multi Book tier, and use this helpful Multi Book Tier Calculator to work out exactly what your pledge should be, with shipping included. Adjust your pledge to the Grand Total which fits your shipping location, and when it comes time to ship the rewards, I'll send you a survey asking which particular books you want. UK Multi Book/Complete Collection Tiers: If you're in the UK and you're ordering more than 6 books, your order may be split up over 2 parcels to reduce your postage costs.\u00a0 Can't see a tier that includes everything you'd like? Just message me, email at kate@kateashwin.com or tweet me at @katedrawscomics and we'll work it out! All money raised will go directly to printing the book, delivery supplies, and postage. If we're lucky enough to make any extra funds, it'll go toward keeping the webcomic running- website hosting, reprints of older books, extra merch, travel for conventions, keeping the artist in food and tea, etc. which lets me keep updating Widdershins twice a week every week!\u00a0 We may end up doing some small stretch goals to improve the quality of the printed version and add extra pages, depending on how well the campaign goes. \u00a0I'm Kate Ashwin, and I've been putting comics on the internet for nearly two decades now! I live in West Yorkshire, with two fat cats and a very understanding husband, and I'm lucky enough to be doing this whole internet comic thing for a full time job. You can follow me on Twitter\u00a0for any project updates, notifications of new webcomic pages, and pictures of aforementioned fat cats. Without the support of you fine folks via Kickstarter and Patreon, I wouldn't be able to do this mindbendingly cool thing for a living, so I am wildly appreciative, and hope to keep making fun and interesting comics for you all for many years to come.",
  "Unique Dyslexic Eye Podcasting and Broadcasting\u00a0 Below is a link to a podcast dyslexia friendly version \u00a0of Unique Dyslexic Eye Kickstarter: \u00a0Podcast Version of this Kickstarter\u00a0 I founded my social enterprise Dyslexia Pathways CIC 12 years ago. This year we embarked on a new venture. This was our response to Corona and lock down. This year I passed and HND in Broadcasting. We founded two new accessible and inclusive podcasting and broadcasting social media pages called Unique Dyslexic Eye. My Steve Unique Dyslexic McCue blog has had over 270.000 views and our aim is to bring that success to our podcasting and broadcasting. Our overall goal is to support and nurture the mental health and well being of the dyslexic and neuro diverse communities. On our podcasts and broadcasts we play exclusively music and poetry written and performed by dyslexic and neuro diverse musicians. We also raise awareness of the positives of being dyslexic and neuro diverse and I give advice an guidance on how to succeed and overcome barriers to employment and education. When I founded Dyslexia Pathways CIC I wanted to offer a different vision. One that challenged the idea that dyslexia and neuro diversity is about disability and discrepancy. To do this we promote a social model of dyslexia which focuses on the idea that dyslexia and neuro diversity is about diversity and difference. We see our social model and social enterprise model as an innovative, inclusive and positive way forward. We do not see being dyslexic or neuro diverse as a problem. We believe it is society that disables us and this begins at school which are still dyslexia and neuro diverse unfriendly. Unique Dyslexic Eye is entirely self funded and independent: Click on the link below: \u00a0A podcast why I promote the social model of dyslexia through social enterprise\u00a0 About Unique Dyslexic Eye just click on the link below: Podcast on my dyslexia and social enterprise\u00a0 Our latest Broadcast Just click on the link below: \u00a0Our latest podcast\u00a0 Here is a review of the show from one of our listeners: \"Excellent! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f Very intellectual and informative. Helps listeners improve quality of life skills for people that are dyslexia. Not too long and easy to listen to. Looking forward to more!\" What I am seeking funds for: I am seeking funds to further develop and build the podcasting and broadcasting we have started. These are much more accessible than my blog. I want to \u00a0build and develop this into a global community for dyslexic and neuro diverse communities. I want to try and tackle the isolation that many dyslexics and neuro diverse people face. This is already being done through social media where I have over 4,000 followers just on one social media site. The podcast and broadcasts will enable us to do this in a more accessible and effective manner. I am going develop our Unique Dyslexic website so we can support people who are creative in dyslexic and neuro diverse communities. Part of the money raised will go towards this. More to the point Unique Dyslexic Eye's social model of dyslexia and social enterprise focus provides a more inclusive and positive vision that challenges the idea that dyslexia and neuro diversity is about disability and discrepancy. \u00a0Unique Dyslexic Website to be developed to Unique Dyslexic Eye\u00a0 Many thanks for reading Steve McCue",
  "The 2015 Season at The Echo Theatre, 15 North 100 East Street, Provo, Utah.\n\n SHOWS INCLUDE: \n ABOUT US \n The Echo Theatre has come a long way since its humble beginnings in 2012. We produce nine full-length plays (including musicals) every year, as well as Short Play Festival featuring the works of up-and-coming playwrights from all over America. Our goal is to provide the best independent theater in Utah County. We receive no government funding and are completely reliant upon our patrons and donors for support. \n\n MISSION STATEMENT\n Anyone can create. They just need a place and an opportunity.\n\n REVIEWS of PAST ECHO PRODUCTIONS\n \u00a0\u201cThe moment I stepped into the Echo Theatre I was surprised, excited, and yet also unsure. While the Echo Theatre is unique for the fact that it is located on the upper level of a traditional brick building what really was surprising was the quite small space in which the production was held\u2026. When I sat down I had two thoughts: 1) this production could be very poorly done since it\u2019s such a small space, and 2) the charm of this small venue could allow for the audience to be pulled into this musical. I easily expected the first scenario to occur, but as the production progressed (really hitting its stride in act two) the cast and their performances grew on me. Their clear heartfelt delivery seemed to resonate with me as they sang the beautifully written songs about making hard choices, learning to grow, and facing their consequences.\u201d \u2014 Peter Harrison, Utah Theatre Bloggers Association (UTBA), on the Echo Theatre Production of Into the Woods.\n\n \u201cThe Echo Theatre Microbox\u2019s Streetcar [Named Desire] was an intriguing and unusual sort of production. Despite the play\u2019s colorful reputation and the nontraditional performance space, the Echo nailed it. After a bit of a slow start and some time to get used to the characters, I found myself feeling just the right amount of discomfort and rapture at the lives unfolding before me in that tiny space\u2026. You won\u2019t find many plays that get more personal or up close than this. Go see the show\u2026!\u201d \u2014 Paige Guthrie, Utah Theatre Bloggers Association (UTBA)\n\n \u201cThe Echo\u2019s production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, set in a post-apocalyptic world, breaks all the rules about what this Shakespeare comedy should be\u2026. I have lost count of the number of times that I have seen A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Yet, the unique visual style and the dark setting revitalized the show. This isn\u2019t a typical Midsummer, which make it an enjoyable evening for both newcomers to Shakespeare and veteran audience members [alike].\u201d \u2014 Russell Warne, Utah Theatre Bloggers Association (UTBA)\n\n HOW YOUR DONATION WILL HELP\u00a0 You generous donation will support our plays of the 2015 season with the expenses of\u2026\u00a0 Expenses your donation will not cover:\u00a0 OTHER WAYS TO HELP\n\n If you\u2019d also like to help in other ways, we often need assistance with our sets! Send us your e-mail to let us know you\u2019d like to help build or tear-down sets, and we\u2019ll let you know when you can come over and join in! \n\n Also, you can extend this invitation to as many people as possible by sharing the URL on Facebook, Twitter, and through e-mail. Please use the hashtag #echotheatre2015 to help spread the word!  \n Share, Post, Like, Follow, and Tweet about this fundraiser to all your FRIENDS and FAMILY! \n Follow Echo News by subscribing to our mailing list: http://www.theechotheatre.com/\n\u00a0 Follow current and upcoming productions at The Echo Theatre on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram! \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheEchoTheatre\n Thank you for your support of great community theatre!

  "\u00a0***UPDATE**** We hit our first stretch goal, so now all pre-ordered blu-rays will come with reversible cover art and all $50 and up backers will also get free 'Jessie' rolling papers with their orders! And now we have another stretch goal! If we can hit $27,420 ALL $50 AND UP PRE-ORDERS will include another blu-ray! That's right, the long out of print film 'Harvest Lake', starring Ellie Church, Tristan Risk, Jason Crowe, and Dan Nye will be back in print, and you'll be the first to get it FOR FREE! If we do not make this goal, we will not be able to replicate these region free, professionally replicated discs, and Harvest Lake will remain out of print, so PLEASE help spread the word, upgrade your pledge if you are able, and let's get Harvest Lake back in print! We hit our initial goal! Our initial goal was set as the bare minimum to cover the costs of disc replication, manufacturing all other perks, and shipping costs, minus Kickstarters fees. We would love to continue making films, but we need to reach much further for that to continue happening! Our first of hopefully many stretch goals has been announced, and the more orders we get, the more YOU get with your order, so please share the campaign far and wide to help us achieve our goals! Mostly Harmless Pictures is proud to announce the completion of Brian K. Williams' third film, 'JESSIE'S SUPER NORMAL REGULAR AVERAGE DAY'.\u00a0 It stars Ellie Church, (High on the Hog, Frankenstein Created Bikers) \u00a0Allison Maier, (Space Babes from Outer Space, Spring Break Zombie Massacre) and Alyss Winkler (Plankface, Amazon Hot Box) This is NOT your super normal regular average stoner comedy! It is filled to the brim with science fiction, alternate universes, time travel, fight scenes, topless nuns wielding giant bladed soft pink chainsaws, a crazy tv preacher, explicit drug use, beautiful locations, an omnipotent snail, and all kinds of general weirdness. Imagine if Douglas Adams, writer of 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' wrote and directed 'Dude, Where's my Car?' It's that kind of weird. It also features a killer ska/punk soundtrack, a late 90's vibe, and was shot in beautiful 4k. It is by far my most beautiful, cinematic, and interesting film to date. This is NOT your super normal regular average Kickstarter campaign! I have been a part of multiple successful Kickstarter campaigns in the past, (Plank Face, Space Babes from Outer Space, Amazon Hot Box) and anyone who has been kind enough to have donated to any of them will tell you, we deliver quality products on time, every time. Making films is my biggest passion, and while it is difficult enough to make it in today's market, it is made even harder by fly by night 'filmmakers' ripping people off, and/or delivering late with over priced, sub par products, turning people away from crowdfunding all together. I \u00a0have a proven track record of success and delivering on all promises on time, and want you to feel safe and secure in your choice of backing this campaign. This is NOT a 'please give us money to help us make this movie' campaign! The movie is SHOT! The movie is EDITED! The movie is SCORED! The movie is DONE! It's ready to have it's booty smacked, and tossed out into the world kicking and screaming, and THAT'S where you come in.\u00a0 By pre-ordering, you will be helping to cover the costs of disc manufacturing, artwork, postage, shipping materials, promotional materials, deliverable costs, hard drives, and perhaps most importantly, allowing me to pay the bills and survive long enough to get a jump start on the NEXT movie. Making films in secret, and not announcing/promoting it until it is finished and ready to order has been the model I have followed for a few years now, and it truly is the support of people like you that keep this model going, and make it possible for me to continue doing what I do.\u00a0Thank you so much for reading, please check out the trailer, please pre-order the film, and please tell your friends!",

  "Hi, we're Jonathan and Adrian. \u00a0We are the hosts of Wargaming Recon. \u00a0Wargaming Recon is the longest-running tabletop wargaming podcast in existence. \u00a0 For over 14 years we've brought you informative, recreational, and educational podcast episodes covering all aspects of our hobby. \u00a0You've trusted Wargaming Recon to review everything from rules by Warlord Games to wet palettes, gaming mats by Cigar Box Battle to MDF buildings by Things from the Basement, and everything else in between.\u00a0 We've interviewed award winning filmmakers like Joseph Piddington about Miniature Wargaming The Movie and Steve Wollett about Word From a Gamer, best-selling authors like Henry Hyde, talented game designers like David Ensteness, Parsec finalist podcasters like Peter Bryant & Mike Kafes of the Mythwits, first-rate convention organizers like Steve & Angelia Parenteau of TotalCon, and internationally known minis painters like Tony Rieger & Dave Shuster of Iron Hammer Studio.\u00a0 The team also worked to normalize mental health and its importance among all people. \u00a0The show regularly features guests discussing how tabletop wargaming helps them in their struggle with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. \u00a0In 2019, I (Jonathan) frankly spoke of my battle against anxiety and depression. \u00a0That episode resonated with listeners to become one of the most downloaded and talked about in Wargaming Recon's history. \u00a0For 2020, we will have a licensed therapist and author with a doctorate from Oxford coming on the show to address these very issues. In the past, the show has been a top fundraising team with the Extra Life charity. \u00a0Extra Life raises money to pay for the medical help kids need when their families cannot afford to pay. \u00a0No child should go without essential medical care. \u00a0Wargaming Recon has hosted 24 hour game-a-thons, live stream, and social media blasts to promote this charity and raise funds for kids in need. \u00a0We're committed to the variety of ways we can give back to the communities around us. Now, Wargaming Recon needs your help. To complete a 2020 podcast season, we can't do it alone. \u00a0Wargaming Recon has grown into a multimedia organization featuring our popular podcast (sitting in the top 18-20% of podcasts globally), video content, and blog articles. \u00a0We have a variety of expenses from review products, convention fees, equipment purchases, hosting, and even staff. We've tried other funding methods. Even with those methods, we're still unable to cover our costs. \u00a0Many expenses come out of my (Jonathan's) pocket. \u00a0With two little girls at home, I can no longer afford to pay for these things on my own. Our goal of $1,200 will allow us to produce a shorter 2020 season. \u00a0Reaching the stretch goal makes a full season a reality. In 2020, we plan to have more guests discussing game design, rules design, art creation, and their Kickstarters. We will spend more time reviewing gaming products from rules to paints, from terrain to miniatures, and tools to board games. We will attend MORE gaming events to report on what actually happens in the gaming scene. We will diversify our collective voice by expanding our stable of co-hosts. We will expand our coverage through the addition of authors from across the globe to write for our website. We will have more video content, more social media interaction, and more time to bring YOU the content you love. None of this is cheap. \u00a0But, we do it because we care about this hobby that we all love. \u00a0We do it because we care about the tabletop wargaming community. \u00a0We do it because we want to give back.",
  "After years of trying to convince the King to re-release his legendary records, he has agreed! Songs and videos that helped actually make music videos a \"thing\".....even before there was an MTV are being brought back to life. Before there were \"music videos\"...the King made music videos. \u00a0Before there was a WWF Wrestling Album....the King had already made TWO! These records had a very limited run in the 1970s and early 1980's and many estimate that only a couple hundred have survived. \u00a0 We're here to preserve Memphis wrestling history and the Kings collectibles to share with his 50 years of fans around the planet.

  "Archimedes is a Bipolar Dynamic Signal Manipulator that is designed for the Eurorack Modular Synthesizer format.\u00a0 The module is 10hp wide, 38mm deep, and the current draw is: 90mA on +12 / 90mA on -12. Archimedes takes in a +5 / -5 volt signal (Oscillator, LFO, Noise, Random) and processes the positive and negative sections separately with CV control over everything, and is AC / DC capable as there is no filtering on all of the inputs and outputs.\n\u00a0 It is comprised of 3 linear sections: \n2 Bipolar Rectifiers -> Offset -> 2 Bipolar Limiting Rails This module has a lot of uses: CV able bipolar half wave rectification over the positive and negative sections of a bipolar input signal, full wave rectification, VCA, bipolar VCA, crossfader, offset, CV able bipolar limiting rails, feedback path destroyer, wave shaping, distortion, asymmetrical & symmetrical clipping, and more. The final prototype (pilot) for Archimedes has been thoroughly tested and is ready for launch and all the design work has been finished, but we need to\u00a0spend a fair amount of money to buy components in quantity, PCBs, as well as get anodized aluminum metal photo front panels.

  "Ekko is a modern Bluetooth-enabled wireless amplifier that lets you listen to your music with any (decent/legit/amazing) speaker.  Our great-sounding, lithium battery-powered amplifier is perfect for people who enjoy the convenience of bluetooth music through their mobile devices, but want a better listening experience than what current bluetooth speakers can squeak out.\u00a0 http://www.ekkoamp.com/ The Ekko was designed to play the best untethered Bluetooth music possible; in contrast most Bluetooth speakers today compromise for superficial high tech looks and portability, often at the expense of sound quality. We value the listening experience more so we created the Ekko to push the limits of Bluetooth music! With the Ekko, we give a powerful semi-audiophile system that provides unbeatable sound price-to-performance ratio. Even more expensive bluetooth speakers from top brands can't deliver the full spectrum of music that bookshelf speakers can when paired with the Ekko. The Ekko is perfect for music fans with discerning ears, whether you\u2019re looking to hang out by the pool with your favorite playlist, or needing a convenient streaming music player worthy of your home entertainment system. The Ekko has a streamlined minimalist design that embodies simplicity because it's all about the sound; music lovers can finally have a sound-quality-first system with a sleek aesthetic. Its easy connectivity and long battery life combine to create a functional and versatile device for any set of speakers that can be played anywhere.  Ekko works by bringing powered wireless capability to real speakers.\u00a0This means you can connect Ekko to any type of speaker. With 5.25\u201d bookshelf speakers, Ekko can easily last over 12 hours with the music cranked way up. With smaller speakers, playtime will last even longer! From top-rated bookshelf speakers to professional studio monitors, we guarantee you\u2019ll hear the difference! Just take a look at the specs and see all the great features Ekko has to offer: - Convenient Bluetooth connectivity - 3.5 mm line in jack for lossless audio - High capacity lithium batteries for long, continuous playtime -\u00a02 USB ports to charge mobile devices for lots of backup power on the go - Digital Amplifier provides a loud and clear music experience every time! The Ekko is one of the most cost-effective ways to get the best Bluetooth music. We focused on delivering the best sound by bringing powered bluetooth capability to tried-and-tested speakers in the market. This allows music lovers to use their favorite speakers, or to research and buy the best speakers for their needs to get the best bang for their buck.\u00a0 Connect:\n\u200bBluetooth 4 (wireless) and 3.5mm input jack (lossless) Output Power:\u00a0\u200b15 watts per channel (optimized for bookshelf and studio monitor speakers) Output Impedance: 8 Ohms Frequency Range:\u00a020Hz to 20kHz (please review) Product Dimensions: \u200b 5.6\" (L) x 3\" (W) x 2.5\" (H)\u00a0 Power Supply: 12v People used to invest in high-end audio component systems to listen to their CDs and cassettes, but not anymore. Today, people have shifted to streaming music through their smartphones, often skipping home audio systems that remain tethered to wall outlets and unable to play well with mobile devices. Because of this, teens and young adults came of age with ear buds, laptop speakers, and Bluetooth speakers that fail to deliver the full spectrum of good music; many have forgotten or have never really experienced the pleasures of listening to real, good quality speakers. This is where Ekko comes in to help you enjoy great wireless music without overspending. If you already have a speaker setup, especially if it's stuck with an older audio system that doesn't get used much, we can make it better. Ekko is an ideal solution to stream Bluetooth music to your existing stereo speakers. Why not enjoy hifi music if you have a decent audio system just gathering dust at home. If you don\u2019t have speakers of your own yet, we have included unbeatable packages, thanks to discounted bulk-purchase pricing through this kickstarter campaign. Featuring handpicked reference and bookshelf speakers from Klipsch and Polk Audio. These packages are perfect if you are just starting to explore beyond earbuds and portable Bluetooth speakers. These speakers are tested and guaranteed to work seamlessly with the Ekko to provide music clarity and quality sound every time. These speakers will also grow with you as you begin to explore the world of quality sound and music. Our main focus has always been to deliver the best possible Bluetooth listening experience. We wanted to create a product that delivered bigger and better sound without holding listeners down to their living rooms. We wanted a product that enables Bluetooth connectivity and powers any speaker so everyone could benefit from better music. Ekko is the perfect wireless amplifier for music lovers. It doesn\u2019t matter if you already have your favorite speakers you could take on the road, or if you are still looking for the perfect set of speakers to suit your taste and budget. Ekko works with whatever you\u2019ve got.

  "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You may know or you may not but Randy Butterknubs: Awakening is a short film made by the cousins years ago. It is a story with no real plot...all you needed to know was that Randy was coming and Jimmy Crumpet had to stop him. Along the way Jimmy Crumpet (Humphrey) had met many characters. Manticore (Drew), Dances with Squirrels (Gerald), Randy (Alex), and Randy's Evil Henchman (Hunter and Thomas), and even a Cameo from Nana, Kim, \u00a0Copeland. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This project we made was almost forgotten but we have revisited the source material and decided to bring the film back. We are now capable of so much more and want to make a six year old film into a new age. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some Characters can't return, and some others may not. But for the ones who can't return we plan to make this film in a way that would make them happy and make them laugh. The budget for the film that we have set is to cover the costs of the costumes and other expenses, since we plan to take this a bit more serious.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I can't afford to make this investment on my own and I am mostly asking family and those involved in the film to contribute. Thank you so much and we hope to be able to create something that would not only be our proudest work, but also something to represent the creative, crazy, and unique nature of our family.",

She is proud to be a co-founder of This Is It. Beauty, being able to focus on her three passions. This Is It.\u2019s conception and development came about organically. The two founders, long-term friends from London and LA, had a serendipitous meeting of minds on a trip to NYC about clean living and wellness. The philosophical discussions evolved into planning how to create a skincare brand that celebrates being clean, ethical, communal, and conscious. Being surrounded by exceptional creatives, the founders gathered a rock star team of professionals who helped turn our vision into a fully realized brand. They set the highest standards when searching for the best botanicals growers and most advanced scientific methods.\u00a0 Your generous support will help us obtain funds so that we can resolve current logistics expenses, and start procuring raw materials for our next batch.

  "My humorous, semi-autobiographical webcomic has been running since I was but a stressed university student in 2012, and will finally be coming to an end this year. But mourn not, for I'm compiling all the comics from April 2015 onwards into a huge hardcover, including the Junior Paleontologist Power Hour comics, four years of hourlies, all the minis and journos, and hopefully some very special guest comics that will be revealed throughout the course of the Kickstarter. Plus, I'll still be making journos for the foreseeable future, so JSPH's spirit will never truly die... But now there'll be TWO WHOLE PHYSICAL BOOKS of my funny lil comics! Volume 1 of Junior Scientist Power Hour was no small fellow at 220 pages, but Volume 2 will be a chunky buddy at over 300, chock full of extras.

  "EXTREMELY COMPACT & PORTABLE A 200-watt guitar amplifier that can be picked up with one hand. Massive power that can fit into a backpack. Truely portable high-voltage tube distortion tones that every guitar player has dreamt about. Well, the dream is finally here.\u00a0 GA1.1 Demo by Jackel Pun - GA1.1 Metal Demo \u00a0by Jeffrey So - GA1.1 Clean Demo ---Let's get into the details.. *High Voltage Class-A Tube Preamp The GA1.1 uses full analogue circuitry in the pre-amp section. Equipped with two 12AX7 and one 12AY7 tubes, provide everything from crispy clean to aggressive distortion tones for any style of music.\u00a0 Three Channels provide completely different tonal options. Channel 1, from clean to overdrive.Channel 2, from clean to metal. Channel 3 from overdrive to metal. *Comp, Thick, Deep, Focus, Boost \"Deep\" switch provides more bass distortion while\u00a0\"Focus\" rolls off the bass and increases high mid harmonics. \"Thick\" is dedicated to channel 3 and  increases the rich, mid harmonics that fit the demanding tone of modern metal. \"Comp\" decreases amp headroom in order to provide a tube tone compressor. \"Boost\" which sends a hotter signal to the output tube, resulting in a  fuller harmonic and saturated tone. *Digital Tone Control The 2x5 bands digital tone control for channel 2 and 3. Active 5 bands (+/- 8db) instead of the traditional 3 bands to fit the creativity of modern guitar players. *200 Watts 2 Channels Class-D Power Output Class-D amplifier provides a wide audio frequency response and is extremely sensitive to transient attack and punch. Different from traditional tube power sections, the GA1.1 provides a more massive low-end punch and crispier high-end detail. And most importantly, it doesn't degrade over time so no service is needed.\u00a0 *3 Cabinet Simulator in all output channels Cabinet simulator provides three different speaker models. Not only can you send these cabinet-simulated signals to your audio interface or a PA system, but also connect your passive hifi speakers to the \"Main Speaker\" output. That means, any speaker can be used as a guitar cab.\u00a0 No bass player in the band? No problem! The \"Sub Speaker\" output provides various low-pass filters, it is designed to connect to a bass cabinet, in order to provide a sub woofer to your guitar tone. This is where the name of the amp comes from. Of course, you can still connect the \"Sub Speaker\" output to another guitar cabinet, or another hifi speaker if you think 100 watts is not loud enough to disturb your neighbours...  *Noise Gate Single-knob-controlled noise gate that is triggered (side chain) by your guitar pickup output to control the distorted output signal. Since the clean guitar signal has more dynamics than the heavy distortion signal, it is extremely effective and more sensitive than most noise gate effect pedals. *Effect Loops 2 separated Effect Loops for \"main\" and \"sub\" outputs, can be defeated by foot switch. *Balanced Line DI Output Electronics-balanced line DI output for recording or PA system. Independent cabinet simulator for this output. *DC 9V Power for Effect Pedals Low noise linear regulated DC 9V (1000mA) output on the back panel of the amp and the remote foot switch.\u00a0 --- \u00a0* Available in two Colours - Black & White White body with Maple side panel Black body with Walnut side panel *Dimension 32cm(w) x 7.5cm(h) x 16.6cm(d)\n*excluding knobs and plugs Weight2kg (estimated) * 6 Button Foot-Switch with 9V DC Output *Pick Design\u00a0- Black or Transparent --",
  "\u00a0Hi! We're Suzana Harcum and Owen White\u2014 the artist and writer behind Tripping Over You, a bi-weekly gay webcomic! \u00a0We're a married lesbian couple, we love making comics together, and we especially love telling stories about LGBT couples. Our comic\u00a0Tripping Over You\u00a0is about two young men who start a fumbling romantic relationship\u2014 and trip over each other's feet along the way. We post pages of TOY for free online at www.trippingoveryou.com, but sometimes we collect a bunch of chapters and put them in a graphic novel\u2014 and now we'd like to do that again! We're starting this campaign in order to self-publish Volume 5 of our comic and make it available in print.\u00a0 \u00a0Here's a look at everything we've added to the campaign through stretch goals: If you are on one of our tiers that include pins, you're welcome to swap out either of the previous designs for these new ones\u2014 or even to add these to your package! Add $9 USD to any enamel pin tier for each additional pin you'd like to add!\u00a0 (Please only do this for tiers that already include the pin set! \u2665 There are tiers that include both a book and pins, as well as a couple other item combinations!) Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see detailed previews of each item as they become available! Now back to the campaign! \u00a0We\u2019d like to print our fifth book in the series as our fifth Kickstarter project! (Here are the links to our previous campaigns: one, two, three, and four.)\u00a0 \u00a0Each time we self-publish a volume of our story through Kickstarter, the process becomes more and more familiar for us. We are also very fortunate to have Hiveworks Comics in our corner this time around to help us with printing, to help us offer an even smoother and more convenient experience for our backers! \u00a0We really like the way Kickstarter's back-end lets us organize and keep track of backers; it gives us a really efficient platform to be able to take pre-orders for the new volume. It also lets us offer incentive rewards to our backers for reaching certain goals. \u00a0Volume 5 will contain chapters 15 and 16 of Tripping Over You (which are both currently available to read on our website), along with the intermission 4koma style comics at the end of both chapters. The end result will be 140 pages of full-color comic pages, up to some of the most recent (as of writing this) pages of TOY.\u00a0 \u00a0Here are some preview pages from the book: \u00a0To follow the same model as our previous Kickstarters, we\u2019re hoping to print 1000 copies of Volume 5 to start.\u00a0This lowers the cost of each book and helps us keep the sale price consistent between volumes. \u00a0Our goal of $8,000 will allow us to print 1000 copies of Volume 5, as well as to cover shipping costs for the minimum number of backers we would need to fund this campaign. It also helps us to do reprints of any of the previous four volumes if necessary for fulfillment of this project.\u00a0Any potential funds we raise beyond that point will go toward unlocking bonus merchandise as stretch goals\u2014 or to adding freebies automatically to each tier that involves physical shipping.\u00a0 FREE WITH EVERY PURCHASE OF VOLUME 5: \u00a0\u00a0Flatter, bigger, and easier to ship with your reward package, we're offering Kickstarter exclusive stickers this time around! This is a free gift from us to say thank you to those who Kick'D TOY during the campaign! We will include a free sticker with every tier that includes a physical item. \u00a0With every purchase of Volume 5, we'll include these two prints for free! These fit perfectly snug inside the front cover of the book, and that's where we'll tuck them in for safety during shipping! Above is a preview of the matching prints this time around\u2014 both prints inspired by this sequence in the comic. ADD-ON ITEMS, AVAILABLE ON SELECT TIERS: \u00a0For reaching our $10,000 stretch goal, we've added tiers that include this two-pack of hard enamel pins! (For reaching our $15,000 goal, we added two more designs to choose from, as well!) Wearable, shiny, and colorful! You're welcome to select any two designs come fulfillment time if you're on a pin tier\u2014 or you can add $9 USD to any pin tier for each additional design you'd like to receive! \u00a0Those who pledge on a tier that includes a head-sketch will have the choice of a receiving a bookplate featuring a sketch from either artist (and on some tiers, both artists), as well as their choice of whichever character(s) they would like drawn on it. This bookplate will be signed by both creators and personalized just for you! For each Volume we print, we collect all of the 18+ extra stories we've made alongside the comic and offer them in a mini-booklet form, as a compendium to the printed book. This time around, our 18+ mini-book features the released extra Brace Yourself, as well as two brand new 18+ stories made alongside this campaign! These two extras are titled Self Care, and Can't Look!\u00a0 CREDITS VIDEO MUSIC:\u00a0Sparks by Cha\u00ebl (Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported \u2014 CC BY 3.0)",
  "'32 Kick-Up is an action/comedy webcomic that's been running since 2016. The simplest way to describe it is a mix of Mickey Mouse, Scarface, and Dragonball. It follows the adventures of two short-sighted kids, the arrogant Patricia-Marie and her humble best friend Calloway. After Calloway's 2nd cousin and guardian is kidnapped by the crime boss, Mr. Tierney, the two find themselves fighting the mob through the guidance of Patty's idol, the street vigilante who goes under the moniker \"the Bridgeport Bruiser,\" real name Helvetia. '32 Kick-Up Vol 1 is a 185 pg 5 x 7.5 inch paperback. It features chapters 1-8 of the comic, plus more than 20 pages of bonus content, which includes behind the scenes notes on my creative process, as well as sketchbook pages showing the evolution of the story and characters to their final state. The extras are intended to lay bare my creative process and attempt to demystify creativity in general. I want it to be more than just a curiosity and to encourage aspiring creators to work on their own projects and fight off those doubts and insecurities that everyone has to go through. Backers have multiple tiers to choose from. If this Kickstarter manages to exceed it's goal, there are a few stretch goals available. The books will be shipped using USPS. Shipping inside the US is relatively problem free, at a flat rate of $5. But for orders outside of the country (including Canada, to my surprise) the price for shipping jumps up to $30. I feel this needs to be spelled out clearly. Silly Rookie (Perry Renarldo Singletary Jr.) is a cartoonist from Springfield, MA. I studied Sequential Art and Animation at the Savannah College of Art and Design, and I've worked for studios like Lab Zero Games, Oddbot, and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios.

  "** LAST UPDATE #4: Strangebeard pinup by Scott Chantler! ** The final update before the end of this curious and interesting campaign... Canadian cartooning legend Scott Chantler is our final pinup artist! He is the creator of the Three Thieves series from Kids Can Press, and the mind behind the amazing Two Generals. Check him out at his swank new website! ** UPDATE #3: Strangebeard pinup by Troy Little! ** Troy Little, the terrific artist of the comic adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as well as Chiaroscuro, Angora Napkin and Rick & Morty VS Dungeons & Dragons, is our latest pinup artist! ** UPDATE #2: Strawberry Sam pinup by Brenda Hickey! ** The second pinup artist is revealed, and it's none other than Brenda Hickey, the amazing artist of My Little Pony, Ward's Valley and Halls of the Turnip King! Brenda is a huge talent and we're so happy to have her aboard! ** UPDATE #1: Strangeduck pinup by Tad Stones! ** Since we've passed the 25% mark, here's the first pinup artist... Disney Afternoon legend (and creator of Darkwing Duck) Tad Stones! \u00a0Tad is one of my favorite people in the business and an absolute legend, and I couldn't be happier to have him aboard! But where do you go from here when the five remaining super-powered Pirate Masters are hunting for your head? Strangebeard 2 answers that question and more, as Jenny sets in motion her plans to capture the remaining Effects of Strangebeard (whose combination will grant ownership over the ocean!) and vanquish the next Pirate Master on her list. But Jenny will have to grow up fast in this merciless new world of pirates and sea monsters, and she will find that danger comes not only from her super-powered enemies... but from her own darkening mind. Strangebeard 2: Electric Bugaboo is a 128-page story that collects Parts Six through Ten of the Strangebeard epic webcomic, which you can read at Strangebeard.com right now. A complete arc starting with Jenny's hunt for The Merchant King and his mechanical t-rex/pirate ship Shiprex, it continues through to the epic battle between Jenny and both Boss Bradshaw (The Electric Pirate) and the sea monster Sargassus. The good news is this: I'm nearly done! The complete Volume 2 of Strangebeard is almost in the tank and it will be done by the time the campaign ends. Once I've finished the design work and fully assembled the work from my A-list pinup artists, the book will ready for print... with your much-appreciated assistance! You'll be able to buy copies of either book, both books, and you can pick up some artwork to boot. It's a win/win! Strangebeard 2: Electric Bugaboo will be limited to 500 copies and will contain the following: \u2022 128 pulse-pounding all-ages full-colour pages in softcover! \u2022 A tasty pinup section containing all-new Strangebeard art from artists to be revealed every week of the campaign! \u2022 A truly fantastic foreword from Gideon Defoe, the author of The Pirates! book series and the writer of the Aardman film adaptation The Pirates! Band of Misfits. And, not insignificantly, I will be reprinting Strangebeard, Volume 1: The Ghost Pirate's Gift, which has been out of print for a year. I'm going to remaster the artwork and fix up a few colour and character inconsistencies, and fix a couple of spelling mistakes. It'll look even better than before. Let's bring it back! The 500-copy reprint of Strangebeard, Volume 1: The Ghost Pirate's Gift will consist of the following: \u2022 128 pulse-pounding full-colour pages covering Parts One through Five of Strangebeard! \u2022 Remastered artwork with improved colour! \u2022 I'll fix that one spelling mistake from the end of the book that really bothers me! \u2022 A truly astounding pinup section featuring drawings by Riley Rossmo, Tom Fowler, Fiona Staples, Mike Rooth, Lar DeSouza, Tim Sale, and more! See more about the book at my very first Kickstarter right here! Printing both books at the same time is a big challenge even for a seasoned salty comics-slinger such as me, so I am counting on you to help get out the word! In this campaign, people will not only be able to buy the book and get their name on the Backer's Page, but for higher pledges you might actually appear in the book! In Electric Bugaboo, several backers from the first campaign make their appearance... and not all of them make it out alive! Jenny Brigham is a twelve-year-old girl and the world's deadliest pirate. Having taken the mantle (and magical powers!) of the long-dead Pirate Emperor Strangebeard, she now hunts for the seven Pirate Masters who slew him and separated his fantastical Effects, the combination of which grant the owner the title of Pirate Emperor of the Endless Oceans! Due to the original Captain Strangebeard having an eye patch, a hook hand and a peg leg, Jenny now has a super-strong punch, a mighty kick, and super vision! But she also has both the loyalty of Strangebeard's surviving crew... and the hatred of the Pirate Masters who have now turned their attention to Jenny! Together with her not-entirely-trustworthy First Mate Sluggo Sealock and her loyal pupper Lemmy, Jenny must stay the course and face the five remaining Pirate Masters.\u00a0 Sluggo Sealock is the disgraced former First Mate of \"The Crashing Boar\", Jenny's inherited pirate ship. After the conclusion of \"The Ghost Pirate's Gift\", he is left injured and alone in the brig of the \"Boar\"... But Sealock is a crafty old pirate, and he has much information to trade for his freedom. But not his dignity!\u00a0\u00a0 Lemmy is a dog. Anyway, let's talk stretch goals. My primary goal is to get my beloved Strangebeards into print... but with every extra dollar I will be able to do more and more to make the campaign better. While the lion's share of my goal is to bring you a printed version of my beloved Strangebeard 2 (and return Volume 1 to the land of publish...ment), I still have a few tricks up my sleeve. But are there stretch goals? Yes, there are. 14k: I will include an all-new Strangebeard print, a new sticker and a laminated Strangebeard fan club card with every physical order! Extra swag, guys. Awww yiss. 15k: I will add foil stamping to the logo on the cover! The cover to Strangebeard: The Ghost Pirate's Gift had gold foil stamping and it looked terrific. I would love to do that again.... Gold for the first book, silver for the second. 16k:\u00a0This is the big one. I can now print 1000 copies of each book. Thanks so much, folks! This is my third crack at a Kickstarter, and I am 100% committed to its success. I want this book in your piratey hands (and hooks!). As it has always been with the webcomic itself, your assistance in spreading the word about this campaign via Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram or message in a bottle is much appreciated. Kelly on Instagram! On Twitter! On Facebook! I cannot tell you how excited I am to get these books made! I love writing and drawing the comic and I love the freedom of the web but my mitts are aching to flip through those pages. Let's do this again! Yo ho!\u00a0",

For our grand finale, we present a volume of endings... and those endings come through choices.\u00a0 \"How much am I willing to risk for my dream job? How much am I willing to sacrifice?\"\u00a0 \"Should I drift in a comfortable arrangement or risk what I have by admitting I want more?\"\u00a0 \"What do we do when sex doesn't work?\"\u00a0 \"Should I get out of this uncomfortable threesome with a guy I'm not into at all and a woman who's starting to look as crazy as she is hot?\"\u00a0 For most of us, the last of those decisions seems like the easiest. But most of us haven't lived Gary's life. Volume 10 of M\u00e9nage \u00e0 3 collects the 10th (and final) year of the webcomic. Strips included are #1351 (Sept. 28, 2017) to #1512 (Apr. 9, 2019). Each chapter break will feature a new illustration. The book, like all our previous books, will also include a 5-to-6 page print-exclusive bonus story (PDFs include the bonus stories too). This year, our bonus story will be part 3 of our reverse-gender take on Ma3. Did Geri (female Gary) find her man? Or woman? We'll also include the reverse-gender bonus story we funded during our volume 7 campaign: The Clams Before the Storm. \u00a0 As some of you may know, we've had to restrain our art choices of late online due to advertisers not wanting us to show mild nudity. With that said, as we did with volume 8 & 9, we plan to fix that for this printed volume (and PDF). I'll go in and tweak a few pages where I feel we would've normally not hidden it. Here are sample comic strips (picked at random) from volume 10 of M\u00e9nage \u00e0 3. Note: Strips are printed 1st half on top of 2nd half in the books.\u00a0 Sticky Dilly Buns and Sandra on the Rocks are two spin-offs of M\u00e9nage \u00e0 3, and Dangerously Chloe is a spin-off of Eerie Cuties. Even though they can be read independently, if you enjoy M\u00e9nage \u00e0 3 or Eerie Cuties, you'll more than likely like these as well. Past volumes of these series are available as well as add-ons or included in some of the rewards. Unlikely friends Dillon and Ruby challenge each other a lot, but that helps them face other challenges, like Ruby's disinterested-seeming boyfriend and some men who seem interested in Dillon for all the wrong reasons. Though Ruby's sometimes not so much \"helping\" there as she is \"delightedly ogling.\" On his own, Dillon has to face his jealousy and career woes, while Ruby has to address her frosty family relations and whether her manga addiction can possibly be an asset in her business-minded life. Or they could just fail to face those problems forever, we suppose! Growth is optional. For our bonus story in volume 2 of Sticky Dilly Buns, we learn how well things went with Ruby's yaoi calendar. Has this helped Dillon's career or made it worse? Sample strips from \u00a0Sticky Dilly Buns volume 2 (picked at random). Sandra has been drifting a bit... even though she still can't pose \"nakies,\" when she ends up on a tropical island with no memory of how she got there, she just goes with the flow. But sharks are circling: Eloise continues to play the long game in hopes of snatching away Sandra's boyfriend, while Eva manipulates the rest of Sandra's circle as revenge against her mentor. Before this is over, going with the flow will land Sandra on shores that seem inescapable. And what happens next will settle the question: is she model or mouse? Sample strips from Sandra on the Rocks volume 3 (picked at random). Teddy-- or Teddi-- has finally come to accept life as a girl and absolutely everything that goes along with it, to save Chloe's life-- and her own. But Teddi's new look draws attention from all corners, from bullying or smitten peers to young monster hunters to her own family. Also involved are Heaven, Hell, and the angel of death-- not a crowd known for resolving differences over a game of Scrabble (the succubi object that there aren't enough X tiles to spell \"XXXRATED\"). Can Teddi and Chloe survive? Maybe so. But not without a price. Sample strips from Dangerously Chloe volume 3 (picked at random). Our goal is $44,000 CAD (roughly 33k US). If reached, this amount will allow us to print roughly 1500 to 2000 copies each of M\u00e9nage \u00e0 3 volume 10, Sticky Dilly Buns volume 2, Sandra on the Rocks volume 3, and Dangerously Chloe volume 3, AND print all the necessary posters and postcards associated to each book. Shipping is expensive, so pretty much half that amount will go to shipping & handling (and shipping supplies). We plan to send the 4 books to print by July so we can start shipping in September-October 2019 (once we've received everything from the printer). We're not a big business, so sometimes it can take us like a month or two to get all the packages out, and depending on your location, it can take from one week to two months to get to destination. If you check our previous Kickstarters, you'll see that we always end up delivering. We ship everywhere in the world. When you select a pledge, shipping cost will be added for the location you\u2019re in. The shipping cost added is included in the goal amount, so it all adds up. Since we know some backers will be new to Pixie Trix Comix, all our books are available in this Kickstarter, either included in the reward you selected or as add-ons (read below on how to add stuff). If you've participated in one of our previous Kickstarters, things should pretty much self-explanatory. We're trying to fund 4 books, and we're making them available as REGULAR, COLLECTOR and GOLD editions. Pick the reward that includes all the stuff you want, and any extras (like a book you're missing, or swag you want from our store) can be added with a pledge increase (what we call an add-on). Since we know many of you wait for our yearly Kickstarter to get some of the stuff found in our store, we're allowing you to get select items from our store via pledge increases. Since Kickstarter can't calculate the extra shipping cost these added items would incur, we've included the shipping cost to each item in the list below. What this means is that when you select a pledge, a shipping cost will be added, but that's only \u00a0for that pledge in question, and the items in that pledge. When you want more stuff than what's in your pledge, you have to remember that this doesn't work like a store where you can add items to your cart. You have to add up the cost of the extra items you want based off the list below, note it down, and at the end of the Kickstarter, we'll send you a survey for you to fill out. THAT'S where you'll tell us what this increased pledge amount was for (see the pledge increase as store credit). We plan on using Backerkit, so this should help make things easier if you did your math wrong or want to add more items after the fact. Here's a visual aid link (from our previous Kickstarter) to adding items: https://kck.st/2HAfNBd\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Older graphic in case the above isn't clear: http://kck.st/1NZcnDT Here's an example of a running spreadsheet you can use to plan your Kickstarter pledge. These prices include shipping to anywhere in the world. Please right-click our store link to either open a new tab or new window to preview all items. Some items aren't on this list as we have limited supplies. \u00a0Not all books are available as collector's edition, so please double \u00a0check to see what's still available. Also note that the items in our store are listed in US dollars without shipping added to the amount. What you're seeing here are the same items converted to CAD dollars with shipping included. Rest assured that whether you're buying from our \u00a0store or getting them here through the Kickstarter, you're paying about the same in the end. (Slightly cheaper here, though, if you selected a pledge with lots of stuff). We have many add-ons that you can add to your pledge. Here's a picture reference with the written list below it.

Below is a sample of our podcast we currently have 7 episodes taped and live for your enjoyment. Our website is \u00a0www.brainthatnameditself.com. We are wanting to raise this money to help us do three things. First we would like to buy some equipment. Right now we borrow all of our equipment and getting what we need every time we want to record is becoming harder as the borrowed equipment is in demand. Second, we feel that we have hit the limit on what we are able to do to expand out listeners by using just our social media accounts. So, we would like to have a little budget to dip our toes into advertising. We want to start small with some Facebook Ads and then move into some Google Ads. And Lastly we would like to be able to offset our hosting costs. We have been paying out of pocket for our hosting and we are hoping to lessen the burden a bit with the money raised.\u00a0",
  "Inte finns det v\u00e4l n\u00e5gra ockulta mysterier bakom dagsnyheternas rubriker om stater och kapital? Ekonomi och politik kan vara engagerande, uppr\u00f6rande, ibland till och med tr\u00e5kigt. Men mystiskt? Ja, faktiskt mer \u00e4n du n\u00e5gonsin kan ana. I sj\u00e4lva verket finns inget mera mystiskt \u00e4n det vi dagligen tar f\u00f6r givet, i den s\u00e5 kallade vardagens rutiner och strukturer. Var kommer de ifr\u00e5n? N\u00e4r uppstod de? Hur h\u00e5lls de vid liv? Alla hj\u00e4lper vi till att uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5lla dem. Men vet vi vad vi g\u00f6r? Och varf\u00f6r? F\u00f6r att f\u00e5 svar p\u00e5 s\u00e5dana fr\u00e5gor kan man studera politisk och ekonomisk historia. Man kan l\u00e4ra sig massor om penningekonomin och om staters administration. Det \u00e4r inte oviktigt. Men inte heller hela bilden. H\u00e4r finns underjordiska rum och krafter som vi s\u00e4llan beaktar och som aldrig n\u00e5r v\u00e5ra vardagliga ytor. Dem ska vi luska fram och titta n\u00e4rmare p\u00e5 i den h\u00e4r poddserien. Verkligheten \u00e4r inte vad den synes vara. Vad detta inneb\u00e4r f\u00f6r fenomenen stat och kapital ska vi prata om. Vi hittar inte p\u00e5 n\u00e5got. Vi ska finna de faktiska mysterierna bakom pengarna, statsmakten, v\u00e5rt om\u00e4ttliga beg\u00e4r och varf\u00f6r n\u00e4stan allt f\u00f6rvandlas till skr\u00e4p till sist.

I ett \"f\u00f6rprogram\" h\u00e4r pratar vi om vad vi bland annat vill ta upp.\u00a0 Per och Eric har tidigare gjort serierna M\u00e4nniskan och maskinen \u00a0(2 s\u00e4songer, Sveriges Radio), Kunskapens tr\u00e4d (1 s\u00e4song, oberoende) och Myter & Mysterier \u00a0(2 s\u00e4songer, oberoende). Picture: Public domain\u00a0 Movie: Henrik Hellstr\u00f6m English translation: There aren't any occult mysteries behind the daily news on states and capital, are there? Economic and political issues can be engaging, upsetting, sometimes even boring. But mysterious? Yes, actually more than you think. In reality there is nothing more mystical than what we take for granted each day, in the routines and structures of so-called everyday life. Where do they come from? When did they arise? How are they kept alive? All of us help to sustain them. But do we know what we do? And why? To answer such questions you can study political and economic history. You can learn a lot about the monetary economy and the administration of states. That\u2019s not unimportant. But also not the whole picture. There exist subterranean spaces and powers here that we seldom recognize and which never reach our everyday surfaces. This is what we will tease out and take a closer look at in this podcast series. Reality is not what it seems to be. We will talk about what this means for phenomena like state and capital. We\u2019re not making anything up. We will find the actual mysteries behind money, state power, our insatiable desire and why almost everything turns into rubbish in the end. Support us in this endeavour of discovery! And experience, with us, that totally different ways of thinking about politics and economics than we\u2019re used to. Per and Eric have previously produced the series Human and Machine (2 seasons, Swedish National Radio), The Tree of Knowledge (1 season, independent) and Myths & Mysteries (2 seasons, independent). Translation of the movie: E: My name is Eric Sch\u00fcldt. P: My name is Per Johansson. E: And we are behind the podcast series Myths & Mysteries. And now we sit here and plan the coming season, which will have the title State and Capital. P: Right. State and Capital at first hardly sounds neither mystical nor mysterious. But if you scratch the surface of such seemingly everyday concepts a little, you in fact quickly find incredibly mystical things. E: Isn\u2019t it so, that despite that we have treated things like alchemy, reincarnation, astrology, this season actually could become the most heavily mysterious? P: Yes, what if you open the newspaper in the morning or check out the news on the web, and at the back of your mind knew that the history of capital is tied to alchemy, for example, or that money, especially today, is pure magic. Then I wonder if your very conception of reality won\u2019t begin to wobble a bit. At least that it did for me when I had penetrated these mysteries. E: But for this season to become real, we as usual require your help. P: Yep.",
  "\"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today\" Malcolm X. Growing up I had a few issues with the way I was being taught at school, I never truly felt motivated to learn as much as I should have been and this is why after finishing my University studies and furthering my base knowledge of the education systems with-in Australia I have finally decided to figure out a way to help children with my local communities that are less advantaged. So I thought to myself, \"What did I, and a lot of other children struggle with?\" and it hit me! READING! It is such a basic building block of education and yet so many people struggle with it. Then I had to ask myself the next question, \"What would be the best way to motivate and encourage children to learn to read\" and this is when the idea for 'Reading with Heroes' was born. Most children have a favourite Hero, be it Superman, Spiderman, Batman or even Spongebob, so why not use these characters to encourage them to learn! So I got in touch with my districts local Libraries, schools, sporting stadiums and council halls and asked them if it would be possible to use their facilities to run 'Free' reading events weekly for children where a new hero will attend each week (me in a different costume) within the community to help increase the base literacy skill levels of the children attending.\u00a0 If all goes well I will be making a Youtube channel and website for this Program so that everyone involved in the creation can see and enjoy the progress we make. I believe that if you have the ability to help others then you should, that is why my vision is to increase the opportunity for children to learn to read in a supportive and encouraging environment. If you or someone you know struggled or still struggles and would have relished this opportunity when you were young please support my project. Without support I will still do my best to get this program up and running but I may have to skimp out a little on the quality of the costumes which might ruin the illusion for the children. The money you donate will go towards costumes, advertising, stationary, books, website production and possibly app production. \"with your help and my dedication we can truly make this something special\"",
  "This book treat a story that i personally wrote for a session of Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 and that I transposed in a Dark Fantasy Novel, where the actions of the Characters are the same that the players have been played in the game. The end of the story is not completed, because the session is in ongoing, but in this book you can find the first actions that explain what is happened in this world. My story is not a Epic Fantasy Novel, then the \"Happily Ever After\" is not so obvious!",

  "Looking back, I was fortunate to have grown up sharing a 2 family home with my grandparents in Woburn, MA. \u00a0Everyday I was treated to great food filled with garden fresh products. I grew up eating meals made of fruits and vegetables picked that day in the family garden. I am looking to ensure that the Portuguese meals I took for granted growing up will be a part of my life (and yours) forever. This can sometimes prove difficult as many of our Portuguese family members cook from scratch and don't usually measure ingredients. I have many recipes that will definitely be included BUT the cookbook has not been completely assembled and I am allowing the crowd to become involved in my project. \u00a0Their are project rewards that allow YOUR family recipe and YOUR story behind the food to be included in the cookbook. The size of the cookbook is not set in stone... I am leaning towards 6\" x 9\" with pages and pictures in color. Portuguese food consists of\u00a0wholesome meals made from the heart. \u00a0Portuguese food is cooked differently depending on the area you are visiting.... Madeira Island, Acores Island or Portugal. \u00a0The cookbook will focus on all areas and some recipes will contain multiple variations. \u00a0Recipes will have pointers that will help you make each dish a success. Caldo Verde - Kale soup with Chorizo and Potatoes Lapas - Portuguese Mussels Grilled Chorizo - Portuguese Sausage Camarao Mozambique - Portuguese Spicy Shrimp\u00a0 Bolo de Caco - Portuguese Bread\u00a0 Malasadas - Portuguese Fried Dough Carne Alentejana - Portuguese Pork dish with Clams, Chorizo and Potatoes \u00a0Sangria Pastel de Nata - Portuguese Egg Tart Pastry \u00a0Arroz Doce - Portuguese Rice Pudding\u00a0 Massa - Portuguese Sweet Bread Input is appreciated for all aspects of the cookbook!!!

Check out the vegetarian Thai peanut stir fry dumpling in update #7! Hi! My name is Amanda and I am an American who has been living, writing, and cooking in China for nearly four years. China\u2019s favored dish, the dumpling (or jiaozi in Chinese), can be found on every street corner, in every restaurant, and in every kitchen in China, but they are all pretty much prepared the same way: a bit of meat, some garlic and ginger, and a bit of vegetables if you\u2019re lucky. Even a visit to the freezer section at any grocery store displays hundreds of packages of dumplings that all look and taste the same.  \n\nBut the dumpling is so versatile! Have you ever tried stuffing a dumpling with chicken? Refried beans? Cheesecake filling? No? Hardly anyone has! My cookbook, Crazy Dumplings, takes this simple staple food and prepares it in ways you never thought possible! From buffalo chicken dumplings to pizza dumplings to apple pie dumplings, a world of foods is available to you in an easy dumpling wrapper with Crazy Dumplings.\n\n Crazy Dumplings will contain 40 of my original dumpling recipes plus dumpling recipes submitted by backers (see rewards for details), the dumpling wrapper recipe, and several original sauce and dip recipes such as buffalo sauce, guacamole, and salsa. There are dumpling recipes for appetizers, main courses, and desserts.\u00a0 I have done my best to include some vegetarian recipes; however, vegan or gluten-free ingredients are nearly impossible for me to get where I live. If this book reaches its goal, though, I will release a vegan & gluten-free dumpling book next year when I am back in America for holiday. Sponsors of this book will be the first to know when I start working on that future project.\n\n\u00a0 Cookbooks are crazy expensive to print due to the color pictures. The goal of $3,000 will cover: \n\n\u00a0 Of course, the main goal of the campaign is to produce the awesome Crazy Dumplings\u00a0cookbook. You will receive an e-version at the $5 level or a hard copy version for just $15.\u00a0 But we have other cool rewards as thank yous as well. At the $15 dollar level, all backers will receive a hard copy version of the cookbook and a random free paper cutting bookmark! At the $20 level, you will get the amazing dumpling dumplinger to help you make perfect dumplings every single time! At the $25 level, you will receive a crazy tote bag! They are good for the environment! At the $30 level, you will get a set of custom carved chopsticks! At the $35 level, you will receive a crazy framed shadow puppet! At the $45 and $50 levels, you will receive a small or large tin of my very own crazy dumpling tea blend! This tea is crazy good. It starts with a light, green tea base, then some delicate jasmine flowers are added infused with peaches, then a strawberry infused oolong tea is added, followed by a fruit blend of apples, roselles, orange peels, and pineapples. It is finally super sweetened with a hit of blueberries. It is sooo good and the perfect partner for all of the crazy dumplings, sweet or savory! If you are in China, you do not have to pay the extra $10 for shipping on your reward tier since I can ship to you from inside the country. That means that people in the US and China get free shipping on all tiers! (There was just no way to indicate that in the tiers themselves.) If you have any questions about this, just message me. \u00a0 If you do not have an Amazon Payments account, please send me a message and we will work something out.

The alternate history storyline takes place starting in 1985, and follows an American Covert Operations unit through the late 1980s, as they work to thwart the spread of Soviet Influence and the rise of mysterious new threats!\u00a0 There is a whole world of LONGBOW\u2122 to explore with multiple characters, heroes and villains, and a fun, exciting, action-packed storyline that will expand with each future product wave.\u00a0 CALLSIGN: LONGBOW\u2122 flashes back to the adventure and nostalgia of 1980s era action figures. The line features the same articulation as the o-ring figures (with metal t-hooks) of the time, with a twist- the addition of swivel wrists!! These ABS and PVC figures will feel and look like the classic figures you remember with an even better range of motion. And the best part is that the hands are made of a flexible material to prevent broken thumbs!\u00a0 CALLSIGN: LONGBOW\u2122 figures will come in one of two different packaging configurations. Standard figures will come awesomely carded on standard 9\" x 6\" cardback, just like in the 1980s. Crowdfunding exclusive figures and MTF: Retro-Ops figures will come bagged with a bio card, just like mail away exclusives of the 1980s. Regardless of the packaging style, all figures will include character art painted by the legendary Doug Hart (of G.I. Joe, Transformers, Visionaries, Air Raiders, Stargate and many other classic brands). In order to demonstrate the overall quality and look of our figures, we've taken LANCER from concept all the way to paint-master prototype. \u00a0For this Kickstarter, all figures will be shown as design illustrations. \u00a0We plan to add prototype images and paint-master images as they are completed. \u00a0Expect regular updates as milestones in the project are reached. To celebrate the halfway point of this incredible Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019ve released the digital edition of CALLSIGN: LONGBOW\u2122 Issue #1 by Broken Icon Comics. \u00a0Featuring LANCER, VOLK, UPTOWN, OUTLAW, PARADOX, and many more, this FREE digital FIRST ISSUE drops readers straight into the action!!!\u00a0 The initial LONGBOW\u2122 offering for this project included 4 (four) fully articulated and individually carded figures. We are offering 2 (two) good guys (SCOTT \u201cLANCER\u201d MCMASTERS & ALBERTO \u201cUPTOWN\u201d CHAPMAN) and 2 (two) bad guys (ALEXY \u201cVOLK\u201d REZNIKOV & GRU SPETSNAZ Trooper, Army Builder) so you can have a proper battle right out of the gate! Participation in the CALLSIGN: LONGBOW\u2122 Kickstarter can be \u00a0anywhere from $1, to a single $25 item, to the \"All-in\" and \"Double All-In\" levels with\u00a0EVERYTHING released,\u00a0 to several \"You Choose\" levels!\u00a0 \"You Choose\" levels range from \"Pick Any 4 Figures\" up to the \"Double All-In + Pick Any 100 Figures\" level! \u00a0The higher the \u00a0participation level the better the value! Backers can add ANY original item and/or unlocked Stretch goal items to their reward package for the additional cost of said item. Note: International Backers will be charged more for shipping and customs taxes depending on the country of purchase/delivery. Please review the various contribution levels for details about the participation level best for you. Contribute the amount you want for the desired participation levels with your desired rewards.\u00a0 If you decide you want additional items (either unlocked stretch goal items, more of the currently available items or move to a higher\u00a0level), you can add to your contribution at ANY TIME during the event. \u00a0 After the Kickstarter event ends, we will send a Backerkit survey where\u00a0you can tell us EXACTLY what figures you want for your pledge amount and your\u00a0shipping information. You'll also have the opportunity to add additional items during the Backerkit. Our target funding goal is $78,000 to produce the first 4 new items: Scott \u201cLancer\u201d McMasters, Alberto \u201cUptown\u201d Chapman, Alexy \u201cVolk\u201d Reznikov, and GRU SPETSNAZ Trooper. The planned release date for the CALLSIGN: LONGBOW\u2122 figures is December 2023. We are using December 2023 as the target available date based on the initial items in the event. Note that this time frame is an estimate and could change depending on how many additional figures stretch goals are unlocked. It's logical that the more that has to be produced, the longer it will take the factory to complete the items. More awesome figures are always better, and with your support we can make it happen! In addition to these awesome retro CALLSIGN: LONGBOW\u2122 action figures, we also have some great Add-Ons that can be added to your pledge.\u00a0 1. We are excited to offer a CALLSIGN: LONGBOW\u2122 #1 Kickstarter Exclusive cover by the legendary Rod Whigham (produced by Broken Icon Comics). \u00a0 2. A great LONGBOW\u2122 & MTF: RETRO-OPS Patch 2-Pack that includes 1 (one) CALLSIGN: LONGBOW\u2122 Embroidered Unit Patch and 1 (one) Marauder \"Gun-Runner\" MTF: RETRO-OPS Embroidered Patch. (Note that these patches will also be included in any \"All-in\" or HIGHER pledge level. All of these items will be included for free in any \"all-in\" packages. If we are fortunate to meet our starting $78,000 funding goal, we have many, many stretch goals ready to add to the campaign. Highly desirable stretch goals to allow\u00a0us to release MORE \"retro\" o-ring figures, with a wide array of new gear AND weapons!

If you know someone who would be interested in these kinds of figures, please share with them and help us unlock more amazing LONGBOW\u2122 action figures!

Once Unlocked, \"Outlaw\" can be added to any package or selected as part of a pledge reward in the Backerkit. The next stretch goal is the mysterious and deadly STEEL WEB\u2122 Infiltrator \u971e-\u6b7b\u795e AKA \u201cGHOST\u201d. This is the first STEEL WEB\u2122 character in that will be revealed, but for now he is a deadly enigma to our heroes. Once Unlocked, \"Ghost\" can be added to any package or selected as part of a pledge reward in the Backerkit. STEEL WEB\u2122 has overwhelmed our forces and taken over the Kickstarter! They did this using their HEAVY ASSAULT INFANTRY - THE SHOCK TROOPER! This figure is Instantly Unlocked and can be added to any package or selected as part of a pledge reward in the Backerkit. To take back the campaign from STEELWEB, LONGBOW has called in reinforcements from ADAPT. This is the first crowdfunding exclusive figure in the LONGBOW line and will only be available during the Kickstarter and initial Backerkit offering. This figure is Instantly Unlocked and can be added to any package or selected as part of a pledge reward in the Backerkit. Note: ADAPT TROOPER (RESEARCH FACILITY) figure will come bagged.

Once Unlocked, the \"HENCHMEN\" can be added to any package or selected as part of a pledge reward in the Backerkit. The KRASNY-NINJA are the elite martial arts soldiers of the Soviet Union.

Joe, Transformers, Star Wars) \u00a0and John Kukovich (Complex, ROBOSKULL MKII).\u00a0 Grindstone's first figure was funded as a stretch goal in the wildly successful Roboskull MKII project by Skeletron Toys. But John and Troy can't do it on their own. They rely on a team of skilled artists, production specialists, and consultants to bring LONGBOW\u2122 to life.

  "Energy block is a perfect backup power supplier for you during outdoor activities to keep in touch, making all your electronic devices keep online when there\u2019s no power supply outdoors. Charge cell phones, laptops, cameras, or drones and never stop step of the adventure. *Extreme durability tests all included in the above review. **Fireproof does not mean it can be thrown in the fire and still works. Once above certain temperature, it will be activated and force the system to shut down to prevent thermal overrun, then explosion.\u00a0 \u00a0More review videos are coming... Energy Block is compatible with the vast majority of devices, gadgets, and portable appliances, including those powered by USB, or DC outlets. 300Wh is enough to power all kinds of beefy appliances, and the huge battery takes a very long time to run down. Besides that, with the help of a detachable modular design, Energy Block is convenient for you to use in various scenarios indoors and outdoors. Just lift the battery block and you can use it between home and office for example. The DC output allows a voltage range of 3~21V, which meets most of the portable appliances\u2019 needs. Energy block is your sustain backup while an emergency of a power blackout or outdoor travel occurs. \u00a0That's not enough? Energy Block is available in a version with an AC output mount with a wider range of interfaces and an additional international standard socket. \u00a0With a more powerful version of the AC output mount, Energy Block can satisfy all your daily/outdoor needs. Equipped with an 80000mAh battery and 300W output (500W surge), it can help your appliances stay full of power for a whole day. \u00a0What's more, the double Type-C ports on the DC output mount provide a total of 110W (65W& 45W) of output power, while the single type-C port on the AC output mount provides UP to 100W. This metal case enables waterproof and dust-resistant performance to reach the IP67 level. It resists immersion in water from 15cm to 1m for 30 minutes. For outdoor use, no worries about different situations. \u00a0*The waterproof is only for freshwater, not for swimming pools and seawater. We believe that battery safety is the first thing to be considered. To make Energy Block more durable, we select and test. Finally, it comes with an aluminum casing designed to last for a lifetime while 100% of the hardware parts are industrial grade that can withstand up to 1000 pounds of force. Check out how Energy Block resists the hammer test: Lithium batteries can become more likely to be dangerous when charging as the life span decreases after 1-2 years of use, which is a leading cause of house fire nowadays. We treat this as the most serious matter and take measures to keep Energy Block surely safe for your family. \u00a0Anzene always puts safety as the first priority and that's the basic principle of how we design Energy Block. There are 5-in-1 chip-controlled protections and will ensure you a safe charging experience when you use Energy Block. To make the battery more reliable and prevent it from firing, Anzene innovated hardware called, cell fire extinguisher (CFE). With this guarantee, make sure that your battery is 100% safe.\u00a0 *We offer an optional CFE installation service. \u00a0In order to ensure the 100% absolute safety of the battery, we have done extensive tests on the explosion-proof tech. Compared to software protection approaches, hardware measures are more essential and reliable to protect battery security. \u00a0For double insurance, an air valve at the bottom of Energy Block is designed to release air pressure internally if there was an accumulation of heat, or there would be a fire. The release of air pressure will prevent a big explosion if the fire was to happen. The portable power backup was redefined. Energy Block powers phones, drones, outdoor gears and much more, with only a 700ml cube weighing about 2kg. It\u2019s the ultimate solution to the modern need for on-demand electricity wherever you go. Energy Block is compatible with the vast majority of devices, gadgets, and portable appliances, including those powered by USB, or AC/DC outlets. 300Wh is enough to power all kinds of beefy appliances, and the huge battery takes a very long time to run down. With the super-fast AC adapter charger coming along with Energy Block, it only takes you two hours to fully recharge Energy Block. And if you want to use a solar panel to recharge, it will take 5-9 hours depending on the sunlight! \u00a0 Energy Block is a solution for energy storage, especially clean energy. You can generate 100% free green energy from cycling or portable solar panels. With solar panels, this metal cube can store solar power and power different devices and e-mobilities helping you live a green life. The old and aging batteries can be replaced by Energy Block to realize the renewal of your ebike instead of declaring it obsolete. What kind of bikes are Anzene Energy Block and Mobility Jig compatible with? Any personal micro-mobility vehicle with a 24V, 36V, or 48V motor hub that has an output power of no more than 350 watts for optimum power output. The retrofit simply replaces any existing battery and reconnects the battery's +/- cable to the Mobility Jig.\u00a0 \u00a0*All the listed prices are in US Dollars ($). Please note that when you checkout, the total amount will be displayed in Singapore dollars (SGD, S $) and the platform will automatically convert to USD for payment. *Once the goal is unlocked, your color selection will also be collected in a post-campaign survey. The estimated shipping time is from July, and we will make sure the sequence of shipping will be followed by backer numbers.\u00a0AC Set will be shipped a month later than DC Set due to different production schedules. Shipping costs will be calculated and paid before we send you the product. We estimate shipping costs to major areas, but your actual shipping costs may be lower. This is because, at the end of the campaign, we will know how many units we will send to each shipping zone, which will reduce costs. Also, if you would like to receive your rewards sooner, we offer additional worldwide air shipping options which will cost around US$130. After the campaign ends, you will receive an email to select your final order choices and pay the shipping costs. If you have chosen multiple add-ons, the final shipping costs might differ from the listed costs because of the excessive weight. The average additional shipping cost is approximately $9-13. \u00a0Each order will ship to only one location.\u00a0There will be no split orders even for the largest shipments including multiple sets. So if you pledge for friends you will need to pick one location that works for everyone. Due to the customs policy of different countries, we cannot guarantee if there is no tax for you. For EU countries, the tax and duties are included. Anzene was started in 2019 with just 4 of us. We have grown to 15 people, innovating a new paradigm of energy access, powering freedom to anyone in the world. ANZENE means \u201csafe-secure-smart\u201d in Japanese and was chosen as a reminder to maintain Japanese product quality standards with respect and love for nature behind our battery pack.\u00a0 \u00a0*This crowdfunding is fully managed and presented by NewWaves Lab. Collaborated with This project is boosted by BackerCrew We were named one\u00a0of\u00a0ProductHype's Best Kickstarter Projects of 2022.",

The videos and photos of neon buffalo that you see in this campaign are of the 'production sample' and accurately represent what we will ship to Backers. We've already started making our custom UHMWPE fabric and all that is left to do is press GO. We're incredibly excited! Shipping fees will be collected post-campaign via the BackerKit platform. \u00a0This enables us to charge you the most accurate and fair shipping possible based on the weight of your package and shipping destination.\u00a0The estimates below are *only* estimates and are subject to change based on rates carriers charge at the time of shipping, this is only to give a baseline for consideration. The pre-filled neon buffalo will most likely have to ship separately in its own box, so if you have multiple items in your pledge via pledge level or add-ons, this will increase the shipping cost due to needing multiple packages. This may also result in increased customs costs for international backers due to receiving multiple packages. *International Backers* We love you and want the neon buffalo to roam your country. However, due to the heavy weight of neon buffalo, we will be limiting our international shipping locations for the pre-filled option.\u00a0 neon buffalo Heavy: $20-25 neon buffalo Heavier: $25-30 neon buffalo Heaviest: $30-35 neon buffalo international/unfilled: $10-12 neon buffalo Heavy: $80-210 neon buffalo Heavier: $100-230 neon buffalo Heaviest: $120-270 neon buffalo international/unfilled: $40-80 The lower-end estimates primarily cover Canada and Mexico. Overseas options start at $130 for the Heavy (30-pound) option.\u00a0 A Note On Customs: All international backers will be responsible for customs fees charged by their respective countries. We launched our first campaign on Kickstarter over 8 years ago. Since that time, we've evolved as a company and learned a lot. Your support has been integral to where we are today and we cannot thank the Kickstarter community enough. Kickstarter has opened doors we didn't even know existed. We've formed genuine friendships with backers, hired backers as employees, traveled around the world with backers, and developed trust and community with backers. We've created a family of wild-individuals from all across the globe. We've been using the production prototype that we have in hand for over 6 months and it is AWESOME. However, in order to bring the neon buffalo to life, we need to reach our goal of $50,000 to meet our factory's minimum order quantities. We'll use the funds raised on Kickstarter to cover the cost of production and shipping container fees as well as to create the training content. Everything is ready to go. All we need to do is hit our funding goal and get into production!",

  "Hello my friends, family, fans, and every body around the world who might be seeing this. Here is a little about me:\u00a0 Jehlad Hickson was born in Manchester, New Hampshire, but that\u2019s not where he really grew up. Throughout his life, he has moved about 18 times, around the east coast, and then finally to San Diego, where he resides currently. While they were living in Ashland, N.H, his mother\u2019s abusive ex-boyfriend got them kicked them out of his house, making him, his mother and his younger brother, who was 10 at the time, homeless. They lived in and out of their car and eventually spent 7 months in a shelter. He was only 13. When asked how he stayed positive during this time in his life, he responded with \u201cWe had it pretty good. It could have been so much worse. Everyone has a right to complain, but it could have been worse\u201d. He also talked about how music and singing really helped with everything. His love of music started when he was 2 when he got a bongo set, and then continued when he started singing at 3. Although he doesn\u2019t have a musical family, music runs in his veins. He plays guitar, electric bass, drums, piano, sings, writes his own songs, and eventually wants to learn the saxophone. About a year ago, a friend of his told him about the Voices of our City choir, and he has been there ever since. Jehlad just wants to sing and produce music, taking any musical opportunity he can, including touring around the country. \u201cMusic pays the bills, and San Diego isn\u2019t exactly inexpensive. The choir is such a good place to be, surrounding yourself with loving people.\u201d The people there, according to him, are so supportive, and have been through so much, but will still love you with everything they have. \u201cThese people are lifetime friends, you know, we help each other\u201d. Although he has a family in LA, the choir is like his family in San Diego. As you can tell, music is extremely important in Jehlad\u2019s life. \u201cArt and music is the last\u00a0 true form of connection.\u201d He then goes on to state that we use art to tell your story. We are all in the same place, but to tell your story is important, and music and art can help you with that. Art is for self-expression, and for those who want to excel. You got to show the world who you are,\u00a0 and you have to use your power and keep going. Other than music, additional things that bring him joy are people (he loves people, and cares so much about other people. He has so much compassion and kindness in his soul), basketball, tennis, working out (get those endorphins), food, fashion, crocheting, and lasagna. He makes it very clear that you just have to stay positive, no matter what. As said before, things could be worse, so you just gotta remember that, and be thankful. When I asked him for advice for the \u201cyounger\u201d generation, (he is only 10 years older than me), he gave an amazing answer\u00a0 \u201cThe world changes so fast around you. Things can change in a heartbeat, so grow up using your heart. The world can be so dark, but stay positive about everything. Stay positive in the hardest times, and always keep a good mind.\u201d This really resonated with me, just because we both have been through a lot, him definitely more than me, but it just goes to show as long as you keep an open mind and a good attitude things will get better. Now on to his future. He hopes to do well in music, but it\u2019s not about the money, but that also wouldn\u2019t hurt. He wants to work with as many people as possible and explore life. He went to college for both criminology and psychology, but now is getting his Masters in Business with a concentration in Digital entrepreneurship and macroeconomics, with a plan to graduate sometime in 2020. He knows he has made it when he can buy his mom a house.\u00a0",
  "We spent over a year filming a mockumentary series called Unpaid Spot, which follows a group of open mic comedians in rural Virginia. \u00a0All four episodes are available for free at UnpaidSpot.com, and we couldn't be more proud of how they turned out! We're really excited to do more, but we're totally broke. That's where you come in!\u00a0 We've started submitting to film festivals, and the main response we've been getting is that they love the writing, and the acting is great, but they production value is clearly low. Which is fair, considering all four episodes were shot on a budget of about $75.\u00a0 For the next season, we need money to buy props and costumes, and be able to pay our incredibly dedicated cast and crew. Most importantly, we want to pay a location to let us film there all day, instead of working around the bars location and shooting an hour or two every few weeks, like we did with season 1.\u00a0 With a real budget in place, we could finish season 2 in a fraction of the time it took us to make season 1, and have the whole thing look a thousand times better. We would also like to keep submitting to film festivals in hopes of generating some press, but most festivals have a $50-60 submission fee. The more funds we're able to raise, the more festivals we can enter, and the easier it will be to make contacts and pitch the series to networks.",

  "Encyclopedia Botanica is a listener-supported podcast about edible and cut flower gardening. Each episode is a lively conversation between me (Hilary Dahl) and a guest contributor. We break down seemingly complicated garden topics so that anyone can feel empowered to take on new projects and further develop their green thumb. Our goal is to make each episode educational and provide practical information for gardeners of all levels. I first launched Encyclopedia Botanica in the summer of 2016. I had been dreaming of creating a podcast for years and my husband and business partner, Colin McCrate, encouraged me to finally just do it. It started out really simple, short 10-15 minute episodes, each one focusing on a specific crop. Since then, the format has continued to evolve and expand. This coming season, I plan to interview experts from across the country on a variety of new subjects. We\u2019ll take an in-depth look at wine grapes, fruit tree care, container gardening for edibles, backyard production-scale cut flower gardening, and other really exciting topics! Check Out Past Seasons of the Podcast Here!\u00a0 What to expect in 2019:\u00a0 The goal for the 2019 season is to create a minimum of 10 subject-specific episodes {NOW 11- see updates for more info!}. Each episode will be accompanied by show notes for your reference on the Seattle Urban Farm Co. blog. If we reach our Kickstarter goal, we'll start releasing new episodes as soon as March 2019! Confirmed Topics and Guests for 2019 (so far...):\u00a0 Stretch goals: Encyclopedia Botanica Podcast Stats:\u00a0 Check Out Past Seasons of the Podcast Here!\u00a0 About the Host:\u00a0 Hilary Dahl is co-owner of Seattle Urban Farm Company and host of the Encyclopedia Botanica podcast. For ten years Hilary Dahl has been helping beginning and experienced growers create beautiful, productive gardens. She has the unique experience of working in on a wide range of projects, from small backyard garden plots to multi-acre vegetable farms. She also works in her own garden every day after work. Hilary created the Encyclopedia Botanica podcast as a way to share effective and efficient garden management techniques and as a way to spread her love of growing food and flowers.\u00a0 Instagram: @seattleurbanfarmco About the Producer and Q+A Co-Host: Colin McCrate is the founder of the Seattle Urban Farm Co. He has been growing food organically for over 17 years and has designed and has managed hundreds of edible garden projects. The author of two books; Food Grown Right, In Your Backyard (Mountaineers Books, 2012) and High-Yield Vegetable Gardening (Storey Publishing, 2015); he believes that urban food production can help increase public awareness of environmental, health, and social issues.\u00a0 ___________________________________________________________________ This project is all about learning, so instead of including a bunch of \"things\" for us to give you as rewards, we've created more ways to share\u00a0garden knowledge and garden-inspired experiences: - Gardening Resource PDF Packet: We've complied some of Seattle Urban Farm Co.'s most coveted resources to share with you! The packet includes: - Sweet peas: Below is a photos of sweet peas grown from Hilary's 2017 saved seed. The 2018 batch should be similar in bloom quality and stem length, and come in a mix of colors! All seed is saved from Spencer varieties.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Educational Webinars: \u00a0Each year we host a series of live, online webinars covering a variety of garden topics. The webinars range from 1-2 hours and are recorded so you can watch them at your own convenience. If you join us during the live broadcast, you're invited to submit questions that the host will answer during the session.

  "Annie and Auzeen have been dear friends since about 2007 when they lived together in Seattle and always knew their conversations and \"voices\" were destined for the air. Like most of the world, we've become podcast junkies, and feel it's the perfect medium for us to share our thoughts, spur productive conversations and hopefully spread some insightful information that can make a difference. We've finally recorded our first one, and it turned out amazing! We want to bring inspiration for gardening and making an impact locally and globally to the masses, and think we have a lot of valuable information to share to help people do that. We already bought some equipment, web hosting and other logistical elements to get us going, but want to get a copyright on the name before we stream it and buy some software so we can continually get better! Being the altruistic artists that we are with liberal arts degrees it's a little tough to get this side hustle going. So, won't you join us in spawning the revolution? We are doing this also to show that millennials aren't just these whiney entitled snowflakes that don't know how to grow a vegetable (we've grown plenty between the two of us).\u00a0 Our first episode topic is \"Food deserts: not just an urban problem\" where we break down some of the myths on food insecurity and steps to help address the issue. We plan to interview farmers, food industry executives, grocers and people at all steps along the food chain. Expect practical how-to's, insightful commentary and lots of storytelling. Hoping to get our first episode up ASAP so we can spread this passion around, and we promise we'll make you laugh too.\u00a0You can help us reach our goal, and we thank you dearly for your support!",
  "I'm Becca DeGregorio, an independent audio producer based in New York City. I'm a full-time freelancer as well as a podcasting fellow at Stony Brook University. No, I do not have very much money. Yes, I do like what I do. This is a podcast idea I've been passionate about for three years now: a podcast about grandmas, and their stories that go untold throughout our relationships with them. I'm calling it The Grandma Files, and I'll be producing much of it myself. Each episode will feature a narrative story between grandchild & grandma, alive or not, with potentially a short feature story tacked onto the end as well. I finally have the confidence, skill set and resources to make this show a reality, but I need your help too. Listen to the mini-episode above to hear more about the origin of this idea and my own grandma who inspired it.\u00a0 As stated in the audio above, I need a production budget of approximately $2,200 to cover the travel costs of meeting my interviewees where they are, payment for producers to record remotely for me when travel isn't possible, original music, sound design assistance & software and \u2013potentially\u2013\u00a0payment for additional editing help along the way. I am extremely gracious to be renting my equipment from Stony Brook University. You should support me because I'm a driven, young producer, who's been fine-tuning her technical podcasting skills for three years now (currently on Commonplace and ProjectNEXT, previously on Open Source with Christopher Lydon). I have a high standard for the listening quality of this show and will handle your donations with care in reaching this standard. I'm also passionate about this idea, and how it might translate to people. From selecting stories to editing and mixing, I'll be constantly considering my mission as it relates to you, the listener. What don't we know about our grandmas? And why don't we yet know those stories? Here they are. How will you hear them? I'm looking forward to diving deep into this work and finding out. Thanks in advance for the permission to do so.",

  "\n\nShort Stack is a series of small-format cookbooks about inspiring ingredients, authored by America\u2019s top culinary talents. Each edition is a collectible, single-subject, 50-page booklet packed with recipes that offer ingenious new ways to cook our favorite ingredients. \n\nWe know firsthand how hard it is to make a living creating recipes and writing about food, so we\u2019ve organized Short Stack into a new publishing model that puts the author first. Our authors will be paid for each copy of their book that we ever print, guaranteeing that their hard work will pay off, again and again, as we sell more of their editions.\n\nWe\u2019re Kickstarting our first three editions\u2014Eggs, Strawberries and Tomatoes\u2014just in time for summer. \n In creating Short Stack we drew from our experience in the world of cookbooks and food magazines.\u00a0 \u00a0Like the best cookbooks, Short Stack editions consist of original recipes created and rigorously tested by a single author with the home cook in mind. In addition to recipes, the books will contain original illustrations and countless sourcing and cooking tips. They are beautiful objects meant to be collected, gifted and, most importantly, cooked from. And, like the best food magazines, Short Stack editions are concise, affordable and built for function. Short Stack is also a contemporary offering of old-school craftsmanship: Each book will be printed locally on the highest-quality paper and card stock, and stitch-bound by hand using baker\u2019s twine. Our production process is intimate and specialized, and we\u2019re also inviting our readers to join in the fun at bookmaking gatherings that we\u2019ll host for each edition.\u00a0 The artful assembly mirrors the series\u2019 individualized, personal tone. We are building Short Stack as a platform for authors that we admire; each edition is a love letter from one cook to his or her favorite ingredient, with recipes that will have you reaching for your skillet before you\u2019ve finished reading the title. For our first three volumes, we\u2019re working with three excellent authors, each of whom is an industry veteran and a leader in the food-writing field. Between them they have worked on five cookbooks, five movies, two television shows and have bylines at Food & Wine, Bon App\u00e9tit, Gourmet, Martha Stewart Living, Wall Street Journal, Men\u2019s Health and more. They are the best of the best, and we\u2019re thrilled and honored to be working with them. (Read more about each author below.) Short Stack will be an ongoing publication; we plan to print new volumes on an increasingly frequent basis and eventually sell subscriptions. This Kickstarter project will benefit our first three volumes, enabling us to print our initial runs of 1,500 copies per edition (or more\u2014it\u2019s up to you!). We have more great authors waiting in the wings to tackle additional essential ingredients.   We realize that $50K is a mighty chunk of change. But it\u2019s what we need to produce three editions without cutting corners. Our platform\u2014paying authors for every book printer (forever), binding each book by hand, printing locally\u2014is pricy, but we believe the final product will be worth it. That said, we have done lots of research to make sure that our costs are as low as possible, while still retaining our project\u2019s high standards. Our goal also begs the question: Why launch three editions at once? Just as much as each edition is an individual work that captures its author\u2019s voice and style, it is also meant to be collected. We felt it was important to establish the series as just that\u2014a series. You can pre-order one volume or all three right now and have it delivered to you later this summer. Down the road, Short Stack editions will be on sale at select bookstores and gift shops, but we\u2019ll initially be selling them via our website, shortstackeditions.com.\u00a0 We will begin printing our first three editions the moment we finish our Kickstarter campaign. The books will be printed by the end of July, bound by the end of August, and shipped in late August/ early September.\u00a0 \nWe\u2019re underway with volumes 1-3. Our authors are busy developing and testing recipes; we\u2019ve finished designs and made our initial mock-ups. All we need to do now is pull the trigger on printing our first full runs. \u00a0\u00a0 Eggs are the superheroes of our refrigerators, just as essential at breakfast as they are at dessert. The recipes in this collection offer creative takes on iconic egg dishes, as well as less familiar preparations that are poised to become favorites.   About the author: Ian was a food editor for Gourmet\u00a0magazine for nearly a decade, and developed and tested innumerable recipes for the publication. His first cookbook, The Farm: Rustic Recipes for a Year of Incredible Food, was nominated for an IACP cookbook award, and Ian\u2019s new PBS show, \u201cThe Farm,\u201d brings education and teaching back to food TV by following locally sourced ingredients all the way to the dinner table. When he is not in a kitchen, Ian is hunting, fishing, and foraging his dinner. To learn about Ian, visit\u00a0ianknauer.com. Few things are better-tasting (and easier to cook with) than a ripe tomato. These recipes get to the heart of this fruit\u2019s popularity and its versatility, utilizing both peak-of-the-season summer fruit and high-quality canned tomatoes. Recipes include: \n About the author: Soa Davies began her culinary career working under David Walford at Splendido in Beaver Creek, Colorado, then moved to New York to take a position at Le Bernardin. There she became the Director of Operations, Culinary Producer and Head of Research and Development under Eric Ripert. She also managed the development and production of Ripert\u2019s cookbook, On the Line, as well as the critically acclaimed television show, \u201cAvec Eric,\u201d and its companion cookbook.

  "cord 1 is a cable management object from artifactual, a product design studio based in Atlanta, Georgia. Precisely-machined from solid 6061-T6 aluminum, cord 1 provides a secure anchor point for the many wires, cables, and cords that power our modern lives. Designed to be a beautiful and functional addition to any desk, cord 1 features an inverted channel that ensures cables remain securely captured during use. Reusable micro-suction pads on its base enable it\u00a0to attach to a wide range of surfaces, again and again. Design\u00a0 cord 1's geometry is simple; it was designed to be a functional object that seamlessly integrates into any setting. To properly retain cables, cord 1's channel had to be large enough to accommodate a wide variety of cables, but small enough that those cables' plugs could not pass through. After a number of iterations, cord 1's 4mm channel is compatible with all of the most popular cables that power our favorite devices, from Magsafe to Lightning to USB-C. Material cord 1 is machined from solid billets of 6061-T6 aluminum, an aerospace-grade alloy of aluminum that has excellent material properties. It is anodized to a beautiful grey finish, providing it with an aesthetic and protective coating.\u00a0 Attachment\u00a0 cord 1 is secured with 0.8mm-thick micro-suction pads, which feature millions of tiny cavities that function as suction cups, each forming partial vacuums when pressed against surfaces and producing a strong suction force.These micro-suction pads don't leave a sticky residue, and can be rinsed under water to restore their \"stickiness\". cord 1 has been tested on a variety of surfaces; sealed wood, metal, plastic, ceramic, glass. Manufacturing\u00a0 Our production partners are located in Shenzhen, China, the manufacturing center of the world, and we have been working closely with them over the past few months to prototype cord 1 and to ensure that it is optimized for full-scale production.\u00a0 Manufacturing is the main driver of cost for cord 1. In the CNC-machining production process, cost is directly tied to both the setup time and the cutting time required to machine each part out of metal. With larger production runs, the cost of the setup time can be distributed, bringing down the cost of each unit. Our funding goal reflects a production run of 100 units, bringing the unit cost down enough for cord 1 to be manufactured, shipped to artifactual HQ, packaged, and then delivered at a reasonable cost to our backers. Project Timeline About Us\u00a0 Hi, I'm John Kiernan-Lewis, a mechanical engineer with over six years of experience in product design and manufacturing. From camera tripods to child car seats, I have had the opportunity to guide products through all stages of development, from first sketch to mass-production.\u00a0 artifactual was founded in 2021 to foster the development of functional, thoughtfully-designed objects. We are so excited to launch our first product, cord 1, and to deliver it to desks, nightstands, and countertops all around the world!",
  "In a world of disposability where everything has an end date, here at 43 North Leather we aim to change that. My name is Jason Trauzzi and this is 43 North Leather. Located on the 43rd parallel we aim to bring you quality hand made leather wallets made with the best possible materials and techniques available to ensure a long lasting and beautiful wallet. Everything we create is hand made, there are no machines involved! Each leather panel is cut by hand, stitched by hand and finished by hand, so you know you are getting the best possible product every time. Why wallets? Like most people I started off with a generic leather wallet that only lasted me a few months until is started to fall apart. The seams would fray and the stitching would fall apart. After going through multiple options I decided to go ahead a make my own. A wallet tells a story. As it patinas it develops character, gracefully aging, becoming more beautiful along the way, even though it may pick up a few scars here and there. At 43 North Leather we offer multiple styles to fit your specific needs, whether you carry only a few cards and some cash to full bifolds and passport wallets, we make something for everyone! Kelso The Kelso wallet is great for a night out or for someone who wants to minimize their everyday carry. Complete with 5 slots, the center slot is large enough for a few bills folded in half. Each slot can comfortably hold around 2 cards each with a total of 8-10 cards with some cash. Killbear The Killbear wallet is another perfect companion for those who want to minimize their carry even more. The perfect companion for a night out, Killbear offers 3 card slots holding 2-3 cards each comfortably and a stainless steel money clip for quick access. Muskoka The Muskoka is a minimalist bifold that is designed for those who seldom carry cash and prefer to carry cards. With a compact design it contains 6 card slots easily holding 2-3 cards with space for a folded bill or two, just in case. Algonquin The Algonquin is our traditional bifold wallet containing a spacious cash flap, 4 card slots capable of holding 2-3 cards each with an additional 2 hidden slots. If you are more of a traditionalist looking for something that not only looks amazing but will last for years to come then the Algonquin is perfect for you. Pearson \u00a0The Pearson is a traveler's best friend. Comfortably holding multiple cards, cash and of course your passport safely and securely for those long trips and amazing adventures. When you are not travelling the Pearson can also double as a notebook cover, easily protecting your standard FieldNotes Notebook in style. Colour and Style Options\u00a0 Key Chains Why not get a matching Brass Shackle Keychain with 12 gauge rivet to match your wallet! Materials Leather\u00a0 Sourced from Italy Badalassi Carlo Pueblo and Conceria Walpier Buttero are some of the finest leathers around prized for their smooth texture, colour and durability. \u00a0Our inaugural set of wallets comes in a combination of four colours: Thread After testing numerous thread options I chose a fellow Canadian Company Black Crown Garage thread. Polyamide 66 Threads are made up of macromolecules with repeating units liked together by much stronger amid bonds (Chemical Bonds), other threads are held together by polyester bonds. \u00a0This helps protect against: moisture, acid, sunlight, breaking, temperature and alkaline. Why stitch by hand wouldn't a machine be easier and faster? Yes a machine would be easier and faster but it is an inferior method of stitching. \u00a0Stitching by hand using the Saddle Stitching method creates a more secure and long lasting stitch when compared to machine stitching, although it does take longer. Production Everything is hand crafted by me so as soon as the funds are transferred I can immediately place an order with my supplier for the leather. Once the material is received I will begin crafting your one of a kind, hand made wallet. As soon as your wallet is done I will ship it directly to you using your preferred shipping option where a tracking number will be provided. Because each wallet is made by hand by a single craftsman it will take some time to complete all the orders, as a result I can not guarantee an exact time frame for delivery. \u00a0But rest assured you will receive your wallet and I will make myself available to answer any questions you might have Packaging All wallets will be sent to you in \u201cIndestructible\u201d cardboard boxes with craft paper filler. All of which is 100% recyclable. None of that wasteful packaging that just ends up sitting in a landfill for 100 years. Being named after Parks and Landmarks in Ontario Canada we here at 43 North Leather would like to keep our products as waste free as possible Stretch Goal! $8000 Unlocks Blue and Whiskey Buttero Combo! \u00a0Dimensions\u00a0 Gallery Follow and Share us in Instagram @43_North_Leather",

  "In 2012 the Brushelle Beauty Stand was born of an idea that came from a need. Denise was working for a beauty company that hosted gatherings where techniques for applying makeup using cosmetic brushes were demonstrated and practiced by a number of people. After the meetings were over there were numerous brushes to be washed and dried. It soon became obvious that the typical process of washing and drying brushes could be improved upon, especially the drying and storing of brushes. The common method of drying brushes is to lay them on a towel on a countertop. Laying the brushes flat doesn't promote efficient drying since air can't circulate around the bristles, moisture can't drain from the ferrules, and shaped brushes become flattened. These factors all contribute to shortening the life of expensive brushes, take up space, and don't add to the aesthetics of your beauty space.\u00a0 The Brushelle Beauty Stand provides elegant solutions to all the issues surrounding drying your brushes. The design allows air to circulate around the bristles, uses gravity to promote drying the ferrules, makes economical use of your counter space, and looks great while doing it! Plus, when it comes time to use the brushes, the center support becomes a stylish cup that can be turned end for end to store either long or short handled brushes for use. The Brushelle Beauty Stand does all these useful, practical, and stylish things while being made of the most recyclable plastic there is, minimizing the impact on our environment. The product is super durable, not susceptible to breakage under normal use, requires no batteries, and can handle most brushes except for double ended ones.\u00a0 We're taking this unique opportunity to also donate 10% of our proceeds to the effort in Ukraine, maximizing our purpose and doing our part to give aid to people in need.\u00a0 Finally, a better way to dry and store your makeup brushes! Here\u2019s the rub. \u00a0Fresh, clean brushes feel better when you apply your makeup! Your makeup brushes are expensive, personal tools that need care to extend their life. Your brushes need to be washed gently and often, and though some would view this as a chore, we prefer the tactile experience of hand washing a beautiful brush. But what do you do with your wet, freshly washed brushes? \u00a0Most would lay them on a countertop causing slow drying that flatten the bristles, not to mention taking up a lot of space. The Brushelle Beauty Stand addresses these problems by letting gravity and natural airflow dry your brushes. What else? The principals behind Brushelle Beauty\u00a0have experience in patenting and bringing to market products in the marine, equine and hardware industries. In each case, their approach was to solve a problem or address a need in the most direct, least complicated and quality way possible. With Brushelle Beauty the goal is to develop a line of transformative beauty products, the first of which is the Patented, Made In America, makeup brush stand called Brushelle. \u00a0Other product ideas are under development and new ideas from our customer family are also welcomed. \u00a0All ideas, from product enhancements to joint product ventures and new patents are open for consideration. Our current goal is to deliver the highest quality Brushelle Beauty\u00a0Makeup Stand in as timely a manner as possible. Our current target date for delivery is August 2022. COVID related supply chain issues are difficult to predict but making the product in Southern California with a manufacturer with many years of experience in manufacturing, packaging and order fulfillment gives us a greater degree of control over quality and delivery than products made elsewhere. Are you ready to reimagine beauty? Brush up on all of our updates on manufacturing, delivery, and everything in between at Brushelle Beauty! How can I order a Brushelle Beauty\u00a0Stand? \u00a0Can I pick which color I want? \u00a0You can choose either Obsidian or Pearl. \u00a0We intend to produce limited editions of \u00a0\u00a0additional colors, to be determined by client surveys. \u00a0Members of the original Kickstarter group would have first chance at ordering limited production colors. \u00a0The limited runs would likely be in lots of 1,000. Are the materials sustainable or recyclable? Is there a warranty for damaged parts? When will this be delivered? Can I pick it up in person myself? Will you be making more colors in the future?",
  "The World's Most Discreet High-Fidelity Hearing Protection with Companion Mobile App. Compact Aluminium Case Included. \"While normal earplugs may look kind of silly, the more stylish and informative EarDials might encourage concert-goers to protect their ears\" - Mashable \"EarDial has modernized the old ear plugs to protect your ears from loudness\" - VentureBeat \"Some of the best earplugs there are in the market\" - Beyond The Stage \"EarDial without a doubt a concert-goers best friend\" - Major HiFi \u00a0As seen on If you ever came home with ringing in your ears after attending a loud event, that\u2019s called tinnitus, and although that probably went away, you damaged a certain percentage of your hearing cells permanently. Tinnitus can be permanent (and extremely annoying), and together with NIHL (Noise Induced Hearing Loss), they are diseases worryingly growing among young people.\u00a0 The WHO (World Health Organization) did a study in middle and high-income countries, and they found that nearly 40% of all teenagers and young adults put themselves at risk for NIHL with damaging volumes at entertainment venues. That\u2019s a lot of young people who might permanently damage their ears. Once lost, hearing cannot be restored.\u00a0 Experts agree that long exposure to levels of sound over 85 dB can cause hearing loss. Most clubs and concerts are over 100 dB. The maximum safe-time without protection at that level is around 15 minutes!\n \nIf you enjoy attending clubs, concerts, or other loud events, you need to protect your hearing. The freebie foam ear plugs that you get in some venues, would protect your hearing, but they would also block some of the sound frequencies that we want to enjoy when listening music. Traditional \u201cmusician\u201d ear plugs usually have some color and stick out of your ear which makes you \u201clook funny\u201d. That\u2019s why we created EarDial. The comfortable and discreet hearing protection specially designed for loud music environments.\u00a0 EarDial is perfect for music-lovers, party-goers, DJs, musicians, bartenders, bouncers, and anyone that wants to hear clearly and safely in a loud music event. It\u2019s also perfect for other loud social events, like sport events, or cinemas. EarDial has a high fidelity (Hi-Fi) noise filter, that will block the harmful decibels without sacrificing sound quality. You will be able to enjoy the music and chat with your friends while protecting your hearing. In fact, our earplugs will enhance the music experience to most people, because they remove the ear-pain factor from the loud music. Our design is as discreet as possible. We made it low-profile, so it doesn\u2019t stick out of your ear, but it is still easy to put and remove. \u00a0We use a high-transparency color for both the silicone and the filter, so when you put them in your ear, they take the tone of your skin and are almost invisible. \u00a0This is how they look in your ear: \u00a0This is how we compare to other transparent ear plugs for music: We made them out of hypoallergenic silicone, so it will be nice to your skin no matter how sensitive it is. Also the silicone is very soft, so you can wear them comfortably for long hours. The elasticity of the silicone make your earplugs very resistant and you will be able to reuse them for many years, most likely forever! \u00a0Our exclusive earwax protection will protect the precision filter so you will have your ear plugs clean and with a clear sound for longer. \u00a0You will also get a compact aluminium case with your earplugs. This case is small and with a strong lobster clasp, perfect to put in your keychain or pocket and carry with you comfortably at all times. You will have your earplugs ready to be used even in unexpected situations. The aluminium case has an easy to open and close cap, so you can use it, even if you had a few drinks, without the risk of stripping the thread.\u00a0 In the aluminium case there is also a plastic storage tray that let you store and take out your earplugs easy and safely, reducing the risk of losing them in the middle of the dance floor. By the way, all plastics we use are PET, which is a non-toxic, recyclable material, that won\u2019t release any chemicals, which means they can be in contact with your earplugs and skin safely. Look how our compact case compare to others: \u00a0We developed a companion mobile app that will tell you the approximate sound level pressure you are currently exposed to, and it will tell you how long you can stay at that level without risk of hearing loss. You can compare the results if you are wearing EarDial earplugs or not.\u00a0 When you activate the EarDial switch, it will adjust the calculations based on the EarDial attenuation levels.\u00a0 You have inside more information about the decibel (dB) scale, the noise dose formula, attenuation standards, and more.\u00a0 Here is a demo of the app in use: And here a demo of the results compared with a professional Sound Level Meter: It will be available for iOS and Android (it is not published yet). You will just need to search \u201ceardial\u201d in your app store. Totally free of charge. Useful even if you are not an owner of EarDial earplugs! We are on a mission to bring awareness and let people enjoy loud social events, while protecting their hearing against NIHL (Noise Induced Hearing Loss) and Tinnitus. We'll donate 5% of our profits to charities like Dangerous Decibels or Action on Hearing Loss. When you support EarDial, you are also supporting a good cause. We made a small run with a prototype, just to test our concept, and we already got some glowing reviews! We are looking forward to hear the reviews for the new improved version! That\u2019s great! and you are in luck, because we designed EarDial to be distributor friendly. We want to see EarDial in venues, festivals, bars, shops, markets or kiosks, and we designed our packaging to make your job easier. Same size as a cigarette box:\u00a0We made the EarDial box exactly the same dimensions as a standard cigarette box, which means it could be easily distributed via cigarette vending machines, cigarette racks, or any other vending machine. Removable hanger hole:\u00a0It has a light-weight hanger hole so it can be put in display hooks. If not necessary, the hanger can hide inside the box. PDQ Box Pack:\u00a0As a distributor you will receive a PDQ (Product Displayed Quickly) box with 20 EarDial boxes. You can simply open the box and put it in a table, counter, bar or rack ready to sell. To order multiple units, simply choose the Kickstarter Special reward but pledge the amount for the units that you want. We will send you as many units as you pledged for. For example, if you wanted 3 units you would multiply \u00a319 x 3, so you would pledge \u00a357. As 2 units is a very popular request, we created a reward with that (you know, for the people who don't read all the content).",
  "Hey Family! Music has always been a major part of my life. From childhood into adulthood, I've always been fascinated with music, and more specifically, with creating music. Last year, I was able to record and release my first single, \"Let Me Say\". The positive response and support has truly been overwhelming. I cannot thank you all enough for the support you've given me. When I released my single, I vowed that more music would be on the way. And I am excited to make good on that promise. I've finally finished recording all of the music for my debut EP \"Kairos\". And we are at the last step of this musical journey, Mixing and Mastering. This is where you come in. In order to release music at the quality that I wish for (and frankly, the level of quality that you all deserve), it requires a significant investment. I've been able to finance the majority of this project independently up to this point. This includes everything from studio time, to musical equipment, and producers, etc. However, we're just a little bit short of our goal. I would be honored if you chose to help support this project. Please consider donating today, while also cashing in on some pretty cool donation perks. Peace and Blessings Brother Gabe",

If we're successfully funded, we\u2019ll be able to finish our first production run, ship in bulk to Miami, and open our online store shortly after we ship our Kickstarter backers\u2019 rewards. Our products are focused on women and everything that this word encompasses. Moms, sisters, daughters, wives, and entrepreneurs who seek to highlight their femininity, distinction, passion, and vanity, women who are not afraid to be different, self-confident, fashionable, fun, original, and with a defined personality. At N8A, we design and market leather products for women, focusing on the mix of colors, textures, and the joy that characterizes our customers. The inputs of our products, as well as the manufacture, are directly with Colombian producers.

Vad ska jag g\u00f6ra \u00e5t det?De senaste \u00e5ren har jag spelat golf med meningsmotst\u00e5ndare, \u00e4tit lunch med kvinnliga imamer, intervjuat islamofober, blivit kompis med f\u00f6re detta nazister, lyssnat p\u00e5 poddar med v\u00e4nsterextrema, h\u00f6gerextrema, mailat fram och tillbaka med n\u00e5gra av de vassaste provokat\u00f6rerna i landet och druckit kaffe med f\u00f6re detta buddhistiska skogsmunkar f\u00f6r att f\u00f6rs\u00f6ka hitta mitt lugn igen. Under mitt liv har jag som programledare, journalist och samtalsaktivist \u00e4gnat tiotusentals timmar \u00e5t att just prata med m\u00e4nniskor. Jag har \u00e4gnat otroligt mycket tid \u00e5t att samtala med m\u00e4nniskor som inte t\u00e4nker, tycker eller k\u00e4nner som jag. Det vill jag forts\u00e4tta med men jag vill att du ska f\u00e5 h\u00f6ra de samtalen ocks\u00e5. Under 2018 t\u00e4nker jag bjuda in g\u00e4ster till podden \"Hur kan vi?\" och fr\u00e5ga dem hur de t\u00e4nker, vad de upplever \u00e4r problemet, hur de ser p\u00e5 framtiden, vad de tycker \u00e4r fel och hur de tycker att vi ska g\u00f6ra. Och du har m\u00f6jlighet att vara med p\u00e5 resan,\u00a0 backa mig och p\u00e5verka inneh\u00e5llet och valet av b\u00e5de g\u00e4ster och fr\u00e5gor. Hur ska jag g\u00f6ra det?Jag kommer att s\u00f6ka upp dessa personer, bjuda in dem till min studio i Malm\u00f6 eller \u00e5ka till dem. Jag kommer att g\u00f6ra poddavsnitten b\u00e5de i ljud och \u00e4ven med video n\u00e4r det \u00e4r m\u00f6jligt. Detta kommer att publiceras p\u00e5 tillg\u00e4ngliga poddplattformar, p\u00e5 Youtube och p\u00e5 en hemsida. Jag kommer att marknadsf\u00f6ra podden genom Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin men ocks\u00e5 hitta m\u00f6jligheter att f\u00e5 genom vissa av intervjuerna och ibland delar av dem till traditionell radio, tidningar och Tv.Utifr\u00e5n m\u00e5let med den h\u00e4r kampanjen siktar jag p\u00e5 att g\u00f6ra 20 avsnitt med just fokus p\u00e5 Hur kan vi: prata med varandra. Om kampanjen g\u00e5r \u00f6ver m\u00e5let finns det m\u00f6jlighet till fler avsnitt och \u00e4ven att g\u00f6ra en bok.F\u00f6r att guida mig genom samtalen s\u00e5 har jag skapat ett manifest f\u00f6r b\u00e4ttre samtal. Manifestet:1. Lyssna f\u00f6r att f\u00f6rst\u00e5, inte f\u00f6r att alltid ha r\u00e4tt.2. Ge och ta plats i samtalet3. Uppmuntra varandra att provprata 4. Tala fr\u00e5n sanning s\u00e5 ofta du kan5. V\u00e5ga vara dum ibland6. \u00d6ppna upp och var s\u00e5rbar7. L\u00e4mna egot hemma8. Bejaka det som h\u00e4nder9. Utg\u00e5 ifr\u00e5n att alla g\u00f6r s\u00e5 gott de kan10. T\u00e4nk p\u00e5 att allt \u00e4r p\u00e5hittat Varf\u00f6r just jag?F\u00f6r att ju mer olik en m\u00e4nniska \u00e4r mig desto mer nyfiken blir jag och vill verkligen f\u00f6rst\u00e5 hur de t\u00e4nker.F\u00f6r att det \u00e4r det h\u00e4r jag har gjort de senaste \u00e5ren och nu vill jag g\u00f6ra med fler och tillsammans med er.F\u00f6r att jag \u00e4r s\u00e5 tr\u00f6tt p\u00e5 alla ideologiska l\u00e4ger, grupperingar och idiotiska etiketter.F\u00f6r att jag k\u00e4nner att jag blir smartare av att prata med m\u00e4nniskor som inte \u00e4r som jag och jag vill att vi ska bli smartare tillsammans.F\u00f6r att jag vill, kan, har erfarenhet, n\u00e4tverk, tid och lust att g\u00f6ra det. Vad ska det leda till?Dessa tjugo avsnitt ska leda till ytterligare tjugo som i sin tur ska leda till ytterligare tjugo. Varje g\u00e4st f\u00e5r tipsa mig om en person som jag ska tr\u00e4ffa. Varje samtal leder till nya fr\u00e5gor. Varje fr\u00e5ga leder till ett nytt samtal.I slutet av det h\u00e4r \u00e5ret ska jag samla alla tankar, samtal och fr\u00e5gor och s\u00e4tta ihop till en bok. Boken ges ut n\u00e4sta \u00e5r och kan tillsammans med en f\u00f6rel\u00e4sning sprida sig till fler personer, grupper, kommuner, organisationer och n\u00e4tverk. Med hj\u00e4lp av den kan vi \u00f6ka nyfikenheten till andra m\u00e4nniskor och hj\u00e4lpa varandra att bli klokare genom samtal. Syftet med boken \u00e4r dels att dela med sig av n\u00e5gra bitar av samtalen men ocks\u00e5 ge verktyg, r\u00e5d och tips och samtalsfr\u00e5gor f\u00f6r att kunna skapa fler samtal mellan fler m\u00e4nniskor som annars inte hade pratat med varandra. Visionen:Jag tror att det tar tid att f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra ett samtalsklimat. Jag ser inte det h\u00e4r som n\u00e5got jag kan f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra sj\u00e4lv p\u00e5 fem eller femtio \u00e5r. Jag har en femhundra\u00e5rsvision som jag b\u00f6rjar plantera f\u00f6r redan nu. Om jag b\u00f6rjar lyssna p\u00e5 fr\u00e4mlingar, meningsmotst\u00e5ndare och samtalar med m\u00e4nniskor som jag \u00e4r r\u00e4dd f\u00f6r, inte har samma \u00e5sikter som, som jag tycker \u00e4r jobbiga och utmanande, s\u00e5 kan fler g\u00f6ra det. Det blir ringar p\u00e5 vattnet, b\u00e5de \u00f6ver v\u00e4rlden idag men ocks\u00e5 \u00f6ver tid. Det vi b\u00f6rjar odla idag kommer att kunna bli n\u00e5got om hundra \u00e5r och om femhundra \u00e5r kanske m\u00e4nniskor har b\u00f6rjat \u00e4ndra sin ton gentemot varandra, st\u00e4lla andra typer av fr\u00e5gor, prata p\u00e5 ett annat s\u00e4tt. Jag tror det tar tid att f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra ett samtalsklimat men jag tror verkligen att det g\u00e5r. Vad kommer pengarna g\u00e5 till?De 20 avsnitten kommer att ha en budget p\u00e5 ungef\u00e4r 10.000 kronor per avsnitt och dessa pengar kommer att budgeteras noga f\u00f6r redigering och postproduktion av ljud och video samt kostnader f\u00f6r studio, webbhosting, formgivning, utrustning, eventuella resor f\u00f6r g\u00e4st och det lilla som sen blir kvar per avsnitt f\u00f6r den tid jag och de personer som hj\u00e4lper mig med detta l\u00e4gger ner. 20 avsnitt x 10.000 = 200.000 Vad h\u00e4nder n\u00e4r vi n\u00e5r \u00f6ver m\u00e5let?200.000 = 20 poddavsnitt i ljud och video250.000 = 30 poddavsnitt i ljud och video300.000 = 40 poddavsnitt i ljud och video samt BOKEN400.000 = 50 poddavsnitt i ljud och video samt BOKEN och vi arrangerar en helkv\u00e4ll LIVE i Stockholm dit vi bjuder in de mest uppskattade g\u00e4sterna fr\u00e5n podden och dit du som backare har m\u00f6jlighet att f\u00e5 en biljett. ( Alla bel\u00f6ningar uppdateras n\u00e4r de tillt\u00e4nkta niv\u00e5erna klaras av. N\u00e4r vi kommer \u00f6ver 300.000 kommer det upp nya backningsm\u00e5l d\u00e4r du te.x kan f\u00e5 bok eller bokpaket. ) Tack:Och har du l\u00e4st s\u00e5 h\u00e4r l\u00e5ngt s\u00e5 har jag lyckats f\u00e5nga ditt intresse och din uppm\u00e4rksamhet. Jag g\u00f6r det h\u00e4r f\u00f6r att jag verkligen tror p\u00e5 samtalet. Jag har brunnit f\u00f6r det h\u00e4r s\u00e5 l\u00e4nge och \u00e4r redo att ta n\u00e4sta steg och \u00e4r tacksam f\u00f6r ditt engagemang, ditt st\u00f6d och att du \u00e4r med p\u00e5 resan. Om vi tillsammans kan f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra samtalet kan vi ocks\u00e5 f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra samh\u00e4llet.  Samtalet forts\u00e4tter.Med v\u00e4rme. Navid Modiri",

  "Hello everyone, my name is Randy May. I'm the creator of Double Tap Audio. With your help we will be producing what we like to call, Double Tap R1 headphones. The idea behind this came to us after having countless sets of headphones break over the years. We wanted to fix this problem without sacrificing a quality listening experience. After months of research, testing and prototyping we made a set of headphones that we are proud to call our own. We wanted the appearance to reflect the durably and strength of the headphones. We used modified 40 Cal once fire brass along with mat black anodized aluminum housing for the earphone shells. We found this solid metal build greatly reduces sound leaking in and out of the earphones, along with being much more durable compared to plastic. One of the biggest problems causing most headphones to fail is strain on the wiring or poor quality wire. We feel we have fixed these problem on our headphones. We are using a multi-layer cord design that allows the strain to beheld by the outer layer. By doing this it allows the wires to float inside, taking little to no strain. Another problem is the wire will break do to kinking or being bent over and over. To help fix this problem we are using thick highly flexible wire. This wire along with the outer paracord help keep the wires from kinking or breaking. We didn't want this highly durable design to be lacking in sound, so we used the biggest dynamic coil drivers we could get into the house. We wanted a good balance of highs, mids and lows. That being said, we have used drivers that deliver crisp highs and mids and a deep bass note. The headphones are noise canceling and come with two styles of ear bud tips. One style can be used for sitting and walking around. The other style is for being more active. We a have every supplier lined up and ready to ship out. We are ready to start producing them, the only thing left is your help. With your funding we will be able to get everything we will need to start making these ideas and prototypes into a reality. We can't do this without you though, so with your support of $55 or more you will get a set of the Double Tap R1 headphones as a reward before anyone else. If you has any questions, check out the FAQ on the bottom of the page. If you can't find an answer to your question, feel free to ask and we will get back to you asap.",
  "Here's THE HONEST TRUTH.. When I first started doing UBER.. I was sleeping in my car after \"up and moving\" to Atlanta.. The girl I was dating, CHEATED on me DAYS before I moved in.. NEEDLESS to say.. We broke up.. lol.. (Funny now.. Wasn't then..) I had moved in with HER and one of HER FRIENDS.. (NOT my brightest moment lol..) I had NO money.. Nowhere to stay.. Just a car.. My insurance was due to lapse in a few days and then i'd be short the ONE THING that I owned.. \u00a0Decided that i'd give UBER a try.. I'd spent YEARS bartending so talking to strangers was/is kinda my thing.. lol.. Made a few bucks.. Got on my feet.. . .. ...\u00a0 Went back to working a regular job.. Like an idiot.. lol..\u00a0 I KNOW.. I KNOW.. Stupid.. lol I knew what my DREAM was.. I KNEW WHY i moved to Atlanta in the first place..\u00a0 but I was SCARED.. I was DEPRESSED.. ANXIOUS.. and a host of other emotions.. \u00a0Through all of that.. I still had DREAMS.. I got FIRED from that job that I HATED.. and then I was back to UBER.. lol.. This DREAM turned into this IDEA...\u00a0 I'm hoping to turn this IDEA, into a platform!! #TheMovingVenue is simply what I call it.. So MANY of my followers in the past year have come from driving UBER/LYFT around Atlanta/Houston. This started as JUST an idea to get my music heard by people while working.. I needed a way to be able to help take acre of my babies and STILL CHASE this dream.. So i came up with this.. It's still in its infancy and I DEFINITELY need some help perfecting the model but in my dream.. These conversations.. These connections.. They take on a whole NEW LIFE.. There is NO SCRIPT.. The MUSIC is REAL.. The RIDERS are REAL and SO are their REACTIONS. When I'm depressed and don't REALLY feel like DRIVING.. I am motivated by knowing that I'm gonna make someone's day!! I've been through some TERRIBLE things, but I find a way to smile through that hurt when I know it means reaching someone genuinely. THESE STRANGERS have helped me so much! Some might say that I've helped them.. If i have.. If I will.. I do so with PRIDE.. THIS IS MY MUSIC.. THIS IS MY PASSION.. LIFE is SHORT, but so is an UBER/LYFT ride. Why NOT make this one your BEST EVER?!? THE BOTTOM LINE To film this show the way that it SHOULD be.. I'd need a camera that films 4kHD footage, Mounting equipment, Microphone, and some LIGHTING. I'll have to sit down with a team to perfect the model of the series.. I need VIDEO editing templates to help EDIT the raw footage down and create the episodes.. I want the series to be REAL but NOT sloppy.. I am ALSO gonna need to MARKET the series across Social Media. I'll need to keep the car up, running, and clean!!! \u00a0I've budgeted for all these things AND the ELABORATE REWARDS that I want to give you guys in the $3000 that I'm trying to raise! I'm prepared to make the BEST POSSIBLE use of every single dollars raised.\u00a0 This has the POTENTIAL to be something TRULY special..\u00a0 Will you help a DREAM come TRUE?",
  "Alone Again is a short film that gives an intimate yet humorous look into a young woman's different relationships and dating over the span of a few years. This dark comedy of errors follows her evolution of naivety transforming into strength throughout various experiences. I've been a professional photographer for 5 years, predominately focusing on behind the scenes, street photography and musicians.\u00a0 I have always had a strong interest in human interactions especially regarding how two people interpret one situation in different ways.\u00a0 When I first wrote this short film, I wrote it with the intention of one friend reading it as an exercise for myself. It allowed me to be candid and probably more open in a way that felt therapeutic so I sent it around to about 20 friends to get feedback and notes.\u00a0 The more I worked on it the more I fell in love with the idea of creating it. I was very inspired that some of the people I sent it to felt understood and not \"alone\" while others felt like they were gaining a different perspective.\u00a0 I wanted to do a Kickstarter to get people involved who probably had no idea I wrote a short film and to ensure that I can cover expenses for crew, wardrobe, set decorating, camera, hair & make-up, etc.\u00a0 I have a lot of amazing people helping me out solely out of love and appreciation for this project but unfortunately that doesn't cover everything that has been budgeted out.\u00a0 I'm humbly asking for help & support so that I can make my short film in the best way that I am able to. Here's a rough outline of the budget:",
  "Welcome to the Kickstarter for Amor Fati sketchbook 1! \u00a0Amor Fati is an ongoing online comic illustrated and written by Zilo (me).  It's a romance between a young boy Yoko and an old man Akihiro. They are boys, they have a huge age gap, a different perception of life, a different style, personality.... and above all there is the society looks. But they deeply fell in love, even if they have their prejudice. They have to accept their destiny, it's with this idea in mind and my love for the korean group Epik High that I created \"Amor Fati\". I gave this name to the webcomic thanks to the song \"Amor Fati\" by which I found this concept to \"love the destiny\" to accept our choices. Yoko and Akihiro will faces their choices.\u00a0  \u00a0Have you ever been in love?\nFallen in love at first sight like in a movie?\nWaited in the pouring rain?\nRun towards him like crazy?\nWatched him secretly? Gone crazy? I don't mind your sex, gender, old age... I can't stop love. \u00a0The book will be printed in A5, landscape for +40 pages in full color. I've prepared some stretch goals to thanks you for supporting this project. \nThose will be available when the additional goals get unlocked and it'll be added for those who took the physical copy. Hope you like it ^^  Most of the funding is going to printing costs (because the printer I'll use isn't in my country), for the shipping because the French Post is very expensive for the sends, a small split for Kickstarter and credit card fees.

Wow your family and friends with a dish that is sure to have them asking for more. These cookbooks are sure to be a hit for everyone in your family. Included in every cookbook is over 200 half page recipes with plans to add more in the future. These recipes range from delicious entrees to mouthwatering deserts that will mimick your favorite resturants taste.",
  "It places an emphasis on building up your kitchen over time, working with what you have, and learning about the interactions between ingredients rather than memorizing recipes. Most of the time... Googling for recipes can lead to some delicious food, but it often leaves you with leftover ingredients or an oddly specific piece of cookware (wheel of cheese anyone?). To compound this, putting emphasis on individual recipes often leaves you hanging when it comes to understanding what makes food good. When a video talks about how to make some killer tacos, you learn how to make those killer tacos. But what about other options? What about if I only have turkey, and not beef/pork/South American caiman meat like the recipe says? What if I don't have a sous vide machine? WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE CILANTRO? Frankly, it's hard to get into cooking. There's a lot of equipment involved, a lot of ingredients, and that means a lot of money. And nobody wants to drop a stack of cash on high tech hardware and fancy spices if it might not pan (hah!) out. I'm making a series with the goal of giving a step by step process for someone who wants to start cooking from square one. Each episode will focus on tips and tricks related to cooking that week's recipes, as well as actually showing them being cooked. There will also be a limited list of \"investment\" items, such as cookware, spices, utensils, or other items that have a high up front cost, as well as a shopping list for more standard ingredients. Recipes for a given period are planned assuming that the watcher has nothing more than the shopping list, and any previous investments. (For example, if week one would require purchasing a baking dish and some garlic powder, then week two recipes would also be able to use those things). There's also a goal of not leaving leftover ingredients where possible. If I tell you to buy a bag of potatoes, the schedule will have you eat them all sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, each episode would also discuss things such as cooking techniques, flavor profiles, and equipment maintenance. It is important to note that this will NOT be a universal source of cooking knowledge. I've worked hard and learned a lot, but I still can't teach you how to slice an onion as well as Alton Brown or how to cook a steak as perfectly as Gordon Ramsey. Although the idea was originally composed for people getting into cooking for the first time, the emphasis on learning flavors and the meal prepping aspect mean that this curriculum is a great asset to people who want to learn a little more, or who would like an easy weekly shopping list in the style of Hellofresh or Blue Apron. This series would have episodes every week or two, and would be complimented by published recipes (cooking along to a video leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion) written in a way that allows for preparing for a weekend shopping trip and adjusting ingredient counts for different numbers of people. The time frame to complete filming is still up in the air, because I haven't completed the entire schedule, but I will have the writing ready by the end of the year so that I can send out the E-Book by January 2021. This may not teach as many fancy recipes as a professional chef's class or a specialist cooking channel, but learning about components and interactions in your own meals allow you to take someone else's recipe and adapt it for yourself. You can work around your own eating style, whether that means addressing lactose intolerance, veganism, or just a simple hatred of a single ingredient. You aren't learning lessons from me, you're learning lessons from the food. I'm just the guy who plans it out. I've always been interested in cooking to some degree. I made casseroles, chili, and grilled cheese, and even had my own\u00a0homemade pizza dough when I was younger. When I got to College I was able to largely avoid cooking by buying a lot of microwavable foods and eating a frankly disgusting amount of fast food. I was that one roommate who would never have food in the house, and who would make a trip to McDonald's at the drop of a hat. I finished four years of education with 2 plates, a set of silverware, and a baking sheet. I've recently been taking advantage of my post-graduation unemployed status to stress about money, but in my free time I've been getting back into cooking and finding that it's a new passion of mine. And because of my unique situation, (read: completely empty personal kitchen) I've been planning the order that I want to buy spices, cookware, and ingredients. I had the idea to write my plan up into a cohesive curriculum, and here I am! The funding goal is predominantly set to allow me to spend more money and time working on recipes and planning sets of meals. It also allows me to actually buy the cookware myself before I suggest it to you guys. Other expenditures include good video equipment (why do you think I only have pictures here?) as well as contracting help for things such as editing videos, editing text, and graphic work on the recipe book. I promise that I won't be blowing all the money on the nicest possible stuff, because I can't recommend that an absolute beginner gets a $300 dollar cast iron griddle. Stretch Goals: This additional material would include printed material, whether additions to the recipe book, or an entire separate document. At the same time, the more funding obtained for the campaign, the more content I can add to the standard videos, and the more esoteric recipes and techniques I can discuss.\u00a0",

  "This is a space adventure on stage... With robots... What else do you need to know?! Well, probably a lot... Once upon a time in space, on the planet earth, in a strange desert landscape called Albuquerque, there was born an idea. The idea started out simple enough: \"Do you maybe want to write a science fiction play with me?\" The answer: \"Yes!\" We realized that there is indeed a shortage, perhaps even a lack, of science fiction in the world of theater. What we would like to do, what we would like your help to do, is create a one-act never-before-seen space adventure on stage, complete with remote controlled robot actors, holograms, airlock mishaps and deep space battles on a fully functional spaceship set! We discover a hapless protein portion chemist (ship's cook) floating through deep space after being blasted out of an airlock while unloading supplies on the exploration vessel he and his crew have been on for just 8 days. With no knowledge of what happened or where he is, all seems lost for the ill-fated fellow. Until he runs smack dab into the side of a mysterious space craft that has a convenient \"Push to Open Airlock\" button located on the outside of the ship. And so he does. The lights on his space suit sweep across a dark control room illuminated by small orange and blue lights, \u00a0keypads that shimmer with analog patterns and glowing cabinets full of strange containers. \u00a0Suddenly the lights go up and a hologram of a ship comes to life in the middle of the room. \u00a0The Astronaut stares with curiosity. His emergency ejection space suit is in stark contrast to the room around him. It is sleek and simple, cool and modern, and the craft he stands in is DEFINITELY ANYTHING BUT. In fact, it is reminiscent of a much much earlier time. Wood paneling runs along many of the control panels, a lounge fully decorated with a mid century chandelier!? Did he just step into some mixed up interior of a vintage space Cadillac? Astronaut soon discovers that this spaceship, which appeared to be abandoned, is in fact inhabited by a small, lonely robot named Edmund, who he has been waiting a very long time for someone to rescue him.\u00a0 We don't want to give away anything else because there are many twists and turns! But, through worm holes and hijinks, space invasions and existential conversations, they will try to defy the odds and make their way back home together. We will be working in collaboration with several outstanding people and organizations (hopefully some of you who may be reading this). We were recently awarded a Resiliency Residency grant from the City of Albuquerque Urban Enhancement Trust Fund. We were lucky enough to excite interest in our project from many of the people who sat on the awards committee. Hooray! Through this grant we were placed with Fusion Theater Company who will be both guide and advisor through our process.\u00a0 We are currently in the process of script revisions, set designs, and of course robot building! We have already gone through several design phases for Edmund and are about to begin the actual fabrication and build. Our robot is one of the most exciting things about this project, (and expensive about $7k). Never before (bold words, but true as far as our research has shown) has a full-sized remote controlled robot droid been the main character of a fully produced stage play. And actually, we have two!\u00a0See below image for a sneak peak at SQU33N-CH (Squ\u0113\u0113nch). Edmund's trusty Sub-quantum data storage rover buddy! We have teamed up with Fonco Studios, a wonderful and brilliant fabrication shop in Los Angeles, who will be building our Edmund robot. They are just as excited as we are to bring Edmund to life. This is a big cost for this project but, because they are as obsessed with robots as we are, they have agreed to do it at a fraction of the cost for what they do for the movies. Their website states that they specialize in \"creating the unusual and unbelievable\" which we feel is totally fitting for this\u00a0project as that is what we hope to achieve with this performance. The set is another very exciting and expensive character in this play. Our goal with this set is to create a beautiful mash-up of mid century, art deco and the future! With airlock doors, windows to space, sliding hatches, holograms, computer screens, a laboratory, art deco lounge, captains chair, pilot stations and even a Meal-O-Matic food machine, this set will look and function like a legitimate spaceship movie set.\u00a0 We calculate that this set will cost us at least $10k to create and a full 2 months to construct and be the best and hardest time of our life! Astronaut will be a contrast from the set and our robots since he is from the future and the robots are from...well we can't give that away yet. But anyway, we have an amazing local costume designer on board to help create his look. Astronaut's form fitting future suit will incorporate an LED fiber optic material that can shift colors as well as a sleek gold visored white helmet. \u00a0We are very excited to create our very own never-before-seen space suit! There are a few other characters that appear either in person or on the holo monitor via video feed but we don't want to give them all away because some of them may not make the final script revision... but these three villains will definitely be there! George and the probes. First we want to mention, because it may be a question many have, why tickets are not part of most of the rewards for donations. Two reasons, one is that the non profit theater hosting us does have overhead costs we hope to recoup. And the second is a portion of all ticket sales regardless of profit or loss for JoyrKade, will be going straight to Global Giving for the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund. And any profit in ticket sales will be donated as well. We feel it. And trying to raise money for something like this when people across the world, not only Ukraine, are suffering, is not lost in our hearts and efforts. \u00a0We are doing this for the art, with all our expertise and heart. And if we can contribute to the efforts to help those in most need, that's what we will do! The grant amount ($2500) as helpful and motivating as it is, is a drop in the bucket for this project. Our goal of $10k will get us half way there so we really are hoping to exceed that goal by as much as possible and even take the production on tour. The actual budget reflected by everything our imagination has brought to this production would be close to $30k and we are already putting in much of our own money to do this. We begin building our set at The Cell Theater, this week! \u00a0When the calendar opened up and the grant was awarded, we committed to it. We've taken off 3 months of work to do it and every dollar will be going into the production, so we are all in! Performances are already scheduled the last 3 weeks of June into July at The Cell Performance space. Opening June 16th and closing on July 2nd.\u00a0 We are confident our community will help get us the $10k through Kickstarter which will get us close, but hoping to exceed that and get our robot arms! And all the other fantastic tech and toys we have planned for this show. Ultimately, if we can exceed our goal by enough, we'd love to take this show on the road to other cities, theater's and communities to experience as well! Ross Kelly is a producer, writer and actor who has been a member of both SAG and AEA for almost 20 years. He has worked as a commercial and music video producer in Los Angeles for the last 10 years before relocating back to Albuquerque in 2020. He has written, produced and directed award winning plays and won Clio Awards for commercial projects he has produced. It's been a while, but this project will be a return to the stage in all those roles while bringing his producing experience of the last decade to elevate this show! He will be playing Astronaut. Sarah Loeppke studied film in college and graduated in 2009 from the University of New Mexico. She has over 12 years of experience working in the film industry and is a member of the IATSE 480 and a member of the Art Directors Guild 800. She currently works as a production designer and art director and has designed sets for music videos, commercials, and feature films. She loves being involved in all the details from set construction to custom prop creation. Some of her favorite sets that she has designed include, a post apocalyptic sushi food truck, a science fiction machine that sends people to other dimensions, and a gloomy old castle tower where sleeping beauty pricks her finger on a spinning wheel. Sarah has also written and directed several short films and so far, has had one brief and successful stint as an actress. She loves good storytelling and shares a love of science fiction, vintage design, and robots with her co-creator Ross Kelly. She will be operating Edmund the Robot during the performances and possibly making a small guest appearance as a space scientist! Elijah Kelly is Ross' son and he will be voicing Edmund! Ross and Elijah wrote and shot a series of comedy shorts over the pandemic that partially inspired the casting and collaboration for this project. Simple low-fi iPhone movies to make us laugh but they made some other people laugh too. This we hope, will do the same! In addition to funding, we know we are going to need a team of both experienced and non-experienced stage folks for the run of the show. We are in the process of vetting a stage manager, board op/tech, prop master and 3 stage hands. We have budgeted to pay these roles and are open to anyone who is interested! Please feel free to contact us ASAP. Also looking for prosthetic make up artist, video editor, VFX artist, CGI, graphic artist and animators who might want to be involved! We have some of these folks but we have a long list! We have a short amount of time to accomplish quite a lot. We have put real life on hold for a few priceless months in order to create something we know will be very special. If anyone else feels a call to this adventure we want to know.",
  "And his story is one we want your help to share. Please join us on this incredible journey that we're taking: from a speech by a mother struggling to understand her son, to a play about a family faced with tragedy, to a show about a boy pulling his family back together and, with your support, we want to take this story to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. We have a wonderful script, a very supportive venue and a production team committed to telling this story in the best possible way. With your help, all this and more is possible. Our Boy by Helen Hammond is a one act play inspired by real events. Joe is a 14 year old autistic boy whose parents are separated and the play opens to find him shivering and alone after having been raped on his way home from school. The play follows Joe and his family on their journey into learning to cope, not only with the aftermath but with each other. As all three characters (Joe, his mother and his father) muddle through as best they can, they begin to rediscover how to connect as a family and look toward a brighter future. \"Before beginning a life of playwriting I spent 40 years as a Paediatrician so, although the story and characters are fictional, the story of Joe and his family is one I felt compelled to tell after so long working with many children and families who have faced the same traumas. The play, as it is now, began life as a monologue from Joe's mother where she struggles to come to terms with how Joe has grown through his trauma and feeling adrift from the son she thought she knew. I was studying directing when I wrote it and got together with some of the other students to develop the monologue into a full one act play. We entered the play into a festival where it was commended and we felt the next step for us was to take the play to the Edinburgh Fringe. By writing and staging the play, we hope to promote greater understanding and support for young people and families in our communities who are living with any kind of disability or suffering from abuse. We understand that these are serious issues and not everyone's stories end well but we have tried to tell this story with moments of humour and a final note of optimism.\" - Helen Hammond I came to writing and directing in theatre as a second career, having retired from a more than full time career as a Consultant Paediatrician where I specialised in early child development, neuro-disability, and child protection, and was awarded an OBE for services to medicine and health care. More recently, I've benefitted from the availability of online playwriting tuition from the Bishopsgate Institute as well as City Lit in London as well as having obtained an ATCL Diploma in Directing and Devising from Acting Out Drama School in Edinburgh, during which I met Chris and Steve who are now helping me bring Joe's story to life. I first dipped my toe into directing movement whilst at University, although it was mostly by accident. It started with taking a very active role in devising with guidance from visiting Choreographers and resulted in me begrudgingly becoming my flatmate's assistant Choreographer for his degree piece. My first professional opportunity as a director came soon after when I helmed a satirical piece of new writing at the 2018 Carlisle Fringe. At that point I was hooked and have since directed shows big and small with the likes of Some Kind of Theatre, Bard in the Botanics and Scottish Opera. I started writing songs 35 years ago and I've released studio albums and singles with Dogs of Autumn, Starfly69 and Einstein\u2019s Wardrobe. I will also be releasing songs as a solo artist during 2022. \u00a0On top of that, I've written some TV themes including \u201cHow 2\u201d on ITV and some music for Sky Sports. Some other highlights of my song writing career include a 2002 song for the Scottish Team at the Manchester Commonwealth Games, and songs written in support of charities such as Alzheimer\u2019s Scotland, Winston\u2019s Wish and lt\u2019s Good to Give. I am currently collaborating on projects with recording artists and writers based in the UK, Ireland, USA, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Australia and Canada. You can find us on Facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/buildingblockscollective and on Instagram @buildingblockscollective For the sake of full transparency, the below figures indicate where the money is going: Now, the eagle eyed amongst you will notice that this combined amount exceeds the \u00a34k goal set on this Kickstarter page. Our intention is to cover the initial costs with this Kickstarter and cover the rest with ticket sales. The creative team will also not be taking a wage from this production until the above costs are met. Once we have covered all the listed costs then any profit will be divided between the creative team and the actors. Actor's wage is based upon the Equity Fringe Agreement as listed here: https://ardenttheatre.squarespace.com/s/Equity-Fringe-Agreement.pdf Much as the situation has improved over the past couple of years, we will still be following the guidelines for auditions and rehearsals as set out by Equity (see www.equity.org.uk/coronavirus). We do not currently have an official statement from the Edinburgh Fringe Society regarding the 2022 festival but we are in constant contact with both the venue and the rehearsal premises regarding safety precautions and current government guidelines. Thank you so much for taking the time to read a bit about our story and why we want to bring Our Boy to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Hopefully we will be able to bring more stories to the stage in future and be able to share them with you all.",

  "Jerry Nova's Love Extravaganza is a short film about one man's love for Pizza, and that relationships come in all shapes and sizes. In this case it's a large pepperoni triangle. Unfortunately for Jerry, his parents (born of traditional values) are not okay with with his taboo relationship. He must fight for his right to love and things will get cheesy. This story is near and dear to us because if you haven't guessed, we too are pizza lovers! In honor of our favorite food creation we thought there was no better way than to make a short film to spread light, or should I say spread sauce on this delectable cuisine. Our story also has an underlining theme of acceptance. \u00a0Acceptance in the idea that love will always prevail, so be who you want to be! We have finished principle photography, but there is much more to do! Just like a chef creates his pizza masterpiece that all his customers salivate over, we too must go through the proper steps in order to make our film a creation our audience will enjoy. Here are some of the following steps we have left in the post-production (the toppings) process including: It's not easy being cheesy, but we are willing to put the work in to get this film done and to share it with you and the world, or at least anyone who likes pizza.\u00a0 Kari Wishingrad as Lisa Nova Not to be messed with. Lisa Nova was raised on corn beef and potatoes. No pizza in her family. She's quiet until you speak out of term. Then you're in for a whirlwind of Mom attitude.\u00a0 Greg Pedemonte as Harry Nova Proper gentleman. Greets everyone he meets with respect. The man of the house mentality. When it comes to pizza though, you better watch out. He takes no gruff, \"My way or the highway\". There's only room for his wife's meatloaf in his stomach.\u00a0 Co-Director/Writer Johnny Roman: the crust of of the pizza crew. The foundation for any good pizza. His favorite pizza is something that's not invented yet. We're all waiting. \u00a0Co-Director/Writer/Lead Actor Kevin Ulrich: the sauce. Smooth like the creamy marinara sauce hot out the oven. His favorite pizza is mushroom, pepperoni. He enjoys picking his own mushrooms on hikes. (don't recommend this).\u00a0 \u00a0Art Director Brandie Rovito: the cheese. Best thing since slice bread. The cheese melts the ingredients of a film together. Her favorite pizza is none of your business. Caution when hot! \u00a0Director of Photography Brandon Garcia: the toppings. There is no such thing as pizza without it's toppings. Whether you like the veggie surprise or the all meaty delight, the toppings complete the magic that is our pizza crew. His favorite pizza happens to be stuff crust. \u00a0Assistant Director\u00a0 Kevin Molohan: the stud. He told me to write that. His favorite pizza is sausage.",
  "Are you fascinated by strange\u00a0behavior?Do you like true crime and scary stories?Are you curious about the science behind why we do what we do?Then you should be listening to\u00a0Psychologia. What is Psychologia? Psychologia is a podcast exploring human psychology, with a focus on its dark side. The name is the root word for\u00a0psychology, which is derived from the Greek psukhe meaning \"breath, spirit, soul,\" and logia, meaning the \"study of\" or \"research.\"\u00a0Each episode of Psychologia examines a new facet of human behavior and the stories, laws, and research behind it. We've already self-produced one season with nine great episodes - and a budget of $0! We're very proud of the results, and if you haven't had a chance to check them out, here's a little run-down (you can find more details and listen to them all here): Who makes Psychologia? Your host, Amaia Perta, has a master's of science in forensic psychology and is a graduate of Bard College and a former student at UCLA. Psychologia was born last year as a culmination of her deep interest in the darker side of psychology and its history, as well as her undergraduate degree in theater and performing arts. In addition to the individualized focus of each topic, every episode has a completely original score and sound design composed by musician and engineer, Cambron Carter (whose first full-length album was just released on Spotify). This seamlessly-produced element brings a new soundscape to each show, creating a fresh atmosphere to underscore the material. We need your help.\u00a0Our goal is to make the second season of Psychologia a bi-weekly ten-episode season, with a five-month run. All of season one was recorded in our homes with basic equipment and minimal technology, and we had no sponsorship or external support.\u00a0 We want to add some cool features to season two, like travel to site-specific locations and interviews with experts - plus better sound quality and variation - but that requires a budget. We need funding to upgrade our equipment and editing software, pay for the platforms we use to post and share the podcast, support the research that goes into each episode, and underwrite the exciting changes we want to make. If this campaign is successful, it will make all of that a reality! Get excited, because we have so many ideas for season two! Here are just a few of the topics we might make into episodes if we reach our goal: Support Psychologia!\u00a0Pledge now and get some great thank you rewards, like a limited edition Psychologia pint glass, a handwritten postcard, a personal \"on-air\" thank you - and even the chance to pick the topic for a full episode!

  "It's time! Rising Sand has become a menace the internet can no longer contain on its own, and the ceremonial (book-)binding ritual must begin! Rising Sand is a fantasy adventure webcomic that tells the story of Dal, a precocious runaway who learns that the sun itself is falling out of the sky, and that civilization has little time to prepare for\u2014or perhaps avoid\u2014the end. To make matters worse, Dal's zealous paladin sister Ro is hot on her tail, determined to drag her back to the life she left behind. Braving perilous ruins and murderous cultists, Dal will find her place in the world, even if it kills her. And everyone else. First launched online in 2016, Rising Sand is an award-winning, meticulously illustrated story that presents ubiquitous human anxieties such as finding our tribe, sacrificing our happiness for the ones we love, climate change, and the acceptance of death through the lens of a light-hearted\u2014and sometimes gut-wrenching\u2014pre-post-apocalyptic world on the edge of its own extinction. A blend of science fiction, high fantasy, and even slice of life makes Rising Sand a rich and rousing adventure for readers of all ages, provided they can squint through the occasional exploding head.  RISING SAND Volume One is a ninety-page softcover tome collecting the first Act of the story, which introduces us to Dal, her friends, and the world of Erj, and builds to a brutal clash as Dal and her sister finally cross paths\u2014again, for the first time. Remastered lettering and artwork, gorgeous 80lb matte paper, and exclusive extra pages featuring behind-the-sand production art, some of which has never been seen online, makes RISING SAND Volume One the most definitive version of the story to date!  It sounds like we have everything under control\u2014what do we need you for? Come on, this is Kickstarter. You know why you\u2019re here. Printing books is very, very expensive. But not impossible! Not if we do it together. We\u2019d love your help to make this project happen, and are willing to show you a very clever chart to get it. As you can see, printing books and shipping them to you dominates the funding goal. The plan is to print enough for the campaign and, in a perfect world, have a few left over for conventions and shops. Every dollar will be put back into the campaign\u2014including towards stretch goals, which, for the time being, are under wraps. We don\u2019t want to jinx anything. But forget about that for now; I see you eyeing that \u2018rewards\u2019 sliver, there\u2026 Our reward structure is pretty simple; frankly, our primary aim is little more than to have the book in everyone's hands without requiring a mountain of money to convert into trinkets. Nevertheless, we\u2019ve the typical selection of stickers, pins, guest artwork, and even the Rising Sand soundtrack EP to slake your material thirst, available in the tiers to your right. Let\u2019s take a closer look at them! Note: As indicated, all prices are in CAD, so in the statistical likelihood you're reading this from the US or Europe, these are probably going to be a bit less than the numbers would make it seem. Bonus! You did it! You're helping! And your name will be remembered forever, etched permanently into RISING SAND Volume One! To commemorate your triumph, receive a high-quality digital PDF edition of the book, immune to all the spills and filth of IRL. This tier includes: Complete the Erjan experience on your desktop or mobile device with a suite of digital extras, including a bevy of high-rez, pre-formatted RS wallpapers, as well as Music To Go To Waste, the official Rising Sand soundtrack EP by composer Lukus Benoit, in both high-quality MP3 and lossless FLAC formats! For the curious, it sounds a little like this: This tier includes: This is it! The book itself! With the binding ritual complete, you'll receive a trophy in the form of a physical copy of RISING SAND Volume One, ready to mount on your favourite shelf, coffee table, or comic rack, and be bragged about to your friends and loved ones! You can also read it, if you want. This tier includes: Make Nyue proud with a cache of additional physical rewards, including an XL holographic RS logo sticker, antique silver-finish lapel pin, and a trio of 8x10 frame-ready Rising Sand prints by special guest illustrators Sophie Campbell (Wet Moon, Shadoweyes), Guillaume Bonnet (The Thief of Tales), and Melissa Pagluica (Above the Clouds)! It's dangerous to go alone, and we've found ourselves lucky enough to bring along some truly unique voices to help round out this vision of Erj. Your walls, your laptop, your YOU will have never looked so beautifully bleak! We'll also sign your copy of the book on request. This tier includes: For backers with only the biggest thirst\u2014let Jenn slake it with a bespoke, traditional, one-of-a-kind portrait sketch of your favourite Rising Sand character, ready to frame! We'll ask backers for their preference when surveys go out. If left unspecified, Jenn will draw whoever\u2014perhaps even characters who have yet to appear! This tier includes: We've funded! Thank you! As such, the stretch goals are UNLEASHED!  Holofoil has been unlocked, and all books will now be approximately 44% shinier than they would have otherwise been! Thank you! Also unlocked are broken sun logo patches, which will be included with ALL physical tiers\u2014even the book-only and early bird tiers! There's still time to reserve a copy of RS Volume One! Let's bring this home! If you've read this far, thank you! We hope you'll consider pledging to help make Rising Sand Volume One happen. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out via Kickstarter or Twitter. Risks and Challenges is also below. We'd also like to thank our fellow collaborators on this campaign, Sophie Campbell, Guillaume Bonnet, Melissa Pagluica, and Lukus Benoit, as well as the incomparable Iron Spike for her valuable advice regarding Kickstarter husbandry. We couldn't have done it without you! Don't forget the skull!",
  "Hi there, my name is Chloe, and I\u2019m an illustrator working in Leeds, UK. When I was 18, I met a man with a spinal injury. It didn\u2019t take long to fall in love with him, but I had no idea what to do about it. Eventually we got together, and we\u2019ve been married 17 years, but it was a lot of trial and error. The project When I was a teenager, I tried writing fiction with a disabled character, and then as I got older, I kept trying to write with disabled characters. I\u2019ve also been drawing for many years, including trying to represent people with mental health problems and physical disabilities. Only now at 43 have I brought all this together to draw something loosely based on my experiences. The eureka moment came when I stopped trying to write it about a man and a woman, but I gave myself distance by making my character a bisexual man. Why a webcomic? I wish to create something which could help teenagers of many backgrounds and situations; gay teenagers, disabled teenagers, newly injured spinal patients, able bodied people hoping to gain better understanding, and hopefully one day a teenager wondering how to approach a relationship with another teenager who happens to be disabled. Webcomics as a medium are easy to read, access, and importantly can be found for free online. I publish monthly on Tapas a month after my patrons have seen chapters. Why \u2018Incomplete\u2019? The comic\u2019s name refers to a few different aspects of the story; firstly, and most obviously, Pip and Matt complete each other in their relationship. Secondly, the story will never be \u2018complete\u2019 because I will write it as long as I can and continue to base it on our life. Thirdly, and the reason I chose the word, is that an incomplete injury is a type of spinal injury where the spinal column is not completely severed, and some feeling remains below the level of injury. What is available in rewards? I am offering a range of items with \u2018Pip\u2019s Prints\u2019 on them, as well as special tiers where you will appear in the comic! Even if you can only pledge \u00a31, I appreciate the support, and every single pledge will get a postcard sent to you, and a thank you in the finished book once it\u2019s published. What are \u2018Pip\u2019s Prints\u2019? Pip, the main character through which the story is mainly told, wears patterned shirts a lot, so I had to start drawing the patterns for them. I decided these patterns would be perfect to create merchandise to help fund \u00a0my work and give a bit of joy to readers and non-readers alike, as well as hopefully encouraging new readers.",

  "George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, the thousands of other Black deaths at the hands of militarized police forces. Protestors choked by tear gas and brutalized by state repression. Hundreds of thousands dead and many more struggling to breathe as capital drives the country back to work to face a deadly virus. Millions beset by extreme weather as the climate crisis mounts. A flood of misinformation and conspiracy that has drowned truths in false consciousness.\u00a0 The previous year saw multiple systemic crises erupt into conflagrations, some literally. As we reeled from the tragedies of 2020, the defeat of Donald Trump came as a welcome development\u2014but the presidency of Joe Biden still portends the continuation of an unacceptable status quo.\u00a0 In our third print edition, we turn our attention to how, in the wake of all this, we may mourn our losses, build resilience, and breathe life into our communities and our movements. There isn\u2019t a choice; the left must do so in order to face the difficulties that lie ahead. How can we make space for ourselves and our loved ones to breathe? How can mutual aid and actions of solidarity help relieve the economic and social pressures imposed upon us? Though our breath may be ragged these days, we have not lost hope. We still may find some breathing room.\u00a0 This issue features a slate of extraordinarily talented writers and artists. As our campaign unfolds, we'll announce the subjects of their writing and unveil some preview selections. For now, here are our Issue 3 contributors: CRITICISM & ESSAYS POETRY FICTION ART/ILLUSTRATION Protean launched in 2018 with a small volunteer staff and a modest Kickstarter goal of $500. Since then, we\u2019ve published a steady stream of original content on our website and have released two well-received print magazines. Each issue is crafted with the utmost care and features stunning art and illustrations alongside essays, fiction, and poetry. We also launched a companion podcast, Protean Pirate Radio, hosted by Mel Buer, which hosts conversations with Protean contributors about their work, interviews with special guests, and roundtable discussions on a broad range of topics. And we\u2019ve been able to do all of this while remaining entirely reader-funded, maintaining our commitment to ad-free publication and fair compensation for our writers and artists. From the start, we decided to take things slowly and intentionally, choosing to give more than we ask. But now, with an established platform and an experienced editorial team, we are ready to grow. Our goals for this fundraising campaign are more ambitious than in the past. We have prioritized paying fair rates to leftist writers and artists while keeping our operational expenses at a bare minimum. This has meant that our editorial board has worked for two years in an entirely voluntary capacity. Now that we've become more established, we hope to reach our stretch goals, which would support an increased publishing tempo and provide our editors and designers with small stipends to allow us to dedicate more time to our work and help ensure the long-term sustainability of the organization. This means that our fundraising ambitions are higher than ever. If we were to meet our stretch goals of $20,000 or $50,000, we would be able to take major steps toward realizing our potential as a thriving leftist literary collective.\u00a0At minimum, we hope you'll put in an order for our print issue.\u00a0 Thanks to all of our readers, contributors, and Patreon subscribers for making our work possible.\u00a0 PROTEAN COLLECTIVE",
  "Patent Pending Noise-isolating earbuds are far from novel, but the Plugfones Liberate flips a common equation on its proverbial ear: we\u2019ve engineered a product that\u2019s earplug first, earbud second. Building on what we\u2019ve learned for the past 6 years\u00a0producing WIRED Plugfones, we\u2019ve SEVERED the cable with Plugfones Liberate.  These Bluetooth 4.0 earplugs offer the same top-notch aural quality as our wired Plugfones, but without the hassle of a 3.5mm connector. Each Liberate headset has a Bluetooth 4.0 antenna, a fully sweatproof design, a noise-reducing inline microphone for voice calls, ruggedized play/pause, volume up, and volume down buttons, song progression buttons, and a water resistant USB charging connector. You can expect the battery to last 8 hours on a full charge, enabling you to easily get through extended shifts without having to source power.  \u00a0Specifications Yellow Model for music only. Black Model for music and calls. Plugfones were initially dreamed up after Shaun, our co-founder, found himself too preoccupied with his own thoughts while working tirelessly in a glass factory. After searching in futility for a set of earplugs that would also play music, he began scraping together funds to assemble prototypes in his garage. By testing them himself and on colleagues, he made the requisite changes to produce a product that perfectly straddled the line between earplug and earphone.  We\u2019ve been doing this for nearly six years, and count the likes of Goodyear, La-Z-Boy Manufacturing, and Tyson Foods as customers. Conventional earbuds, even those designed to cancel noise and costing hundreds of dollars, aren\u2019t comfortable for all-day use. Plugfones were engineered as earplugs first, which means that your ears won\u2019t fatigue after wearing these on a 12 hour shift or while shooting your AR-15. Even if you aren\u2019t working in the field or in a factory, having a set of earplugs makes everyday scenarios far more tolerable: riding the subway, sleeping alongside a snoring partner, maintaining focus in the gym, mowing the lawn, or keeping outside distractions at bay while gaming. Or, for the crazy ones, skydiving! The issue, of course, is that typical earplugs are boring. Really boring. Plugfones Liberate enables you to enjoy the spoils of an earplug without going insane. While your ears are being protected, you\u2019ll be treated to top-notch aural excitement. Beyond streaming music, you\u2019ll also be able to take incoming calls without having to expose your ears to unsafe levels of loudness even for a moment.  The Liberate, just like our existing wired Plugfones, have been tested by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL). A third-party firm, Michael & Associates, Inc., was employed to rigorously test our products according to U.S., E.U., and Australian standards. Our new Liberate headset received an ANSI certified NRR (Noise Reduction Rating) of 26. As you\u2019d expect, we\u2019re big advocates of protecting your hearing. It\u2019s an element of our lives that we often take for granted, and it\u2019s difficult to recognize small but meaningful diminishment to how acutely we\u2019re able to hear.\u00a0 If you commute daily on a subway, are exposed to loud machinery, or routinely find yourself in noisy environments, it\u2019s not enough to simply drown out the external world with loud music. Liberate works to reduce your ear\u2019s exposure to loudness, enabling you to enjoy music at lower volumes while protecting one of the most important senses you have: the ability to hear. \"I was able to head out onto the busy CES show floor and hear nothing except for the sweet sounds of U2.\" - Reviewed \u201cI could have used a pair of these when I lived in the Lower East Side of Manhattan and drunken NYU students were screaming at each other at 3 in the morning.\u201d -David Goldman,\u00a0CNN Money Because Liberate is designed to be worn for extended periods of time, we\u2019ve designed the earplug tips to be user-replaceable. We recommend silicon tips be swapped out every four weeks, and foam tips every one to two weeks. We toss in four total sets of tips (two silicon and two foam sets) with each Liberate. Replacement sets in quantities of ten are available on our website for $7.99. Seating a Plugfone in one\u2019s ear canal is fundamentally different than seating a conventional earbud. If you\u2019re an avid earbud wearer, remember to seat the Plugfone Liberate more deeply than you normally would -- it\u2019s an earplug, after all!\u00a0 We generally recommend to seat the Liberate without music already playing. Once you seal out external noise, then turn on your music. If you can hear the low-end resonate, you\u2019ve successfully seated your Liberate!  Designing a product like the Liberate requires months of planning, tooling, re-tooling, and if we're honest, another round of re-tooling. We're big fans of exploring prototypes and getting behind the scenes tours of our favorite gadgets, so we wanted to share a few initial drafts, drawings, and renditions that we generated en route to a finalized product. -The Plugfones Team Share with Your Friends! www.facebook.com/Plugfones www.twitter.com/Plugfones www.instagram.com/Plugfones We\u2019re eager to get Plugfones Liberate into as many ears as possible, but shipping outside of the United States and Canada may bring additional duties, taxes, or fees to the user. Backers ordering for shipment outside of these countries will be responsible for paying those fees. In the event that we cannot ship to a certain country, your pledge will be fully refunded.",

  "Scraggs O'Possum and The Penultimate Hitch is a journey - 7 years and 35,000km in the making.\u00a0 It all started in the Summer of 2016, with a decision by then, 23-year old Anna Persson, to hitchhike halfway across Canada in the name of adventure. What followed was a revelation and a declaration - hitchhiking had to be the best way to travel!\u00a0 The accumulation of stories, adventures, mishaps, and encounters, alongside a passion for performance, theatre, and the arts is what led to the script for Scraggs O'Possum and The Penultimate Hitch being born in the Winter of 2021.\u00a0 Fast forward six months, and the production is well off the ground and preparing for our debut at the New Zealand Fringe Festival with performances at BATS Theatre on February 27th, March 1st, and March 2nd.\u00a0 Scraggs O'Possum and The Penultimate Hitch features a selection of Anna's true-to-life hitchhiking experiences - expertly brought to the stage by a cast and crew of some of Wellington's finest creatives.\u00a0 The cast stars -\u00a0 Liz Butler\u00a0 Jonathan Mandeno\u00a0 Aaron Douglas Nick Zajac Sara Douglas\u00a0 Chris Hobbs\u00a0 Anna Persson\u00a0 With -\u00a0 Direction/Set/Design by Sebastian Blair\u00a0 Sound by Calum Turner\u00a0 Stage Management by Abbie Hill\u00a0 Being an international cast and crew, we want to provide the opportunity to our non-NZ-based friends and family to be able to support, share in the excitement of this production, and watch the damn thing!\u00a0 The arts, and especially theatre is not cheap to produce and we're grateful to have received a small amount of funding from Creative New Zealand, alongside funds raised from a fundraiser party, which are helping to cover some of the costs of our set, props, and marketing. One thing hitchhiking taught me is the importance of being vulnerable and asking for help. In trusting and being trusted. In stepping into the discomfort of asking for help and doing so with gratitude and humility. Bringing this production to the Fringe has meant much of the same. This is me, standing on the edge of the highway of the internet, once again, asking for help.\u00a0 Through this Kickstarter, we would love to support the creatives who have dedicated hours to bringing this performance off the ground.\u00a0 $500 is our modest target, $2000 is our dream - but, like with hitchhiking, every little bit helps.\u00a0",

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle began his career as a writer while practicing medicine in Birmingham and Fu Manchu's creator, Sax Rohmer, was born there, too. Washington Irving penned his classic horror tale, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" whilst living in Birmingham, \u00a0and Charles Dickens performed often at the second city's Town Hall, giving the very first public reading of \"A Christmas Carol\" there in 1853.The famous humourist Jerome K. Jerome, author of \"Three Men in a Boat\" was born in nearby Walsall. Both he and Dickens were marvellous exponents of the macabre tale when the mood took them, and the spirits of all these nineteenth-century greats haunt our stage-work. Artistic Director Jonathan Goodwin\u00a0has been fascinated with the Victorian and Edwardian eras since childhood, and especially the works of Conan Doyle, Stoker, Stevenson, M R James and their ilk. Indeed, the first novel he can recall reading is The Hound of the Baskervilles, when he was six or so.\u00a0Jonathan was an avid viewer of the black and white Sherlock Holmes films, the Bela Lugosi and the Boris Karloff films, and the early Hammer Horrors back in the days when they were still screened on TV. Little could he have known that all of that would one day lead to his following in their footsteps on stage! Indeed, he even corresponded several times with Peter Cushing\u00a0on the topic of acting, when\u00a0Goodwin was still a teenager. Of course, Peter Cushing was one of the first actors a young Goodwin watched playing Sherlock Holmes, in fact, along with Basil Rathbone. They remain his favourites to this day, along with Jeremy Brett, naturally. Jonathan is an omnivorous reader and a bit of a bookworm. On his bookshelves are innumerable titles on Victorian and Edwardian crime, plus works by all the late nineteenth century's greats of popular fiction. But he always allows his imagination free rein when writing scripts, and thinks a degree of artistic licence is allowed when crafting a piece of entertainment \u2013 however macabre the subject matter! \u00a0Jonathan recently won The Hamilton Deane Award from The Dracula Society for his online \"live\" theatre performances, Sunday Down The Cellar! \u00a0https://www.thedraculasociety.org.uk/the-hamilton-deane... (former winners include Mark Gatiss and Benedict Cumberbatch) We've added some Sherlock Holmes and Dracula books in the Ultimate Dracula PDF reward. Sherlock Holmes and the Plague of Dracula After Mina Murray asks Sherlock Holmes to locate her fiancee, Holmes and Watson travel to a land far eerier than the moors they had known when pursuing the Hound of the Baskervilles. The confrontation with Count Dracula threatens Holmes' health, his sanity, and his life. Will Holmes survive his battle with Count Dracula? \"I really liked Stephen Seitz's writing style.\u00a0Watson's voice as a biographer was convincing, in keeping with the style of the canon\" Sherlockianer Sherlock Holmes and The Affair In Transylvania Sherlock Holmes and The Affair In Transylvania is a complete re-telling of Bram Stoker's Dracula, incident by bloody incident. \u00a0 When Dr Watson tells Holmes the distressing news that his niece's husband is missing on a visit to Count Dracula, the great detective decides that he and Watson should journey to Transylvania.",

  "This publication captures the initial humorous moment where a creator will save a supposedly completed design with the iconic file name 'Final.pdf' Unfortunately this creator receives feedback from their client, informing them that the wrong branding colours have been used. Consequently after correction, the file name grows to become 'Final_Final.pdf' After working late that night fixing the design, the creator notices a seemingly obvious spelling error just before submitting the revised version to the client. And yet again, while\u00a0rolling their eyes, another 'Final' is added to create 'Final_Final_Final.pdf' Waking up exhausted from little sleep the next morning, the creator opens an email from their client explaining that the image resolution isn't adequate. Frustrated, the creator swears at their cat and subsequently exports the file again, but this time with the name 'Final_Final_Final_F*cking_Final.pdf'\u00a0 We understand that every designer approaches a process of design uniquely, this book documents our interpretations and highlights the various ways designers design.\u00a0 Our team consists of 16 students who all met whilst commencing our studies for the course Diploma of Graphic Design at RMIT, Melbourne.\u00a0 Each one of us has unique skills and interests that we bring to the table. We are eager to challenge ourselves, learn new skills and evolve as graphic designs, pushing each other to be ready for the design world.\u00a0 Collaborating throughout the entire project, we will be discussing and producing our ideas. We encourage you to be open minded and take a look at our work. Your support will help and encourage us to produce the best publication we can!

  "We love making magazines but hate having to rely on advertising. We love giving writers freedom but hate wasting money on distribution. We love working with photographers and illustrators and want to have control over who we commission. We love the smell of paper and seeing it all come together but hate having to publish something when it\u2019s not totally ready. We love the collaboration, the sense of the new, and the unfound, unseen and unpublished. We are Dan Crowe (award-winning magazine publisher and book editor based in London; previous literary editor of AnOther Magazine and founding editor of Butterfly, Zembla, Port and Avaunt magazines), and Matt Willey (award-winning graphic designer, Pentagram partner, and former art director of The New York Times Magazine). Having worked extensively in publishing we have seen how magazines have become editorially constricted over the past 25 years. We\u2019ve seen advertising commitments and excessive distribution costs become the norm, and sales dwindle \u2014 not because the audience has disappeared, but because authentic publications have. It got us thinking: what if we removed these problems? What would it take to have complete creative control of a magazine? What would it look like, who would write for it, where would you buy it? This is the magazine we have always wanted to make: large format (280mm x 350mm), with extraordinary writers and artists; unusual, opinionated and inspiring editorial, all wrapped up in stunning design. Delivered straight to you from the people who made it.\u00a0 The acclaimed American author Jonathan Lethem (The Fortress of Solitude; Motherless Brooklyn; Dissident Gardens) will write a new novel over the course of the ten issues of INQUE, one chapter per issue. This will be the first time a major writer has done this (the idea in itself is not new, but when, for example, Charles Dickens published in serial format, it was over a matter of months, not years). This work, from one of America\u2019s most exciting and innovative writers, will only be available to read in INQUE, and illustrates the nature of this venture: a ten-year creative document, a hybrid magazine set to the rhythm of its time, showcasing new talent and commenting on what will be an extraordinary decade. We will also be translating international writers into English, and commissioning long-form fiction from new writers\u2014something that is rarely seen these days. In addition, the preeminent author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie will be selecting new African writers for each issue, and we have an editorial board with some of the world\u2019s most exciting and respected writers, publishers and editors helping to create each issue.\u00a0Lastly, we will be working with outstanding artists and photographers to create exclusive limited-edition authenticated art prints. Placing a limit on the issues will allow it to become a contained project, with a beginning, middle and end.\u00a0We love the idea of INQUE being a finite set\u2014magazines tend to go on and on\u2014housing creative projects across the whole series which will, in 2030, conclude and create a whole. There won\u2019t be a digital version because we feel the Internet is oversaturated. Being print only will ensure a slower experience, allowing the reader to take time to savour the high production values and unique content. In 2003 we launched Zembla, a literary magazine with the tagline \u201cFun With Words\u201d. It fused incredible writing with great design and featured, amongst other things, living authors interviewing dead writers, and inspiring new fiction. It was exciting to make. It lasted for nine issues. A large part of the title\u2019s revenue stream was advertising. After that, in 2011, we launched Port, a magazine which combines all the things we love about print titles: quality writing, photography and editorial design with wide-ranging interests in architecture, science, literature, food and fashion. It was, and still is, a homage to the great magazines of the 20th century. Port is largely supported by advertising. We still make Port together. We took a detour in 2015 and launched an adventure magazine, Avaunt, which was about exploration, in the broadest possible sense: we explored language, science, the mind, social sciences and, yes, some of the kit used to climb tall things. We worked on this magazine together for five issues. INQUE is the logical next step, not just for our personal collaborative relationship, but, we feel, for magazines as a whole. It's time to take back some control. It's time for change... We have already confirmed a great list of contributors, and are expecting more to join: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Christopher Anderson (Photographer) / Nicholson Baker (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Barbara Bloom (Artist) \u00a0/ Paul Davis (Graphic Artist) \u00a0/ \u00a0Jack Davison (Photographer) \u00a0/ \u00a0Naoise Dolan (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Brian Eno (Musician and Artist) \u00a0/ \u00a0Jason Fulford (Bookmaker and Photographer) \u00a0/ \u00a0Werner Herzog (Film Director, Screenwriter, Author and Actor) \u00a0\u00a0/ \u00a0Daisy Johnson (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Hanif Kureishi (Playwright and Author) / \u00a0Catherine Lacey (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0David Lammy (Politician) \u00a0/ \u00a0Ben Lerner (Author and Poet) \u00a0/ \u00a0Jonathan Lethem (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0David Lynch (Director and Artist) \u00a0/ Robert Macfarlane (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Sophie Mackintosh (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Ben Marcus (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Peter Mendelsund (Designer and Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Rebecca Miller (Author and Director) \u00a0/ \u00a0Samantha Morton (Actress) \u00a0/ \u00a0Cillian Murphy (Actor) \u00a0/ \u00a0Joyce Carol Oates (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Ben Okri (Poet and Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Max Porter (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Bridget Riley (Artist) \u00a0/ \u00a0Marcus du Sautoy (Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University) \u00a0/ \u00a0Paula Scher (Graphic Designer and Painter) \u00a0/ \u00a0Will Self (Author) \u00a0/ \u00a0Tamara Shopsin (Author and Designer) \u00a0/ \u00a0Alec Soth (Photographer) \u00a0/ \u00a0Tilda Swinton (Filmmaker and Writer) \u00a0/ \u00a0Kae Tempest (Poet and Playwright) \u00a0/ \u00a0Ocean Vuong (Author) / Tom Waits (Musician)\u00a0 INQUE has established a visionary editorial board to help advise on each issue. Ranging from highly regarded literary publishers to Pulitzer-winning cultural commentators, poets and editors, the board will reflect a multiplicity of opinions and cultural perspectives. More info/bios here We have created\u2014in partnership with iconic British brand Sunspel\u2014a limited-edition long-staple cotton T-shirt with a two-colour screen print. Text by author Max Porter and design by Matt Willey. We\u2019re launching INQUE\u2019s premier issue on Kickstarter because of the collaborative element and sense of community. Magazines are nothing if not communities. Having a group of like-minded people coming together to create the premier issue is, for us, very important and what makes a magazine launch the exciting event it is. Having a single investor is more complicated to find and difficult to work with. Investing in the first issue as part of the Kickstarter campaign, rather than after we launch, means we can make sure we can pay the contributors and the printers up front. Following the initial campaign, each of the following nine issues will be released annually and become self-sustaining. INQUE will then be available as a direct-to-your-door subscription via our website, as well as from select magazine and gallery stores in Los Angeles, New York, London, Berlin, Milan, Paris, Hong Kong and Sydney.

  "Apex Magazine is seeking funding to relaunch the zine and resume the publication of award-winning, entertaining, diverse short fiction. Apex Magazine is an online zine of fantastical fiction. For ten years we published works filled with marrow and passion, stories that are twisted, strange, and beautiful. Creations where secret places and dreams are put on display. After taking a year hiatus, we're ready to bring more such stories into the world. We will publish in two forms: an every-other-month eBook edition and a free serialization of the issue's content over a two month period on our website. Additionally, we will continue to produce a monthly podcast of narrated original short fiction. In May, 2019 the magazine went on a hiatus due to our editor-in-chief's health misadventures (that he wrote about here on the Apex Book Company blog). A year later, he's back to his old self (plus one titanium jaw) and is ready to restart the Apex engine! However, before we relaunch, the zine will need an injection of financial support. Enter this Kickstarter campaign! The baseline goal of the Kickstarter will be to raise enough money to fund the first two issues. Our dream would be that we end up funding the whole 2021 publication year via stretch goals. After this Kickstarter campaign, we hope to return to our self-sustaining business model. We do have some planned changes/improvements for the relaunch. But one thing will remain the same--the quality of our groundbreaking genre fiction. The last few years of Apex Magazine, prior to our hiatus, we produced an incredible run of transformative and diverse fiction. We published both the 2018 and 2019 Hugo Award winners in the category of Best Short Fiction (\u201cWelcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience\u2122\u201d by Rebecca Roanhorse and \u201cA Witch\u2019s Guide to Escape: A Practical Compendium of Portal Fantasies\u201d by Alix E. Harrow, respectively) and the 2017 Hugo Award winner in the category of Best Novelette (\u201cThe Tomato Thief\u201d by Ursula Vernon). Fiction from Apex Magazine has also won the Nebula Award, Locus Award, and numerous others. In addition to our phenomenal fiction, every issue of Apex Magazine offered evocative cover art, thought-provoking nonfiction, author and artist interviews, and a professional-quality podcast produced by KT Bryski. All these wonderful things would not have existed if it wasn\u2019t for the community of readers, creators, and staff\u2014the extended Apex family. Thank you so much for your love and continued support! Despite being self-sustaining for the three straight years before its hiatus, we need your help to make this relaunch a reality until our usual funding streams of subscriptions, advertising, and donations come back online.\u00a0 tl;dr: We\u2019re halving the yearly issue count but doubling the content included in each issue.\u00a0 Since we last published, the following pay increases are being implemented to begin with the 2021 publication year: The baseline goal of $7,500 raised via this Kickstarter will go towards issues 121 and 122 to cement the relaunch. In addition to our Kickstarter efforts, we plan to use additional revenue streams, such as sprucing up our Patreon offerings, subscription drives, advertising, and donations to make the publication self-sustaining once again. The budget breakdown of the $7,500 budget includes the following items for issues 121 and 122 (in no particular order) and Apex Awesomeness: Shoot the moon goals: For each funding milestone that we reach, we'll distribute free content for you to enjoy: \u00a0$1,500 \u2013 All donors receive an eBook copy of Apex Magazine Issue #1.

INSPIRATION Our story began with inspiration in early summer of last year. \u00a0My brilliant wife, Beth, was putting together a birthday care package for our son at camp. \u00a0Our camp allows only one package a summer so gifts, forgotten clothes, and getting the things all the other kids have has to be put in the one package. \u00a0One of the gifts he received was a sports bauble that allowed us to record a 10 second birthday message. \u00a0It had low quality sound, it was bulky, and it was $10. \u00a0But Beth was so happy to wish Isaac Happy Birthday in her own voice. \u00a0It made her happy and she thought it would make him happy. \u00a0She wished she had bought several of the baubles to send throughout the summer. \u00a0But since it would have to be sent in a package, this would be the only one. SOLUTION So why couldn't the bauble be smaller? \u00a0Thinner? \u00a0Lighter? \u00a0If it could go in an envelope it would be a letter and Beth could send a voice message as often as she wanted. \u00a0That's good. \u00a0And if the kids could send their voices home, that would be great! \u00a0Maybe they'll sing, laugh, include a friend -- heck, maybe they would just write more often! \u00a0So we did our research and made our first prototypes last summer. \u00a0We created the concept, an initial design, and tested their performance. \u00a0Results were good and enthusiasm ran high. \u00a0One-way and two-way mailers made their way through the US post office from home to camp and camp to home. \u00a0Camp letters would never be the same. DEDICATION What have we made since last summer? \u00a0Improvements! \u00a0We found a better recording mechanism and increased reliability by engineering and design. \u00a0We worked with the factory to create high quality sound, increased record time to 20 seconds and beyond, tweaked the original graphics and created a new icon, and we sent dozens and dozens of samples through the US Mail to confirm performance. \u00a0We have come a long way from last summer's prototype but we still hand assemble all the VoiceMailers you are about to receive. \u00a0And we make it easy to use - it's one button, there is no computer required, the packaging is protected against accidental re-recording, and the envelopes are pre-stamped. \u00a0You just record, seal, and mail. What do you get? \u00a0You get to hear your camper's voice this summer. \u00a0You hear about the games, the friends, and the fun. \u00a0And they can hear you. \u00a0Yes, there is still a space to write. \u00a0But don't you want to listen? Kickstarter makes Pledging fun and easy. \u00a0When your friends say, \"I miss their voices\" you can tell them they don't have to miss them. \u00a0They're in the mail. \u00a0Listen as much as you like.",
  "No one expected Terrence and I to be best friends and complement each other so well. When we realized our unique friendship, we were inspired to tell our story and bring it to the big screen (okay, small screen).\u00a0This series will show the trials and tribulations of our friendship and the situations we get ourselves into and of course, the funny moments that get us through. The video we made above is a teaser of what we want the episodes to feel/look like! Short and funny! We want to launch this series on Instagram because it is the most popular social media platform and we want our videos to be seen. The length of the videos on Instagram can only be 1 minute long so we also thought that would be a fun challenge to fit in our story line in just 1 minute episodes. Don't worry, if you don't have an Instagram, it's okay! There will be other ways to view our series and we'll keep all of our backers in the loop. With your help, we can produce and film the first 4 episodes of Ebony and Ivory! Terrence Terrel\u00a0is a Mississippi-born actor and writer who has been featured in videos for pop stars like Beyonce and Lady Gaga, and on television networks like\u00a0Fox,\u00a0NBC, and\u00a0Showtime.\u00a0 Though he\u2019s always been a performer, Terrence didn\u2019t always have the confidence you see on screen, due to bullying throughout his teenage years. The artist learned to cope by turning the negativity into humor, and has used these experiences as the basis for his first children\u2019s book,\u00a0Blacky, an uplifting story about a young Black boy\u2019s journey to self-confidence. In between acting, \u00a0Terrence travels to different schools all over the country every month. He promotes his book to children and teaches them how being different can be your greatest superpower. Jordan Birkland packed her Suzuki Grand Vitara at age 18 and left her small town in Arizona to make it big in LA. She was given unconditional moral support and the rest was up to her. After the first night in LA when discovering that there were people living in the closet of her apartment, she was ready to go back home to Cave Creek. That moral support (especially from her mom) reminded her of the insatiable desire she had to accomplish her dreams and never give up.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Fast forward to today, \u00a0Jordan has been hustling to get any acting part she can by taking class every week, auditioning for TV/Film projects and even performing in an improv troupe called Punching Kittens (no animals were harmed). She has appeared in multiple short films, web series, indie projects, improv shows etc. Most recently you can catch Jordan as \"Elle\" in a new Passionflix Christmas film called The Trouble with Mistletoe. \u00a0We will shoot two episodes in a day every week! It will essentially only take us 2 days to shoot 4 episodes so we will be done in a little over a month including editing. We already have all of the people that we need to make this happen and the episodes are written. We are ready to go! We want our project to be the best quality possible so we will need to fund the following things: -Director -DP/Editing -Sound -Writer",
  "Q&A-Verslag is Dries Verhaegen's first prose journal, made during the quarantaine situation in Belgium. It's his second book publishing, after a poem book in 2019 titled 'Koelte/Hersenpan'.\u00a0 It has to be considered as prose, never the less, it's also experimental on that field: prose and poems meet. It describes places, where 1 main character, finds its way, through rooms with corpses, voices, codes and memories. Described in 8 chapters, he tries to understand these forms and patterns he finds, in order to understand where this place will lead him. Most of these things he finds on his way, can be seen as 'inbetween-spaces', that in the text, can get a fysical form. The epilogue is written by Casper Burghgraeve & Benjamin De Roover and gives a good description/review. Dutch: Quote from the epilogue by Casper Burghgraeve & Benjamin De Roover. \"In Q&A-verslag, na Koelte/Hersenpan (2019) de tweede bundel van Dries, doet een anti-vitalistisch lyrisch subject verslag van een denken en een ervaren. In acht delen (onder)zoekende proe\u0308zie worden ruimtes geschapen, geabstraheerd en weer vernietigd. Het lyrisch ik probeert een cartograaf van onze manier van leven te zijn, de tekst een psychogeografie van iemand die zich verplicht niet langer kan verplaatsen.\" IMPORTANT NOTE: Design: Otis Verhoeve Epilogue: Casper Burghgraeve & Benjamin De Roover.

  "We're THRILLED to introduce this beautiful, 124-page full-color book to you, featuring the art and writing of more than 85 women writers and artists from the Jacksonville community, with a stunning cover by artist Lana Shuttleworth. Today we are asking for your support to help us publish this gorgeous collection of women\u2019s voices. Women's voices matter. We know and honor that at Women Writing for (a) Change Jacksonville. \u00a0We exist for one purpose: to help women live more conscious lives through the art of writing and the practices of community. \u00a0We lift the expression of the feminine in all its forms: words, art, music, and use them to help create more conscious, connected communities. \u00a0Our goal is to provide safe spaces for women to come together and share the truth about their lives. \u00a0The somber fact is that, even today, women's voices are silenced, their roles stereotyped, their truths denied. \u00a0Truth: Historians estimate that out of all documented history, only 0.5 percent represents women\u2019s voices. \u00a0Women in all forms of media are greatly underrepresented. And in today\u2019s art world, groups like the Guerilla Girls have pointed out that representation in our national museums is at a shockingly low level: less than 10 percent in many of them. This is beginning to change: entire museums are closing down to rectify this situation, and reopening with a new, broader perspective.\u00a0 We are a part of that growing movement, starting in our own backyard. With the publication of (a) river rising, we are a tributary in a river of powerful feminine voices rising and creating waves of change around the world. \u00a0This publication of women\u2019s stories, words, and art is part of the solution, a missing component of what the world needs. It\u2019s a beautiful gift of truth-telling that we hope will inspire others to share their truth and help rewrite the story of the world. \u00a0By supporting us, you are taking action to support this movement. These stories\u2014of love and pain, loss and joy, regret and longing\u2014are universal to people everywhere, and capture our very human experience. \u00a0Everyone, of all ages, genders, life experiences, can benefit from reading these stories and relating them to their own lives. \u00a0We hope they will!\u00a0 We've already gone to print! (We had a deadline!) After six months of intense editing and design work (plus five years of writing in this community!) the book is at the printer\u2014and the bill will be due shortly! We had a deadline: an invitation to launch the book at the Jax By Jax Literary Arts Festival on Nov. 16 \u00a0in downtown Jacksonville. It\u2019s been all hands on deck to get it printed so we could deliver in time, but now we\u2019ve got a finished product and the world at our fingertips. We hope that with the public\u2019s support, this project will be sustainable not only today but annually. (Next edition planned: BIRDS and BLOOMS!) We are so proud of what we have created! Beginning with the cover art by Lana Shuttleworth, this beautiful velvet-touch soft-cover book is filled with the art and words of 57 writers and 29 artists. To give you an idea, here\u2019s the cover: Beyond the cover, this book includes words that will touch your heart. We want to share these words with the world, and we hope you\u2019ll help make that possible! Maybe you're wondering, how did all this happen? How did we get to NOW? Here's a five-year countdown, with words and art from the Anthology interspersed. January 2014: Our first writing circle as a newly licensed affiliate of Women Writing for (a) Change. \u00a0We started with seven women around a dining room table and grew to hundreds of women (and a few others) over the next five years.\u00a0\u00a0 September 2014: Our first writing circles with incarcerated women in Jacksonville. Since then, we've served hundreds of justice-involved women in Jacksonville and produced several (private) anthologies for them, which they find powerful. \u00a0It amazing them to see their words in print\u2014and inspires them. June 2015: We moved to our new location in historic Riverside and began holding \u00a0community events, featuring women's art, and investing in local community issues, using words and writing to bring our mission to life in our community, like writing circles with the UNF Women's Center, the Women's Center of Jacksonville, Mayo Clinic, Rethreaded, Generation W, the Jacksonville Public Library, the Historic Preservation Society, the Dolores Barr Weaver Policy Institute for Girls, and many, many more. Fall 2016: We began our formal women's art program with the Art of Memoir Exhibition, followed by Truthtellers in the spring.\u00a0\u00a0 Fall 2018: We formed a 501(c)(3) non-profit to better support our outreach programs and began producing art-inspired journals to support our programs. We wanted to ensure that our programs would be widely accessible to a more diverse audience. \u00a0We affirmed our mission to serve women primarily, but not exclusively, and not just cis-gendered women. We launched our Fall art show, RISE, followed by SHINE in the spring. Spring 2019: We held our first editorial team writing circle with a diverse group of women of various ages, life experiences, and ethnic backgrounds, striving for a more inclusive approach to our selection process. Given the traditional barriers to publishing for many women, we decided upon the radically inclusive idea that any writer or artist who had participated in our programs could submit up to three pieces for consideration, and that at least one would be chosen, based on its application to the theme.\u00a0\u00a0 Summer 2019: We began an intense selection and editing process, using our writing practices to guide our meetings and keeping our writers in charge of their own voices as we edited. Fall 2019: Starting in September, we began the enormous task of creating a start-up publication from scratch, selecting the cover art and using an inclusive, interactive feedback process to gather input from the team on font and style choices. Nov. 11, 2019: Final approval of the print master for production at our local printers. General collapse. Cheers. Standing ovations. Much-needed sleep. \u00a0And then...the Kickstarter launch! \u00a0How will we pay for this damn thing? We crossed our fingers and turned toward the community.\u00a0 We think you'll like our rewards because they fit with our theme of sharing these words with others in the community and, in effect, helping to create more community.\u00a0\u00a0We focused more on experiences \u00a0than \"stuff\" and considered the needs of others who might need to hear these voices. Donor gifts include giving a blank writing journal to a woman currently incarcerated or gifting an outreach writing circle to an organization or group of your choice. \u00a0We also cannot wait to treat qualifying donors to a VIP reading event! We are immensely grateful for any and all support levels!",
  "Our project has received the honor of being selected for a BRIClab residency this November, Native American Heritage Month, to develop and present a work-in-progress showing of Morgaine Gooding-Silverwood's newest play, sleeper, featuring movement direction by Raquel Chavez alongside traditional Chickasaw stomp dance. Together, Raquel and Mo will be enlisting a team of queer and BIPOC artists to bring this exhausted tale to life. Our play follows Sleeper, a millennial archetype of an every-person, who from a self-imposed, bedridden exile ponders the imperative of a lived existence. Why wake up? What, or who, do we rise for? Throughout what should be a nap, sleeper debates a shape-shifting cast of characters, both familiar and foreign, as they grapple with trauma, loneliness, identity and self doubt. Will our Sleeper ever escape (or accept) their somnolence? Can they draw back the curtains and let in the light? Ultimately, the key to Sleeper\u2019s liberation hinges on a phone call from their mother and a return to their indigenous roots, where dreams have the power to unlock the relationship between parent and child, descendant and ancestor, body and earth. \u00a0From the moment of birth until our last waking breath \u2014 and beyond \u2014 humanity\u2019s relationship to sleep is eternal. It is a phenomenon full of complex contradictions; familiar and mysterious, active and passive, protracted and ephemeral. There are those who want to \u201chack\u201d sleep and those who\u00a0claim\u00a0to need none at all. Those who embrace, or allow themselves to be embraced by sleep are perceived as indulgent. Others approach their nightly recharge with apathy; some feel outright disdain. And through it all sleep carries on, misunderstood and maligned, the unlimited resource we always want more of, but wish we needed less. sleeper is a play that seeks to engage our entrenched personal, political and historical beliefs around rest. Unfolding from a desire to quiet this discursive static, the play instead amplifies this noise and wraps itself inside it, like a warm blanket. With a generous award of $2500 from BRIC, we plan to be able cover half the cost of development. However, as theatre makers who are deeply invested in fair and equitable pay for artists, especially artists from marginalized backgrounds, we are asking for your help in raising a further $2500 in order to pay our actors and crew what their hard work is worth.

  "My sister Emily and I have always dreamed of being radio DJs. However, since radios are now mostly run by robots (plus also, radios whaaat dat?), we've decided to settle on the next best/awesome thing---PODCASTING. We are taking our love for the movies that made us into the gals we are today and examining them one at a time through in depth discussions using film lingo no one cares about. JUST KIDDING, we will be having hilarious discussions and reliving some of the greatest movies of your childhood and beyond. Just a smattering of movies we will discuss: Jurassic Park, The Neverending Story, Teen Witch, Mother Goose Rock n Rhyme, The Chipmunk Adventure, FEDs, Sneakers, Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Labyrinth.\u00a0 The only problem is---we are poor. Last year our apartment was broken into and the only thing we had of value (my laptop) was stolen. So help us make this Podcast dream a reality and contribute to what will hopefully be your new favorite Podcast! With your contribution you can help us purchase --The cheapest laptop with a CD-ROM they make ---Two Microphones --A Sound Editing program And that's it! We'll pay for the snacks you guys. Once we get our basic equipment, we'll be on our way and will start recording our episodes.",
  "We launched This Week in Drugs in July 2015, thinking it would be a fun way to stay involved with the drug policy reform movement as alumni of Students for Sensible Drug Policy. While we knew there was an audience of drug nerds like ourselves out there, we weren't sure how big it was or if the show would ever take off. One year later, episodes of our podcast have been downloaded\u00a0over 16,000 times. We've released 50 episodes featuring luminaries in the drug policy movement like Neill Franklin and Betty Aldworth, government officials, scientists, and student activists. Our team has grown to four, and we've had dozens of others contribute music, graphics, and other content.\u00a0 Released every Sunday, our weekly episodes now have an average of over 700 listeners, and our most-listened-to episode has 962 downloads (so far!). We're thrilled with the success of the show, and humbled by the warmth and dedication of our fans.\u00a0 Unfortunately, as we get more listeners, some of our costs increase. It takes $861 per year just to keep the lights on, and we'd love to spend some money on advertising to help grow our community. We're grateful for the support of our monthly donors on Patreon, but realize that a small monthly donation isn't for everyone (if it is for you, check out our Patreon page!). If you get value from listening to This Week in Drugs, if you enjoy staying up to date on the most important drug policy news and hearing directly from top drug policy influencers and decision-makers, please help us continue our work by making a contribution.\u00a0 With your help, TWiD Season 3 will be bigger and better than the first two, and we'll be able to grow our audience to reach even more people. Where the money goes:\u00a0We will spend the funds we raise on the following items, in descending order of priority. None of the TWiD team is compensated for their work.\u00a0",
  "I took EVERYTHING I have learned from building thousands of pedals, from circuit design and tone to quality components, assembly methods, as well as the hidden costs in inventory management and distribution, and distilled it all into a new pedalboard friendly format I am calling the \u201cLive Series\u201d. I had three primary goals when designing the Live Series: QUALITY - The Live Series takes VFE Pedals already high standard for quality from our standard lineup and kicks it up a level by using a glass-reinforced substrate in the potentiometers and hand-wired Switchcraft audio jacks. Read more about the component and construction quality of the Live Series in the \u201cComponents & Construction\u201d section below. USABILITY - From the large, solid metal knobs to the simple, clean layout, the Live Series was designed to be as intuitive as possible. The goal is make each pedal easy enough to operate and dial in without the need for a manual (though one is included). Top-mounted jacks were chosen for quick & compact setup on a pedalboard, while the control layout and tapers were designed to make finding the perfect tone as easy as the twelve-bar blues. AFFORDABILITY - By using a direct-only model that is built in limited, unique runs, the Live Series cuts out all extra costs that are not related to product quality or tone. By using this method you, the player, save 25-40% (yes, you read that right) off what the standard distribution and inventory cost model would dictate. 4 pedals will be available in the first run, but an additional pedal will become available at each of the $5K, $10K, and $15K backing levels. New paint colors will also be available at these backing levels. Looking for something different? I plan to develop many new Live Series pedals in 2016, but for the sake of this Kickstarter, I can convert most standard series VFE pedals into the Live Series format. Email me at peter@vfecustom.com to see if there is another pedal in the standard VFE lineup that you'd like to have made in the simpler, more affordable Live Series format. Please note that the shipment date will likely be in March/April for any conversion requests, and DIY requests will likely not include full documentation (just an unpolished schematic & parts list). All conversion requests must be approved by Peter via email. All Live Series pedals are built with the following components, construction methods, and unique features. All Live Series pedals are powered by the industry standard, 2.1mm pin, center-negative power supply (voltage range varies by pedal, but all will work on 9V). NO BATTERY POWER! Backers will get to choose from 6 enclosure colors and 6 knob colors...at first. 3 additional enclosure colors will be available at each of the $5K, $10K, and $15K backing levels. For the first time ever, I am offering both circuit boards and barebone DIY kits to Kickstarter backers. This is a test run to gauge interest in a regular DIY option for Live Series pedals when regular production begins. CIRCUIT BOARD ($15 level) - Your choice of one Live Series circuit board. Includes switching system micro controller (with DualMode switching), and downloadable .pdf document with detailed parts list, schematic and more. BAREBONE DIY KIT ($49 level) -\u00a0Your choice of one Live Series barebone DIY pedal kit. Barebone DIY kits do Include the enclosure (your choice of color), circuit board, Carling footswitch, pots, knobs (your choice of color), jacks, LED (your choice of color), LED bezel, switching system micro controller (with DualMode switching), and downloadable .pdf document with detailed parts list, schematic and more. These pedal kits DO NOT INCLUDE the small, inexpensive circuit components or a graphic print.  BTDR-3H REVERB BRICK ($17 extra) - Add a BTDR-3H reverb brick to your Ravine delay + reverb barebone kit or PCB at the $32 or $66 levels. Technical support is not offered beyond the documents provided for DIY builders. If you have never built a DIY kit before, I recommend purchasing the pedal fully assembled. If you are unable to successfully build the pedal, I won't be able to help!  All DIY kits can be returned for a $25 credit towards a purchase of any VFE product - even if the kit is returned partially or fully assembled. While there are no demo videos out yet for the new Live Series pedals, there are many demos of the standard series pedals that the first set of Live Series pedals is derived from. For this Kickstarter campaign, all pedals available will be derived from a standard series pedal - so you can have a reference point for the tone of each Live Series pedal offered here. MERMAID - Derived from the Merman transparent overdrive STANDOUT - Derived from the Focus mid booster RED WOLF - Derived from the Alpha Dog vintage distortion RISE & FALL - Derived from the Old School vintage tremolo RAVINE - Derived from the Yodeler delay + verb The primary goal of this campaign is expand the Live Series pedal lineup\u00a0 through a crowdfunding campaign. Once we reach the initial $2500 level, I will give more specific information about the stretch goals to expand and improve the Live Series. Here are is a summary of the stretch goals: In the video below, I answer these 5 questions...unscripted...so it's kinda long (15 minutes). Enjoy!",
  "The age of human segregation has been long forgotten. Living in a system that is one in the same, humans have bred into becoming one race. Countries no longer oppose one another, everything being mingled into one unit. Not having warfare to focus on, humans mindlessly feed all of their focus into the media, giving society a false perception of life. Society's view of self-worth is only defined by how a human can serve the entertainment industry. Those that are not considered genetically gifted are labeled as useless & invaluable. Invaluable enough that they are forced to sacrifice their body parts to creatures (who have lost arms and legs due to chemical testing) for they can replace their roles within the entertainment industry.\u00a0 In one of the most important settings in the story, characters must compete in a strategic competition that involves them being in vehicles. The competition does not involve racing, the vehicles just enable the drivers to maneuver on the playing field. Each character has their own signature vehicle. Whenever ONE of the Character Illustration rewards is purchased, the backer will automatically get their own signature car for their character(s). I will retrieve the information from you of how you would want the vehicle to look. \u00a0\"Insidious Bliss\" is in the beginning stages of being turned into an online comic series. It will be a comic drawn in the style of manga...non-colored, heavy detailed shading, and the whole nine yards. The story is already completed on paper, as I can promise its filled with powerful messaging, conflicting characters, and a story that never fails to deliver suspense. However, time and money are one in the same, leaving me to need a few backup artists to help me complete the first volume in a timely manner. Although this comic is extremely important to me, college and working to keep the lights on can take up a lot of time. I'm mainly launching this campaign to hire a back up artist, where the two of us can work on chapters simultaneously, releasing content on a consistent basis. The co-author will receive $15.00 for each page drawn. Any donation would be much appreciated, as I thank anyone who would even consider helping out. \u00a0 \u00a0If this campaign reaches it's goal, you can bet every reward that has been offered will be met to anyone who donated a certain amount. For anyone who donates $25 or above, the characters that you have self created will play a pivotal role within the story. If your character speaks a certain way, or has certain weaknesses you would want me to incorporate in the comic, make sure to send me an email regarding those matters. Last thing I would want is to add a character that is unauthentic to how you envisioned them to be. Outside of the rewards, the comic will be released on the following websites... -SmackJeeves -Web Toons -Duck Web Comics",
  "Hey guys, welcome to the Crow Summer Issue Two Kickstarter!  I'm printing a small run of the second issue of my webcomic, Crow Summer. It's 42 pages long and full color. This is also the ANGSTY issue, so it\u2019s a lot of neighborhood drama. Ahhh, wonderful drama. Crow Summer is a fantasy webcomic set in modern-day rural Missouri, USA. It\u2019s about a student vampire hunter who gets stuck babysitting a werewolf over her summer vacation! The pair of them end up spending all their time together getting into mischief, some of which involves the supernatural (see issue one), and some of which involves even scarier things\u2026 like angry neighborhood children. Some of which yell. \nIn this issue, our student vampire hunter in question, Nina Schneider, decides that in order to have the maximum amount of summer fun, her babysitte\u00e9, Reese Moran, needs a bike. Fortunately, Nina's got a plan to get him one. Unfortunately, this plan is a little bit criminal. \u00a0As always, this comic is always free to read online. I'm currently posting a page a week on Tapas. But since I designed this comic for print, it\u2019s my personal opinion that it\u2019s best read that way!!\n $500\u2014 \u00a0An extra postcard added to all the tiers!! Chloe Cunningham (aka me!) is a comic artist and cardiovascular technology student. When she was twelve someone stole her bicycle. She couldn\u2019t afford a new bike, so for the next two years she had to wear roller skates whenever the rest of her family went cycling. Bike theft is a subject that is close to her heart, and she hopes this comic shows that.\u00a0 Read Crow Summer online on TapasSupport Crow Summer (and Chloe) on PatreonFind Chloe on Twitter Special thanks to Mandy Robertson for her gift of an art tablet and to Ruth Cunningham for sharing her art tablet.

  "Folks, I'm so excited about this new EP that I can barely write a description for this Kickstarter Campaign. Let me say this, as some of you may or may not know on July 1st I went\u00a0to legendary Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals Alabama to record two songs and my life and career path changed overnight. Not only was I working in the very same studio as so many of my influences growing up, but I was using the same equipment and players that created the music that sculpted me into the musician that I am today. I received so much encouragement and validation from the people I worked with down there, that I cannot pass on the idea of furthering the experience! Since returning home I have played those two (nearly completed) songs to some of my most trusted friends and critics, who gave me only glowing reviews\u2026some with a tear or two in their eyes.\u00a0 \u00a0Because of the overwhelming response to this life-changing opportunity that has been gifted to me, I have scheduled three more recording dates there in mid-October and decided to release a 6 song EP called: THE MUSCLE SHOALS SESSIONS in April of 2019. This Kickstarter is being hosted specifically for those who highly requested a physical CD and additional digital copy of the project.\u00a0 \u00a0My project goal is to reach 200 preorders to fund the photography, the CD artwork, the physical product, the digital hosting costs and the domestic shipment of the finished product. Without that number reached, I won\u2019t be able to fund the order of physical CD\u2019s. \u00a0 -MH",
  "If you follow me on Facebook, you know how deep some of my students' writing is. If you don't, read this paragraph that a student wrote in response to the question, What is an American? Malcolm X believed America was a nightmare; Dr. King believed it just needed improvement. They fought against Britain to claim their own country, then they brought down the Natives because they didn\u2019t believe in the future or agree about moving forward. They bought Louisiana from France, Alaska from Russia, and Hawaii from someone else. America has been through two world wars and several conflicts between North and South. African-Americans fight for their rights, as do women, and we\u2019ve had both good and bad presidents. But what is America? America is an expanding place that is always innovating and changing, aims for equal opportunities for people, and is an overall safe place to be. An American, therefore, is not necessarily a person born in America, but a person who enjoys the fruits of America and strives to work hard for both themselves and others. If you loved that, you'll love this: The best student essays from the 9th grade class will be bound beautifully in a small book as the first volume of an annual publication called the Maryvale Prep Review. This publication will give students a chance to $8 covers the cost of printing one book. If I raise $200, our costs will be covered. If I raise more, we'll print and distribute more books.\u00a0 If I raise way more, then the cost per book will go down and we can print free copies for the contributing students and their parents and then put away enough so that Volume 2 can afford color pages.\u00a0 Although the collection is in danger of growing beyond these first ten essays, this is the basic table of contents.",
  "At the Astral Waters Review, we seek to amplify the voices of those who have been marginalized in genre writing. Historically, the realms of science fiction and fantasy have been dominated by a single overwhelming categorization of people. But now is the time for change. \u00a0 In genres that seek to create new worlds, new voices must be heard. Female voices, nonbinary voices, voices of color, and LGBTQ+ voices. The voices of the underrepresented, the discriminated, the marginalized, the oppressed: here they will find a haven to dream, to create, and to inspire in realms of creativity that know no limits. Be bold. Be powerful. Be fantastic.\u00a0 -------------------------------------------------------- WHAT WE'RE PLANNING: - 5-7 creative writing pieces per genre (10-14 total, including short stories, novel excerpts, and poetry)\u00a0 - 3-4 art pieces per genre (6-8 total)\u00a0 - 3-4 book reviews per genre (6-8 total) - 3-4 pages of related advertisements (publishers, author readings, agents, art galleries/shows, book releases, etc.) - Full color, high-quality digital display - Between 80 and 120 pages, depending on the length of our submissions - Available in a variety of downloadable formats, including PDF and e-reader (Kindle, Nook, iPad, etc.) -------------------------------------------------------- WITH YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS, WE WILL: - Compile, edit, design, and distribute quality literature and art produced by new and up-and-coming creative people - Maintain a website and online store - Compensate our editors and designers according to rates set by the EFA - Pay our contributing writers and artists!\u00a0 -------------------------------------------------------- **STRETCH GOALS: - Pay our contributing writers and artists even more! Our goal is to be able to pay all contributors $50 each, but we can't do it without help from our supporters! - Get in print! Printing is extremely expensive; we're looking at about $2,000 for 400 copies of a single issue. We would love to have the beauty of our contributors' work appear in a full-color, hold-it-in-your-hands journal, and we need your help! - Ensure future issues! We can't guarantee that the Astral Waters Review can continue to be published unless we have consistent support from returning customers, which will ensure our ability to pay our contributors (and our bills) every issue.",
  "ALL THE RAGE: Support a showcase of new work by emerging women writers, directors & performers from Manchester - for Manchester The Arts have taken a battering in recent years, none more so than last. We want to inject some much needed life and creativity back into Manchester's cultural scene, giving four emerging women writers the chance to have their work staged.\u00a0 Showcasing the brilliant diversity and imagination of Manchester, for Manchester, we'll bring togetherness, empathy, laughter and a shared experience that will spark joy and hope for a brighter future. With an all female creative team of writers, directors and producers, we'll provide an intern opportunity for an aspiring theatre maker, and multiple roles for women performers.\u00a0 Our mission at Bluestocking is to tell women's stories in all their raw brilliance and truthful glory, since it's when we're able to find truth and expression we're able to find connection, create respect and empathy that ripples across society.\u00a0 Storytelling is vital for social and individual change and collective healing, and Theatre needs money to make it happen; costume, marketing, props and of course - the most important thing - payment for the artists involved. So we're leaving no stone unturned in our bid to financially support those we invite to work with us. We'd be grateful if you could support our mission. Thank you.",

  "Hello new friends! My name is Lisamarie and I created Scatterbrain in 2011, after a life changing cancer diagnosis, that led me to discover my love for sewing as therapy through my chemo treatments. I have a whole line of silly characters named 'octopals', a super snuggly sloth named Sully, and a whole family of bat buddies that double as finger puppets & wristlets! I have a full line of products with my illustrations and an ever growing character base to share with all of you! What's an 'octopal'? An octopal is an octopus pal with stubby legs, wonky eyes, and a squishy body that are the cutest cuddly friends you could ever ask for! We've been hand making them for 10 years now (crazy!) and were growing our collection! That's why we're here to let you all in on our newest additions to the Scatterbrain fam! Why Kickstarter? We have successfully ran one kickstarter already, 2 years ago, to manufacture our very first trio of octopals! Since then, we have found a brand new manufacturing company that has made our toys even BETTER but plush toy manufacturing is quite expensive, and we desperately need to restock our octopals, so Kickstarter is the perfect platform to help us reach our manufacturing goals without going completely bankrupt! And it allows us to share our excitement with all of YOU & to gauge what characters you want to see more of!\u00a0 *Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform folks! If we don't hit our funding goal, we won't be able to move forward with manufacturing. \u00a0Your card will not be charged until the end of the campaign! You can edit or cancel your pledge at any time before the campaign ends!* \u00a0My 1st MANUFACTURED Women Empowerment Toy of the new permanent line, Amelia. \u00a0My first Women Empowerment toy was Rosie, in 2019. \u00a0I made a limited edition run of 200 Rosies ALL handmade. \u00a0She was 9 inches tall, came with a second adult sized bandana, a small coloring book, pins, & a PERSIST pocket mirror. Here's Rosie: However, I overestimated HOW much LOVE she would receive and I quickly realized that I cannot hand make 200+ toys in this line in the future, so AMELIA will be my 1st Manufactured Women Empowerment Line Octopal, and a PERMANENT character! Here is my original blueprint for Amelia & her hat design... \u00a0I wanted to make sure she was PERFECT so I tried to make the blueprint as detailed as possible for the manufacturing company and they nailed it! She features: \u00a0We also have, in our new lineup, these two silly billies.... \u00a0\u00a0*IF WE SURPASS $31,000 NEW CHARACTERS WILL BE RELEASED* To help us reach our goal for manufacturing, we wanted to offer some cool add-ons for you too! We currently sell some of the following items, however, KEYCHAINS, TUMBLERS, & TOWELS are BRAND NEW rewards for our Kickstarter! We may or may not have them for sale after this campaign, so you will be the FIRST to access them and maybe the ONLY ones too! Check out the full line up of add ons below!\u00a0 \u00a0ADD-ON INSTRUCTIONS: To add an add-on to your pledge, follow these steps: 1) Press the 'Manage Your Pledge' Button above. If you have not pledged yet, it will say 'Back this Project'. 2) Increase your pledge in the 'Pledge Amount' box by the total of the add-ons you want to add. 3) After the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned. \u00a0....................Here's what the $18,000 will go to for the first 3 Characters.................... ***Remember, Kickstarter will not charge your card/take any money until/if we reach our initial funding goal by the end date.*** Thank you ALL so much for taking the time to view our kickstarter, and we are thrilled to be ready to start manufacturing these AMAZING new guys!

  " The spirits of emotion that power Widdershins, England's most magical town, have been overtaken by the dark forces of the Seven Deadly Sins. The only ones who can save the place from itself are daring bounty hunter Harriet Barber, her friends, and Jack O'Malley: the town's uncertain, untrained, and utterly unwilling new guardian.\u00a0 They may have everything they need to save the day, but when you're fighting monsters of your own making, your own worst enemy may be yourself... Widdershins is a series of light-hearted Victorian-era adventure stories set in West Yorkshire, England. It's been running as a webcomic for nearly seven years, and\u00a0you can read the whole comic online, for free, starting here!\u00a0Volume seven wraps up a long-running arc, bringing many of the comic's main plots to a satisfying close as the casts from previous volumes finally come together to take on all seven deadly sins at once. This project is to fund Widdershins Volume Seven: Curtain Call, which will be a full-colour, A5 landscape softcover, completing the Deadly Sins arc. This story is much longer than the others, around 234 pages in total, packed with resolutions for stories and characters from previous books. All of the art is already finished, I just need the money to send it to the printer!\n\n If you're new to the series, or just have a few volumes missing from your Widdershins collection, there are several reward tiers that include any of the six previous books. Also, since it's nice to catch up, all tiers from Deluxe Digital upwards will include downloadable high-resolution digital copies of every volume so far! Fancy the keyring, but missed out on the early bird tiers? Just add \u00a35 to your pledge at any tier that includes a physical reward and I'll include a keyring with your order! Can't see a tier that includes everything you'd like? Just message me and we'll arrange it! All of the money raised will go towards printing the book, packaging it up and shipping it out! Any leftover funds will go directly into the comic, such as keeping previous volumes in print, or helping me to bring Widdershins to new conventions.\u00a0 We already met the goal for spot gloss on the cover! Hooray! At \u00a315k, I'll be able to reprint Widdershins Vol 4 and include spot gloss on the cover of that for the first time! This means folks getting the full set will get a full shiny version, which would be pretty neat, and the reprint would just help me immensely in general!\n\nAt \u00a320k I'll add 4 pages of book-exclusive extras to Vol 7- A Tourist's Guide to Widdershins! This would be included in the PDF version. Hello! I'm Kate Ashwin, I live in West Yorkshire, England, with my very understanding husband and two fat cats, and comics are what I do all day every day! I've been making webcomics for around 16 years, which is a silly amount of time to be doing anything, but here I am anyway. You can follow me on Twitter\u00a0for any project updates, notifications of new webcomic pages, and pictures of aforementioned fat cats.  As ever, I'm so grateful to Kickstarter for giving me the chance to make this comic, as this story wouldn't have been possible without the funding received from previous projects. I hope I can continue to amuse folks with offbeat tales of wizards, friends, and finding strength in yourself. Thanks for reading!

Here's where the $5k monies will go towards a potential second volume. We'll be making up part of the difference via residual sales. * Based roughly on if everyone has pledged at the $12+S&H level; it actually comes closer to $3060-someodd, given the variance in sales tax collection by State.** This reflects our future rates of .01 per word.

  "WHAT IS IT? Tinted Window is a journal that publishes compendiums of texts and images that focus on one person, place or object.\u00a0 As writers and editors, Alex and I set out to produce a serial publication that could relish in the details of its subject, in a moment where detail is very often sold short in favour of opinion and newsbites. Thematically, our scope is wide, but Tinted Window\u2019s defining feature is its commitment to exploding its subject; to seeing it from multiple angles. To these ends, we want to go further than most publishers to bring together new responses from leading writers, and to source new translations into the English language.\u00a0 - Oscar Gaynor, Editor No.1: HERV\u00c9 GUIBERT\u00a0 This issue focuses on the life and work of the writer, filmmaker and photographer \nHerv\u00e9 Guibert. In 1991, Guibert died at the age of 36 from AIDS. Perhaps\ncharacterised as a writer\u2019s writer, the issue opens his oeuvre to a general\n audience. In the posthumously published book, The Man in the Red Hat, Guibert\n details the progression of his illness, and this is the focus of a new short story by\nwriter, poet, and frieze editor Andrew Durbin, who takes a journey to Patmos, \nGreece echoing one of the author\u2019s last.\n Artforum contributing editor Bruce Hainley examines Guibert\u2019s film La pudeur ou\nl\u2019impudeur, also released months after his death, which recorded his everyday life\nand eventual deterioration. Regarding his legacy as a photographer, writer\u00a0John Douglas Millar pays attention to the portrait Guibert made of his close friend, the philosopher Michel Foucault. Accompanying the essay are a collection of Guibert sensuous and evocative black and white photographs. In addition to these new responses, for the first time in English we are publishing a\ntranslation by Jeffrey Zuckerman of Guibert\u2019s short story Flash Paper, an \nautofictional story of companionship and intimacy, from his 1988 collection Mauve \nle Vierge. Alongside are new drawings by the artist Louis Fratino, responding to the\nstory.\n Looking at his life from one more remove, we publish a series of\n\u2018reminiscences\u2019 made by Guibert's friends, fellow authors, lovers, publishers and associates,\n collected by author Brigitte Ollier (also for the first time in English). This includes\n illuminating contributions from his wife Christine Guibert, author Marie \nDarrieussecq, photographer Hans-Georg Berger and writer and publisher R\u00e9gine\n Deforge. The Editors provide a brief introduction and timeline to the life and work of Guibert. WHO IS BEHIND TINTED WINDOW? Alex Bennett is a writer whose work has been published by Cura, Map, Novembre, and Pin-Up among others; he is also a columnist for Flash Art International.\u00a0Oscar Gaynor is a writer, editor and runs a public art project in Croydon, commissioning many artists each year to produce bold new work. They both graduated from the Critical Writing Masters programme at the Royal College of Art, where they were co-editors of the book Honey, I'm Home, a collection of essays on property, ownership and access. DESIGN Since beginning to think about making a journal we knew that we wanted to create a curious object, something collectable, but also eminently readable and a delight to carry and hold.\n \nIt has a unique, specially designed plastic wallet, and will be approximately 100 pages and measuring 20cm by 26cm. Tinted Window is designed by London-based design studio Regular Practice. They have created a new font for Tinted Window, based on research with the editors at the Bob Cobbing Family archive.\u00a0 WHY KICKSTARTER?\u00a0 All of the content is in - but only with your kind support can we jump the last hurdle and print the journal. Your pledges will ensure that we can pay our designers, Regular Practice, for their original work, and cover the costs of printing and shipping. As well as this, with Tinted Window, we are hoping to produce a journal we would like to write for ourselves. That is, to produce an opportunity for writers to write about what they are passionate about, at length if necessary, and always to be paid for doing so. As such, with your contributions we will pay our contributors for their unique work.\u00a0 We think that each subject we dedicate an issue to deserves wider recognition and have always kept the enthusiast and the general reader in mind. Your belief in the journal will mean that more underrepresented voices and stories can be heard. Any additional money raised will go towards the commissioning of new, original work for the second issue, estimated to launch Spring 2019.\u00a0No.2 will focus on concrete poetry made by women, and No.3 set its sights on the Chagos Islands. REWARDS Pledge \u00a330 or more and receive a poster featuring Louis Fratino's artwork. A2 Art print on 170gsm G.F. Smith paper, twice-folded.

  "After the year we've all had, the last thing we expected was to get the opportunity to take our work to the Edinburgh Fringe in August 2021. FINDING THE WILL is delighted to have teamed up with Tortive Theatre to do just that! Richard Curnow and I have been touring BARD HEADS since 2010 to small-scale venues from Scotland to Cornwall and with the National Rural Touring Scheme. During the pandemic we were able to Live-stream all six shows from our homes and, in so doing, get nominated for two ONCOMM Awards 2021! But it's not the same as being in the same space as you; hearing your laughter, your intake of breath, your silence, your appreciation. So getting back to performing with a real live audience is going to be incredible, extraordinary and like coming home.\u00a0And boy, are we coming home! Two actors and six monologues - three each -means we will both have approximately 16000 words in our heads. \u00a0We have been touring these shows intermittently for the last decade, but we've never before performed all six on a weekly repertory basis! This will be the biggest challenge in our forty year careers!\u00a0 BARD HEADS takes an updated look at some well-loved characters from six of Shakespeare\u2019s most popular plays and imagines what might have happened next. Each 50 minute one man/woman show is full of laughter, tears and quite a few surprises.\u00a0 Written and performed by Jules Hobbs and Richard Curnow of FINDING THE WILL. \u00a0 \"The magic of the Bard Head tales is that they are written from a different perspective to the Bard\u2019s plays, cleverly focussing on one character relating their own part in each story.\" (Vanloo's Reviews Jan 2021) Friar Lawrence faces criticism over star-crossed lovers\u2019 fiasco.

Sweet Prince?\u00a0\u00a0Confirmed bachelor Osric lampoons Hamlet. Constipated Osric\u00a0has not spoken about Hamlet and the Elsinore massacre for over 45 years, but after a devastating session with his therapist, he is compelled to reveal all\u00a0in a series of exclusive media interviews. What's done cannot be undone - or can it?\u00a0 Meg the witch seeks help. Born in Avebury, Meg the witch is haunted by a night she can never forget.

  "VOOR DE POES Magazine werkt hard aan het eerste VOOR DE POES Kookboek! En daar hebben we JOU bij nodig!\u00a0 De afgelopen tijd heeft ons team in samenwerking met een gecertificeerde dierenarts gewerkt aan het samenstellen van unieke en verantwoorde recepten voor de kat. En het wordt nog mooier; ook hebben we gewerkt aan recepten voor jou als kattenbaas! De recepten bevatten veelal dezelfde ingredi\u00ebnten, waardoor je in \u00e9\u00e9n keer een prinsheerlijke maaltijd voor zowel jouw kat, als jouzelf op tafel tovert. Dankzij dit kookboek heb je vanaf nu altijd een tafelgenoot. Waarom dit kookboek?\u00a0 Niet alleen omdat samen eten nu eenmaal gezelliger is, maar ook omdat we kattenbaasjes kennis willen laten maken met verse, verantwoorde en gezonde alternatieven voor hun kat. Net zoals mensen, hebben katten zo nu en dan behoefte aan variatie. Tevens heeft vers koken voor je kat een aantal grote voordelen, zo gebruik je bij het bereiden van een verse maaltijd minder verpakkingen en krijgt je kat in plaats van (veelal) bewerkt voedsel, vers bereid voedsel voorgeschoteld. Het boek staat daarnaast boordevol wetenschappelijk onderbouwde weetjes en prachtige foto\u2019s, waardoor het boek niet alleen informatief, maar ook visueel gezien, een prachtig plaatje wordt. Wat hebben we nodig om dit kookboek te realiseren? \u00a0Bij het samenstellen van een uniek kookboek als deze, komen (helaas) nu eenmaal de nodige kosten kijken.\nZo roepen we de hulp van een vormgeefster in, maken we gebruik van een fotograaf en komen er reiskosten en administratiekosten aan te pas. Daarnaast zijn er nog de drukkosten voor het boek, de materiaalkosten en de kosten rondom het maken van promotie voor het kookboek. Hier hebben we jouw hulp hard bij nodig!\n \nNatuurlijk staat hier ook iets tegenover. De mensen die een donatie doen ontvangen het kookboek zodra dit gedrukt is bij hen thuis. Tevens ontvangen zij een uitnodiging voor de presentatie. Ook kunnen 5 mensen een fotoshoot met VOOR DE POES fotograaf Mitsuko Fliervoet kopen!\u00a0 Ook hebben we mooie acties bij elk bedrag dat we binnenhalen die later bekend worden!",

  "Subscribe and leave a rating in iTunes. Bandwagon is a new narrative podcast that tells stories about the people who give momentum to growing fan bases.\u00a0Each season will delve into a different type of bandwagon \u2013 a sports team no one thought was worth anything trying to change the hearts and minds of a town. A band on tour trying to make it big.\u00a0 This is a show about being a part of something larger than yourself. Welcome aboard. \n Season 1 will explore a bandwagon that has taken the nation by storm \u2013 The Bernie Sanders campaign. Bernie\u2019s a longtime senator from Vermont. He\u2019s always been known to be a progressive voice. But he\u2019s from a state with the most cows per capita. So nationally he\u2019s had a somewhat limited reach. But after announcing a presidential bid he transformed rapidly from huffy Vermont Senator to the leader of a political revolution. And now he\u2019s overfilling arenas coast-to-coast.\u00a0 \u00a0Bernie might not win the nomination. Or maybe he will. You might agree with his politics. Or maybe you don\u2019t. Disclaimer: I do agree with most of his politics. But this show is not about those things. That\u2019s not the point. The point is that he\u2019s gone from unknown to everywhere. He\u2019s created a bandwagon and struck a major chord with the American people. So I want to know \u2013 who are these people? What are their stories?  It doesn\u2019t matter our age, we all define ourselves by how we choose to associate \u2013 from being a deadhead or a Red Sox fan to being an environmentalist \u2013 these things mean something about who we are as people. Participating in these communities, these bandwagons, satisfies a craving: the need to feel like we\u2019re a part of something \u2013 like we belong.\u00a0I\u2019m fascinated by this phenomenon. And being a radio producer, the next logical step was to make a podcast about it. So...here we are. The season will continue until March 1st, 2016 - that's Super Tuesday, the day on which the most states hold their primary elections. I have no idea where Bernie will stand at this point \u2013 and it doesn't matter. The idea is to follow the trajectory of his campaign through stories about his followers. I will release 1 episode each month.\u00a0 Good question. Here's a breakdown of my budget: Important: Most of these are one-time costs. If funded, Bandwagon will be in great shape to move forward not just with season 1 but with more seasons down the road. Follow Bandwagon on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, the\u00a0website, or on iTunes.",
  "It's time to bring the fifth installment of \"Not A Villain\" to print form! \u00a0Book 5 collects pages 514 to 636 from the webcomic.  \nIf you want to collect the previous books, Books 2, 3, and 4 are available, but Book 1 is out of print. If we can reach the stretch goal of $20,000, then I can reprint Book 1! To help with that goal, I have a bunch of cool stuff to offer: In the meantime, here are some awesome swag to add to your pledge! \u00a0To \"add on\" to a reward is really easy. Just click the reward tier you want, then change the DOLLAR amount (not the reward) and add the needed amount required. That's it! You can keep managing your pledge throughout the campaign, too. Just click \"manage pledge\" and change the dollar amount again. Credit cards are not charged until after the Kickstater ends. And that's when I will send out a survey (via BackerKit) and you'll tell me what extras you added on. \u00a0PLEASE NOTE: Book 1 is out of print and NOT available until we reach $20,000. If you add it on and we don't reach that goal, I'll give you another book of your choice instead. SHIPPING WILL BE CHARGED SEPARATELY. Please don't add it to your pledge right now. Below are my estimates for the maximum I'll charge you (I'm chipping in $5 for each shipment which is why the lowest tier is $0 for Domestic). It is likely your shipping rate will be cheaper, but for now, you can budget for a worst-case scenario. If you want a closer estimate, send me a message with what you intend to order plus your country, and I can give you a better estimate.  \u00a0Note: Digital goods (like the PDFs) cost nothing to ship! \u00a0You can read the entire storyline for free at navcomic.com!",
  "WE MET OUR GOAL!\u00a0 HURRAY! Here are some stretch goals to further improve the book and your rewards as the campaign continues on! ACHIEVED \u2013 THE AUDIOBOOK: a digital recording of the entire book being read aloud will be provided to all backers ACHIEVED \u2013 THE SOUNDTRACK: a soundtrack listing to go with every page in the book will be added as an appendix to the book ACHIEVED \u2013 THE THANK YOU: a handwritten thank you note on an index card will be inserted into every physical book copy obtained through the Kickstarter ACHIEVED \u2013\u00a0THE CHEMISTRY TEXTBOOK: all backers will receive an additional PDF-only book of Bonding Time chemical structure art ACHIEVED \u2013 THE WEATHER GUIDE: all backers will receive a complete guide of cloud names for all days of the year for any Sunday-through-Saturday configuration Hello there! Grab a seat, and let's call class into session for one last time, and I'll tell you what this is all about.\n\u00a0 I'm Dante Shepherd.  For the last ten years, I've been producing Surviving The World, a daily photocomic with a chalkboard and labcoat and lessons touching on just about everything (science, literature, creeping people out, you name it).  The comic is a mix of humor and education combined with complete destruction of the fourth wall.\n\nSTW has been used in classrooms as a teaching material, for a wedding proposal, as a daily mantra, and it's funny, too!\n\n\u00a0 It started in 2008, and now, ten years later, it's coming to an end of June 1st.\u00a0 So to celebrate the end, we're pulling together a \"best of\" book collection, featuring 300 of the best comics from the 3500+ that have been made in the last ten years. WHAT ARE THE REWARDS? Let's put it simply - readers have been asking for a STW book for nearly as long as STW has been running. The entire goal of this Kickstarter is to get them made, printed in beautiful color with all the bonus jokes that have gone right along with it. So for rewards? And I'll personalize and sign the book for you, creating a lesson around a subject of your choosing, if you so wish! Here's what the USB looks like! Here's a break-down of the rewards tiers: ADD-ON ITEMS?\u00a0 Yes!  There are a number of STW items which you can directly choose to include as a reward if you add it on to your backing tier.  These can include additional books as well.\n\nFirst, select the reward tier that you're interested in, with the amount necessary to support the campaign at that tier.  Then, make your donation an additional amount to reflect the add-on item that you wanted.  This will cover the shipping of both items, too.\u00a0 The pricing for the add-on items are as follows:\u00a0\u00a0 If you prefer, you will also be able to add items to your order via BackerKit after the project funds. I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION. CAN YOU SUMMARIZE? The one and only STW book to celebrate the ending of Surviving The World.  You'll love it. Thanks for your support!\u00a0",
  "We're a group of graduate students at the University of Toronto trying to revitalize the English Department's creative writing journal. With our proposed funding, we'll create a new and improved physical journal after taking last year off. We're open to as many different and diverse voices as possible, as well as being committed to guaranteeing fair representation. Every bit of support for our Kickstarter will go directly into Echolocation - first in covering and guaranteeing the print run for the journal, and then further increasing what we can pay our artists, writers, and creators. We want to adequately pay for creative labour, and this project is a first step in that direction. We know how difficult it is to create, and want to thank all the artists who take a chance with our journal.\u00a0 Conversely, we want to thank you! Even if you only read through our project, or stop by and offer kind words of support, we know readers are the second pillar in a successful journal. We want to build an inclusive and wide-ranging literary community behind Echolocation - presenting our project in this forum is the best way to attract eyes (and possibly contributors) that otherwise wouldn't see the work we do in our corner of the literary sandbox.\u00a0 Regardless of whether you can give 5$ or 500$, know that we are grateful for any and all contributions and promise to use an funds past our goal to better compensate artists and writers. Again, thanks for considering and supporting Echolocation!\u00a0",
  "THE SHADOW BOOTH: VOL. 1 is now fully funded! This means that is will be released this December, as a mass market paperback. If you haven't already done so, pre-order your copy now for December delivery! Also, we've reached our first stretch goal! VOL. 1 now includes a brand new story by Alison Moore, 'The Stone Dead'. We've added it to the Table of Contents below - making it a round 13 stories for our first issue! A QUICK NOTE REGARDING THE EBOOK: We added this at a late stage, so we weren't able to add details to all the reward levels. However, EVERYONE who orders a copy of the paperback will receive an option of an ebook as well, free of charge, in the questionnaire once funding is finished. We don't believe in making you pay twice! When Eliot first spies the booth at the end of the pier, he wonders what it is. The canvas is faded, the striped pattern barely visible beneath years of dirt. The wooden boards are stained and scratched. It\u2019s the crude, handwritten sign that draws him closer, makes him reach out to pull the curtain aside. Enter the Shadow Booth, it says, and you will never be the same again. The Shadow Booth is a new journal of weird and eerie fiction, edited by Dan Coxon (Winner: Best Anthology \u2013 Saboteur Awards 2016) and published as a 200-page mass market paperback. Drawing its inspiration from the likes of Thomas Ligotti and Robert Aickman, as well as H. P. Lovecraft and Arthur Machen, The Shadow Booth explores that dark, murky territory between mainstream horror and literary fiction. From folk horror to alien gods, the journal aims to give voice to the strange and the unsettling in all its forms. We've reached full funding with over a week to spare! Because of this, we're aiming higher.  If we raise \u00a33,000 - we'll add a new story by Alison Moore to Volume 1 - ADDED!If we raise \u00a33,500 - we add another story by a mystery author! We're working on exact details of the second story to be added, and will update you as soon as we have the details. For now, rest assured that more money means more fiction! We've also added a new reward (on the right) so that you can pre-order Volumes 1 & 2 together. Volume 1 will be mailed out in December, Volume 2 is expected summer 2018. Remember: if you've already backed us, you can always increase your pledge! One of the aims of the journal is to reward the people who really deserve it - the writers. Yes, there are other costs involved in producing and distributing any book or magazine, but it's our belief that these should be outweighed by the authors' right to get paid for their work. It's one of the reasons we're crowdfunding - to ensure that the authors of these wonderful stories receive reasonable payment. Paid markets are becoming increasingly rare and it's a trend that we'd like to see reversed. We have factored in the costs involved in printing, layout, proofreading, distribution and the production of the other rewards, and approximately half the \u00a32500 target will be going direct to the writers. That means that if you buy a copy for \u00a310, somewhere in the region of \u00a35 will go to the writers to reward them for their work. Now, doesn't that sound fair?\n Hopefully you've already read the work of some of the writers involved, but in case you haven't, here's some of the talent we have lined up: Paul Tremblay is the author of Disappearance at Devil\u2019s Rock, the Bram Stoker Award winning A Head Full of Ghosts, The Little Sleep, and the forthcoming The Cabin at the End of the World. He is currently a member of the board of directors of the Shirley Jackson Awards, and his essays and short fiction have appeared in the Los Angeles Times and numerous \u201cyear\u2019s best\u201d anthologies. Richard Thomas is the award-winning author of three novels, three short story collections, 135+\nstories in print, and the editor of four anthologies. Gary Budden's work has appeared in Black Static, Unthology, Year\u2019s Best Weird Fiction, The Lonely Crowd and many more. He was shortlisted for the 2015 London Short Story Award, and his story \u2018Greenteeth\u2019 was nominated for a 2017 British Fantasy Award and adapted into a short film by the filmmaker Adam Scovell.  Malcolm Devlin's stories have appeared in Black Static, Interzone, Nightscript and Shadows and Tall Trees. His collection, You Will Grow Into Them, is published by Unsung Stories.  Annie Neugebauer has work appearing and forthcoming in more than a hundred publications, including magazines such as Cemetery Dance, Apex and Black Static, as well as anthologies such as Bram Stoker Award finalist The Beauty of Death and #1 Amazon bestseller Killing It Softly.  Richard V. Hirst is the co-author of The Night Visitors (with Jenn Ashworth), a novella told entirely via an exchange of emails, and Bus Station: Unbound, a choose-your-own-adventure-style novel set in Preston Bus Station. His work has been published in the Big Issue, Time Out and the Guardian amongst others. ...and that's just scraping the surface. Having read the stories, we can confirm that they're all amazing.  Dan Coxon is an award-winning editor, author, copy-editor and proofreader. In 2016 he won Best Anthology at the Saboteur Awards, for Being Dad: Short Stories About Fatherhood. He runs his own editorial company, Momus Editorial, and has worked for numerous publishers and authors in the past, including Urbane Publications, Unsung Stories, Influx Press and Dodo Ink. He is also a Contributing Editor at The Lonely Crowd, and has previously edited Litro magazine. His own writing has appeared under his own name and under a pen name, in publications that include Black Static, Unthology, Unsung Stories, The Lonely Crowd, Popshot, STORGY and The Year's Best Body Horror.

Av t\u00e4vlingens b\u00e4sta bidrag vill vi skapa en kokbok under samma namn f\u00f6r att kunna inspirera till gr\u00f6n matlagning samt ge allm\u00e4nheten m\u00f6jlighet till att ta del av de ber\u00e4ttelser som kommer att skapas via Plantable Cooking Contest i h\u00f6st.\u00a0 Vi vill att v\u00e5r kokbok ska handla om mer \u00e4n bara recept. Bakom varje recept finns det historier, k\u00e4nslor & upplevelser som t\u00e4vlingens kockar vill dela med sig  av. Kokboken kommer att inneh\u00e5lla de b\u00e4sta recepten fr\u00e5n t\u00e4vlingen. Vi r\u00e4knar med att kunna samla ca 50 recept d\u00e4r vi presenterar b\u00e5de matr\u00e4tter och personerna bakom recepten.  Vi vill ocks\u00e5 att ni f\u00e5r inblick i arbetet bakom t\u00e4vlingen. Finalen kommer att f\u00e5 ett eget kapitel i boken d\u00e4r ni f\u00e5r tr\u00e4ffa finalisterna och f\u00f6lja kampen om att bli Sveriges b\u00e4sta vegokock.  Arbetet med boken p\u00e5b\u00f6rjas efter att finalisterna till t\u00e4vlingen presenteras den 1:a augusti 2018. En panel fr\u00e5n Vegetariska Kockars F\u00f6rening kommer att v\u00e4lja de b\u00e4sta recepten som har inkommit till t\u00e4vlingen.  Under finalen tar vi hj\u00e4lp av en fotograf f\u00f6r att dokumentera hela f\u00f6rloppet. Efter finalen, under november 2018, jobbar vi med f\u00f6r att f\u00e4rdigst\u00e4lla recepten fr\u00e5n finalen samt ingresserna & texterna. En matfotograf som pl\u00e5tar matr\u00e4tterna i studiomilj\u00f6 kommer att ske parallellt under denna period.  Materialet kommer sedan att bearbetas av en professionell formgivare f\u00f6r att skapa en vacker och tidl\u00f6s kokbok. Arbetet med formgivningen p\u00e5b\u00f6rjas under november 2018.  Boken ska printas i Sverige f\u00f6r att uppn\u00e5 ett s\u00e5 klimatneutralt tryck som m\u00f6jligt. Boken planeras vara klar f\u00f6r leverans i januari 2019. Det lider ingen brist i Sverige idag p\u00e5 matt\u00e4vlingar professionella kockar s\u00e5v\u00e4l som f\u00f6r hemmakockar. Under t\u00e4vlingen bed\u00f6ms oftast kockarna, t\u00e4vlingsmomenten och maten som presenteras. N\u00e4r t\u00e4vlingen sedan \u00e4r \u00f6ver f\u00e5r dock oftast kocken all uppm\u00e4rksamhet. Sj\u00e4lva maten under t\u00e4vlingen faller dock l\u00e4tt i gl\u00f6mska. En av de viktigaste m\u00e5len med Plantable Cooking Contest \u00e4r att driva p\u00e5 utvecklingen av det v\u00e4xtbaserade k\u00f6ket. Vi str\u00e4var efter att skapa ett forum f\u00f6r matlagare som vill skapa modern innovativ v\u00e4xtbaserad mat. Vi vill att maten som tillagas under t\u00e4vlingen ska inspirera b\u00e5de kockar och allm\u00e4nheten till nya id\u00e9er som i sin tur driver utvecklingen fram\u00e5t. Vi hoppas att Plantable Cooking Contest ska vara mer \u00e4n bara ett evenemang under en dag p\u00e5 \u00e5ret. M\u00e5let \u00e4r att t\u00e4vlingen erbjuder en plattform f\u00f6r diskussion, inspiration och utveckling \u00e5ret om.\u00a0 Som en del i detta arbete vill vi tillsammans med er publicera en kokbok som samlar de b\u00e4sta recepten fr\u00e5n Plantable Cooking Contest. Vi tror att det \u00e4r det b\u00e4sta s\u00e4ttet att s\u00e4tta maten i centrum, bevara resultaten av t\u00e4vlingen och uppfylla v\u00e5rt syfte med att sprida inspiration och skapa nya id\u00e9er.  Bakom Plantable Cooking Contest st\u00e5r Vegetariska Kockars F\u00f6rening. F\u00f6reningen stiftades i slutet av 2015 med syfte att hj\u00e4lpa restaurangbranschen att bli b\u00e4ttre p\u00e5 att erbjuda v\u00e4xtbaserad mat till sina g\u00e4ster. Vegetariska Kockars F\u00f6rening har tre tydliga sp\u00e5r: gemenskap, inspiration och kunskap.  Vi \u00e4r en \u00f6ppen f\u00f6rening som v\u00e4lkomnar alla som \u00e4r intresserade av det v\u00e4xtbaserade k\u00f6ket.

  "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We are three graduate students studying Religion at the University of Georgia who have found a deep passion in teaching. \u00a0Because we are always looking for new and interesting methods to use in the classroom, we noticed the rise in popularity of Podcasts and decided to do some research. As academics, our goal was to find podcasts for our students that addressed the study of religion in an academic manner while simultaneously keeping the tone light and entertaining. \u00a0To our surprise, we did not find anything that met our needs! \u00a0Being enterprising individuals, we decided to give it a go ourselves. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We would like to release monthly podcasts that cover topics within the field of religion from a purely academic perspective that is relatable to both scholars and the average casual listener. \u00a0We feel that through our individual experiences in the classroom and research, we would be able to produce a podcast that treats all religions and adherents with fairness but does not shy away from tough, controversial topics. \u00a0Just as we would in our classrooms, we want to maintain a standard of religious sensitivity and reputable scholarship (hopefully we can make you laugh a little as well).\u00a0 Our Hosts Planned Episodes",
  "TONEAudio wants to celebrate its 10th Anniversary by going analog. With your support and pledges, we'll create a special 10th Anniversary PRINT EDITION to be mailed to backers in November, 2015. Also, we plan a second special print edition in April 2016. Your pledge of $8 or more gets both issues delivered to your door. Neither issue will be available online.\n TONEAudio is an online magazine focused on equipment reviews, music reviews, audio industry trends and associated lifestyle goodies. (You can check out the last 70 issues on our web site at www.tonepublications.com listed under MAGAZINE)\n Our readers tell us that we've created a magazine that\u2019s informative, beautiful to look at, and most of all, fun. And we're much more than a traditional audio magazine. We enjoy writing about style, wine, factory visits, headphone gear, \u201cold school\u201d classic gear, interesting accessories, and cars\u2014especially when they have great audio systems. But most importantly we cover music. Half of our magazine is devoted to current releases in the world of pop, rock, country, and jazz along with in-depth interviews with artists and industry professionals. We also employ some of the world\u2019s best and brightest music journalists. Learn more about the TONEAudio team below.\n Growing and building steadily from our humble roots in 2005, we have appreciated the ongoing support and feedback from the close knit community of audio fans, readers, manufacturers, music industry professionals, and many others who made our dream of producing a magazine a reality. We could not have done it without you.\n Over the years, many long-term and loyal readers have asked us, \u201cHey, TONE \u2026 will you ever print the magazine?\u201d Up until this point, the answer has been \u201cno\u201d. Given the number of inquiries we still receive, we are letting you, our readers, decide. If we can get enough advance backers to vote for the project with their pledges we will celebrate our anniversary in print. After all, you have come to us all these years, and now we want to return the favor and come to you.  \nThe 10th Anniversary issue this November, and the April 2016 issue will NOT be available online. Get both for a special Kickstarter rate of $8 during our campaign. \nWith over 250 pages, the 10th Anniversary issue will feature our Best of 2015 awards including Editor's Choice, Exceptional Value, and Products of the Year. The April 2016 issue is a ways off so we have not decided yet all it will contain. But as with the 10th Anniversary issue, we\u2019ll create new content available only to paid subscribers. As you have come to expect from us, both issues will include music, gear, style, and other fun tidbits.  JEFF DORGAY \u2013 Publisher and Photographer\u00a0 A Wisconsin native, Jeff built his first amplifier from a schematic in the RCA tube manual at age 14. His hi-fi sales career came to an abrupt end when he told a customer to take his big check up the street to the local Levinson dealer for much better equipment. 15 years as a commercial photographer led to writing about the rapidly expanding world of digital imaging at the turn of the century, writing for Macworld, CNet, Studio Photography and many others. He has also been a consultant to Adobe, Roland DGA and Olympus Cameras. He still takes a very active role in the images produced for TONEAudio, contributing a major portion of the magazine\u2019s visuals. These days, the Pacific Northwest is home, where you can find him in the local record stores, music venues, or in search of a great steak.\n JEAN LaCROSSE \u2013 Art Director   Jean\u2019s early studies of fine art and marketing were spent at the Southern Oregon University. She later moved to the Southwest to work on her tan and finish a degree in design at the University of Arizona. Her 25 years of art direction and design for Mayo Clinic, Bombardier, the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, American Express and other companies along with high-end prepress skills provided the necessary background to create the look and feel for TONEAudio. Every pixel of the magazine falls victim to her watchful eye. When she\u2019s not digitally designing, you can find Jean exploring Northwest wineries and enjoying Portland's live jazz and fine art.\n ROB JOHNSON \u2013 Managing Editor and Reviewer   Rob spent much of his professional career in technology marketing consulting for a Fortune 100 company. After 25 years in the corporate world, Rob followed his passion and joined the TONEAudio team in 2013. That means he\u2019s Jeff\u2019s right-hand man if there\u2019s a heavy amplifier that needs lifting. As an audio enthusiast his entire life, Rob\u2019s other past roles included time as a disk jockey and as a concert hall recording engineer. With all those opportunities to be surrounded by fantastic sound, Rob\u2019s several-decade obsession for great home audio gear took root at an early age.\n BOB GENDRON \u2013 Music Editor and Writer   Veteran music critic and copy editor Bob Gendron is a frequent contributor to the Chicago Tribune and the author of the 33 1/3 Series book on the Afghan Whigs\u2019 Gentlemen album. He owns far too many records, continues to attend an unhealthy amount of concerts, spends far too much money on craft beer, and enjoys playing hockey. He also writes for DownBeat and formerly served as music editor for The Absolute Sound. He\u2019s also been published by Rollingstone.com, The Source, and various other outlets.\n BAILEY S. BARNARD \u2013 Gear Editor and Writer   A staff writer and editor with luxury lifestyle magazine Robb Report since 2007\u2014a position that has afforded him access \u2028to some of the world\u2019s best hi-fi gear, not to mention jets, yachts, hotels, food and booze\u2014Bailey is also TONEAudio\u2019s gear editor, a frequent contributing writer and social media guru. Prior to his current editorial endeavors, he served as editor in chief of a student-run art and literary magazine at the University of Iowa, where he studied creative writing, literature, journalism and art history, in addition to editing and designing the North American newsletter of an international non-profit organization. Bailey has played music his entire life and there is little he loves more. When he\u2019s not listening to music, he\u2019s either beating up his beloved Martin guitar or blowing into a harmonica\u2014or both.\n LIZA DONNELLY \u2013 Cartoonist   Liza joined TONEAudio for issue 2, and has been supplying us with comic relief ever since. She has been a staff cartoonist for The New Yorker since 1982 and has worked for other publications including American Photographer, National Lampoon, Cosmopolitan and The New York Times. She has written a number of children\u2019s books and has shown her work in numerous exhibitions around the world. She lives in New York with her husband and two daughters. More information about Liza, her work and appearances can be found at: www.lizadonnelly.com\n JAAN UHELSZKI \u2013 Music Writer   Jaan Uhelszki was one of the founding editors at Detroit\u2019s legendary Creem magazine. Since that time, her work has appeared in leading publications including USA Today, MOJO, Uncut, Rolling Stone, Spin, NME, Guitar World, and The Village Voice. Currently the editor-at-large for Relix, she is the only journalist to have ever performed in full makeup with Kiss. These days she only feels compelled to put on Serge Lutens kohl black eyeliner and Dior mascara when she goes out to grill rock stars over an open pit. Just imagine... If our project is funded though Kickstarter you'll have the opportunity to get your very own copies of TONEAudio for the office, coffee table at home, next to a favorite reading chair, by the bed, on the mantle, or on the toilet tank. Placement is up to you. We won't judge.\n",
  "Make Good!\u2122 For me, the creative process was a journey of frustration, hope, and discovery.When I first got serious about writing songs, it felt as though I was making them in a vacuum. Having played cover songs for so long, I had a relatively good sense of the how...\u00a0but not the why. Even though I now have a good sense of my own \"why,\" other people all around us are creating incredible things in unique ways each and every day -- this podcast is about them. CREATEcast\u2122 will be a biweekly podcast all about the creative. A short 15-20 minute interview accompanied by what that person makes -- a song, a poem, or even a set of images made viewable on our website. Interviewees will include established creatives as well as those who are just beginning to discover their own hows and whys. If you are unfamiliar with podcasts, they are essentially serialized audio programs that focus on specific topics. You may have heard of\u00a0This American Life and The Nerdist. Podcasts can\u00a0range from fully scripted shows to completely unedited interviews. CREATEcast\u2122 falls somewhere in between these two extremes. Because podcasting is freely distributed, I need your help to get it going, Here's a specific breakdown of where your money will go...",
  "AxiomAir represents a revolution in wireless audio reproduction!  It has all the features of Bluetooth and WiFi combined in one sound system without the problems of either: Because the AxiomAir is manufactured in our factory in Canada, we can create an almost endless variety of finishes to suit your decor. The body of the AxiomAir comes in two stock finishes: black on black, or white on white. Then customize the lid in wood grain, a solid color, or even a picture of your favourite person, place or thing \u2013 the choice really is yours! You can even have the entire speaker painted to match your favourite colour or room decor. The lids are also all interchangeable later so you can update your look anytime you like. We've literally spent over 35 years researching sound and how to get the highest possible output from the smallest possible footprint. This research infuses every aspect of the AxiomAir. What does 150 watts of continuous output really mean?  Continuous power is how much power is available to the speaker all the time.  A lot of companies only list their peak power output \u2013 the level that can be attained for only fractions of a second.  The peak power rating is generally 5 times the continuous power rating.  So 150 watts of continuous output means the power to listen loud without distortion, the power to have an outdoor party, and the power to let the full dynamics of the music reach your soul. Bluetooth\u00ae is made to transmit voice from your headset to your phone - not to carry full-spectrum high-resolution sound. Using a Wi-Fi\u00ae network instead means you've got three times the usable range of Bluetooth\u00ae, you can play high resolution audio without compression, you can have more than one user at a time, and you can have them all over your home controlled from any device on your network (together or individually).  \nAxiomAir can be added to your home network so that it's always available to play music in the house. What if you want to take out on the lawn though, and your network doesn't reach? No problem. AxiomAir broadcasts its own network for you to connect to, giving you the freedom of Bluetooth\u00ae without any of the compromises. Just join the AxiomAir hotspot and your phone or tablet can access the user interface. It's a mobile music hotspot. If you've got a separate hard drive on your network with your high-resolution music files, you can easily access that hard drive from your AxiomAir with just a few clicks. Use the interface to easily add more devices to your AxiomAir network. Drag and drop different songs onto your playlists \u2013 and drag and drop speakers into different groups that can all play the same music at the same time. Keep the party going from room to room. The user interface was designed to be a convenient way to play any song in your user library, across as many AxiomAirs as you have in your home. Play in just one room or across all the AxiomAir-enabled rooms in your home. We chose the Raspberry Pi \u2013 a micro-computer about the size of a credit card \u2013 as the 'brains' behind the speaker, and we chose to make the Linux-based operating system open source. What that means is that any developer can write an app for the Raspberry Pi. If we create new features from our end, you can easily update your AxiomAir by clicking the 'Update' button on the user interface. Add the optional Karaoke module with our proprietary feedback-killing circuitry and two microphone inputs. AxiomAir becomes your Karaoke machine, with music volume, microphone volume, and echo level all controlled from the user interface.\u00a0 Give presentations that sound better than anyone else's. No really \u2013 the Karaoke module also works for presentations, so your AxiomAir becomes a portable sound system that will broadcast your voice with crystal clarity and no feedback even in rooms with hundreds of people. If high-end audio can be portable, why not high-end video too? Create a movie-theater-to-go by attaching a mini projector to AxiomAir (sold separately.) You can share movies in the backyard, in the bedroom or at the beach. Use a ChromeCast\u00ae or Apple TV\u00ae to send movies wirelessly to the projector. If you were to purchase a high-quality Digital-to-Analog-Converter (DAC), a 150-watt amplifier, the Axiom M3 speakers, a raspberry pi, and the power supply it would cost more than $1,400!  By backing the AxiomAir you can have it for just $475 when you are one of the first 200 contributors. \u00a0Ian Colquhoun Ian founded Axiom in 1980, and for over 35 years he has relentlessly pursued one goal: to amplify emotions by creating the most true-to-life audio experience possible.  He was part of a decade-long research project at the National Research Center in Ottawa, Canada, that changed the way the world measured loudspeaker sound.  Most weekends he can be found kicking around his anechoic chamber working on new sound reproduction ideas.  Music is his life.\u00a0 Andrew Welker Andrew is a brilliant loudspeaker, amplifier, and digital hardware designer who has a broad knowledge of everything audio and a particular expertise in the science relating to the omni-directional psychoacoustical effects of loudspeaker reproduction.  After graduating with a degree in Electrical Engineering Andrew went on to join the R&D team at API (Audio Products International), where he worked for over 10 years.  He joined Axiom in 2009 and has been the lead designer on the AxiomAir, fulfilling many personal wish-list items with this product:  a portable, wireless speaker that an audiophile could be proud to own. Michelangelo Guarise Michelangelo lives in Florence, Italy, and works passionately on marrying technology with music.  A lifelong Maker, Michelangelo founded RaspyFi.com, the predecessor to Volumio.org.  He focuses on the cognitive aspects of user interactions and physical computing, and he has been a world leader in freeing high-resolution music from traditional wired set ups so that it can be played from a smartphone, tablet or PC.\u00a0 Vlad Muller Vlad studied industrial design for 4 years in Uherske Hradiste  and at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague (a 6-year Master of Arts [Design and sculpture] degree programme).  His experience spans a wide range of disciplines from office furniture and household objects to toys and consumer electronics.  He is passionate about marrying the masculine and the feminine to create designs which are universally appealing. John G Paton Paton has been working with Axiom in various capacities since before its inception.  He is a lifelong Audiophile and John and Ian built the very first pair of speakers together in the late 1970s.  Little did they know at the time where it would all be 36 years later.  His musical tastes are wide-ranging and eclectic and he has long recognized the \u2018power of music and rhythm  to creep into the secret places of the soul\u2019.  (H.T. to Plato).\u00a0\u00a0",
  "Portable devices have improved practically in every way except one \u2013 sound quality. It\u2019s a question of as to how the listener hears the sound of their music or audio books through their headphones. The multinational companies are as decisive as to how perfect their processors are, or the high definition provided by the screen. Further they talk about how powerful the OS is accompanying which is the Lightweight and Sleek Dimensions. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter if you purchase a top-of-the-line headset, if the sound entering into those headphones is poor in the first place. \n \nWhy is sound from your mobile device so poor (at least from the standard of an audiophile)? \nAudio files on your computer are like any other files \u2013 they are binary, 1s and 0s. It requires a \u201cdigital to analog/audio\u201d converter (otherwise known as DAC) to turn those files into sound that you can hear. Portable device manufacturers (smartphones, tablets, laptops) use the most basic, internal DACs possible, because DACs drain the device\u2019s battery.  So, while headphones have improved, that improvement does you no good if you use them through the headphone jack/DAC of your device. That\u2019s why OnBlink has created the OnBlink Mini Amplifier and the OnBlink Plus Digital to Analog (DAC) Converter and Amplifier.  The OnBlink Mini Amplifier and the OnBlink Plus has to be plugged into the headphone jack of your device. The Amplifier will amp up the sound to a great extent. The OnBlink Plus Digital to Analog (DAC) converter will deliver amazing sound quality that you just don\u2019t hear from the device\u2019s internal DAC. \u00a0The size of your headphones dictates, to some extent, whether an amp may be needed. Most earbuds and in-ear headphones are typically very efficient and are less likely to have any benefits from an amp. Larger headphones, on the other hand, will benefit, or even require, a headphone amp to reach audible volume levels with portable players. \u00a0We have created a supply unit which can split output power far more stably in headphones. Other amplifier divide the power when connected with 2 headphones, but we designed 2 power lines to both the output jack which helps OnBlink mini and OnBlink plus to achieve incredible level of performance even when both the headphones are connected. Large size amp which are used for concerts have been using such technology from years, but this is the first time such a technology is introduced in such a portable size. This technology helps to run both the headphones of their maximum ohm. \u00a0Onblink plus uses the same outer body like many other amplifier in the market and there is a reason for that. That uni-body design helps to completely seal the chip of the DAC+AMP which does not interferes with portable device antenna. We noticed a sound interferance and disturbance in headphone before every incoming calls, that sound was the DAC getting affected by the portable device antenna. Hence we decide to use a uni-body design which completely isolates the chips from the reductions of the antenna. Few other reason pushed us to use the design was its compactness, durability and elegancy. This design also fits in our size of Advanced circuit and has ample of space to fit in a huge Lithium-ion batteries. This outer body which is readily available also brings down the cost exceedingly thus reducing the production delay altogether. Other companies only have AMP in such a small and compact size. As we used Advanced circuit design using the latest IC technology, we could fit both the DAC and AMP in Onblink Plus. This has completely changed the Audio industry and has exceedingly enhanced your hearing experience. We have invested 2 years just to refine Onblink plus. Onblink is the world\u2019s smallest AMP + splitter, we have created a custom circuit for maximum performance, this changes the complete audio output circuits. We have successfully placed an audio chip TI OPA 1612 in such a small chamber. This technology would be hard for counterfeiter to even try. This took us a lot of time and resources to produce the Onblink mini which is a completely new design. Funding Breakdown Research and development of the OnBlink Mini and the OnBlink Plus is complete. The funds received will be used for production, packaging and marketing. \u00a0The OnBlink Mini comes with the following items: OnBlink Mini\nCharging USB cable\nUser manual\nThe OnBlink Mini is a miniature stereo amplifier + splitter for use with music/audio/smart-phone/tablet/etc devices, and provides more power and audio quality to stereo headphones, including high impedance models. Two stereo headphones can be attached to the OnBlink mini so that two people can listen to the music at the same time. Specifications Highlights The OnBlink Mini has a build-in lithium battery, which can be fully recharged in 2 hours. The device comes with an LED battery indicator \u2013 a red light means the battery is low, and when fully charged, the light will be green. A charging cable is included. The OnBlink Mini has an intelligent charging circuit, so it will automatically stop charging when the battery is full. \u00a0PLUS Supports multiple device types for digital-to-analog conversion via USB OTG feature, PC, Mac computers iPod / iPhone / iPad, smartphones The OnBlink Plus comes with the following items: Specifications Highlights OnBlink is a audio consultancy - was established in 2012 with the aim of creating high end and detailed music ambience. OnBlink has successfully given audio consultancy for series of music shows in London, to become the bestselling audio assistance provider for any musical concert! We have worked closely with many music artist and brands for their shows and seminar. Having owned this larger space of music,  we have set our foot on this new mission to bring you quality music to your ears! Today In this world of advanced technology , where power back ups are owned by almost every individual,  do you know that the power supply to the audio jack is limited by these back up devices? Did you know that the supply to you audio jack does not match the specifications required by your head gear? We are here to help you to understand audio output, the way we understand it. Prototype we have more then 20 prototype before we came up with advance IC unit. This is a groundbreaking technology in AMP and DAC. For year the chip model was not changed, until now. If you can't contribute monetarily, but like what you see. Tell your friends about these amazing little AMP+DAC . Share it on Facebook, twitter, your favorite forum, we would greatly appreciate and accept any help you have to offer. ",
  "Traditional headphones use dynamic drivers, which use a cone and voice coil to create sound. This design is fundamentally flawed and has its inherent limitations. Planar magnetic speakers are fundamentally different from traditional dynamic speakers allowing them to overcome many \nconstraints in dynamic cone drivers. Planar magnetic drivers use an array of magnets in parallel with an ultra light diaphragm with a printed circuit. This array creates a magnetic field in which the diaphragm is suspended. Planar magmatic drivers use an ultra thin and light diaphragm with a printed circuit on it to create sound. When an audio signal is sent to the circuit it interacts with the magnetic array and produces a electromagnetic force that moves the diaphragm back and forth creating beautiful and accurate sound. Traditional headphones use a fixed pivot points in order to conform to your head. Aeques uses a suspension system that allows the earcups to pivot effortlessly , conforming to heads of all sizes or shapes. Most headphones have 4 to 7 newtons of clamping force in order to stay on your head and create a seal.\u00a0 Aequus has only 2.5 newtons, as our omnidirectional articulating earcup design requires less force in order to achieve a perfect seal, this means you can wear Aequus for longer without any fatigue.  With four easy to remove screws you can easily change the side plates on Aequus to suit your style or listening preferences.  Make your headphones even more personal. Side plates can be laser engraved with any custom artwork. Closed Backs Open Backs  Mod away.

  "All Sorts is a magical office story about the surreal world of Data Mart and the eclectic (ahem, strange) people who work there. It's my second feature-length film as a writer/director, and it was put together with a lot of paperclips, staples, and heart in Yakima, WA. We\u2019re in post-production now, and we\u2019re looking for funds to finish making this film so that we can win lots of film festival awards and also maybe some employee-of-the-month certificates. Diego is desperate \u2013 for a job, for excitement, for love. When he gets hired to work by Vasquez, the absurd boss who loves data but can\u2019t type, Diego finds himself in the strange, strange land of Data Mart. There he meets June, an incredibly fast filer, and as the two make their way into the secret world of underground filing, things will never be the same. Diego agrees to be her coach and manager, and as June rises up through the underground filing ranks, the two begin to fall for each other. But do they really have a shot, or are they just fooling themselves? This is the second feature we\u2019ve filmed near my hometown of Granger, WA. We had so much fun making the first one, Cement Suitcase, in and around Tri-Cities and Yakima, that I knew we had to come back to film the next one. And we were lucky - a lot of our cast and crew from the first film came back this past February and March to film for 18 days and make it all happen!  All Sorts is truly a community-made film. The producer and art director stayed at my parents' house. Other family friends invited crew members into their homes. David Carstens, the cinematographer, even volunteered to sleep at the office location where we shot. Everyone really pulled together, and made a lot of sacrifices, to make this film the best it could be. We finished production! That means we\u2019re halfway to the finish line. We still need to complete the editing, visual effects, color correction, music, and sound design. With our experience making Cement Suitcase, we\u2019re confident that we can make a great film. But a feature film isn't like an alphabetized file - you can\u2019t just expect people to find it on their own. We\u2019ve got to send the film out to festivals and promote it every way we can think of so that the film finds a great distributor, and gets seen by as many people as possible.\u00a0 Post-Production, music, marketing, distribution, and film festivals aren't free - in fact, according to our accounting spreadsheet, they all cost money dollars! We\u2019ll need to pay for film festival entry fees, closed captioning, and creating a DCP digital file that can play in movie theaters. We plan on getting big discounts for post-production, but it will still cost quite a bit. This is where our Kickstarter funds will go.  We want to make magic - that\u2019s why we make movies, and that\u2019s especially why we made this movie. We want people to be thinking about magic when they look at a filing cabinet. We want them to use their imagination as they think about their own office lives. This is a very positive movie, about love, about friendship, about finding magic in a dim, drab place. I hope you\u2019ll join our team and help us make it! J. Rick Casta\u00f1eda,\u00a0writer/director of All Sorts Director - J. Rick Casta\u00f1eda\u00a0 J.

  "After two years of preparation we are finally ready to move forward and begin shooting our latest project, \"Outside the Box\". All we need now is your help to raise the money needed to launch our production!\u00a0 Outside the Box is a dramatic comedy about a group of homeless characters who are trying to find their place in the world. We are setting out to capture a thirty minute block of content which we can then use as either a television pilot, or as four webisodes in a web series. Gabriel Auffant (left) is a highly accomplished director, having worked on a variety of projects such as short films, commercials, comedy sketches, and feature films. He has a heart for comedy and loves to bring others joy through his work. Gabriel also has a background in theatrical acting. Colton Bostick (right) is a dedicated cinematographer with a wide range of video production experience. He has been filming, and editing videos for over ten years. Fun fact: While Colton loves video work, he does not like salads. Christopher T. Lovett (center) is a talented and adept writer, having placed in four contests over the past ten years. His work includes (but is not limited to) screenplays, television pilots, monologues, multiple short films, and flash fiction. He is currently working on a novel. First, you can take a few minutes to share our kickstarter page with your friends and family. You can even share this page with people you don't know so well, everyone matters!  Next, taking the time to share this link through email and on social media would help a lot. Spreading the word about our project to as many people as possible will greatly increase the chances of reaching our goal.  Lastly (and perhaps most importantly!) every dollar you are willing to contribute will be greatly appreciated by our team. We are really excited about our list of rewards that we are offering in return for your contribution. Be sure to check out all of our different reward tiers to find out what looks best to you! No, everyone who contributes will only be charged after the kickstarter is complete and if we've reached our minimum goal. A background element to the premise of \"Outside the Box\" is that a research group has started a study on the homeless community. As part of their research, they provided each of our homeless characters with a camera so that they could record their thoughts at the end of each day. These video logs allow us to insert the inner thoughts of our main cast in the midst of any scene. In many cases, we use this technique to add a well-timed comedic element in the midst of whatever is going on at the time they are, \"Outside the Box\". \u00a0 We want it to be clear: our goal is never to make fun of the homeless. We reviewed our script with beta readers and people connected with multiple homeless organizations to ensure that none of our humor comes across as insensitive or rude. Each person who has read our script says that it does not come across as disrespectful or demeaning to the homeless community, but rather, makes them relatable as real people with real thoughts, feelings, and inside jokes just like anyone else. In fact, one of our heart goals is to raise a positive awareness of the homeless. In future episodes, if we are blessed with the opportunity and the funding to make more, we plan to connect with more homeless organizations and even list them in the credits so that people have a place to go to give money and find volunteer opportunities to help the homeless.\u00a0 Like us on Facebook!\n\u00a0 https://www.facebook.com/OTBTheSeries/ Follow us on instagram!\n\u00a0#OtbTheSeries\u00a0 \u00a0Also stay connected through our website for Outside the Box.\u00a0http://otbtheseries.com/\u00a0(Please note* currently directs to this kickstarter, link will update when our kickstarter campaign is complete)  http://auffantfilms.com/ http://otherworldmediafilms.com/",

  "Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales was the publication that launched Atomic Overmind Press. Now, a decade later, Kenneth Hite and Atomic Overmind are ready to take you on a whole new tour through the world and works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft.\u00a0 \u201cSearchers after horror,\u201d wrote H.P. Lovecraft, \u201chaunt strange, far places.\u201d Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations gives you a guidebook to those places, and to places still stranger and farther yet \u2026 places shudderingly close to home. Kenneth Hite guided readers through Lovecraft\u2019s plots and themes in his earlier book Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales. Now, expanding on his \u201cLost in Lovecraft\u201d essay series in Weird Tales magazine, he takes you on a sight-seeing tour of Lovecraft\u2019s settings: from Arkham to Antarctica, and from New York City to Hyperspace. For Lovecraft the setting was everything, and his legendary locations still hold meanings and secrets for today\u2019s readers. Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations drives the hidden routes connecting seemingly unrelated tales. It follows the tracks of Lovecraft\u2019s predecessors and models, stops to get its bearings in the real world, then plunges back into mystery, deciphering and explaining the symbols and signs on the Master\u2019s map. Kenneth Hite climbs the crags of Kingsport with you, and shines a light under the shadows over Innsmouth. Don\u2019t stray far from the group in the Dreamlands, and while in Vermont, please keep your head and hands inside the bus. With Hite as your guide and Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations as your guidebook, you can\u2019t get lost in Lovecraft even in the loneliest parts of the planet \u2026 unless you want to \u2026 So that's what Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations is all about. Now\u00a0let's talk about the content.\u00a0 Modern Cthulhu Mythos master Nick Mamatas provides a Foreword to start the tour.\u00a0As part of his \"Lost in Lovecraft\" series for Weird Tales magazine, Ken has already written 14 of the 19 essays that will comprise the basic version of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations. Those are:\u00a0 A further 5 essays are still to be\u00a0written, but Ken already has them plotted out. They are:\u00a0 All of those essays together comprise the basic edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations.\u00a0 Just for backing, we'll give you the current text of Tour de Lovecraft: the Destinations, incorporating all fourteen of the currently-existing Kenneth Hite's \"Lost in Lovecraft\" essays from Weird Tales magazine \u2014 AND the digital first edition of Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales. You can find a link to both PDFs in the first backer-only update under the Updates tab on this page. After doing some thinking on the issue, Ken and I have decided on an addition to the reward tiers. If you are backing at Ward/Dexter or above, you will automatically receive the Digital Editions of both Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales and Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations. This applies to Ward, Dexter, Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, and, of course, Azathoth.  Now on to the presentation formats. We're looking at four formats for the book to be delivered in, all of them featuring cover artwork by the esteemed artist Ivan Dixon. They are as follows.\u00a0 The Digital Editions of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations and Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales comprise a PDF version of the book's text, as well as epub and mobi formats.\u00a0 The standard, or Tourist, edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations will be an (at-least) 144 page hardcover book measuring approximately 5.25\" in width by 8.25\"in height. It will be cloth-bound, and feature a sewn binding and dust jacket.\u00a0 The Tourist Edition of Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales will feature the same dimensions and specifications.\u00a0 The Traveller Edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations will have the same dimensions as the Tourist Edition, but feature an exclusive blue leatherette binding and foil-stamping on the cover, along with the dust jacket. Additionally, each copy will be signed and numbered by Kenneth Hite. This edition will be limited to 75 copies.\u00a0 The Traveler Edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales will feature a green leatherette binding, and will also be limited to 75 copies.\u00a0 Now that we've unlocked Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales, we're adding a new edition to the campaign, the Twin Travellers edition. As with the Traveller Edition, this set of both Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations and Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales will feature an leatherette binding, this time in an edition-exclusive blue-green, and foil-stamping on the cover,   along with a dust jacket. Each set will be signed and numbered by Kenneth Hite. This edition will be limited to 75 sets.  The extremely limited Globetrotter Edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations will be hand-bound in leather by Sara Hindmarch of Chicago, IL. Also signed and numbered by Kenneth Hite, this edition will be limited to five copies.\u00a0 Since this edition is hand-assembled, it's possible there may be a few custom extras included in the final product. If we unlock the new edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales, there will be an accompanying five-copy edition of that book, and a further five copies of both books available only as a set, featuring a hand-made slipcase by Ms. Hindmarch.\u00a0\u00a0 Additional copies of the Tourist Editions of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations and Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales are available as add-ons to your backer level. Just add $15.00 to your pledge for each copy you'd like to add on. You'll be able to apply that to those copies in Backerkit. You don't have to decide now, of course. You can simply wait for Backerkit and add additional copies then. \u00a0 You can also add-on copies of the Digital Edition of each book. Add $10 to your pledge for each Digital Edition.\u00a0 Our plan is to have the additional material for the book written, and the book printed and delivered into the hands of backers by Halloween of next year (2018).\u00a0Please note that, due to the hand work involved, delivery of the Globetrotter Edition may take 2-3 months longer than the Tourist and Traveller editions. Note that if you're backing a level including the Globetrotter Edition, we're including normally-delivered copies of the Tourist Editions of the Tour de Lovecraft books, as well as the Digital Edition.\u00a0 \"Ken\u2019s always had a great combination of wit, knowledge and geekery. All of that comes to fruition with Tour de Lovecraft, an immensely readable trip through the works of everyone\u2019s favorite dark fantasist, H.P. Lovecraft, which combines a deep love of the work with a clear-eyed view of quality of the same. If you\u2019re a Lovecraft fan, you\u2019ll find lots to enjoy, and to argue with.\"\u00a0 \u2014 John Scalzi,\u00a0author of Old Man's War and Lock In \u201cKenneth Hite\u2019s\u00a0Tour de Lovecraft\u00a0is indispensable. Thorough, insightful, and compellingly readable, it\u2019s a perfect introduction for newcomers to Lovecraft and an endlessly fascinating review for long-time Lovecraft addicts. This is the companion-book to Lovecraft\u2019s fiction\u2014I read it entirely in one sitting, and I know I\u2019m going to read it again many times over the coming years.\u201d\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Tim Powers, author of\u00a0Declare\u00a0and\u00a0Last Call \u201cLovecraft can be terrifying for all the wrong reasons. Kenneth Hite\u2019s charming and accessible\u00a0Tour\u00a0makes it much, much simpler. This is a sharp, engaging survey of Lovecraft\u2019s most important stories, sure to bring inspiration to new fans and fresh epiphanies to longtime devotees. And I\u2019d recommend it to any teacher looking for an introductory critical companion to the fiction itself.\u201d\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Stephen H. Segal, editorial director, Weird Tales magazine \u201cTour de Lovecraft\u00a0is an insightful and witty romp through the fiction of the twentieth century\u2019s master of horror.\u201d \u2014\u00a0 Daniel Harms, author of\u00a0The Necronomicon Files\u00a0and\u00a0The Cthulhu Mythos Encyclopedia Here's an overview of our funding strategy, with a couple of initial stretch goals assuming we hit our goal for Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations.\u00a0 FUNDED! This is our basic funding level. If we hit this, we'll produce the digital and hardcover print versions of\u00a0Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations, with a completion and delivery date target of Halloween 2018. FUNDED! If we hit this funding goal, we will not only produce the digital and physical versions of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations, we will also revise and reproduce the digital and physical versions of Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales. The format of both books will be the same, and pledge tiers will be added to allow backers to get both books in standard and special formats. UNLOCKED! At this point, with the basics fully funded, we can move on to adding new content to the Tour de Lovecraft Books.\u00a0 Lovecraft set three stories in Washington Irving's old stomping ground of Upstate New York, and his allusions to the Plateau of Leng tie that blasphemous country to Antarctica, nightmares, and Tibet. Ken adds two new essays to Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations:\u00a0one on\u00a0that eerie undiscovered country, and another on Leng. UNLOCKED! Ken turns his eye to Lovecraft\u2019s collaborations, beginning with Hazel Heald (\u201cOut of the Aeons\u201d, \u201cThe Horror in the Museum\u201d, \u201cWinged Death\u201d), Adolphe de Castro (\u201cThe Last Test,\u201d \u201cThe Electric Executioner\u201d), and Anna Helen Crofts (\u201cPoetry and the Gods\u201d), and winding up on Venus with Kenneth Sterling (\u201cIn the Walls of Eryx\u201d). With this goal achieved, Ken adds individual articles on those seven Tales. UNLOCKED! Like Charles Dexter Ward, Ken returns home -- to Oklahoma, to examine the setting of \u201cThe Curse of Yig\u201d and \u201cThe Mound.\u201d And why venture back into the past if not to examine the primordial, paleontological past with our eyestalks as well? If we power past this stretch goal, Ken adds two new Destinations: Oklahoma and Deep Time. UNLOCKED! Ken drives the bus deeper into the collaborations, where we meet Zealia Bishop (\u201cThe Curse of Yig\u201d, \u201cMedusa\u2019s Coil\u201d, \u201cThe Mound\u201d), HPL\u2019s then-girlfriend Sonia Haft Greene (\u201cThe Horror at Martin\u2019s Beach\u201d), Duane Rimel (\u201cThe Tree on the Hill\u201d), and Frank Barlow (\u201cThe Night Ocean\u201d). With this goal unlocked, Ken adds individual responses to those six Tales. UNLOCKED! Lovecraft visited the American South several times in his life, and at least four times in his fiction. And while he strangely never set a story in a jungle, the swamp seemed to hold just as much horror for HPL as the forest or the icy wastes. With this goal reached, Ken adds two hot, wet new Destinations, the South and the Swamp. UNLOCKED! We\u2019re out of worthy collaborations, but what about the stories Lovecraft just left unfinished? Like Lovecraft, Ken isn\u2019t sure exactly what to do with the fragments -- \u201cAzathoth,\u201d \u201cThe Descendant,\u201d \u201cThe Very Old Folk,\u201d \u201cMemory,\u201d \u201cThe Thing in the Moonlight,\u201d and \u201cThe Book\u201d -- but if you follow him past this stretch goal, he\u2019ll do something with them: one overlong essay, perhaps, or six little short ones. Speaking of overlong, Ken will also analyze Lovecraft\u2019s round-robin tale \u201cThe Challenge From Beyond\u201d, written with C.L. Moore, A. Merritt, Frank Belknap Long, and Robert E. Howard. UNLOCKED! Lovecraft turned horror into science fiction and vice versa, even while calling back to ancient archaeological terrors. With this goal met, Ken adds two new Destinations, taking us into Outer Space and under the pyramids to Egypt.\n UNLOCKED! What rhymes with \u201creached another stretch goal?\u201d Lovecraft would have known, and perhaps we\u2019ll find out when Ken adds two new pieces to Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales: one on Lovecraft\u2019s sonnet cycle Fungi From Yuggoth, and one covering the rest of Lovecraft\u2019s poetry. UNLOCKED! Miskatonic University may prefer the South Pole, but Lovecraft doesn\u2019t neglect the icy north, from Lomar to Greenland to his pal Clark Ashton Smith\u2019s Hyperborea. When we melt this stretch goal, Ken adds two cool new Destinations, taking us up to the Arctic and onto the campus at Miskatonic University.\n UNLOCKED! Fiction done, poetry done, what\u2019s next? Our Tour becomes recursive with essays about Lovecraft\u2019s essays, of course! If we hit this stretch goal, Ken writes a response to Supernatural Horror in Literature and an essay on Lovecraft\u2019s \u201cHistory of the Necronomicon.\u201d UNLOCKED! What fun is a tour without a map? If you help drive us past this stretch goal, acclaimed cartographer Mark Richardson of Green Hat Designs prepares a map of Lovecraft Country\u2014the Miskatonic and Manuxet valleys\u2014in the style of a 1930s road map, and we print it in Tour de Lovecraft: the Destinations as interior art. UNLOCKED! You\u2019ve waited patiently throughout the Tour, and finally you can pet a kitty! Ken (and possibly his cat Virgil) responds to Lovecraft\u2019s essay \u201cSomething About Cats\u201d (also published as \u201cCats and Dogs\u201d). Passing this stretch goal also gets Ken to add an essay on Lovecraft\u2019s writing advice, specifically on HPL\u2019s \u201cNotes on Interplanetary Fiction\u201d and \u201cNotes on Writing Weird Fiction\u201d. UNLOCKED! This is it! We\u2019ve gone everywhere, and now we\u2019re giving you the Master\u2019s master itinerary! When we reach this stretch goal, Ken compiles The Lovecraftian Gazetteer: Every location mentioned in Lovecraft\u2019s fiction, listed and keyed for your convenience. This stretch goal includes an (interior art) world map, by Ken or possibly by an even better cartographer! Both the Gazetteer and the world map will be included in Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations. Often requested of Ken, and just as often put off by Ken, adding brief synopses of all the stories to Tour de Lovecraft: the Tales would be undeniably handy and undeniably a pain in the tuchus to write. But if you\u2019ve come with us this far, hitting this stretch goal means Hal will hit Ken until he buckles down and does it.\n In addition to pledging for reward tiers, you can help us spread the word about Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations through social media. The more backers we get, the better we can make the whole project!\u00a0 UNLOCKED! At 250 backers, we'll go beyond just a PDF presentation of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations, and add full-featured .epub and .mobi editions to the Digital Edition. This also applies to Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales if it is funded.\u00a0 UNLOCKED! If we hit 300 backers, we will create an illustrated Kickstarter-exclusive bookplate. These will be sent to all backers receiving physical rewards. Any backers getting both Tour de Lovecraft books (funding of both pending) will receive 2 book plates.  UNLOCKED! At 350 backers, we'll add color endsheets to the binding of the books, and add a spot gloss to the book's dustjacket.\u00a0 UNLOCKED! At 400 backers, we'll add a second ink to the interior printing of both Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations and Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales. UNLOCKED! Once we hit 450 backers, we'll add an appropriately-colored ribbon bookmark to both Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations, and The Tales. \u00a0 UNLOCKED!\u00a0While Ken's words are the star of Tour de Lovecraft, we're keen to fancy up the way they're presented. What better to do that than some artwork? When we hit 500 backers, we'll add black and white chapter headers, spot illustrations, and so on to the interior of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations.\u00a0 UNLOCKED! The first edition of Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales was graced with spot illustrations by the excellent artist (and Darkest of the Hillside Thickets band member) Toren \"Macbin\" Atkinson. If we hit 550 backers, we'll expand the interior art inside Tour de Lovecraft: The Tales with even more art!\u00a0 UNLOCKED! Identifying your bag when on a journey can be difficult, but we can help! At 600 backers, we'll create a set of 3 vinyl luggage labels for the more outr\u00e9 stops on the Tour. All backers at tiers with physical rewards will receive these for free! UNLOCKED! Sure, set one covered Kadath, the Dreamlands, and Hyperspace....but what about Leng, Arkham, and Innsmouth? 3 labels just isn't enough to cover all the esoteric locations on our Tour... so at 650 backers, we'll double the size of the set to 6 labels. All backers with physical rewards will get the full set of 6 for free!  UNLOCKED! With the wealth of Lovecraftian analysis in these two volumes, it'd be nice to be able to find things, wouldn't it? At 700 backers, Ken is hoisted on his own verbal petard as he buckles down and indexes the pile of words he's made for both Tour de Lovecraft books.\u00a0 UNLOCKED! At 800 backers, Mark Richardson's map of Lovecraft Country leaps from the pages of Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations and takes on a life of its own! We'll turn his map into a high quality print (format still to be determined) and make it available as an add-on in Backerkit.\u00a0 UNLOCKED! 900 backers? Insanity! If we get this many backers on board the Tour, we'll create a Kickstarter-exclusive slipcase that will fit the Tourist, Traveller and Twin Traveller Editions of The Tales and The Destinations, and we'll make it available as a an add-on in Backetkit.\u00a0 UNLOCKED! Dread has come upon us all! Because Hal is in fact a monster, at 1000 backers Ken's fervent protestations will be roundly ignored, and we will unleash the unspeakable: the Tour de Lovecraft Tote Bag. The tote bag will feature the art from both books, be the best quality we can find to customize, and be available as an add-on in Backerkit.\u00a0 There are many more destinations and many more Lovecraft tales that Ken would like to write about, and with your kind support, we have many more interesting stretch goals ahead. Stay tuned! Atomic Overmind Press is committed to supporting brick and mortar book and hobby retailers.\u00a0We fully understand how Kickstarter and other crowdfunding platforms create new challenges for traditional retail stores, so we\u2019re taking steps to encourage retailer support of our products. Here are a few things we are doing.\u00a0 1. We know cash flow can be an issue, and most retailers don\u2019t want to tie up capital while you wait for fulfillment. With that in mind, you can become a retail backer of Tour de Lovecraft at the \"Pickman\" level to let us know you\u2019re interested in carrying the book, and during the BackerKit process you can adjust your order to fit what you need at that time.\u00a0 2. You\u2019ll get Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations\u00a0copies early, and you\u2019ll be able to sell for at least 30 days before it hits distribution. 3. In-store, freight-free pickup option for backers local to you: You\u2019ll have the option to add your store\u2019s name to our Retailer Backer List for in-store pickup (US stores only). If you do, any of our backers can save the cost of shipping their books by picking their Tour de Lovecraft rewards up at your store. Yes, we need their support pledge to make Tour de Lovecraft: The Destinations happen, but you will have the opportunity to expose a potential new customer to other products and accessories your store has to offer. Both you and the backers local to you will need to coordinate with each other ahead of shipment. We\u2019ll provide the list of participating stores in an update as we get closer to the release. Shipping. It's the biggest wildcard and largest misunderstood cost of any crowdfunding project. We've chosen not to fold shipping costs into the reward tiers for this campaign, and have reduced the pricing on those tiers accordingly. Shipping will be charged using Backerkit when we are finally ready to get the project physically into your hands. Our shipping partners, Studio 2 Publishing, have extensive experience with Kickstarter fulfillment and will be able to provide us with the most economical methods to get your rewards delivered to you in proper shape. For overseas backers, costs will naturally be higher, but we are committed to finding the best-cost solution possible for you. This includes finding and working with localization partners to ship the final rewards if possible. We cannot offer guarantees on what those prices will be. But if you trust us, we promise do the absolute best we can for you. And well you\u00a0should ask!

  "WHO ARE YOU? WHAT IS HAPPENING? Hi Kickstarter! My name is Cat Harris-White and I create, sing, perform and produce under the name SassyBlack. You may know my work from my (now defunct) group THEESatisfaction or my appearances on Black Up & Lese Majesty\u00a0by Shabazz Palaces. Last year I released my first solo album and 5th release No More Weak Dates to a fantastically warm reception.\u00a0 Since then so much has happened including my first solo tour to Europe last fall, speaking at SXSW & Pop Kultur Berlin, performing at several festivals (Capitol Hill Block Party, Treefort Music Fest, Linecheck Music Festival (Milan), Barcelona Acci\u00f2 Musical (Barcelona), Daytrotter Fest etc.) as well as my music being featured on the Adult Swim compilation LUXE.\u00a0 On June 23rd, I released my sophomore album \"New Black Swing\" independently. It's my 7th release in the past 3 years, can you believe it?! Like all my projects, this album was written, produced and performed by me. And so far this has been my most successful record yet gaining praise not only from major publications like i-d, NYLON & the FADER, but also from YOU, my family, friends & supporters!\u00a0 \u00a0 OH COOL, WHAT'S GOOD SASSY? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? As I mentioned, people have responded so well to New Black Swing that it is definitely time for a full fledge North American & European tour! I manage & book myself & have been in contact with promoters and venues all over the world preparing routing while strategizing how I can share my music through live performances. So far I have some great dates lined up including Seattle, Portland, Brooklyn, LA, London, Salt Lake City, Z\u00fcrich and more to be announced.\u00a0 WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS KICKSTARTER?\u00a0 I rarely ask for help. This is something that I have been trying to work through. As a Black Queer woman, society and my own communities expect me to be strong while emotional and able to handle and figure out anything. While parts of that are true, there is no shame in asking for help and finding better ways to accomplish things.\u00a0 With that said, this is what I like to call a \"vulnerability moment\". It's an opportunity for me to share myself in a different way and admit that I don't have all the answers and that I do in fact need help at times. Going from being a DIY musician to a signed artist back to a DIY musician is quite the journey and I wouldn't change a thing! However I have learned a lot over this time and asking for help is an opportunity to better myself and learn more about my community and where that support resides. All in all I am very excited to get to know my supporters better and to continue to learn and share knowledge as a result. WHAT'S THE PLAN MA'AM?\u00a0 The tour kicks off August 31st\u00a0and goes until mid November. Promoters and venues have been contacted and so far 15 dates have been confirmed with more confirming every day!\u00a0 - All Service Incentives will be scheduled in September and set in motion beginning in November when I return from tour.\u00a0 - Merchandise Delivery has a few more steps involved which is below: WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? My expenses consist of travel by air or land or water (ferry), tour publicity & radio promotions, music videos, accommodations (need somewhere to sleep and practice!) & of course food (need to eat!). These are all things that are necessary to have a successful tour.\u00a0 WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO YOU SASS? It\u2019s important to love yourself and try new things! My solo career is still a new thing for me and it is scary everyday, but that\u2019s why I love it. I push myself further and learn more about myself and how I can help others and that is one of the best feelings in the world. Outside of making music!\n",

  "Fire & Bone makes tiny, true-to-life, animal skull reproductions derived from high-resolution 3D scans of original specimens, carefully miniaturized in a digital process, 3D printed, and then cast in metal using traditional lost-wax casting. Each skull pendant can be both worn and displayed on their optional wood collectors base.\u00a0 It's been nearly a decade since we launched Fire & Bone on Kickstarter, and our library has now grown to include over 80 different pendant species, along with skull earrings & cufflinks, one-of-a-kind fossil pendants, skulls with inset gemstones, and more! Check out our entire library here. The nine new skulls that can be both worn or displayed on the collectors base include:\u00a0 The Snub-Nosed Monkey, Tasmanian Devil and Python each have articulated lower jaws. The Allosaurus, California Condor, Canada Goose, and Kangaroo have fused lower jaws. The Bull and Reindeer have no lower jaw. BOTTLE STOPPERS We always look to our Kickstarter campaigns as a way to introduce new products with the Fire & Bone aesthetic, \u00a0and we are very excited to present our new skull Bottle Stoppers and Wine Glass Charms! These pieces are made from the same 3D scanning process that we use for our jewelry. They are made in the USA from lead-free pewter and are then plated in rhodium to give high strength and a high-luster shine. These bar accessories make great gifts and are guaranteed to be a conversation starter at your next get together! The introductory bottle stoppers available in this campaign are: Raven, Modern Human, and Merino Ram.\u00a0 WINE GLASS CHARMS It's always a nice touch to know whose glass is whose, and what better way to do that than to have your own collection of Skull Wine Glass Charms! The set includes 8 charms on metal hoops designed to fit around any wine glass stem. The charms included are: Velociraptor, Crow, Modern Human, Domestic Cat, Crocodile, Merino Ram, Coyote, and Triceratops. We continue to add to our popular line of skulls adorned with real inset gemstones. These are inspired by our love of geology and mineralogy, and add an eye-catching pop of color and mineral curiosity to our collection. The three new gemstone skulls are; the Bighorn Sheep, the Great Blue Heron, and the Domestic Cat. Each is adorned with one of four colorful stones to choose from. GEMSTONE OPTIONS We are excited to offer 3 new pairs of earrings for this collection; the Nile Crocodile, the Crow, and the Coyote. At about 10-15mm long, our skull earrings are tiny tiny versions of our already tiny skulls, and they still manage to retain that amazing Fire & Bone detail. Each earring species is also available as a pendant on our web store. Our process begins with digital scans of real animal skulls, which we scale down and then optimize for 3D printing. This digital miniaturization process is designed to retain an unprecedented amount of detail from the original specimen. To make the final pieces, we reproduce the miniature model in wax with a professional level high-resolution 3D printer. With our wax model we make a primary mold which allows us to cast the skulls in any metal using traditional lost-wax casting. We continue to work with a family owned foundry in the U.S. with decades of experience producing large production runs of small delicate pieces.\u00a0 MADE IN THE USA! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u00a0\u2022 WE SHIP WORLDWIDE! \ud83c\udf0d If you'd like to pledge for multiple reward tiers, simply add up the total amount to cover each reward that you would like (but just select one reward at checkout). After the campaign, we will send you a survey where you can tell us exactly which items you would like. For example, if you would like 1 skull pendant and 1 pair of skull earrings, pledge $65 ($35 + $30), but select just the \"1 SKULL PENDANT + CHAIN\" reward at checkout, and then add the cost of shipping when prompted based on your location. We'll get your skull species and metal choices and shipping information after the campaign. You will also have the opportunity to add items to your order after the campaign through BackerKit, including pieces from our previous campaigns! We'll ship everything together, which is especially useful for international backers. We launched our very first campaign on Kickstarter in 2013 and we\u2019ve been making these tiny skulls ever since! \u00a0With Kickstarter, we get to test demand for new pieces, and we have a great platform for communicating with fans. If this campaign is successful, we will be able to keep acquiring more hard-to-get skulls for our collection and building this project together with you. If you missed our previous campaigns, those collections are now available on our site - www.fireandbone.com. We now have over 80 species, and we're excited to continue to add more!\u00a0 Even though we have made some great steps since we first launched \u2013 you may see Fire & Bone pieces sold at your favorite natural history museum or oddity shop :) \u2013 we still primarily do this as a passion. Kickstarter lets us find people who share that passion. Here are a few of the nice things people have said about our tiny animal skulls: \"I received my skulls and I just wanted to say that I'm still impressed every time I look at them.

With nothing more than a few dollars to his name and a bootleg Walkman, Sam began his career by selling electronics door to door in New York. What began as a humble career in electronics laid the foundation for Axel Audio years later. After working in electronics for almost 30 years, Sam saw an opportunity to change the way high quality audio products are made. He enlisted his son and daughter, Kevin and Samantha, to help him actualize his dream. The combination of Sam's innovative drive, Kevin's passion for songwriting and Samantha's eye for design forged a highly creative and strong familial foundation to build upon. This is how Axel began. Now, we're turning to you, the Kickstarter community to help transform what began as our passion into a reality. \u00a0Kevin Kevin joined Axel after graduating from Dartmouth and working at GE Capital and AGC Partners. He's a singer-songwriter with a passion for sound, who now leads Axel. Sam Arriving to the U.S. with very little to his name, sold electronics door to door in New York before eventually founding and leading a multinational consumer electronics corporation. He then started Axel. Vera A lead product designer at a leading electronics company for almost a decade and principal at Design Continuum, with many awards and recognition from the CE industry. Samantha Also a Dartmouth graduate, a creative with a love for all things related to storytelling who is Axel\u2019s creative director. Sal Lead Package Designer that has worked with several well-known brand licenses for the gaming, consumer electronics and mobile accessories industry over a decade. Our initial goal of $180,000 is the cost to create tooling. Our manufacturing partner is one of the largest and leading OEM headphones manufacturers, with over 20 years of experience building high quality audio products.\u00a0We began working with them in April 2014 and they have been intensively involved in all facets of our development. We wanted to ensure reliability before bringing our project to you, not only as an idea, but as a rigorously researched, tested, and now near production ready product. We\u2019re on track to ship your headphones to you in just a little over 2 months. Our tooling cost is generally more expensive than that of a typical headphone manufacturer. Here's why: 1. The nature of our fully collapsible and interchangeable design, requires us to create completely original tooling molds for all of their smaller components.\u00a0 2. Each of our six unique drivers requires its own tooling, while other parts like the silicon inserts, involve a more specialized process.\u00a0 3. Together with our manufacturer, we are working around the clock to insure the highest level of tooling quality, quality control, manufacturing workmanship, and above all else, audio engineering. We have bigs plans for the future of Axel Audio. Pending on Kickstarter funding, we hope to:\u00a0 StupidDope This brilliant and custom feel is something to be seen and is sure to be something you need in your life.

Apre\u0300s cinq courts-me\u0301trages, c'est ma premie\u0300re incursion dans un registre plus l\u00e9ger et cocasse. Je suis tre\u0300s curieux d\u2019expe\u0301rimenter, de chercher le bon ton, avec un dispositif ou\u0300 les personnages sont au centre.\nJ'ai souhait\u00e9 tourner tr\u00e8s vite, dans mon immeuble, avec ma fille, Lily, cinq mois.\u00a0Je ne souhaitais pas passer par un financement classique, trop long, afin de ne pas rater cet a\u0302ge.\u00a0 La mise en sce\u0300ne est axe\u0301e essentiellement sur elle, ses re\u0301actions, et sur le personnage de Paul, leur alchimie, leur monde a\u0300 eux ; quitte a\u0300 avoir par moment les dialogues des personnages secondaires en off.\u00a0Dans cette optique, nous avons tourn\u00e9 en \u00e9quipe l\u00e9g\u00e8re : en lumie\u0300re naturelle, un cadreur, un inge\u0301nieur du son et un perchman, quelques heures par jour, sur une semaine, au rythme du be\u0301be\u0301. J'ai confi\u00e9 le ro\u0302le de Paul a\u0300 Se\u0301bastien Chassagne, r\u00f4le qu'il m'a fait l'honneur d'accepter. S\u00e9bastien a une grande sensibilite\u0301 et un sens inne\u0301 du rythme, de la re\u0301partie. Il m\u2019e\u0301pate par son intelligence, sa cre\u0301ativite\u0301, son aisance. Il parvient a\u0300 cre\u0301er des moments de complicite\u0301 avec le be\u0301be\u0301, tout en passant facilement vers un registre plus dramatique. Nous avons la chance de rassembler autour de lui un tr\u00e8s beau casting, Sabrina Seyvecou est Agathe, la compagne de Paul ; Audrey Giacomini est Camille, sa meilleure amie ; Isa Mercure est Marie-France, sa belle-m\u00e8re ; Didier Niverd est Pascal, son beau-p\u00e8re ; Odile Grandchamps est Mme Vivien, une dame de la PMI et Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jaquin est M. Brunel, le voisin. L'\u00e9quipe technique n'est pas en reste, avec Alexandre Andrillon et Guillaume Pellerin au son, Marion Le Guevel et Sabine Harosteguy \u00e0 la mise en sc\u00e8ne et \u00e0 la logistique. Le sc\u00e9nario a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit avec l'aide de Rachid Adjelout. Nous avons \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent besoin de votre soutien, \u00e0 tous, pour mener ce projet \u00e0 son terme et l'amener en festival et en t\u00e9l\u00e9vision.\u00a0La postproduction a besoin de nombreuses \u00e9tapes et moyens pour optimiser les moments que nous sommes parvenus a\u0300 capter.\u00a0 Merci de votre attention et de votre soutien.\u00a0 Eric du Bellay En bonus, la premi\u00e8re sc\u00e8ne du sc\u00e9nario : 1. EXT. Bord du bassin de la Villette Paris \u2013 JOUR Paul, la trentaine, des lunettes de soleil sur les yeux, est assis sur une chaise pliante\nbasse, au soleil, au bord du canal. Il dort.\u00a0 C\u2019est le matin to\u0302t. Il n\u2019y a pas grand monde : quelques joggeurs, une personne a\u0302ge\u0301e avec son chien, un couple qui le de\u0301visage en passant...\u00a0 A co\u0302te\u0301 de lui, un transat avec Lou, 5 mois, qui elle ne dort pas.\u00a0Elle fixe attentivement deux canards qui attendent patiemment devant eux.\u00a0 Lou jette son doudou, a\u0300 l\u2019attention des canards.\u00a0Le plouf re\u0301veille Paul.\u00a0 Paul :\u00a0Oh non... Lou, c\u2019est ton Doudou, c\u2019est Me\u0301dusor... T\u2019es relou, c\u2019est le troisie\u0300me... Va le chercher maintenant...Ah bah c\u2019est con, tu peux pas... Va falloir que t\u2019assumes un peu plus tes actes... Le be\u0301be\u0301 fixe son pe\u0300re avec attention puis tend les mains, enthousiaste. Me\u0301dusor a e\u0301loigne\u0301 les canards.

STRETCH GOALS announced!!!\u00a0 Thanks for visiting our campaign! We're raising funds to complete the AWARD-WINNING web series, THE ROOM ACTORS: WHERE ARE THEY NOW?! Please help us finish the full HILARIOUS 10-episode season!   Our mockumentary follows 7 out of 9 of the ORIGINAL ACTORS from The Room as they struggle with embracing or shaking the stigma of appearing in what Entertainment Weekly called, \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies.\"\u00a0 Hopefully, you've already seen the first 4 side-splitting episodes of THE ROOM ACTORS: WHERE ARE THEY NOW (TRAWATN)? Available on Funny or Die\u00a0(FOD) and YouTube (and coming to Amazon's FOD channel soon)!\u00a0 The Room Actors: Where Are They Now? was \"top-of-the-feed\" on Funny or Die for 4 weeks straight with over 80% funny ratings AND it garnered hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube within a few weeks of launch!\u00a0 TRAWATN traveled to film festivals around the world, winning tons of awards and accolades. Aww, shucks - you like it, you really really like it!! Not only is the series fun and chock full of jokes designed for YOU die-hard Roomies, it also it includes lots of laughs for those of you who have never seen The Room. Hold on. Who the hell are we? In short, we're 7 actors from so-bad-it's-amazing cult film THE ROOM. Have you heard of THE DISASTER ARTIST with James Franco? We're the actors who were in the ORIGINAL movie, The Room - the cult masterpiece that spawned the book, The Disaster Artist, which became an Oscar-nominated major motion picture. I played \u201cMichelle,\u201d the best friend of the main character in The Room. Juliette Danielle (Lisa), Philip Haldiman (Denny), Carolyn Minnot (Claudette), Dan Janjigian (Chris-R), Kyle Vogt (Peter), Greg Ellery (Steven) and I star in the first 4 episodes of The Room Actors: Where Are They Now (TRAWATN)? ALL of us are BACK and will appear in the next 6 wacky episodes of TRAWATN! We can't wait to share new episodes with you!!\u00a0 We have 6 more episodes left to FINISH THE SERIES! The goal we set for this project ($12,500) is the MINIMUM we need to make 2 more episodes. If we hit our MINIMUM GOAL, please keep donating! For every additional $7,000 we raise, we'll add one more hilarious episode.\u00a0\u00a0We need\u00a0$42,000 to finish all 6 remaining episodes\u00a0in our 10-episode WEB SERIES! People often ask us whether we make money off our participation in \u201cThe Room.\u201d And the answer is NO. (I mean, it\u2019s yes, but not like you\u2019re thinking. We each made a few hundred dollars shooting The Room back in 2002 and that was it. We\u2019ve spent it. It\u2019s gone.)  Unlike big name Hollywood actors, we are basically regular Joes and Josephinas. We don\u2019t have a reserve of cash set aside for making films and we don't have easy access to financiers with gobs of money! (If you do, please let us know, though -- we LOVE having Executive Producers!) When it comes down to it, this project is all about you, our fans. YOU decide HOW MANY EPISODES we do! If you fund us, we\u2019ll do it! If we hit our minimum goal and you want more episodes, continue to support us and spread the word and we'll make more!\u00a0 In short, we can't do it without your backing. We\u2019re pretty much begging. That\u2019s OK. After being in The Room, it\u2019s not like we have a ton of pride. WHY??? WHY LISA WHY...ARE WE DOING THIS?\u00a0 We knew when we filmed THE ROOM 15 years ago, it wouldn\u2019t win any awards. But we had no idea that it would eventually be known as \u201cthe Citizen Kane of bad movies,\u201d and ultimately spawn an Oscar nominated film! But when the world is laughing at you, what do you do? You laugh right along with them. Otherwise, you find yourself crying into your goblet of wine at night and no one wants that.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we created this series for YOU, the fans!\u00a0We, the Room actors, absolutely LOVE the fans. The jokes and Easter eggs in the series are designed especially for YOU! I guess we realized\u00a0that we really like making you laugh. Sure, Juliette beats Room fan zero Michael Rousselet on a regular basis...\u00a0 BUUUUUT we\u2019ve been to numerous Room screenings in Los Angeles, and we\u2019ve never met a funnier, wittier, more intellectual group of film fanatics. From SPOOOOONS to the football gags to the way you\u2019ve made \u201coh hai\u201d an inside joke for the ages, Room fans are awesome. So we made something to celebrate that...AND\u00a0we need your help to finish it! Awww, we love you for that! Thanks so much for being a part of our Roomie family, because we can\u2019t make the remaining episodes a reality without your help. But we want to make sure it\u2019s good for you too, so we\u2019ve got a lot of fun rewards planned out. Take a look at what YOU can get! \u00a0Great question!

  "Hello! My name is Kati Skelton and I am a filmmaker living in Brooklyn, NY. I have made a handful of comedic shorts, a couple of which you can check out below! One is called DOOR ON THE LEFT, which premiered at the Maryland Film Festival in 2016, and another is called BUSINESS, which premiered at Slamdance Film Festival in 2017. Vimeo was nice enough to give them both Staff Picks, and Business was recently featured on Short of the Week! Last year I also made an infomercial for Adult Swim called WET SHAPES, which you can check out on their website.\u00a0 Most everything I've made I've worked on with a very close group of friends in Brooklyn, who are a bunch of beautiful geniuses. So when I started talking about a new script I wrote, they all banded together and knew what they had to do: kidnap me, hold me hostage, and force me to make the movie for their own sick pleasure. They've been keeping me in a basement, depriving me of food and water, and forcing me to work endlessly on preproduction efforts, all so that they can get their horrible rocks off collaborating on the movie. They hover above me as I type this. And while I am truly passionate about the movie and am so excited to make it, I also crave the daylight and fresh air, to which I haven't been exposed for several weeks. By donating to this campaign, you will not only help us make the film, but you will also help me get out of this basement--in one piece, I hope! Pots N' Tots is a short film about two ceramicists, Margot and Billy, who are collaborators and lovers. They work at a studio called Pots N' Tots, which is a kind of pottery studio slash daycare center with a laissez faire attitude towards childcare. But one day, they find out that the board of the studio wants to split them up. Margot suddenly must confront her artistic jealousies of her partner, but the question is: does the studio really have their best interests in mind, or is something sinister bubbling beneath the surface? It's a tale of jealousy, competition, and artistic sabotage. But it's also a story of redemption and forgiveness. It's very silly and serious at the same time, and if we don't raise enough money to make the movie, they may not let me out of here alive.\u00a0 Pots N' Tots will star Ruby McCollister (Neighborhood Food Drive) and Andrew Ryder (Lace Crater). We are still in the midst of casting several other starring roles! Debbie Fong, Chris Osborn, and Breanne Thomas are producing, Daniel Johnson is behind the camera, and Allistair Johnson will be doing production sound. Debbie Fong and Brad Johnson will be doing art! The gang is truly all here, down in this basement, where they punish me for not having raised the funds yet. Your donations will be used to secure locations, pay for production design, camera and lighting equipment, production insurance, transportation, food, and postproduction services like a sound mix, color, and VFX. The shoot will take place over six days, two of which we've somehow already shot! But we still have the most complicated scenes ahead, which include 12 actors, an awards ceremony, a Rapscallion, and a dream sequence involving Three Strange Guys. We've only just begun, and we need your help to make it a reality!  We're shooting the movie in bits in pieces in order to accommodate everyone's schedules on such a low budget. We shot the first two days in April, and then will shoot the rest of the movie between May and June, with post production taking place through the rest of the summer. Our hope is that the movie will be finished by the end of September!",
  "The Antelope Magazine is an exciting new literary magazine from the minds of Elisa Shoenberger and Meghan McGrath. The magazine brings together our varied interests in oral histories, eclectic information, beautiful photography, snarky bird cartoons, and paper airplanes. The first issue is centered around the theme of Flight and where it takes us. We have oral histories with pilots, beekeepers, street artists, articles about zeppelin disasters and urban wildlife projects, poetry and even...storigami! The magazine takes its name from Suzanne Briet\u2019s \u201cWhat is Documentation?\u201d (1951) that expands the notion of what a document can be or what can be archived. As part of this project, we wanted to explore a single theme in as many different styles of writing/photography/drawing and modes of creation as possible. The money we raise from this Kickstarter will be used to pay for the printing of the magazine, any shipping costs related to the magazine, and the supporter benefits. As editors, we volunteer our time and expertise in the hope of bringing a bright (and ridiculous) new magazine to the world. In addition to having a varied theme, we at The Antelope Magazine are committed to paying our contributors. We value them as artists, historians, creators, etc., and are excited to support the work they do. Proceeds over our Kickstarter goal will be going to pay our contributors more.  Do you do creative work? Check out The Antelope and consider submitting to our forthcoming issue! Our theme is \"Code\" and we welcome contributions from\u00a0writers, oral historians, short story writers, poets, cartoonists, and more. Bring us your FORTRAN, your Bacon ciphers, and your runic alphabets! (Anyone want to write an article in Klingon?) About The Editors Elisa Shoenberger is an academic out of the academy. She has a BA in Latin American history from the University of Chicago, a MA in Latin American, Caribbean, and Iberian Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and an MBA from Loyola University.

She has been interviewing women in the arts in Chicago for her book while working on this magazine. She can\u2019t stop interviewing people.  Meghan McGrath collects accordions and hangs out with them in Poughkeepsie, New York. She works as an ethnographer with mainframe cryptography folks and edits for Narrative magazine. She has an MA in Folklore and MS in Informatics, neither of which sound like real things. Previously, she worked for the Poetry Foundation, the Alan Lomax Archives at the Library of Congress, the Studs Terkel Collection, the Art Institute of Chicago, and elsewhere. Her main goal in life is to befriend a wombat and learn how to beatbox (in that order).

  "Hello! Thanks for visiting my Kickstarter, and supporting THE VARSITY ENTERTAINMENT CONCERT SERIES. I'm Julius Rowe, a promoter from Newnan, GA (appx 40 mins south of Atlanta, GA). I have been in the marketing/promotion business for 10+ years. I have coordinated 20+ event featuring celebrities and artist and have been the head of a countless number of events.\u00a0 For years I have worked under someone. I would book artist/celebrities\u00a0for different venues. The venue would handle the overhead for each event. Ex.: celebrity/artist fee, marketing/promotion tools, and everything needed for the event to go smoothly. Once these event were over, I would only receive 20% max of the proceeds....when the sponsor/venue would pocket thousands of dollars off my ideas, connections in the industry, and hard work. With your help, I WILL BECOME MY OWN BOSS!!!! I will be able to book a venue and artist the day my Kickstarter ends, for a show that will be August 19th, 2017.\u00a0These concerts will be held in the growing city of Newnan, GA in a newly built event center. At this time it, the market is very small, but is wide open....I HAVE NO COMPETITION! SO IT'S NOW OR NEVER.",
  "\u201cBlue: In My Feelings\u201d is a project that really just started out with me venting and expressing my thoughts through spoken word, and it eventually took on a life of its own. For me, writing serves as a creative and therapeutic outlet for my frustrations, my worries, my aspirations, and my goals. I love the freedom that writing and spoken word offers, and I love music, itself; so it only made sense to somehow find a way to combine the two. I have dealt with a lot in the past and in the present. Being diagnosed with depression and moving through life gets difficult. There are days when I question if there is even a reason to live. Over the past few years, I have tried to immerse myself with school and with clubs that focused on things that I thought that I cared about and conversed with people whom I thought shared my same interests and passions. Realizing that I was doing nothing more than going through the motions left me at a point where I was more lost than ever. Writing and music have helped me in ways that a doctor\u2019s medication never could, and it inspires me to move forward and get the most out of life. \u201cIn my feelings\u201d is the first project in which I have truly made not only out of the interests of others but for myself, as well. I hope you will enjoy this project as much as I've enjoyed the process of getting to this step in its creation.",
  "My name is Ray Harry and I am a songwriter, producer and a multi-musician. I specialize in alternative r&b, instrumental music and cinematic music. My dream is to be able to make a living doing what I do best which is make music. I been actively pursuing a career for many years but yet to achieve the break I need to become a professional musician. What I have accomplished over the years is vast amount of knowledge about composition, songwriting, producing. I have written many songs in my makeshift recording studio when I was located in Brooklyn then in 2005 I re-located to Connecticut. Over the years I amassed a catalogue of songs which is presented on my Bandcamp page. My music is released under my record label Lighthouse Music Grp. Although I released a steady stream of music the ability to promote and market has hindered its success because of lack of funding.\u00a0 In 2017 my home in Stratford Connecticut was foreclosed forcing me to put my equipment in storage therefore currently I do not have facilities to record the way I would like to. I do have my guitar and laptop so I sketch out my pre-production demos. I have a new collection of acoustic guitar demoed songs that will be produced into the new album.  I am seeking funding so I can properly record, produce, market and promote this album.In this difficult time I feel a sense of urgency to make this project work and push me into professional status. To all who donate to this project I give my most sincerest thanks. Links to my previous work can be found here https://lighthousemusicgrp.bandcamp.com/",
  "Introducing: an app that helps solves one of the biggest challenges we all have everyday: what shall I eat today?\u00a0 I would like to raise funds for marketing, licensing and to hire a programmer to help me create the app that helps you decide what to eat and make healthy choices while saving money! I am a foodie and love to cook - all my friends and family always compliment me on my cooking so I want to share my recipes with the world! Users can also share their recipes in this foodie community.

  "We are doing the Young Enterprise college program through our college. Together with eight others I have created a website and recipe book to help the younger generation of the U.K learn how to cook fresh at home and with economic sense and great flavor. Our varied diet plan and book showcases numerous different recipes which are easy to make and have great nutritional values. We want more people to jump on board with this movement and with the funding they give, expand ourselves to the wider community.\u00a0\u00a0",
  "Why are we doing this book? Popular demand. We are a family of four. Our annual \"cookie list\" starts with 4 choices per person plus six standards \"for the house.\" Do the math. Then add in all the partial batches for particular favorites that didn't make this year's cut, and whatever new one Scott discovered and simply has to try. (Experiments don't count as cheating, you see). Check us out on\u00a0 www.heritagecookies.net! My husband's passion for heritage cookies goes back to when I was nineteen and brought him home for the first time. My mother followed the Czech tradition and made 8 or 10 different cookies each Christmas. He saw that tray and declared, \"This is a Good Thing.\" When we began to make our own Christmas, Scott began to explore the world of Czech baking. And then he proceeded to broaden our baking repertoire with 30 years of constant research and testing. There are hundreds - thousands! - of incredible bakers who create new cookies every year, but we are more drawn by the ones with history and stories behind them. I am a first generation immigrant to America, and one of the things you miss are the special treats of your culture and childhood. Those are the ones we wanted: the cookies that immigrants from whatever culture would swoon for when the old flavors showed up. And the emigres from America too. North America has cookie traditions of its own, and we wanted to find those as well. National cookies like Chocolate Chips, and American regional favorites like Snickerdoodles and Buckeyes too! Thirty-[mumble] years later we have a pattern. We make our 2-3 dozen cookies each Christmas. We keep a tithe of each for the family. We get the rest of them out of the house, to friends, family, coworkers, clients, and anyone who's done us a favor over the years. And then we promise, \"Yes, someday we'll write a book...\"  We love sharing our cookies. But we also want to keep that promise to our friends, and to share our passion for great, timeless cookies with you and with the rest of the world. As we write this we are planning on 150 recipes or so, the vast majority of which we've already tested and written up. For the rest we are still baking, testing and re-baking. And then we'll have to bake old standards too, to get them professionally photographed.  Our photographer, a lovely mother of two charming girls, has been squeezing us in between her professional magazine shoots. We would like to do right by her and make sure she gets paid. Lemon cookies only go so far (Yes Laura, we have discovered your secret!) The same goes for the graphic artist responsible for the book's layout, and for our videographer. There is much more to creating a first class cookbook than having first class recipes. This is where you come in. We have all the material we need to publish a lovely, unique cookbook of classic heritage cookies from all over Europe and the Americas. A book that will capture for your home the wonder, warmth and comfort of home-baked cookies and spice-filled air - the scents of home that our ancestors carried in memory as they moved. It will happen if we meet our goals. When this project is done we hope to issue stretch goals to fund other projects, such as a supplement of variations focused on people with food allergies. No nuts? No dairy? No flour? No problem! We want all of our friends to have cookies that are easy, and elegant, and with a bit of effort, even extravagant.\u00a0 We need your help! Please support our effort to publish a quality cookbook and make it available in all standard formats.\u00a0 Thank you, Kate and Scott Pavelle",
  "When her unborn child is diagnosed with Spina Bifida and given a low chance for a healthy birth, Alex decides to have an abortion. What should be a routine procedure becomes infinitely more complex in the state of Texas where by law a funeral must be held for the fetus. The story grew out of a string of articles involving women choosing to undergo abortions after their children were diagnosed with developmental diseases. Spina Bfida came up several times because of how late it is detected, and how uncertain the effects can be (ranging from still birth to mental handicaps to no lasting effect at all). I found an often ignored topic in the abortion conversation which are mothers who expect and are excited to have their babies but do to unforeseen circumstances choose to give them up.\u00a0 I then thought of the laws which were new at the time I wrote the play that required women to hold ceremonies for their remains. I imaged mothers who were recently expecting and are now grieving. I thought of how they were forced to publicly relitigate their choices and buy coffins and write speeches for someone they never met but had really really hoped for.\u00a0 At its core the play is about someone saying goodbye to a loved one. Through the political and medical detail I found I was able to write about the experience because I could write about loss. I think in the discussion of abortion and the discussion of these laws it's important to consider the human aspect, the personal grieving involved, and the emotional toll it takes on the women. With the most recent fetal remains bill being passed only a few months ago in Pennsylvania by male state senator whose wife had passed away, it seemed important for a man to consider another perspective on a less intrusive platform.\u00a0 CASTING | February 1 - 2, \u00a02020 We\u2019re casting the two roles of Alex and Wally. Auditions will be held over two days for non-equity actors at Dixon Place. We'll be posting a link to our casting notice shortly. TABLE WORK | February 5 - 12, \u00a02020 Reading a play is always a good place to start. Table work involves the playwright, director, and actors going over the work together to discuss and discover what the characters want, how they think, and why they are so well written. REHEARSAL | February 13 - 29, \u00a02020 Time to dress up. Rehearsal is where the writer takes a step back giving the actors and directors a chance to finally collaborate and see if they can actually impress him. Rarely does this step go as planned. We'll be rehearsing for the better part of February at experimental theater Dixon Place in the historic Bowery! DESIGN | February 22 - March 3, 2020 Setting and dressing the stage is the difference between a reading in your parents' room with your mean friend Phillip and an actual play that people can watch! The design team attempts to bring what\u2019s on the page into the physical realm, rarely do they have the time or the money necessary to fully realize the work which is why Off Broadway theater is so metaphorical! TECH | March 4, 2020 The tech rehearsal works out out the kinks in sound and lighting. It takes a lot of work to program a lightboard. Although few notice a seamlessly run light board, oh boy do you see when things go wrong. PERFORMANCE |\u00a0March 5, 6 and 8, 2020 Playing at the Hudson Guild Theater in Chelsea during New York Theater Festival's WinterFest.

Across the country abortion rights are in a backslide. These bills are passed quietly in state legislature. In New York City turnout for local elections hovers around 14%. Representation of this issue in art and media brings attention and hopefully action to a point where the average American can make a difference.\u00a0",

  "Hello and good day to all. My name is Lukas and I make guitar pedals. I have years of experience tinkering in the world of electronics but we will get to that later. First, my goal ;) I want to make pedals for a living , eventually. So I decided to start this project a few years back by modifying pedals, that eventually turned to designing pedals. We started the whole Vintage EFX venture with pen and paper. From there it was a while before we had all the parts we needed to finish the prototyper, but with time and well planned purchases we had a working unit. This unit was developed to help ease the creative process without having loose component everywhere. Now we can swap out components without having to inhale flux or solder in extremely tight spots.\u00a0 We were not a big fan of the generic aluminum box so we thought really hard about how we wanted it to look. After much time and consideration, we went with an old school army theme. We have designed and built functional and finished products, just in limited numbers.  All our models are soldered by hand and are wired together on stripboard. Hand assembly is a must with us! The paint is also all done here by hand at Vintage EFX. Why are these pedals different then the thousands of others out there. Well first, the goal is to make a great original product. We do our best to put a Vintage EFX touch to everything we do and try to give you some \"Swiss army knife\" type pedals. \u00a0 BOOST MK3 DEMO BELLOW The saying around here is K.I.S.S.! but give me a few extra knobs or switches to play with. Also so you don't think we stopped after a few designs, here is a quick peak at the MK4, the MK3's much bigger sibling.We are very excited about this product, so are many people that have had the chance to hear it for themselves. It is 99% done, just need some parts to assemble the magnificent beast. (Update!!! The MK4 is available in a very limited quantity as a reward. Only 4 up for grabs at the moment.) \u00a0Now for why you should back vintage EFX. I have years of experience as a guitarist, over 20 years playing.\u00a0 After earning a Diploma in Audio Engineering in 2006 I have worked from the bar shows, conferences, festivals and many studios. I have applied my training and years of experience into the builds I created. I am completely obsessed\u00a0 about anything related to audio, so you know you will get a great product that is sure to last an eternity.  And to finish, a little picture of me and my work buddy. (She is the one in the winter lineup video, that was looking to get attention by squeaking her toys in the background) https://www.facebook.com/Vintageguitareffects Thank you for looking into Vintage EFX.

  "Leo is a mini headphone amplifier that emulates the warm tone of vintage audio equipment. Connect Leo to any smartphone or music player to your favorite headphones to experience the sound that vinyl lovers have been raving about without the expense and hassle. \u00a0How Does it Sound? Leo brings a presence to music, as if listening to a live performance. The tonal quality provides warmth and power while preserving delicate high frequencies. Leo brings out the best performance from any pair of headphones.\u00a0 Leo looks as clean as it sounds.\u00a0Constructed with a rugged extruded aluminum body, CNC carved aluminum knobs, and precision laser cut faceplates available in a choice of black acrylic, walnut veneer, or smooth black leather. Units come standard with soft yellow LED backlighting. Premium units come with UV LED backlighting.\u00a0 Modern audio equipment only delivers audio within a flat and narrow range of tones. Leo delivers a much larger range of frequencies while recreating the exact tonal quality of premium vintage amplifiers.\u00a0While we can\u2019t hear tones below a certain range - we can feel them. The unique tonal curves correct for\u00a0psychoacoustic\u00a0phenomena leading to a sound quality full of\u00a0warmth,\u00a0feeling, and presence. Audio Physical We spent the last year designing Leo from the ground up to deliver you the best audio experience. We started our journey measuring many vintage amplifiers and turntables to discover how they deliver so much character. From there, we engineered equations that modeled the vintage equipment and coded simulations to find the optimal circuit for the sound. The final electronics of Leo are a work of precise calculation optimization and design iteration. We designed an intuitive interface and rugged enclosure to stand the test of time while remaining true to the equipment it emulates.\n We have several full functioning prototypes and are ready to mass produce Leo but need your help to kickstart production! We completed the design phase of our project and started working closely with a US based factory to manufacture Leo. Once funded, we'll kick into high gear with parts acquisition and assisting the fabrication process. Recently I had the pleasure of sitting down with Eric C. Gould of \"Tech View Now\" for an interview about the design process of Leo and a hands (and ears) on demonstration. http://gouldtech.blogspot.com/2015/01/leo-tranforms-your-digital-audio.html Geeky Gagets\u00a0http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/leo-mini-headphone-analog-amplifier-12-01-2015/ Yo Success\u00a0http://www.yosuccess.com/tag/analogartistry/ SakiDori\u00a0http://sakidori.co/article/5771 3c Tech News\u00a0http://3c.technews.tw/2015/01/26/use-leo-play-sounds-like-classical-cds-from-smart-device/ IXBT\u00a0http://www.ixbt.com/news/hard/index.shtml?18/59/66 Tech Bang\u00a0http://www.techbang.com/posts/21928-give-the-warmth-of-vacuum-tubes-and-vinyl-sound Hands on Test \u00a0Interview with the Founder",
  "Hello! I'm Kathleen Jacques, and since 2010 I've been creating a webcomic called Band Vs Band. You can read it here!\u00a0I'm raising funds to make its second book happen, and cover the cost of printing and shipping. Band Vs Band is about two clashing musicians: wholesome do-gooder Honey Hart with her band The Candy Hearts, and bad-girl troublemaker Turpentine with her dirty noisy band The Sourballs. The gals start as enemies and rivals with a secret attraction to each other, but gradually fall in love. It's fun, queer, and retro-inspired, with a distinctive visual style.\u00a0 The Volume 1 book collecting the comic's first three years was a 2015 Lambda Literary Award finalist for LGBT Graphic Novels, and Band Vs Band has also been a finalist in online comics categories for an Autostraddle comics award (2016) and a National Cartoonists Society Reuben award (2017). I've had so much fun sharing these characters and their world with readers, and I've been blown away by the amazing response it's gotten from folks who enjoy it. \u00a0 The comic itself is free to read online, but there's just something special about a physical book. The Volume 1 print book was funded thanks to the generous support of my Kickstarter backers, and now I need your help to print Volume 2! It'll be a 162 page perfect-bound softcover book, professional full-colour offset printing, 7x10 inches (and the format matches Vol. 1, so they'll look nice together on a shelf.) I'm a graphic designer when I'm not making comics, and a huge nerd about making sure these are beautiful books in terms of print quality, layout, and feel. Volume 2 will collect all the Band Vs Band pages from 2014\u2013early 2018. In these comics, Honey and Turpentine struggle to balance their band dreams with job & money problems, persevere through mishaps and injuries, and start to realize what they mean to each other. Plus, there'll be several pages of book-exclusive bonus material & art that won't appear in the web version!\u00a0 It is the second book in an ongoing series with continuity \u2013 but if you like the premise, I think you'll find lots to enjoy here even if you haven't read Volume 1 or the online version of the comic yet. The book is almost complete - the vast majority of it is finished, and I'm currently working hard at finalizing the rest.\u00a0 I'm incredibly excited for this book, and the prospect of seeing it in print \u2013 a lot of work and a lot of love went into it, and I want to share it with all of you. So, what's in it for you, besides a sweet copy of the new book itself for your very own? Guest artists! I am so thrilled to be able to offer a set of art cards with Band Vs Band illustrations by three of my absolute favorite comics artists: Megan Rose \"Rosalarian\" Gedris\u00a0(Meaty Yogurt, Spectacle),\u00a0Nina \"Space Coyote\" Matsumoto\u00a0(Sparks!, Simpsons Comics), and Sf\u00e9 R. Monster\u00a0(Eth's Skin, Beyond Anthology). These are going to be gorgeous 5x7\" prints \u2013 and they're Kickstarter exclusives, so this is your one chance to grab them! Stickers!\u00a0For when you just want to stick the Band Vs Band aesthetic onto every possible surface (Laptops! Sketchbooks! Muscial instruments! Cover the world!) There are two different sticker sheets available in various reward tiers, and they'll both be 4x6\" vinyl with multiple kiss-cut designs to peel off. Meet the band! Heck yeah! I'll draw you hanging out with up to 2 Band Vs Band characters in an in-universe photo that'll appear in the Volume 2 book. These are super limited, and I'm going to make a few available right away, and a few more later in the campaign.\u00a0 If you snag one of these, you'll need to send me a reference photo as soon as possible! You get to pick which characters you meet, and any other requests about this image and how you're portrayed just need to be consistent with the universe/tone/canon of the comic (ie: you need to appear as a human, and my characters all act in-character here)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 There are more cool items included in the reward tiers, including comic page prints, my limited edition risograph mini comics, and having me sign your book and do a sketch on the title page (up to 2 BVB characters of your choice). Check it out! If you'd really like a particular combination of items that isn't specified, please send me a message and I'll confirm how much to add to your pledge to add any non-limited reward onto another tier. All tiers that include a print copy of Volume 2 also get your name on the book's special thank-you page. You'll be immortalized forever! PDF ebook versions of both Band Vs Band volumes are available as digital-only rewards, plus any tier with a print copy of the Volume 2 book also gets you a download of the digital edition. \u00a0Oh wow - the limited tiers are all currently sold out! But if you missed something you wanted, mark your calendar: more spots for some of them are opening on February 28 (tiers with Volume 1) and March 5 (Meet The Band) I want to mostly focus on the Volume 2 book itself; however, If this project exceeds its initial target, I do have one big additional goal: at $20,000, we reprint Band Vs Band Volume 1! There are reward tiers that include both books, but they're limited...and that's because my stock of Volume 1 is pretty low. The first printing was a relatively small quantity \u2013 and I'm delighted that the comic's audience is bigger than I expected, but it also means I'm running out! If we fund Volume 2, but don't make that additional goal, it means reprinting Volume 1 will probably be its own separate campaign at some point in the future, and that book will become scarce and unavailable to buy for a while. (If we DO unlock reprinting Volume 1 this time, it'll become available in unlimited reward tiers) Besides the big reprint, more funding above the initial target also means that I'll be able to print a higher quantity of Volume 2, and that I may be able to add some cool upgrades to certain rewards \u2013 but the first priority is reaching that first goal to make Volume 2 happen.\u00a0 Special thanks to: my amazing guest artists, and all of you who've followed the comic over the years and been so incredibly enthusiastic and supportive!Video music track: \"Silver\" by Riot / Youtube Audio Library",
  "Last year, Bored Panda did a feature on me, and since then, my book started to sell. As a result, I feel this is the perfect time to print a sequel. Since volume 2 is nearly identical to volume one, I know exactly how much this project is going to cost.Therefore, I am asking the Internet for 6000 dollars. This money will be used for printing, shipping from China, import fees, packaging, postage to backers, and Kickstarter's processing fee. When I estimated costs, I estimated conservatively, so that I don't get stung.Last, if you are reading this, thank you. It means you are thinking of backing my book. C'mon! Do it! It's twenty bucks and it means a lot to me!THANK YOU! \u00a0",
  "\"The joy of being an independent artist 101.\"\u00a0 Class is now in session. With being an independent artist definitely come some good, and of course some bad as well. On one hand you have freedom, independence, creative control, full insight to all money made, and spent, ownership of your masters, and so many other amazing perks. The list truly goes on. Your moves are yours to make. You're the controller of your destiny.\u00a0 \"The pain of being an independent artist 101.\"\u00a0On the other end weighing in is the bad. The biggest burden being the financial aspect. SIGH!!! I think that all independent artist would agree that, that's the biggest issue faced. When one has extremely big dreams and, larger than life goals but lacks the financial resources to accomplish said goals that can be pretty stressful to say the least.\u00a0 \u00a0\"How can you help? | Where is your money going?\"\u00a0Here's where you all come in. I'm ready to record a 5 song extended play. More commonly known simply as an EP. In total I'm in need of $3,800. This total will cover production cost, recording expenses, and mixing / mastering. All other expenses will come out of my pocket. Cost for advertising & promotion, photo shoots, the EP release, and so on will all come out of my pocket. Currently I already have the people in which I'd like to work with on the creation of this project in place and on board. It's now time to get the financial aspect of things figured out. Every donation helps and means a great deal. Thank you all for your time. Hopefully you'll see fit to help me accomplish my goal in getting one step closer to making this more than just a dream. \u00a0What type of music are you investing in?\u00a0As an artist I am inspired by all genres of music. I feel as though when you limit yourself musically you're only doing yourself a disservice. If I had to categorize myself I'd label myself R&B/Hip-Hop. However realistically I love to infuse many different genres in my music. However, rather it be R&B, Hip-Hop, Rock, Pop; one thing that remains a huge priority in my book musically is lyrical content. Music is a universal language, a inspiration, a mental investment. Music is more than just a sound. That's why if nothing else lyricism is a major factor in my music. So by investing in me you're investing in more than just a nice beat and a catchy punchline. Thank you all for your time and hopefully you'll see fit to back me. Take care. <3 -Steffan \u00a0",

ARCHT\nOne is also designed to sound acoustically perfect, regardless of where you put\nit in the room. ARCHT One\u2019s stunning design architecture incorporates years\nof acoustic research resulting in the creation of our groundbreaking Sound\nArray technology.\u00a0 ARCHT\nOne represents\u00a0a\u00a0symbiotic relationship between function and design\nthat will transform homes into elegant concert halls with the music quality to\nmatch. Many speakers claim to provide true surround sound in a single device. However, speakers are directional by nature and they sound best when listening from a specific point. Adding multiple speakers does not change this reality and can\u00a0cause distortion and inconsistent audio quality. ARCHT One is a true omni-directional speaker with a built in sub-woofer ARCHT\nOne solves this problem with its patented Sound\nArray technology: the only one of its kind. It only uses 3 speakers \u2013 a\nfull range driver for the mids and highs, a sub-woofer and passive radiator for the bass. Each of these speakers are equipped with a Sound Array module,\nwhich transforms the speakers from directional to omnidirectional. The result is\nconsistent, distortion free audio which redefines the meaning of surround sound\n- it\u2019s truly amazing. ARCHT One adapts to its surroundings A first of its kind, dynamic audio optimization allows ARCHT One to adapt to its surroundings. Our custom ARCHT Audio application gives smartphone users the power to optimize the ARCHT One\u2019s sound\u00a0based upon the space in which it is being used.\u00a0With the app, ARCHT One will always be tuned to your environment, ensuring you get the best audio experience wherever you are. ARCHT One supports Multi- Zone over WiFi Up to 6 ARCHT One speakers can also be connected over AirPlay, either in the same room or in multiple rooms, giving listeners a complete home audio experience. \n\n\u00a0 ARCHT One can be connected in True Stereo with Bluetooth Pairing For those who live by true stereo sound, 2 ARCHT Ones can be paired together in the same room over bluetooth for double the experience! With ARCHT One, you can once again hear each beat and lyric the musician intended it as the speaker delivers the quality of live performances straight to your living room. We intentionally crafted ARCHT One to be aesthetically-appealing and produce sound quality that is all-encompassing. ARCHT One will provide a definitive home audio experience with high-resolution sound and modern design for a more immersive and personal audio experience.\u00a0 Our dream began in 2011 when a car audio\nveteran\u00a0from Singapore\u00a0invented the\u00a0Sound Array, with the vision of transforming how speakers\nare 'seen' and 'heard'. He started out with high end systems but soon realized\nthat while bigger may be better; the ultimate speaker is not all about raw\npower, but about the overall user experience. From the first purchase, opening the box, speaker set up and daily use - enjoying high end audio should not be a\ncomplicated process.\u00a0 He\u00a0teamed\nup with an acoustic expert and industry veteran in the US, with the aim of\ndeveloping a speaker that would look fantastic, sound awesome and be extremely\neasy for anyone to setup and use. We displayed hand-crafted prototypes at CES 2014 earlier this year to test this hypothesis. At CES, the team\u00a0received great feedback from technology and design communities. After the event, we knew we were on to something. The ARCHT One project is 3 years in the making. With your support, we can take the ARCHT One from Prototype to Production,\u00a0and launch in a city near you.\u00a0",
  "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to come to my Kickstarter page and watch my video.\u00a0 My name is Tania Amsel, I am the writer & performer and Blood Orange, my new one-woman play that explores themes of love, loss and childhood trauma through the eyes of a junior doctor in A&E at Christmas time! You can be a part of Blood Orange's success by becoming a supporter and donating to this kickstarter campaign today! \u00a0Check out the\u00a0Blood Orange Website for more details.\u00a0 \u00a0(Photo by: Photography by Mildred) Written and Performed by Tania Amsel Directed by Hamish MacDougall The Old Red Lion Theatre, London, 10th December 2019 \u2013 4th January 2020 BUY TICKETS HERE: https://www.oldredliontheatre.co.uk/blood-orange.html It\u2019s Christmas Eve in Swansea A&E and Amy has just vomited all over a hot doctor\u2019s shoes. Amy is not a patient at the hospital. She\u2019s a junior doctor. Hoping to secure a transfer to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, Amy can handle the long hours, the overtime, and even the shame of vomiting on her colleague, but when assigned to the case of a boy with cancer, Amy is confronted with childhood memories she thought she\u2019d forgotten and the pressure begins to take its toll. When helping others is at the heart of your career, what happens when you are suddenly the one that needs help?\u00a0 In 2016 I read a survey by Mind in which nearly 90% of NHS primary care workers surveyed found their work life stressful, with 1 in 5 saying it has led them to develop a mental health problem. The figures stunned me, as I'm sure it does you, and was one of the reasons I felt compelled to write Blood Orange. Since then I have done more research into NHS and mental health, in particular Junior Doctors and the pressure of a job where you\u2019re giving 100% of yourself, rescuing sick people who are at their most vulnerable, emotionally and physically. All that \u2018giving\u2019 coupled with the negative stories in the press, takes its toll on medical staff which is what\u2019s highlighted in Blood Orange. The other important topic in the play is cancer and I wanted to emphasise the longer term effect a serious illness can have on loved ones and family. That\u2019s absolutely not to say this a play is without humour and laugh out loud moments because, as in life, the darker times intertwine with the funny, silly moments which in a strange way makes us feel more alive.\n\n\u2018The NHS will last as long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it\u2019. I wanted to write a story from the perspective of one person, Amy, as an example of the thousands working in the NHS. By making it personal and relatable, the audience join in Amy\u2019s journey exploring her past which is inextricably linked to her stressful life in a hospital A&E department and what the future may look like.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0The idea of Amy\u2019s story has actually been with me for much longer: a strong sister bond and losing someone very dear; that\u2019s a good start for a heartfelt story, added to this a below the radar struggle with my own mental health and the compulsion to write this play in this way was inevitable.\n\n \u00a0I hope Amy will convey the feistiness she feels yet her vulnerability is what makes her strong to do her job and live her life with all its highs and lows. Our aim is to make an amazing memorable play that speaks to the senses:\n\nTo HEAR not only Amy\u2019s words but also a soundscape of hospital confusion, London madness, and get a glimpse inside Amy\u2019s head where there\u2019s love, guilt, grief and relief followed by big Christmas fun!\n\nTo SEE the visual effects that create an atmosphere both in the hospital, in London and also inside Amy\u2019s head.\n\nTo SMELL (imagination!) the Hospital but also Amy\u2019s fear of discovering something is very wrong with her sister.\n\nTo FEEL Amy\u2019s determination and wavering, her feistiness and vulnerability, her loss and discovery, and ultimately her relief and letting go....

  "Natalie Riess is raising funds to print a complete 2 volume collection of the fantasy webcomic Snarlbear. Snarlbear tells the journey of Daisy, a young girl pulled from Earth into the Rainbow Dimension, where she learns the value of friendship and monster punching. The webcomic can be read online here and is part of Hiveworks. Snarlbear is a dark fantasy adventure following the exploits of Daisy Snarlbear, a girl exploring a brightly colored, monster-infested otherworldly land called the Rainbow Dimension.\u00a0 Daisy finds her place in this unforgiving polychrome hellscape as a monster fighter for hire, but soon becomes embroiled in a royal unicorn coup, a quest for a magical eyeball, and a journey that reveals that the most dangerous monsters may have been the ones inside her all along. Volume one includes chapters one through six, outlining Daisy\u2019s introduction to the Rainbow Dimension and rise to fame (or infamy) as a monster hunter. Volume two includes chapters seven through ten, in which Daisy and friends deal with a mysterious crystal menace and the consequences of helping an exiled unicorn prince. Traditionally inked and digitally painted, Snarlbear is heavy on dreamlike, fantastic imagery with searing experimental color palettes, creature designs and action sequences with a dash of friendship and fantasy drama.\u00a0 The webcomic ran online for 5 years (2012-2017). \u00a0 The Complete Comic collection of Snarlbear is a matching set of books covering all 10 chapters of the comic, plus all the watercolor chapter covers, an epilogue, and bonus content! The books are standard graphic novel size (6\u201dx9\u201d) and are both around 190 pages. Pages have been reformatted from their original web RGB to CMYK for print. A few pages have been redrawn and corrected. A decorative page border has been added for additional magical flair and to give the collection a sense of unity. The books will also feature bonus content such as Rainbow Dimension Map endpapers, concept art, sketches, world building appendixes, illustrations and more! The collection is ideal for both fans of the webcomic and new readers. It can be enjoyed by teens and older readers, especially those who like unicorns! \u00a0 Obviously there\u2019s no point in an adventure without treasure! Backers of the project have the option of choosing one in many tiers. Here are the ones available: Among the physical rewards offered with the books, we have stickers, gorgeous prints of original watercolor art done exclusively for the Kickstarter, and a Dragon Flint enamel pin! \u00a0 The rewards are designed to be \"pocket sized\" to match the book formats and keep production simple, so we can focus on the books. \u00a0 If we reach our goal to the Complete Collection, we have exciting stretch goals to add to the project! The mystery of each amount shall be revealed as we reach those milestones. The bigger the treasure hoard grows, the more beautiful the books shall be! Snarlbear is a very weird and beautiful project that I'm really proud of. I started it as a student to learn how to make comics, and over the years it snowballed and blossomed into a sprawling, ambitious project that's become very personal and close to my heart...you can't work on something for 5 years and not have it take a piece of you with it. Not only did I grow as a creator over the course of this project, but I also made a lot of amazing friends (the real treasure...) along the way...I want to thank my family and friends for their support, Hiveworks for their resources, hard work and advice, and a whole lot of cool strangers on the internet for paying attention to my weird unicorn story and encouraging me to keep it going. Thanks everyone! I can't wait to make this book! : 3 \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "\u00a0The goal for this kickstarter is to fund a small run of Chapter 4 issues for 2018!\u00a0The book will contain 42 pages, printed in beautiful full color in soy-based inks at 10.25\" x 6.5\". Chapters 1 through 3 are also available through this campaign, in both digital (high quality .pdf) and print form, so if you haven't picked up the others yet, you can do so here!\u00a0Each Chapter comes with its own Digital Sketchbook, containing behind-the-scenes content such as concept art and production notes in a high quality .pdf!\u00a0 Stickers with the Suihira characters drawn in a chibi style are now available thanks to reaching our first stretch goal! \u00a0What's Suihira: The City of Water about? This award-winning webcomic is about a zealous desert princess running away from home to find the legendary city of a dishonored water goddess.\u00a0 \u00a0In Chapter 4, Princess Wahida, also known as \"Dija\", tags along with two \"desert folk\" who promise to help her get supplies for her journey to Suihira. Little does she know, they actually plan on turning her in for a quick cash reward. However, things may not go exactly as any of them had hoped... \u00a0 Chapters 1 through 3 are also available\u00a0in beautiful paperback prints, and I'm excited to add Chapter 4 to my printed roster! Here are some samples from the Digital Sketchbooks. They include all sorts of bonus material, like concept art, model sheets, studies, and more! Each chapter comes with its own sketchbook with different content.\u00a0 \u00a0 For this campaign, I am also offering a limited number of custom pencil sketches of a character from Suihira! Here's a sample of my pencil work! The sticker sheet will be 5x7 in and in high quality vinyl! Every reward with a physical book will have these included!\u00a0 If you back any of the Digital Books without paperbacks and want the stickers as well, increase your pledge by $10 with a message that you'd like the stickers as well!\u00a0 These illustrations were made to celebrate Suihira's first, second, and third anniversary. Now they're here to celebrate this Kickstarter and its backers!\u00a0Every reward with a physical book will have these 5 x 7 in postcards included! If you back any of the Digital Books without paperbacks and want the postcards as well, increase your pledge by $10 with a message that you'd like the postcards! If you would like both the postcards and the stickers, increase your pledge by $15 with a message that you'd like both! If the campaign reaches $3000, Acrylic Keychains of Suihira characters will be available to backers! Can we make this stretch goal before the campaign ends?! Why not make a volume of all 4 chapters?I considered doing this, however, I would prefer to stick to releasing single issues for each chapter until a full book is complete (8 chapters). Suihira, when finished, will be 2 books. I may print an Omnibus upon completion of both books, but that won't be for at least another decade. Do you have any stretch goals?I wasn't originally going to, but I was so blown away by the campaign, that I must now have stretch goals!\u00a0 Where's the $300 go to?Half of it goes to printing and the other half goes to shipping, fees, taxes, etc!\u00a0 I'm going to be at Emerald City Comic Con / Wondercon. Can I pick my book(s) up there?Absolutely! Just please let me know, and I'll reserve copies for you at these cons!",
  "Racquet is a new, quarterly tennis magazine launching this summer. It will feature the best of in-depth writing about modern tennis culture\u2014art, fashion, history and photography, all presented in a collectible print magazine. Nothing like this exists. We\u2019re launching Racquet because there isn\u2019t a publication that does justice to the game we love. We want to celebrate the cultural diversity found in and around the modern game as well as the forgotten stories from the pro game\u2019s buccaneering past.\u00a0 Who's on Team Racquet? Racquet is the work of a small edit team: Caitlin Thompson, David Shaftel, Larry Buchanan & the Women's Tennis Association's Courtney Nguyen. We\u2019ve got experience at big publications: TIME, Sports Illustrated, The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Washington Post and Grantland, to name a few. We've been named checked in Sport's Illustrated's Tennis Podcast, and we've got a storied band of advisors, led by former Esquire editor in chief, David Granger. The amazing chain of ACE hotels will be a distribution partner for us, and we've got\u00a0some of the best tennis writers contributing as well as well-known writers who don\u2019t normally write about tennis, but are fascinated by it.\u00a0Our debut issue will feature original writing from Sasha Frere-Jones, Gerald Marzorati, Taffy Brodesser-Akner, Carole Bouchard, Thessaly La Force as well as original illustrations by Bill Sullivan.\u00a0Their work will be surrounded by great contemporary art design, and photography as well as amazing archival material we've unearthed - thanks in particular to a collaboration with the illustrious International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island.\u00a0 Why print? But Racquet is about more than just tennis. It represents the first step in a new model of publishing and journalism in print. Because Racquet\u2019s priority will be on a selling a beautiful physical edition, the magazine will not be beholden to the digital-centric model of publishing and advertising that is diluting the quality of so much current journalism.",

This year our funding has been cut, so we are reaching out to friends of the journal to help contribute! (Edit: we have now raised enough money to publish issue 37 and the University of Glasgow have confirmed that the journal should have funding for the next year or two! Thanks so much, everyone!) We are hoping to print 50 hard-copies of this issue.

  "What does it mean, for you, yes, you\u2014the reader, the avid science fiction fan, purveyor of the imaginative even when faced by the banality of a day-to-day life\u2014to support a publication that is colored, and we mean, like really, really colored, by the nuances of culture, race, and history? For one, you get to read something that would dispel the notion of POC-penned science fiction as somewhat inferior science fiction. We will work very hard to come up with a lineup that will counter this assumption, and we will succeed in doing so. We believe in science fiction\u2019s transformative powers, its ability to remedy the dreariness of our lives. People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! will exist, with your kind help, of course, to relieve a brokenness we\u2019ve enabled time and time again by favoring certain voices and portrayals of particular characters. We won\u2019t harangue you with guilt trips involving the importance of openly listening to the assimilated, the colonized, the misappropriated. That\u2019s just not how we roll. What we aim to do, instead, is to challenge you: Join us because it is fun to do so. We don\u2019t mean fun as a vehicle for trivializing centuries of injustice that resulted in the lack of representation for certain groups of people because power structures were skewed heavily in favor of a chosen few. We mean fun as the satisfaction we get in those light-bulb-in-the-head moments of our lives, the satisfaction we get from meaningful conversations that lend clarity, the satisfaction we get when we move past those feel-good-driven acts of tokenism, the satisfaction we get when we read stories that have palpable artistic and intellectual values that speak of our present time and most of all, our future. As we said in our submission call, we will not be asking writers who submit stories to tell us what makes them \u201cpeople of colo(u)r.\u201d We leave that up to your world experience, your conscience, your sense of community, and your sense of fair play. And like the other hugely successful initiatives of Lightspeed\u2019s Destroy series, People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! is saying, \u201cWe\u2019re here. We have always been here. And we are very, very excited to show it.\u201d  Join us by supporting our Kickstarter.\n P.S. If you're excited too, and not just in the I GOTTA HAVE THIS THING sort of way but in the I GOTTA BE PART OF THIS kind of way, good news! If you write fiction, we're currently open to submissions for the issue. If you don't write fiction, or even if you do, but you want to help out in some other way, the best thing you can do is help spread the word about this campaign. And if you have other ways you'd like to help, we're happy to listen! We\u2019ll publish the special issue whether the campaign is successful or not, but the campaign will determine how big and awesome we make the issue. If we raise just $5000, we\u2019ll be able to make the special issue a special double-sized issue,and if we raise even more than that, we have a few really excellent stretch goals lined up as well.  In 2014, we conducted a successful campaign to fund our first special issue, Women Destroy Science Fiction!, which ended up raising more than 1000% of our original goal, and unlocked additional special issues Women Destroy Horror! and Women Destroy Fantasy! In 2015, we conducted another successful campaign to fund Queers Destroy Science Fiction!. It performed similarly to WDSF, raising more than 1000% of our goal, and unlocked additional special issues Queers Destroy Horror! and Queers Destroy Fantasy! A regular issue of LIGHTSPEED contains an equal mix of science fiction and fantasy short fiction, consisting of 4 original stories, 4 reprints, plus a novella reprint (exclusive to our ebook edition). Each issue also includes a feature interview, a book review column, a media review column, and spotlights on the authors who appear in the issue.

Previously, we crowdfunded our two other \"Destroy\" special issues: In 2014, we published Women Destroy Science Fiction!, which was named one of NPR's best books of 2014 and won the British Fantasy Award; and in 2015, we published Queers Destroy Science Fiction!, which received similar acclaim.  When not doing special issues devoted to destroying science fiction, LIGHTSPEED is usually edited by bestselling anthologist John Joseph Adams, editor of anthologies such as Wastelands, The Living Dead, and Brave New Worlds, and series editor of Best American Science Fiction & Fantasy.  All of the money raised by this project will be used to fund the publication of the POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue and related stretch goals. Anything leftover after that will go toward the production of future issues of LIGHTSPEED. You'll find our various reward options in a column on the right side of this page (PC/Mac) or on a separate page (iOS/Android).

  "Lisa's Pantry will be the sequel to my first cookbook, My Relationship with Food. After successfully self-publishing my first book, I wanted to continue to offer delicious and nutritious gluten-free, no refined sugar and limited\u00a0dairy recipes.\u00a0\n My style of cooking talks to everyone, not only those who are intolerant to gluten. It offers a variety of cooking styles for anyone who likes to eat healthy and delicious foods. Whether you are vegan, vegetarian or like to incorporate a healthy, eclectic diet of meat, poultry and fish, my recipes have something for everyone to enjoy. \nPlease feel free to check out my website to see the kinds of things I like to cook!\n The reason I got into the field of recipe developing and cooking was a result of my own battles with food in my earlier years.\u00a0After seeing the response I have had from my first cookbook, it has proven to me that opening up and expressing my story about battling with weight issues shows others that you can turn things around and make your relationship with food a\u00a0positive one, as I have done. \nI am so grateful for my audience who have come together and follow my recipes with admiration and passion to create easy and nutritious meals for themselves and their friends and families.\u00a0 \nI am positive that I have inspired people in a range of ways, from identifying their own issues with food to bringing families together through new ways of cooking. \nEven to this day it excites me when my followers share a creation they have made from my cookbook; it is amazing to see people coming together through a shared love of food.\n Since launching My Relationship with Food, my knowledge and understanding of cooking and designing recipes has greatly expanded. I have been working hard in the kitchen, experimenting with new ideas and I am really hoping to share them.\n I am an author, chef and teacher with a strong passion for nutritional, wholesome and delicious foods.\n It was through my own challenging journey that I developed a wealth of knowledge and experience that has led me to become an expert in all things gluten-free as well as an industry leader in healthy eating.\u00a0I have now devoted my life to sharing my passion and encouraging, supporting and inspiring people to change their dietary habits for the better. Two years ago I self-published my debut cookery book, My Relationship with Food, which features 100 delicious, nourishing and seasonal recipes, all gluten-free with minimal use of dairy and no refined sugar.\n I spend much of my time teaching. This begins with educating children to understand the importance of good nutrition and instilling good habits from an early age by teaching them to cook within their own homes and to gain confidence in the kitchen which is a skill they will have for life. \nI also provide cookery lessons to private clients in their homes and regularly visit employees of leading blue chip companies, including Google, Facebook, KPMG and Nomura, amongst others.I run interactive cookery workshops and demonstrations to advise on the benefits of mindful eating, particularly at various charity fundraising events such as Reverse Rett,\u00a0Heart Cells Foundation and One Family UK.\u00a0 A partnership with an established contract caterer, allowed me to set up my pop up Lisa's Pantry which involves offering healthy options to a number of city banks, encouraging nutritional eating in the workplace. \nIt is not only food that I love to produce, I have also manufactured a kitchenware product under my brand, My Relationship with Food. This is a\u00a0silicone, fibreglass\u00a0baking mat which is a product that every household could benefit from. They are\u00a0reusable alternatives to aluminium foil or parchment paper. They are BPA free,\u00a0non stick and extremely easy to clean, saving you time, money and introducing you to a healthier way of cooking. Please visit my website for more information.\n I believe that everyone has their own relationship with food, from allergies or intolerances, dieting and suffering from an eating disorder, to simply having a love for all things edible. \nThrough many ups and downs, I've managed to turn my own relationship with food around. I transformed my style of eating to what works best for my body, adopting a gluten-free diet, limiting dairy and refined sugars.\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Lisa's journey through her relationships in life, mirrored in her relationship with food is a compelling, nuanced and illuminating account - with great recipes and life lessons to boot\" Tony Adams, MBE Former Arsenal and England Captain \"I love this book. It's full of recipes of exactly the meals my family and I want to eat.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tim Steiner Founder and CEO of Ocado \"This book is an honest look at one woman's relationship with food and has some great recipes.

It has opened many doors for my story to be heard and I want to be able to re-live this experience.\u00a0Producing the cookbook has changed my life in so many ways and I have met so many wonderful people along the way; I want to achieve even greater things by carrying out this process again. \nMy story is personal and I want my book to be personal too; I don't want to hand it over to someone else. I also love bringing other budding professionals in and giving them the chance to get their feet off the ground in the same way that I have done, whether that be food stylists, photographers, creative illustrators, copyrighters, make up, hair, clothes stylist etc.\n Self-publishing is an expensive process and this is why I am asking for your help through Kickstarter, it would mean so much to me and I would be able to offer you great recipes and other gifts in return.\n.. \u00a0 The goal is to raise \u00a340,000. I know this is not a small amount of money but it takes a lot to publish a book. This sum of\u00a0money would allow me to print around 2000 books.\n So much goes into publishing a book that you probably don't even think about: the page layouts, the printing, the food testing and styling, recipe developing as well as the artwork and photography and Kickstarter fees, of course.\u00a0 \nIf I was to raise even more than this it would really allow me to get stuck in and develop my brand ideas even further but \u00a340,000 would provide an amazing starting point.\n \u00a0If I can raise more funds than the project goal amount, this will help me to continue my work in the following ways:\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 June - July: Run Kickstarter\n July- August: Kickstarter ends + production of Lisa's Pantry cookbook begins \nSeptember: Production begins \nOctober-November: Production complete + launch party\n November-February 2018: All Kickstarter rewards delivered Please be aware that as a result of unforeseeable\u00a0circumstances, this timeline is not set in stone.\n \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "Most casual sports fans are aware of Duke\u2019s run of dominance in men\u2019s basketball under the leadership of Mike Krzyzewski, who has announced the 2021-22 season will be his last. Some even know about the \u201cCameron Crazies\u201d \u2013 the group of Duke students who paint their entire bodies, wear outrageous outfits, and yell and chant and sing during Blue Devils home games at cozy Cameron Indoor Stadium. Most fans, however, would have no idea of the level of detail or the intricacies involved in \u201ctenting,\u201d the process(es) by which Duke students prove themselves worthy of access to the most important games played between the walls of Cameron Indoor Stadium. As with most things associated with Duke men\u2019s basketball, the entity of the Crazies runs a parallel line of progress with that of Coach K\u2019s. With the team\u2019s success since Krzyzewski was hired over 40 years ago, the most elaborate and passionate student section in all of college sports evolved. Centered on an exclusive interview with Krzyzewski, \u201cK & the Crazies\u201d will feature dozens of other interviews to look back on a historic career, as well as how that success built up unique traditions and institutions adjacent to the Duke men\u2019s basketball program. To be sure, this narrative podcast is not about recounting Krzyzewski\u2019s accolades or accomplishments as the head coach of Duke men\u2019s basketball, nor will it present a timeline of the program\u2019s achievements. It will instead highlight the relationship between Coach K and the Cameron Crazies, and how the student fan base has become one with the basketball program. \u201cK & the Crazies\u201d will take listeners on a journey through the origins of Krzyzewskiville (K-Ville), as told by one of the tent city\u2019s founders. It will introduce you to more recent tenters, who pushed boundaries within K-Ville\u2019s guidelines, drawing national media attention for their exploits. The podcast explores the extraordinary relationship between Coach K and the Crazies through the eyes of former players, administrators, students, and members of the media \u2014 writers, broadcasters, and radio hosts. Listeners will also hear from opposing players, who chronicle their personal experiences inside historic Cameron Indoor Stadium. There is also the rare opportunity to gain insight from referees, who often draw the ire of the raucous student section. And, of course, there is the exclusive interview with Krzyzewski, where he talks in-depth about the Cameron Crazies and what they mean to him, Duke basketball, and the University as a whole. With that, it is important to note, \u201cK & the Crazies\u201d is not simply a collection of interviews. It is a story of people and how one man helped inspire the most distinctive student fan base in college sports. \u201cK & the Crazies\u201d is tentatively set to release as a six episode series with a bonus follow-up, though the final output number is subject to change. The podcast will release in late January during the ACC regular season and conclude the week of Coach K\u2019s final game at Cameron Indoor Stadium when the Blue Devils face-off with North Carolina. We have been engaged in conversation over the last few months with a half dozen major sports media entities for possible distribution. These discussions are ongoing. Should we not secure a distributor, we will self-release the podcast, which will ultimately have no impact on how you as a listener can gain access to the production. Brian McLawhorn is a sports journalist and documentary filmmaker. He has covered the Duke men\u2019s basketball program since 2007, and is currently co-publisher and managing editor of Bull City Hoops. Additionally, he produced ACC Network\u2019s \u201cAll ACCess: Louisville Football\u201d (2019) and worked as a field producer for \u201cThe Hall of Fame Knocks\u201d (2021), which was distributed by NFL Media Group and aired on CBS and NFL Network. Brian has worked on various other film projects that have been distributed by ESPN, ABC Sports, Sony Music Nashville, and Fox Sports, as well as numerous independent documentary features and shorts. Daron Vaught is a play-by-play broadcaster and web host for USA Baseball. In this role, Daron hosts \"Covering the Bases,\" the official podcast of USA Baseball and serves as an on-camera anchor for social media and web features, in addition to providing commentary on streamed USA Baseball games. Daron is also the play-by-play broadcaster for Tubby Smith's High Point University men's basketball team and has called over a dozen different sports on the ESPN family of networks, including the NCAA Regionals for women's gymnastics and the ACC Track and Field Championships. He often hosts local sports talk radio shows throughout his home state of North Carolina, as well as fills in on Durham Bulls radio and television broadcasts. People often ask us why we are the right people to tell this story. As described, together we have covered Duke men\u2019s basketball and the ACC for a combined 25+ years. Having sat center court inside Cameron Indoor Stadium for throughout this time, we have developed a unique and intimate insight into the relationship between Coach K and the Cameron Crazies. We have spent hours filming and recording inside K-Ville and at the foot of the wooden bleachers where students transform into one of the most iconic fan bases in sports today. Experience as storytellers, time spent studying the phenomenon that is Coach K & the Crazies, and our passion to share this unique experience with listeners is what drives us and qualifies us to bring this story to Duke and sports fans everywhere. Why do we need your help? Unfortunately, creative projects are not free to produce. While we have self-funded the project to date, we are working to raise $75,460 by our projected launch date of late January to cover: producer, host, and editor pay, production overhead and travel, legal and E&O insurance, promotion costs, and equipment. The $6,700 we are raising here will cover technical costs of tape syncs, music and archival licensing, hosting fees, software, travel, and costs of printing and shipping rewards.",
  "With influences such as Annie Mac, Nina Kraviz, Annie Nightingale, The Blessed Madonna, amongst many male counterparts of the music and broadcasting industry, I've always found a sense of purpose in listening, sharing, creating and dancing to music. The ability to take someone on a journey to transcend from one place to another with the power of sound is magic. Suspended from music production school for drinking a G&T in the studio made me more inclined to create a platform of opportunity for other artists to be heard. Passion and purpose is key... and it was here Stripped FM was born.. This channel will entertain as well as introduce music, mainly unsigned artists, it will promote events and engage an audience through humour and real life, addressing controversial topics. Radio is a great medium to explore, presenting opportunities to promote other creative entities that can engage and inspire the listenership, producing an audio theatre to the mind. The beauty of radio is allowing the audience to get involved by interacting and engaging with the station and the presenters, musicians and entertainers through social media channels, competitions and even by post if they want!\u00a0 There will be multiple presenters, predominantly female, who will build their audience using personal skills and create an online following with a target listenership who engage with them to keep the content fun, involved and up to date. Guest speakers and interviews will be featured and a full programme schedule drawn together. This will include show slot, content, a profile of the DJ/presenter/guest \u00a0and playlists and reference links to show content.\u00a0 The funds will go towards studio set up, rent, production, licensing and marketing.",

  "\u00a0Life is much more enjoyable and carefree when your feet feel the love. Your feet could be compared to tree roots. Healthy roots are the key to healthy and structurally sound trees. \u00a0Hence we believe your feet deserve the same kind of tender, loving care as the rest of your body.\u00a0 It is time to introduce Yesfettle, a foot massage platform with a variety of fitness functions. Fitness and massage are combined in a single compact unit in a groundbreaking design. Your feet will be stimulated and rejuvenated by its reflexology-based massage surfaces, while the well-matched accessories let you complete a full-body workout without leaving your house. BIG GAINS IN LESS COST. The design is inspired by the diverse living forms seen in nature and strives to strike a balance between a vibrant aesthetic and ergonomic characteristics. It is made of high-quality TPR materials and features a long-lasting structure and elasticity resilience to maintain its shape and integrity during regular use. If you have sore or fatigued feet, do yourself a favor and spend only a few minutes each day utilizing Yesfettle to deliver the greatest relief for your feet! The positive influence of foot massage and heating has been scientifically proven for years. When you stand on Yesfettle: \ud83c\udf35 The application of gentle pressure from Yesfettle\u2019s uneven surfaces releases tension that tends to store up in the feet. \ud83c\udf35 It helps wake up tired feet. \ud83c\udf35 It promotes healthy blood circulation. \ud83c\udf35 It enhances physical and mental relaxation. Your lives have become structured in a way that makes it easy to not move; you sit in cars, you sit at desks, you sit on the sofa at night to unwind. You take elevators to avoid a flight or two of stairs. It's TOOOO bad! \u00a0During prolonged sitting, your metabolism slows by 90%, blood pools in your legs, and the muscles of your lower body are paralyzed. Many health problems can result from long periods of sitting at work. Your body was built for movement! You really can start making changes by performing these gentle, non-sweaty exercises on the massage surface, such as standing, pacing, stretching... to increase your range of motion and strength for lifelong health and vitality. No matter what movement you choose, the more you move, the better your body will function and the better you will feel. Balance gets worse with age.No matter your fitness lever, adding balance training to your daily or weekly fitness routine will be hugely beneficial. \u00a0For those looking for maximum benefit, these massage&balance beams can be used barefoot to really get your feet working. Exercises on these beams can increase the range of motion. Strengthening and stimulating your feet might help mitigate injury risk. The Rock Garden kit satisfies the majority of people\u2019s daily foot care requirements. It is softer and more comfortable to stand on due to its high tensile strength and elasticity resilience. The massage surfaces on The Ocean Floor are sharply carved with 3D texture. Walking on it can improve the microcirculation of the feet, resulting in a more irritative effect on the nerve ends and a more propitiatory effect on the spirit. The most difficult terrain is The Live Desert. Standing on the cactus may result in a painful sensation similar to that of standing on a shiatsu board. This pain, however, will eventually fade as your tolerance grows. These robust cacti have enough natural strength to stimulate your muscles and revitalize your feet. Each Yesfettle purchased includes two individually designed massage balls that serve a variety of purposes. Playing with this smooth ball can help you achieve greater flexibility in your toes while rolling another spiky ball under your foot will immediately stimulate the sole of your foot and help you release muscle tension in a matter of minutes. They both promote leg movement and assist users in developing good focus habits on the task at hand. We are doing our part to protect the environment and the health and well-being of your loved ones by developing a product with a low environmental impact. This means a long lifespan and good recyclability to reduce waste. We tested a variety of materials during the development phase, including PU, but our beta testers were concerned about its wear resistance and a slight odor. We eventually settled on TPR for the soft massage mat and high-density ABS for the workout platform, both of which are recyclable and reusable. It does not affect the quality, but it makes Yesfettle more environmentally friendly. Heat is yet another advantage that Yesfettle has that other massage devices do not. Heat has been shown to hasten natural recovery and alleviate pain. The Yesfettle platform includes a foot warmer to meet the physiological requirements of heating comfort. When graphene heats up, it emits far-infrared rays, which transfer heat energy to deeper parts of the human body. As a result, it helps to alleviate pain and sore muscles, improve blood circulation, reduce muscle spasms, and contribute to your holistic health. \u00a0\u26a0\ufe0f The weighing and counting functions require four AAA batteries to operate. A weight scale is a must-have item in any modern home. Yesfettle\u2019s built-in digital scale\uff08free to choose lb or kg mode\uff09 makes it easy to keep track of your daily weight. The scale is manually operated, you have complete control over whether it is turned on or off. The platform can support up to 400 lbs/180 kg. Available in two colors matte black and platinum grey. Choose your preferred color in the survey we send to you after the campaign ends. The three-in-one workout base is the pinnacle of practicability. It was thoughtfully designed to simulate all of the bulky gym equipment and machines and combine them into a single comprehensive workout concept. It includes a variety of functions such as push-ups, sit-ups, squats, Pilates, and more that can help you burn calories and stay in shape without leaving your house. With 20+ combo positions, the color-coded push-up base targets specific muscles (chest, shoulders, back, triceps) and promotes proper form, which can develop your major and minor muscle groups with the perfect fitness solution. It also enables fitness practitioners to create more training combinations. Whether you are a man or a woman, whether you are just starting on your fitness journey or a seasoned pro, this easy-to-follow mode will suit you perfectly and encourage you to stick to the end.\u00a0 Using digital counting, you can easily keep track of how many push-ups you have done and for how long, which can serve as motivation to help you meet daily goals. The back is non-slip design and resistant to wear. The sit-up bar is constructed of durable material, and the soft foam material wrapped around the handle enhances your grip. The entire device is really simple to install and operate. Now you can work out wherever you want, any time you please, and in any outfit you want. \u00a0* The resistance bands are gifts but the pilates bar is not included in any reward tier. We are trying our best to make the base snap hook compatible with most of your bands at hand.\u00a0 Boost Your Fitness With Yesfettle app App for training guidance shown are not final, more changes will be made. \u00a0The shipping costs will be collected separately before our fulfillment.\u00a0The taxes are handled by our end. One of the most notable upfront production costs involves molding. We were unwilling to make concessions and settle on our prototypes. So, before launching our project, we purchased custom-made molds from an established, industry-leading manufacturer and conducted a trial manufacturing run to ensure a smooth transition from prototype to finished product. \u00a0 I used to clean my grandmother\u2019s house once a week when I was a kid. Nonetheless, she would have cleaned the living room by the time I arrived. I always told her she did not have to do that, but she was adamant. I had no idea why she felt compelled to do this every week at the time, but one day I found myself stuck at a desk for more than ten hours, my legs swelled up, my spin began to ache, As I jerked up, I felt a wave of vertigo. What's worse was that I had grown accustomed to this negative routine and had even accepted the negative effects of being sedentary. I finally realized why my grandmother insisted on cleaning by herself. It was something she could do to keep herself busy. \u00a0Every day, it is critical to move more. I didn't want to interrupt what I was doing to exercise, but I also didn't want to put my health at risk. I desired to achieve the best of both worlds. While looking for solutions, I came across a foot massage mat. This fantastic product piqued my interest to the point where I could not wait to tell my friends about it. To my surprise, everyone had a never-ending supply of ideas and imagination for improving and optimizing it. Since that day, we have had one goal in mind: to create an easy-to-use foot care product that can incorporate more movement into our hectic workday. \u00a0It took a full year of work, hundreds of designs, and numerous prototypes to get to where we are now.\u00a0 We are obsessed with creating quality products that lead to amazing results. Let us work for you while you work hard. So much love and gratitude to everyone who has been part of this journey! Our team members are placing the massage surfaces beneath their desks to benefit from the convenience of working and relaxing at the same time \ud83e\udd70 .

  "Stacy Has A Thing For Black Guys\u00a0is an independent, feature film to be filmed in Dallas, Texas in March 2018. Think Get Out\u00a0meets Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? The film is an adaptation of Ruben Carrazana's stage play by the same name. The play was produced by the theater collective known as The Tribe in Dallas in the summer of 2016 where it\u00a0had a successful run and was named an Outstanding New Play or Musical by the Dallas-Fort Worth Theater Critics Forum, Best New Play By A Local Writer by TheaterJones, and was recommended for the American Theatre Critics Association/Harold and Mimi Steinberg New Play Award. The outpouring of love and support from the community was inspiring for everyone involved, and the play was entirely funded by the City of Dallas, which is unheard of. And now, we're turning it into a movie! We've got our cast, our crew, and we've already raised a significant portion of our budget due to a grant from the City of Dallas Office of Cultural Affairs as well as a number of individual investors. All we need now is a little bit of extra dough, mainly for post-production. Three people sit in a living room. A white married couple. And a black man. Drinking lemonade. And making small talk. However, as the night goes on, what started off as a seemingly safe and silly sex farce suddenly becomes slightly darker and more violent as hidden prejudices bubble up to the surface. In most contemporary films, the insecurities and anxieties that control our daily lives remain invisible, but Stacy Has A Thing For Black Guys operates with a heightened sense of awareness of the historical and social context in which we now live, offering a sharp and fiercely funny commentary on how we all choose to avoid honest conversations with others and ourselves about sex, gender, and race in America. TheaterJones called the script \"a smart, funny, and layered look at marriage\" that is \"fiercely funny in unexpected ways\" with \"twists [that] are always surprising\". Click here for TheaterJones review: \u201cThis play is fiercely funny in unexpected ways, and both the title and the substance have layers. All the more impressive considering that it is Carrazana\u2019s first playwriting venture.\u201d\u00a0 - Mark Lowry, TheaterJones Click here for D Magazine feature: \u201cThe play is a comedy, but Carrazana still wants the audience to hold up the mirror he feels all good theater should provide. In this case it might be more of a funhouse mirror.\u201d\u00a0 - Katy Lemieux, D Magazine Here is a video interview with the playwright and director of the 2016 stage production: \u00a0",
  "Help us print the second book of Minna Sundberg's award-winning Nordic fantasy and adventure webcomic Stand Still. Stay Silent. 90 years ago, a cataclysmic pandemic turned the Old World into a place of silence and fear.\u00a0Most of the surviving population of the Known World live in Iceland, now the largest safe area in existence, with a few smaller settlements scattered in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Hunters, mages and cleansers dedicate their lives to defending these settlements from the terrifying beings from beyond the safe areas, creatures from the Silent World. Before now, there has been no official attempts\u00a0to explore the Silent World. An underfunded, questionably selected, rag-tag team of explorers are assembled and launched into the unknown in a search for information and relics of the Old World - hopefully valuable relics. Stand Still. Stay Silent. follows six people (and a cat) on a journey filled with adventure, camaraderie and Nordic mythology. Who knows what they might find on their journey... and what they might lose. Stand Still. Stay Silent, also called SSSS, began in November 2013, and can be read online on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday on sssscomic.com.

  "Moss is an online journal of Northwest writing. We started Moss in the summer of 2014 as a venue for showcasing and supporting the talented and imaginative voices of the Pacific Northwest, with a special focus on emerging writers and a mission of celebrating and preserving the Northwest\u2019s robust literary culture. Moss is a community-first project; every issue of Moss is made available online for free, we don\u2019t charge submission fees, and we pay every writer we publish. Now in its second volume, Moss has been covered by The Stranger, City Arts, The Portland Mercury, and The LA Review of Books\u2019 new site The Offing, among other publications, and has helped bring the work of Northwest writers to more than 10,000 unique online visitors. The writers we\u2019ve published and interviewed include Rebecca Brown, Peter Mountford, Matt Briggs, Corinne Manning, Charles Finn, Janie Miller, Ryan Boudinot, and many more. The money raised from this Kickstarter will be used to publish a print edition of the first three issues of Moss, compiling our entire first volume of fiction, non-fiction, and interviews into a beautiful, accessible, and tangible print book. The books will be printed by BookMobile, an independent typesetting and production house based in Minneapolis that prints books for Graywolf, Coffee House Press, and number of other esteemed publishers. The funds from this Kickstarter will allow us to do a small print run of 300 copies while still insuring the highest possible printing quality.\u00a0 The web has been an amazingly effective platform for us, and has enabled us to release a lot of great writing into the world without undue overhead. But, we also recognize that not everyone wants to read fiction and essays on a computer screen. For some, paper and ink simply offer a more comfortable or convenient reading experience. The permanency of a physical book also means people will be able to share this writing in a more meaningful way than they can with a link to a website. Our hope is that copies of this book will be passed around, checked out of libraries, and re-discovered on family shelves 20 or 50 years from now. We\u2019ve earmarked copies from the print run for donation to libraries and schools, to help us reach an audience outside of our online sphere, and are making the books available at-cost for individuals with limited financial resources. In short, our decision to make a print book is about creating a new way to read Moss that will help us share this great writing with as many potential readers as possible. And as an added bonus, we\u2019ll be including a few surprises beyond the content that\u2019s already been published in our online issues. For a contribution of only $10.00, you can get an at-cost copy of Moss: Volume One. By contributing more, you can get a bunch of great rewards, including stickers, shirts, totes, photo prints, and more\u2014plus the knowledge that you are helping us to spread the work of hardworking Northwest writers to as broad an audience as possible. Any proceeds beyond the costs needed to produce our backer rewards and print our initial run of books will go directly towards paying the writers we\u2019ll publish in future issues of Moss. Not to worry! While we only publish writing by current residents of the Northwest and those with a substantial connection to the region, we\u2019re not an exclusive club. A big part of our mission is to bring Northwest writing to readers in other parts of the country and around the world\u2014that\u2019s you! For Canadian backers, we ask for a $5 supplement to your pledge to cover extra shipping costs. For all other international backers, we require a $10 supplement. Though we pay every writer we publish, make our online issues available for free, and have no advertising revenue or submission fees, our online issues have been self-funded up to this point, and will continue to be self-funded unless we significantly surpass our Kickstarter goal. However, the upfront costs of even a small print-run are substantial\u2014well above\u00a0the funding we\u2019re able to personally cover for our online content. Kickstarter allows us to offer a diversity of purchase options and special rewards without risking these upfront costs, and without sacrificing the quality of our product or reader experience by incorporating advertising into our site. Most importantly, Kickstarter offers an exciting way for Moss to engage directly with our community of readers and writers as we embark on this new stage of the project. We truly believe that a print edition of Moss offers a chance for the broadest possible audience to support, discover, and read the work of these incredible Northwest writers.

  "\u00a0 What if there was a book that showed you step by step instructions from seed to plate? Growing a meal: tending the plant, harvesting your labors and a recipe to prepare what you've grown, start to finish! Beautifully illustrated educational pages of botanicals and appetizing photographs of plated foods. It feels like the time for such a book to be born. A grown up plant science book mixed with home economics kitchen skills, something Bill Nye and Julia Child could both give a thumbs up to.  \u00a0 After years of cooking for loved ones and having some pretty high praise, I am being bold. This is my dream. Offering tutorials for those who think they can't grow or cook food. This is my homesteaders start to getting back to our roots. Great skills are not lost. Simple can be delicious. All concepts that I want to prove within a few hundred instructional pages. I truly believe in growing your own food. Not just for the sake of saving money, knowing exactly where your food comes from, or choosing exactly what you like to eat. All of those things are of course healthy goals, but what about the joy of cultivating something naturally amazing with your own two hands? And then combine that with the joy of creating beauty in a meal you saw from seed to feast. Absolutely soul fulfilling. There's something rebellious about being able to just do it all for yourself. Feels damn good.  \u00a0 This book is for anyone. I know it sounds corny but I mean that. Anyone who can cook but thinks the have a black thumb. Avid gardeners who tend to flowers and shrubs without giving vegetables a thought because they feel inadequate in the kitchen. Even the curious who have always dabbled in food and gardening but just want to learn more and link the two. I am excited to share the fun facts and debunk some of the difficulties. I hope home growing what you cook will become your hobby and your habit too! \u00a0 Over the last two years I have mapped out and perfected my layout. The foods prepared for the creation of the book have been selected specifically featuring items grown by me or by local farmers I am glad to call my friends. Meats are from families I know and support. Dairy from animals I have hugged. Produce harvested by hands I shake at the Farmers Market every weekend. The illustrated portions of this book are done by my sister who is an extremely talented artist. The photography is masterfully done by a brilliant up and coming local photographer. Self publishing, which will save over 40%, is set and ready to go to press. The last step has been funding. That's where you, my fellow foodies come in. Please take a moment to look at the rewards created to thoroughly show my appreciation for your much needed help. If you are unfamiliar with Kicksarter I will summarize the scoop. If I reach my goal this becomes a real tangible thing! If I miss the mark, nothing happens and you are refunded. It's all or nothing here. I am confident in this project and I feel really good about crowdfunding this way! The printing and distribution process is slated in my mind for arrival Spring 2018 I have the support of local book stores and several shops that will carry this book.  \u00a0Video\nSong Credit: \"Bring Me The Sunshine\" by Jess Penner on Growing In The Cold",

  "Jane Ayeko-K\u00fcmmeth and Ulli Schauen are asking you to help deliver investigative journalism to the Africans about the ongoing male circumcision campaign which has been pushed into the continent with massive public relations campaigns. \n\n\u00a0Our goal is challenging, but we also promise a lot: At least ten episodes in two languages - Swahili and Englisch - to be broadcast for free by African radio stations. It was mainly US organisations which have been organizing \u00a0the \"medical circumcision\" of African boys and men in 15 subsaharan countries* in the name of combatting AIDS.\u00a0 Between 2007 and 2020, around 23 million males were circumcised due to this massive campaign (source: WHO). The so-called VMMC** drive \u00a0was started after three clinical studies had shown in 2007 that the chance for a man of being infected with the AIDS virus by intercourse with a woman was reduced by around 60 percent, while critiques say they showed that this clinical trials had no effect - or even an adverse effect in real life. \u00a0Es waren vor allem US-Organisationen, die daf\u00fcr gesorgt haben, dass im Namen der AIDS-Bek\u00e4mpfung bisher 23 Millionen Jungen und M\u00e4nner in 15 L\u00e4ndern Afrikas beschnitten wurden. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO hatte das 2007 empfohlen, nachdem drei klinische Studien gezeigt hatten dass das Ansteckungsrisiko von M\u00e4nnern, beim Verkehr mit einer Frau infiziert zu werden, um 60 Prozent sinkt. Kritiker sagen sie haben gezeigt, dass das im richtigen Leben nichts besagt, ja sogar das Gegenteil bewirkt: h\u00f6here AIDS-Quoten. \u00a0This project will bring the results of Ulli Schauen's extensive journalistic research about the topic to Africa via a series of at least ten radio episodes in English, Suahili and - depending on the result of the funding \u00a0- even more African languages. In German language, you find the radio documentary online here.\u00a0 F\u00fcr ein Deutschlandfunk-Radiofeature (es steht hier online) hat Ulli Schauen in Kenia und dar\u00fcber hinaus intensiv recherchiert. Dieses Kickstarter-Projekt wird die Ergebnisse als Serie f\u00fcr afrikanische Radiostationen in mindestens zwei Sprachen verf\u00fcgbar machen, in Englisch und Kisuaheli, bei h\u00f6heren Einnahmen auch in mehr Sprachen.\u00a0 From the beginning, the effect of mass circumcision for combatting AIDS has been highly controversial. In 2020, the main donor of the campaign, the US Presidential Fund PEPFAR stopped funding medical circumcision of the group in which they had been most successful: the under-15-year olds. They wrote that almost all \"adverse events\" like infections, fistula and even mutilation had happened to young boys and newborns. Another study showed that the number of \"adverse events\" was grossly underreported by the circumcizing organizations. The stop is widely unkowny by the time of writing, circumcision teams attributed the moratorium to the Covid-19 pandemic. Die meisten Beschneidungen wurden bei den unter-15-J\u00e4hrigen und Neugeborenen durchgef\u00fchrt. Genau diese aber wurden im Jahr 2020 vom US-Fonds PEPFAR gestoppt. Man hatte festgestellt, dass fast alle Komplikationen bei den J\u00fcngeren geschahen - und besonders viele bei den Babies: Fisteln, Infektionen und sogar Verst\u00fcmmelungen. Und es gibt offenbar eine hohe Dunkelziffer. Der Stopp ist nicht kommuniziert worden. Manche Zirkumzisions-Teams schreiben ihn der COVID-19 Pandemie zu. \u00a0 Ulli has extensively researched the topic, recorded sound and conducted interviews about the topic in January / February in Western Kenya and Nyanza. He has also talked to experts in Uganda, USA, France and Germany. This resulted in a 51-minute radio documentary in German language that you can tune into here on the webpage of the national public radio Deutschlandfunk.\u00a0 Note: even though his investigations have made Ulli highly critical of the campaign, we consider his work as balanced journalism, not as \"intactivist\" campaign material. He really did not like the fact that he could not convince any radio station to fund a radio production in English and that, so far, the results of his work about the African topic have been presented only in Germany and not to those who are affected most: the African citizens in the 15 target countries.\u00a0 Ugandan journalist Jane Ayeko-K\u00fcmmeth and Ulli Schauen are teaming up to make the many aspects of the circumcision campaign also heard in African radio through a series of shorter reports (of 5 to ten minutes in average).\u00a0In addition, they will ask international experts to avail themselves for long-distance interviews in the radio programmes. This way, the Africans themselves will be able to discuss it among them and in their media. The series will also include new material that did not make it into the German radio documentary.\u00a0 Zusammen mit der uganisch-deutschen Journalistin Jane Ayeko-K\u00fcmmeth produziert Ulli nach erfolgreichem Crowdfunding die afrikanische Radioserie. Sie wird auch neues Material enthalten, das es nicht in die deutsche Radioversion geschafft hat.\u00a0 The high-quality production in a professional studio will be financed through crowdfunding in the Northern Hemisphere and produced in English and Swahili. In further steps, other vernacular African languages may follow, depending on demand. Radio stations in Africa will be allowed to broadcast the series for free whereas media in other parts of the world \u00a0will have to pay royalty fees if they want to have it. Each episode will be accompanied by a web page where the public and the radio presenters can find authentic and verified information about the topic - easy to be used.\u00a0 In case of funding above the kickstarter-minimum, we will not just keep the money but instead produce more episodes \u00a0plus in additional languages. New languages may include Dholuo, Ateso, Zulu or French, for example - depending on demand by African radio stations.\u00a0 We estimate \u00a0that for each additional 2,000 Euros we may cover producing the whole \u00a0series in an additional language, whereas each additional 1,000 Euros \u00a0would allow the research, recording and production of two additional \u00a0episodes. So wird das Geld verwendet:\u00a0 Wenn mehr Geld zusammenkommt, k\u00f6nnen auf Nachfrage andere afrikanische Sprachen produziert werden, wie z.B. Dholuo, Ateso, Zulu oder Franz\u00f6sisch. \u00a0Wir sch\u00e4tzen, dass je 2.000 Euro zus\u00e4tzlich uns eine weitere Sprachproduktion erm\u00f6glicht und je 1.000 Euro zwei weitere Folgen der Serie.\u00a0 This is the concept for the episodes at the moment. In the process, African radio stations will have their say in it:\u00a0 Die Titel der Episoden auf Deutsch findet Ihr am Fu\u00df dieser Seite. What is the foreskin good for? The international medical community has been more interested in finding out how it can be safely cut and what the benefits of cutting could be. After several thousand years of male circumcision practice, finally some results emerge. The WHO process that endorsed male circumcision for combatting AIDS was and is still highly controversial. Critiques say the technical conference in Geneva, March 2007, was extremely biased, and opponents in the science community had no say at all. With or without? This is the question that bothers most men as well as women in Africa. \u00a0While men that have been circumcised at infant stage cannot compare, many African men can \u2013 if they have been cut at a sexually active age. They do talk about it, but everybody has his own truth to it. The US Presidential Fund against AIDS, PEPFAR, has stopped financing and organizing the circumcision of young boys under 15 years and of babies. Their own records say it had too many adverse effects like infections, fistula and \u201cmiscuts\u201d. Up to 2019 the majority of cut foreskins belonged to the young boys. Were they robbed of their right to decide in an informed way? \u201cWe changed the culture\u201d says Prof. Robert Bailey of the University of Illinois, one of the chief proponents for male circumcision. This is and was done by well-orchestrated PR campaigns in all the 15 African target countries. Road Shows, pop songs, sponsored radio shows and the participation of African state agencies and foremost endorsement by ethnic leaders created a consensus that cutting the foreskin is good for many reasons. Even critiques acknowledge the results of scientific studies. It was shown that men have 60 percent lower risk of being infected when having sex with an HIV-positive woman. What exactly does it mean? And what is the effect in the long run? \u00a0For years now, the VMMC proponents at the WHO have been mathematically calculating high numbers of prevented infections through the VMMC campaign. But critiques say this is totally unrealistic because a vaccine that works only in 60 percent of the cases is worthless, and other factors will still cause a spread of the virus. Among the African Ethnies, circumcision is a hot topic. Among the Turkana in Northern Kenya, a man is a man only with a foreskin, but in the neighboring Samburu a real man must be cut. \u00a0So, tribal jokes and tribal violence have been using the topic of circumcision. And now, for 13 years, the VMMC campaign has been cutting through all this giving an upper hand to the traditionally circumcising communities, but to what effect? In some cases, it has increased violence and forced circumcisions by the traditionally circumcising ethnic communities. At least in Uganda and Kenya, the same scientists whose research findings showed that circumcision reduced the infection risk by 60 percent are now part of the circumcision organizations. Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University keeps promoting circumcision through its video channel and other means alongside with Makerere University in Kampala. But if science is part of the implementation of its results, are they still independent? Prof. Michel Garenne says no. Largely unnoticed by Africans, pediatricians mainly (but not exclusively) in the Northern hemisphere have fought over the question if routinely circumcising babies for non-religious reasons is ethically okay. On the pro-side were mainly US doctors, on the contra side pediatricians from other countries like Germany. We inform about that discussion and ask why it was not taking place in Africa as well. Everybody can find the pro- and con groups on facebook fiercely fighting each other, and most are based in the United States. Their names are PEPFAR, CDC, KEMRI, FACES, UNICEF, UNAIDS or the WHO. On the example of Kenya, we explore and explain who is doing what and who is deciding what. For the circumcision clients it looks like the Kenyan state was acting, but most of the times it is the United States behind it. And it may well be that staff in the health sector is lacking because they have moved to better paid jobs in the NGOs who work for male circumcision.\u00a0\u00a0 At one point the success statistics were so good - they \u201cshowed\u201d that in some parts of Kenya 180 percent of the males were already circumcised. Excuse me, 180 percent? The numbers were corrected downward by a rough estimation. But are they now correct? \u201cWe changed the culture\u201d, says one scientist concerning the Luo community which is traditionally a non- circumcising community. By now, peer pressure left no choice for a young Luo boy other than having circumcision. In theory, it must be an \u201cinformed consent\u201d that leads to circumcision \u2013 consent by a male who has been fully and impartially informed about advantages and disadvantages. But this is often not the case. \u00a0Promoters have been pushing males to circumcise with incorrect or inappropriate arguments as if the foreskin was evil and as if leaving it intact was irresponsible behavior towards the girlfriend. They had too much pressure to reach the target numbers, they started working sloppily and gave out money even to young boys for bringing their friends into the operation theatre.\u00a0 Critiques like Professor Garenne say that the circumcision campaign leads to more risky behaviour by men: Frequent sex without condomes. And thereby the message raises the infection rate of AIDS.\u00a0 This is what \u00a0happened to Steven Ochieng who had himself circumcised because all his friends were circumcised and did not even want to walk along with him. After his foreskin was gone he thought he could be the champion with girls and felt free to have sex with many. From what he understood, his friends had told him he was protected even without a condom. Now he is suffering from AIDS, the disease with no cure. \"We have promoted condom use in Africa for millions of dollars. But they do not use them,\" says one scientist promoting circumcision. \u00a0He claims that a young American has as many different sex partners as an African - but one after another and with a pause, not at the same time. The circumcisers claim that these are the reasons why they have to resort to removing foreskins in the most affected regions. In this episode, we put the arguments to test - and open them for discussion among the African audience. Some even say that the whole campaign could be racist. Some women want their partner to be definietly circumcised. Others love to have him with foreskin. Apart from the different individual female views, there are scientific findings about the effect of being circumcised or not on the female partner. We report about both too and let the people discuss. Programmes driven by foreign donors attract \u00a0qualified personal from the public agencies to NGOs. What is the effect of the VMMC campaign (\"Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision\") on the medical sector in Africa? \u00a0Is there a brain drain? Does it pull people away from curative positions to foreskin-cutting? \u00a0These are some of the questions we asked and bring you details through our report. This is just a call-in program with a short intro, a teaser to get the listeners to share their thoughts and experience. Depending on ideas shared and demand raised, there may be even more episodes.

  "What's \"Quinntessence\" about?? Quinntessence is a webcomic about a magical detective named \"Quinn Tillion\" who solves murder mysteries. The first 2 chapters of this story are to establish the characters and cover Quinn's first murder mystery.\u00a0 The story starts on Halloween night where Quinn and her friend Harriet are invited to a masquerade. Shortly after arriving to the masquerade though a murder occurs. Being the only person with expertise on murder mysteries Quinn takes it upon herself to find the culprit (also she really like detective stories, lol). Where will it be posted? I haven't set up a tapastic account yet, but you can see all the developmental sketches, etc. by clicking here and scrolling through the tumblr blog I have set up for the comic.",
  "Hello! My name is Samantha Whitten and I'm the artist of The GaMERCaT, a webcomic that mixes gaming humor with mischievous felines. It started in 2011 as a fun little side project and quickly gained popularity from both gamers and cat lovers alike, and now has a steady once-a-week update schedule (every Monday!) The slice-of-life comic features an appropriately-named cat with access to a large library of games and an over-active imagination, who literally dives into popular franchises and tackles topics in gamer life from a cat's perspective. He's haunted by a materialistic fairy and preoccupied with raising a gamer kitten protege, all while he and his friends fly under the radar of blissfully ignorant humans. The comic is free to read online at TheGaMERCaT.com, but readers have long been asking for a printed version, so I'm finally here to deliver the first volume! The book will include the first 100 comics, plus a bit of extra bonus content if we can hit some stretch goals ;) How exciting! \u00a0 The book will be a perfect bound paperback with a 12pt gloss cover, sized at 9\" x 6\" and roughly 130 pages long. The art and layouts of some comics will be tweaked, mostly to be more suitable for print or to convert animated panels to static images. The book will also include concept art, as well as pet profiles of my cats, who serve as inspiration for the personalities of the characters and influence their antics. \u00a0 \u00a0As a special bonus sale for this Kickstarter I have exclusive enamel pins available!\u00a0This pixel Gamercat pin is unique to this project and will not be sold in the online store, so if you like it this is your chance to grab it. The standard pin is unlimited, but the shiny gold metal version is limited to only 200 pieces and reserved for the special shiny bundle pledge tier. During the first Kickstarter I offered over-sized vinyl stickers of Gamercat and Glitch. They were super popular, so I decided to add Pixel and Sweet and offer all four as an add-on in this project. Who doesn't love stickers? If funding exceeds the main goal I have some bonuses planned! This time I would prefer to enhance the main focus of the project rather than doing a bunch of extra products, so I've kept the stretch goals focused on and around the book. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Time for the little details! The book is mostly ready to go, I just have to prepare any extra bonuses that come from any stretch goals the project hits. If we reach these bonuses early I will get started on them while the project is still running in the hopes of getting the book submitted as soon as the Kickstarter is done. File approval and sample production can take 2-4 weeks, and if everything is good on the first go, the book can go into production and will likely take 4-6 weeks. Shipping will add another 4-6 weeks, so the best case scenario for receiving the books is possibly in December, but I'm estimating delivery in January to add a little safety buffer. Please do not count on these for Christmas gifts! The funds from this project will go towards producing the books, the bonus items, and shipping all rewards. Kickstarter takes 5% in fees, and Stripe (the payment processor) takes another 3%-5%. I also need to reserve a percentage for US taxes at the end of the year. Any funds leftover after the fees are paid and the rewards are filled will be reinvested back into The GaMERCaT. Shipping can be complicated and, unfortunately, rather expensive for international backers. I've done my best to find the cheapest rates and have detailed them below.\u00a0All rates are gathered from USPS.com I'm afraid I cannot control how much shipping will cost. I understand that international rates may be a major deterrent and I wish I could do something about them. I'm sorry!

  "Thanks to your overwhelming support, our Kickstarter is now over! Don't \nworry though, you can still get a gTar. Head over to www.incidentgtar.com for \nmore information or to place an order. What people are saying about the gTar: \"If you're ever picked up a guitar for the first time and tried to play a favorite song, you know how discouraging it can be. The gTar completely changes that.\"\u00a0-Drew Houston, Dropbox founder/CEO \"The gTar by Incident is disruption defined.\" - TechCrunch \"The proof is in the pudding. The pudding tasted good.\" - Evolver.FM \"\u6b32\u3057\u3044\uff01(Want!)\" - gigazine.net\u00a0(Japan) We've also been featured on: CNN,\u00a0Rolling Stone,\u00a0Wired,\u00a0Mashable, PC Mag, Create Digital Music, and out of the six finalists at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC 2012, we were selected as the runner-up. If you're a fan, please take a second to follow us on Facebook, Twitter, or on our blog! Update #8: Last Call + T-Shirt Designs (!!) Update #7: New Video Update + Demo Update #6: New Color/Pick Guard Option at $350k! Update #5: Shipping We've added international shipping options - thanks for for patience. United States: Free Canada: $10 Rest of the World: $60. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There's nothing like the thrill of playing a real musical instrument. Unfortunately for most, learning can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience. That's why we built the gTar. The gTar is a fully digital guitar that\nmakes it easy for anybody to play music, regardless of experience. All you have\nto do is dock your iPhone in the body, load up the gTar app, and an array of\ninteractive LEDs along the fretboard will show you how to play.\u00a0 You may be asking yourself what it means for a guitar to be \"digital.\" While most guitars have pickups to amplify the sound of vibrating strings, the gTar has none - instead, we've designed the gTar with sensors that detect exactly what you're playing in real-time and relay each note to your iPhone, which then produces the actual sound. This makes it possible for us to do all kinds of exciting things, so let's get into it! Start With Songs You Already Love The free gTar app comes bundled with a library of songs that you can start playing right away. We're adding more every week and we'd love to hear your suggestions. \u00a0Also, if you've been itching to play a specific song check out the Song Selection reward tier where we will work with you to get a song of your choosing on to the platform. \u00a0One of the things that's so exciting about the gTar is the ability to incorporate different sounds outside of the guitar. So if you want to play a song with a big, warm synth or a booming grand piano, it's all possible with the gTar. Stop Learning, Just Play We think that everybody should be able to have fun playing music, regardless of how long they've been playing or how much time they have to practice. That's why we built an intuitive feature called SmartPlay, which mutes out incorrect notes as you play and nudges you along as you play through difficult songs. Most Guitars Only Have One Level of Difficulty. We Have Three. If you've never played the guitar before, start with Easy, where you only need to play the open strings. This gives you the chance to start playing your favorite songs right away while getting a hands on feel for the strings. SmartPlay is in effect here, so if you\u00a0accidentally\u00a0hit the wrong string, you won't hear anything.\u00a0 When you've graduated from Easy, you can move up to Medium and start playing the frets and strings at the same time. Don't worry though, Smart Play is still in effect, so you can continue to play without the fear of messing up. When you've mastered a song and want to take it to the next level, try playing in Hard. Here,\u00a0the gTar will continue to display the correct notes, but allows you to play whatever you want. SmartPlay stops working here, so every note you play will ring out. Go Further Since the gTar is powered by the iPhone, it can sound however you want. Try playing around in Free Play, where you can choose from a variety of guitar models, keyboards, synths, or even drums. Free Play also provides an expression pad for tweaking sound effects (chorus, echo, reverb, and distortion) and a panel that gives you full control of the LEDs. Where Does the Money Go? Over the last year, we've taken our completed hardware design to China where we've been working with an amazing manufacturing team in Shenzhen that have helped us take the gTar from a schematic to a finished product. The gTars in the photos/video you see are all working, fully functional prototypes. We've already invested in the tooling and have lined up our supply chain. \u00a0We now need your help to fund the initial batch of production units. After the campaign ends, we expect it to take 2-3 months to produce, assemble, and ship your finished gTars. More specifically your contribution will help us fund the following: - Custom Guitar Body Manufacturing- Volume Component Ordering (sensors, processors)- Production Assembly- Production Quality Assurance and Testing Here's our team assembling the first pilot units. Due to the complexity of the gTar's assembly, we've had to iterate through more than 10 prototypes - these pilot units were built to ensure that our manufacturing processes would work at scale. The Story of the gTar Incident began out of a personal need for a guitar that could plug into the computer to compose music digitally. When the first functional prototypes started coming together, we were inspired by innovative musical instruments like the Monome and decided to try adding LEDs to the fretboard. We started to see how fun and easy it was for someone with no musical background to interact with the bright, colorful lights and we knew we had something worth pursuing.\u00a0 from L-R: Josh (Marketing/Branding), Marty (Engineering), Franco (Engineering), Maly (Design), Idan (Founder/Engineering) Developers/Hackers The gTar grew out of a series of hacks and we're very excited to see what the rest of you do to tweak and customize yours. We plan to offer an SDK in the future, so if you're interested in building apps for the gTar, shoot us an e-mail (dev@incidenttech.com). The gTar is also USB-MIDI compliant, so if you're interested in hacking the gTar to create/perform music, we'll be releasing some tutorials and hacks soon! Specs Size: 35\"L x 13\" W x 1.75\" DConnections: USB, 1/4\" Line Out, SmartPickPower: Internal 5000 mAh Li-Ion Battery, Charging via. USB App + gTar Compatibility: iPhone 4/4S (app + gTar)\u00a0 gTar Hardware Compatibility: Any CoreMIDI/USB-MIDI enabled device (includes other devices running iOS 5, Android, and Mac OSX) In the Box - Padded Backpack Gig Bag - Guitar Strap- USB Charger (1A 5V)- USB Cable- Two Sets of Replacement Strings- Three SmartPicks- Line-out Headphone AdapteriPhone not included FAQ Does the gTar need to be tuned?\u00a0Since the gTar is entirely digital, it doesn't care whether the strings are in tune or not. Keeping reasonable tension on the strings will improve the performance and sensitivity of the gTar. Where does the gTar get power from?\u00a0The gTar has an internal battery that lasts between 6 to 8 hours on a full charge. \u00a0To both power and charge the gTar, you can use the included USB charger or plug the gTar into any standard USB dock on a computer or charger of equivalent power.\u00a0 What phones will be supported? Currently we plan to support the iPhone 4/4S. We hope to support other devices in the future. How do I get the gTar app? The gTar app will be available for free in the App Store before we ship the gTar. It is already been built and approved. Will this teach me how to play on a \"normal\" guitar? The strings and fret layout of the gTar has been designed to be virtually identical to that of a traditional guitar, playing it will teach you the same fundamentals that you would need to play on a traditional guitar. How do Song Selections work? If you've selected any of the reward tiers that offer you a Song Selection, we will work with you to integrate a song of your choosing into the app. Since some things (like licensing restrictions) are out of our hands, we can't guarantee that we'll be able to include your first choice. However, we'll work with you to find something you like and will enjoy playing on the gTar.Can I integrate the gTar into an existing guitar?The gTar is a completely redesigned solution that cannot be retrofitted onto a traditional guitar. \u00a0If you are a guitar manufacturer that is interested in integrating our technology into your designs, please contact us directly. \u00a0 What is Little Kids Rock? Little Kids Rock is an amazing non-profit that brings guitars and music lessons to kids and schools who wouldn't otherwise have access to them. Our special Little Kids Rock reward tier allows you to purchase two gTars - one for you and one to be donated to LKR as part of a pilot program we're launching. To learn more, check out LittleKidsRock.org! What about international shipping? Shipping a guitar around the world is no easy task, but we wanted to make the gTar as accessible as possible for international backers. For backers in Canada, shipping is a flat fee of $10. For everywhere else in the world, shipping is $60. You can add this to an existing pledge by selecting \"Manage My Pledge\" and adjusting it appropriately.",
  "What is it? Well, it's like a thing. Not just any thing. Like a round thing, with stripes. \u00a0Basically, we are two guys who have spent years...come to think of the possible cumulative time, probably literally years, of time talking about comics, animated series based on comics, live action series based on comics, movies based on comics, movies NOT based on comics, the occasional book that isn't a comic, tv shows, and actors. We know a lot. Seriously, we really do. Sometimes people like listening to us. Very often people enjoy engaging in a long discussion about one of those topics we love so much. Sometimes I cannot control myself and jump in the middle of a conversation because I love what they are talking about and realize, this isn't where I parked my car! We know Easter eggs, we know spoilers. We know the most random, archaic stuff you'd never think of, AND we are funny. Come on, its worth a buck isn't it???",

The diversity and triumph of our contributors' creative writing and artwork makes for a stunning array of voices.

Her desire to play make-believe is what got her into filmmaking in the first place; she\u2019ll be graduating with a BFA in Directing from Temple University in Spring 2018. What's happening after college? She'll be living in sweet, sweet debt in Los Angeles, California, where she studied away this summer, interning at Women In Film and Fenty Corp. She hopes to work in development and write and direct comedies for both television and film. She's been on the writing team for Temple Smash, Temple\u2019s student-run sketch comedy show, since her junior year. Next semester, she'll be co-head writer, meaning there's going to be an influx of sketches about talking animals. Fun fact! With the money she (hopes to) make from filmmaking, she wants to open up a Montessori school in her home state of Maryland where Uggs will be banned and puka shell necklaces will be mandatory.  Ryan Kuna (Director of Photography):\u00a0Ryan is a junior at Temple University where he's majoring in film with a concentration in cinematography and minoring in art history. He\u2019s famous for being super passionate about lighting, so much so that we're convinced Sean Paul\u2019s 2002 hit, \u201cGimme The Light\u201d, was written specifically for him. On top of being an amazing DP, Ryan is also a lover of cashews, a stand-up guy, and a hard worker. He's currently working on a feature called Chuck Lawson and the Night of the Invaders with director and frequent collaborator, Tyler Bonner, who will also be acting in Abort Mission! Deanna Crawford (Producer):\u00a0Deanna is a current senior at Temple University finishing her degree in Film and Media Arts with a minor in Psychology. She is currently the production office intern for Lavelle Productions where she assists with transcripts, organization and research for a feature length documentary they're producing. She's previously worked as a producer and unit production manager on films such as True Grit LIVE!, Fleshing Out, and The Shepherd. Her pastimes include writing, playing the piano, and hanging out with her cats. In the future, she hopes to continue to produce content that features the voices of women and people of color.\n  Ian Mansberger (Editor):\u00a0Ian is a senior at Temple where he is majoring in film with a concentration in post-production. He took part in Temple's LA study away program last spring where he interned at The Hollywood Reporter. He did SUCH an amazing job that they extended his internship all the way through July! Dude is GOOD. Ian's ultimate dream? Editing for television as well as for world-renowned acapella group, Pentatonix\u2019s, music videos. Ian loves Pentatonix. Seriously, Ian, geez. But, I get it they're incredible. Devin O\u2019Brien (Co-Producer): Devin is a sophomore film major at Temple University who has worked alongside Brianna since the beginning of his freshman year. He is a writer for TUTV\u2019s Temple Smash, and this semester he will be joining Brianna as co-head writer. They aim to flood the show with sketches about Lucas Grabeel of High School Musical and Foodboy fame, Lucas if you\u2019re out there please donate, we might even have a cameo spot for you. Devin is also Vice President of Temple\u2019s Improv Club, is a founding member of improv team The Parliament, and piloted the role of Johnny in the world premiere of Green Day\u2019s American Idiot on a high school stage. \n Claudia Hoffman (Line Producer):\u00a0Claudia is a sophomore film student at Temple. She hopes to take part in the Producing concentration, which will ultimately aid her in journey toward meeting and working with her favorite artist, Frank Ocean. Claudia LOVES film, it\u2019s usually all she\u2019s ever thinking about. She wants to graduate and move to New York to pursue her producing career and hopefully along the way make some very ~cool~ films and a lot of great memes. If you know of any good food places in the Philly or NYC area, she will gladly take suggestions.\n Fiona Tagliente (Line Producer):\u00a0Fiona is a writer, comedian and overall jazzy person born and raised in South Philly (sad). She\u2019s a sophomore at Temple where she majors in film and will eventually concentrate in Screenwriting. She enjoys doing stand-up and writing sketches but when she's not doing the funnies, she likes to watch lots of trashy reality shows and read conspiracy theories. After college she wants to work in the world of television and one day, write and produce her own television show. Fiona also notes that she hopes to eventually stop catfishing her brother and get really good at cursive.\n Jaclyn Silvestri (Location Consultant): Jaclyn Silvestri is a junior Media Studies and Production major with a concentration in Media Production. Currently, she serves as Lighting Director/Producer/Social Media Coordinator for the TUTV program, Temple SMASH, which is Temple University\u2019s student-run live sketch comedy show much like Saturday Night Live.\u00a0Jaclyn is super stoked to be a part of this project because she loves comedy, women\u2019s rights, equal representation in media, Brianna\u2019s comedic wit and Ryan\u2019s sick lights. Jaclyn hopes to move up in her producing experience, both in television and film, and loves having the ability to do both because of these super dope creative funny people! Udochi Ekwerike (Production Designer): Udochi, a Philadelphia native,\u00a0is in her third year at Temple University studying Film and Media Arts with a BFA concentration in Screenwriting. In her three years at Temple,\u00a0Udochi\u00a0has been developing herself into a writer-director, producer and art director. Her current work has been featured in Temple University's Diamond Screen Film Festival as well as The Blackstar Film Festival. Udochi is also a top tier human being and deserves all the Fenty Beauty her heart desires. \n Bryn Antaran (Assistant Director): Brynn Antaran is an undergraduate film student in her third year at Temple University. She's recently been accepted into the Directing BFA program and is using her new knowledge to create stories that explore feminist issues and American regionalism. She also makes a mean chocolate chip cookie. Catch her on the next episode of TLC's 'My Strange Addiction' obsessing over organizing spreadsheets into the wee hours of the morn.\n In addition to the ten of us, there are a number of current and past Temple students signed on to make the film the best and weirdest it can be!\u00a0 I love high school movies. It's my favorite genre of movie\u2014sorry not sorry to anyone who thinks I'm garbage for that (Apocalypse Now SUCKS. Just kidding,\u00a0I haven't seen it but I know in my heart of hearts that Ferris Bueller's Day Off is light years better). My infatuation with these comedies inspired me to make something slightly more mature, and with slightly more people of color than we're used to seeing in those films...and by slightly I mean that unlike most films in general, this one stars two women of color. What's important to note about this film is that the story is not specific to women of color, and that's kind of the point; majority of the films and TV shows that come out of Hollywood star mostly white people for no reason at all. There's nothing about the characters' lifestyles that makes it pertinent for them to be white, so why continue to disregard the lack or representation that's industry-wide? Even when there is representation, the characters of color can often be stereotypical or white-washed. I acknowledge the progress Hollywood has made over the years, but for a show like Game of Thrones (which is FANTASY) to have as little diversity as it does, makes absolutely no sense. On top of my want to prioritize diversity, it is also important to me to normalize women's health issues by showing Jasmine's want for an abortion without going into depth into her justification for it, or talking about the morality at all. I believe it is a woman's right to choose what they want to do with their bodies, and our various health issues and needs should not be politicized or shamed. This is not a comedy about abortion, but abortion is an aspect of the story. Seriously, there aren't even any abortion jokes in it however, the first drafts of the script are a different story... Unfortunately, Ryan won't agree to shoot the film on an LG Chocolate, so majority of our budget will be allotted to camera equipment. We're trying to achieve a very specific, vintage-y, camera-movement heavy look with this film. Anamorphic lenses allow us to shoot in a widescreen format and fill our compositions with a lot of detail so that we can best convey visually\u00a0the story and all of it's weird quirks.\u00a0 Additional equipment funds will be spent on car rigs for our car scenes in which we have to put the camera on the hood of the car (No, unfortunately there won't be any car chase scenes featuring Vin Diesel. He's unavailable). We need the proper gear to ensure that the lighting and camera setups are done safely.\u00a0 Also, we need to feed our crew so that everybody stays happy and nobody walks off because of a limited number of granola bars.\u00a0 Below is\u00a0a breakdown of our needs in the form of an aesthetically pleasing chart: \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the rewards pictured below (Abort Mission condom, notebook, T-shirt, and poster), we are also offering special thank you videos in which Brianna and Ryan will dance to the Beyonc\u00e9 song of your choice! Or, if you want to get REAL fancy, we could make a music video of us dancing to any song of your choice. If you feel like pledging our entire budget, Brianna will tattoo Michael Cera's knees on her. Seem random? We actually mention his knees in the script, so it's pretty relevant. She's willing to live with the illustration of the knees of a stranger on her forever if it means this film will get made, and it will only get made with your support! We're going all or nothing, dude!!!\u00a0 \u00a0",
  "\ud83d\udc95Hello \u00e0 tous , j\u2019esp\u00e8re que vous allez bien ? Nous voici donc pour un nouveau projet qui se nomme \"Lovely World\" Ce projet est r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en hommage aux 30 ans du parc Disneyland Paris. N'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 me donner des retours, me dire quels sont vos pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s, cela fait toujours plaisir d'\u00e9changer \u2764\ufe0f Pour ceux qui ne me connaissent pas je suis Auxane alias Lecailloumagique sur instagram et ici-m\u00eame ;) (vous pouvez retrouver mes cr\u00e9ations sur mon site lecailloumagique, ainsi que sur\u00a0instagram ) \ud83d\udc95Le kickstarter se d\u00e9roulera par paliers, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire que chaque pin\u2019s sera d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9 une fois un montant particulier atteint. \ud83d\udc95Les pin\u2019s seront de tailles diff\u00e9rentes, vous pourrez retrouver 3 cat\u00e8gories de pin's, les \"Jumbo\" qui feront environ 10cm de hauteur, les \"Medium\" qui feront entre 5 et 6cm \u00a0et enfin les \"Tiny\" qui seront des ensembles de petits pin's de 2cm de haut. \ud83d\udc95Les prix varieront donc en fonction de la taille des pin's. Pour rappel, le prix des pin's est calcul\u00e9 en prenant en compte beaucoup d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments, les tailles des pin's, le nombre de couleurs, s'il y a des couleurs sp\u00e9ciales ou non (paillettes, glow in the dark...), le print, mais \u00e9galement les frais annexes comme les frais de livraisons, les emballages, les frais kickstarter, les cotisations ainsi que le temps de travail. \ud83d\udc95Vous pouvez retrouver les design individuellement ci-dessous \u00a0et les infos-pratiques en dessous de ceux-ci.\u2764\ufe0f \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83d\udc95Hello to all, hope you are well? So here we are for a new project which is called \"Lovely World\" This project is made as a tribute to the 30 years of Disneyland Paris park. Do not hesitate to give me feedback, tell me what are your favorites, it's always a pleasure to exchange \u2764\ufe0f For those who don't know me I'm Auxane aka Lecailloumagique on instagram and here ;) (you can find my creations on my website lecailloumagique, as well as on instagram ) \ud83d\udc95The kickstarter will be in tiers, meaning that each pin will be unlocked once a particular amount is reached. \ud83d\udc95The pins will be of different sizes, you will be able to find 3 categories of pins, the \"Jumbo\" which will be about 10cm high, the \"Medium\" which will be between 5 and 6cm and finally the \"Tiny\" which will be sets of small pins of 2cm high. \ud83d\udc95Prices will therefore vary depending on the size of the pins. As a reminder, the price of the pins is calculated by taking into account many elements, the sizes of the pins, the number of colors, if there are special colors or not (glitter, glow in the dark...), the print, but also the additional costs such as delivery costs, packaging, kickstarter fees, contributions as well as the working time. \ud83d\udc95You can find the designs individually below and the practical info below them.\u2764\ufe0f \u2728Si le Kickstarter atteint son objectif de financement , alors Kickstarter versera les fonds sur mon compte deux semaines apr\u00e8s la fin de la campagne. \u2728Suite \u00e0 cela, les pin\u2019s partiront en production. La livraison des pin\u00b4s est pr\u00e9vue pour Novembre 2022 (\u00e0 noter qu\u2019il peut y avoir de l\u2019avance ce qui serait top ! J'ai pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 vous donner une date de livraison lointaine afin d'\u00e9viter les probl\u00e8mes de retards cons\u00e9quents rencontr\u00e9s avec les usines) \u2728De tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8res modifications de couleurs peuvent \u00e9ventuellement \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es \u00e9galement, mais pas de Panique ! Cela sera presque semblable et je vous montrera tout l\u2019avancement durant le projet \u2764\ufe0f \u2728\u00c0 noter \u00e9galement qu'il est important de savoir qu'aucun pin's n'est parfait! ce sont des objets fait \u00e0 la main et il se peut donc que de micro d\u00e9fauts soient pr\u00e9sents sur vos pin's.\u00a0 Questions r\u00e9curantes: Des early Birds \u00a0ce sont tout simplement des pin\u2019s (r\u00e9compenses) \u00e0 prix r\u00e9duits, ils sont en quantit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9s et ce sont donc les premiers contributeurs qui pourront en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier \ud83e\udd70 Tout d\u2019abord il y a un avantage en ce qui concerne le prix , les pin\u2019s seront propos\u00e9s \u00e0 des tarifs avantageux sur le kickstarter (et encore plus avantageux pour les early birds), et seront par la suite vendus plus chers sur la boutique en ligne. En participant au kickstarter, vous vous assurez \u00e9galement d\u2019obtenir les pin\u2019s que vous souhaitez. En effet , la commande de pin\u2019s aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019usine se fait en fonction de vos choix ! Il y aura ensuite un stock sur la boutique mais assez r\u00e9duit , ce qui ne garanti pas que vous puissiez les avoir par la suite . Si le financement n\u2019est pas atteint , alors les contributeurs ne seront pas pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s et les pin\u2019s ne seront pas produits. Vous serez pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s une fois le kickstarter termin\u00e9 (uniquement si le financement est atteint). OUI , une fois la campagne de financement termin\u00e9e , vous recevrez un questionnaire dans lequel vous pourrez notifier vos coordonn\u00e9es ainsi que les pin\u2019s d\u00e9sir\u00e9s. Cependant, ce kickstarter est pr\u00e9vu sous forme de paliers. C\u2019est \u00e0 dire que vous pourrez choisir uniquement parmi les pin\u2019s d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s. Si tous les pin\u2019s sont d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s (4800\u20ac) alors la question ne se pose plus \ud83d\ude18. OUI, vous pouvez modifier \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel moment de la campagne votre contribution tout simplement en vous connectant sur votre compte. \u00a0N\u00e9anmoins, soyez s\u00fbrs avant de participer , les annulations ou reductions de contributions cr\u00e9ent de faux espoirs . Je vous remercie tous par avance , encore une fois, que la force soit avec nous et n\u2019oubliez pas ... YOU ARE THE BEST \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc95 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u2728If the Kickstarter reaches its funding goal , then Kickstarter will release the funds to my account two weeks after the campaign ends. \u2728Following that, the pins will go into production. Delivery of the pins is scheduled for November 2022 (note that there may be some advance notice which would be great! I preferred to give a long delivery date to avoid the problems of delays encountered with the factories for the Mythical Scenes project part 2) Some very slight color changes may be made as well, but don't panic! This will be almost similar and I will show you all the progress during the project \u2764\ufe0f \u2728Also note that it's important to know that no pin is perfect! These are handmade items so there may be micro flaws on your pins. Early Birds are simply pins (rewards) at reduced prices, they are in very limited quantities and it is therefore the first contributors who will benefit from them \ud83e\udd70 First of all there is an advantage regarding the price , the pins will be proposed at a chipper price on the kickstarter (and more cheaper for early birds), and will be thereafter at a more expensive price on the online store. By participating in the kickstarter, you also ensure to get the pins you want. Indeed, the order of pins from the factory is made according to your choices! There will then be a stock on the store but quite reduced, which does not guarantee that you can have them thereafter. If the funding is not reached, then the contributors will not be charged and the pins will not be produced. You will be charged once the kickstarter ends (only if the funding is reached). YES, once the funding campaign is over, you will receive a questionnaire in which you will be able to notify your contact information as well as the pins you want. However, this kickstarter is planned in stages. This means that you will only be able to choose from the unlocked pins. If all the pins are unlocked (5800\u20ac) then the question no longer arises \ud83d\ude18. YES, you can change your contribution at any time during the campaign simply by logging into your account. \u00a0Nevertheless, be sure before participating , cancellations or reductions of contributions create false hopes . I thank you all in advance, once again, may the force be with us and do not forget ... YOU ARE THE BEST \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc95",
  "\"Why was this character gay? It didn't add\nanything to the story.\" \"It was distracting how he had a husband\ninstead of a wife. It made the story hard to read.\" \"If she was a\nlesbian, why didn't you say anything during her first appearance? This feels like\na retcon.\" Even in science fiction, supposedly the genre of limitless possibility, where everyone is invited to the adventure, heterosexual, heteroromantic, and cisgendered are considered the default, to the extent that everything else is \"deviation,\" and must be eyed with suspicion.  (For a timely example, look no further than the people recutting and remixing the recent finale of a popular animated series to take away the bisexuality of the main character (no spoilers!).\u00a0Because only a male/female happy ending can truly be considered \"happy.\") Having\nalready invited women to destroy science fiction, it was only fitting that\nLIGHTSPEED look for a new group of individuals who wanted to trade their\nfeelings of marginalization for sledgehammers, and the \"I Want to Destroy\nSF\" inbox filled up all over again. People really wanted to break things\nin that most magnificent of ways: with prose.\n\nWe're\nhere. We have always been here. And we are very, very excited to show it.\nLIGHTSPEED was founded on the core idea\nthat all science fiction is real science fiction. The whole point of this\nmagazine is that science fiction is vast. It is inclusive. Science fiction is\nabout people, and queer people, no matter how they identify [Gay, lesbian, bisexual, demisexual, asexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, genderfluid, genderqueer--anyone who fits within the QUILTBAG], are a big part of\nthat. We always have been. We're just sometimes hard to see. So, in the\ninterests of visibility and breaking stuff, here we are to show you just how\nwide the spectrum of sexuality and gender identity can really be. Part of our goal with this project--and indeed, our dearest wish--is to get as many queer creators involved as possible. Show the world that we are legion, we are amazing, and we are a part of the great, glorious landscape of the science fiction genre (right before we burn it all to the ground). We're\nso excited. If you're excited too, and not just in the I GOTTA HAVE THIS THING sort of way but in the I GOTTA BE PART OF THIS kind of way, good news! If you write fiction, we're currently open to submissions for the issue. If you don't write fiction, or even if you do, but you want to help out in some other way, the best thing you can do is help spread the word about this campaign. And if you have other ways you'd like to help, we're happy to listen! We\u2019ll publish the special issue whether the campaign is successful or not, but the campaign will determine how big and awesome we make the issue.\u00a0If we raise just $5000, we\u2019ll be able to make the special issue a special\u00a0double-sized issue,and if we raise even more than that, we have a few really excellent stretch goals lined up as well.\u00a0 A regular issue of LIGHTSPEED contains an equal mix of science fiction and fantasy short fiction, consisting of 4 original stories, 4 reprints, plus a novella reprint (exclusive to our ebook edition). Each issue also includes a feature interview, a book review column, an artist showcase, and spotlights on the authors who appear in the issue.\u00a0 If we successfully fund, the special DOUBLE issue will contain the following\u00a0additional\u00a0material: And naturally, all of the above will all be authored entirely by queer creators. For this special issue, control of the magazine has been handed over to a talented team of queer creators: Steve Berman\u00a0has edited more than thirty anthologies, including the Shirley Jackson Award finalist, Where Thy Dark Eye Glances: Queering Edgar Allan Poe and the annual series Wilde Stories: The Year's Best Gay Speculative Fiction, which has been a two-time finalist for the Lambda Literary Award. His gay YA novel, Vintage, was a finalist for the Andre Norton Award. He founded Lethe Press, one of the larger LGBT publishers, in 2001. He resides in New Jersey, the only state in the Union with an official devil. Paul Boehmer attended his first Shakespearean play while in high school; he knew then that he was destined to become the classically trained actor he is today. Graduating with a Masters Degree, Paul was cast as Hamlet by the very stage actor who inspired his career path. A nod from the Universe he'd chosen aright! Paul has worked on Broadway and extensively in Regional Theatre; coinciding with another of his passions, Sci-Fi, Paul has been cast in various roles in many episodes of Star Trek. Paul's love of literature and learning led him by nature to his work as a narrator for Books on Tape, his latest endeavour. Paul is married to the love of his life, Offir and they live in Los Angeles with their two midnight-rambling Tomcats Dread & David. Cecil Baldwin is the voice of the wildly popular podcast\u00a0Welcome to Night Vale,\u00a0written by Joseph Fink and Jeffery Cranor. Cecil plays Cecil Palmer, a radio host who reports on the strange goings-on in Night Vale, a desert community where monsters and conspiracies are just daily occurrences. Sigrid Ellis\u00a0is co-editor of the Hugo-nominated Queers Dig Time Lords and Chicks Dig Comics anthologies. She edits the best-selling Pretty Deadly from Image Comics and edited the Hugo-nominated Apex Magazine in 2014. She lives with her partner, their two homeschooled children, her partner\u2019s boyfriend, and a host of vertebrate and invertebrate pets in Saint Paul, MN. What if you could re-live the experience of reading a book (or watching a show) for the first time?\u00a0Mark Oshiro\u00a0provides just such a thing on a daily basis on Mark Reads\u00a0and Mark Watches, where he chronicles his unspoiled journey through various television and book series. He mixes textual analysis, confessional blogging, and humor to analyze fiction that usually makes him cry and yell on camera. He\u2019s been nominated for a Hugo in the Fan Writer category in 2013 and 2014 for his work, and he\u2019s nearly done with his first novel. Wendy N. Wagner\u00a0grew up in a town so small it didn\u2019t even have its own post office, and the bookmobile\u2019s fortnightly visit was her lifeline to the world. Her short fiction has appeared in magazines and anthologies including\u00a0Beneath Ceaseless Skies,The Lovecraft eZine,\u00a0Armored,\u00a0The Way of the Wizard, and\u00a0Heiresses of Russ 2013: The Year\u2019s Best Lesbian Speculative Fiction. Her first novel,\u00a0Skinwalkers, is a Pathfinder Tales adventure. An avid gamer and gardener, she lives in Portland, Oregon, with her very understanding family. Follow her on Twitter @wnwagner. LIGHTSPEED (lightspeedmagazine.com) is a digital science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF\u2014and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales. When you read LIGHTSPEED, it is our hope that you\u2019ll see where science fiction and fantasy comes from, where it is now, and where it\u2019s going. LIGHTSPEED\u00a0is a winner of the Hugo Award (and four-time finalist), and\u00a0stories from LIGHTSPEED have been nominated for the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Award, and the World Fantasy Award.\u00a0Last year, we crowdfunded our first \"Destroy\" special issue,\u00a0Women Destroy Science Fiction!, which was named one of NPR's best books of 2014. When not doing special issues devoted to destroying science fiction, LIGHTSPEED is usually edited by bestselling anthologist John Joseph Adams, editor of anthologies such as\u00a0Wastelands, The Living Dead, and Brave New Worlds, and series\u00a0editor of Best American Science Fiction & Fantasy. All of the money raised by this project will be used to fund the publication of the Queers Destroy Science Fiction! special issue and related stretch goals. Anything leftover after that will go toward the production of future issues of LIGHTSPEED. In the event we massively exceed our goal, we'd like to thank our backers by offering the following stretch goals: $10,000 - Essays & Artwork Booster - UNLOCKED! The Personal Essays we're posting on Kickstarter throughout the campaign will also be included in the issue, and we'll double the number of stories illustrated in the issue from four to eight. $15,000 - Destroy/Subscriptions Booster\u00a0- UNLOCKED! If you chose a LIGHTSPEED subscription reward, you'll get LIGHTSPEED issues #1-61 (including the Queers Destroy Science Fiction! issue), and your subscription will begin with #62 (July 2015). If you already have issues #1-61, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-58. If you chose a NIGHTMARE subscription reward, you'll get access to NIGHTMARE issues #1-33, and your subscription will begin with #34 (July 2015).\u00a0If you already have issues #1-33, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-58. All other reward tiers will get 3 additional back issues of LIGHTSPEED (for a total of 6), plus\u00a03 back issues of NIGHTMARE and 3 back issues of FANTASY. $20,000 -\u00a0JJA Queer Sampler - UNLOCKED! LIGHTSPEED publisher John Joseph Adams will assemble an ebook sampler of queer stories previously selected for publication in his many projects. It will be made available exclusively to backers of this Kickstarter. Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be like a short anthology (about 50K words; about half the size of a normal anthology).\u00a0[Estimated delivery: Jun. 2015] $25,000 - Podcasts Booster - UNLOCKED! We normally podcast 4 (out of 8) stories we publish on our website each month. If we reach this stretch goal, we'll podcast all 7 short stories we publish on the website, plus one of the flash fiction pieces.\u00a0[Estimated delivery: Jun. 2015] $30,000 -\u00a0Queers Destroy Horror! - UNLOCKED! We'll publish an additional special issue, Queers Destroy Horror! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine, NIGHTMARE. [Estimated delivery: Oct. 2015] $35,000 - Queers Destroy Filk! - UNLOCKED! Seanan McGuire, who in addition to being an amazing writer and our amazing guest editor, is an amazing filk artist. If we unlock this stretch goal, she will write a song about destroying science fiction. We'll post the song online so it can be shared with anyone and also downloaded as an MP3.\u00a0[Estimated delivery: Jun. 2015] $40,000 -\u00a0Queers Destroy Fantasy! - UNLOCKED! We'll publish an additional special issue, Queers Destroy Fantasy! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward.\u00a0It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine,\u00a0FANTASY. FANTASY merged with LIGHTSPEED in 2012, but we'll revive it for this one special issue. [Estimated delivery: Dec. 2015] $50,000 - JJA Queer Anthology Booster - UNLOCKED! We'll make the JJA Queer Sampler (the $20K stretch goal) into a full-sized anthology (about 100K words, about 20-25 stories).\u00a0Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward.\u00a0[Estimated delivery: Jun. 2015] We\u2019ve had a lot of requests for special reward packages since we didn\u2019t offer every possible combination of items. Well, we hear you, backers! So we decided to go ahead and offer reward \u201cadd-ons\u201d to allow you greater flexibility in backing the campaign.\n\n To add an add-on to your pledge, click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button, then increase your pledge by the relevant amount. For instance, if you want to add ebooks of the Women Destroy special issues, you would increase your pledge by Pledge $10; or, if you wanted those AND the Women Destroy Fantasy issue in trade paperback, you would increase your pledge by Pledge $27 (Pledge $10 + Pledge $17). Make sense?\n\n There\u2019s no way to tell us NOW which add-ons you want (an unfortunate limitation of Kickstarter), so we\u2019ll get that information from you during the Kickstarter survey process after the campaign is over.

  "This project is a part of our studies abroad and supervised by our lecturer Dirk Hoyer. Most of the team-members are also German film students, but the project is also supported by local students. \u00a0 Most of us have already worked together and love working together: \u00a0 After reading about the first robots that are being used as a helping hand in social work we were intrigued. The discussion about robots and androids is more relevant than ever! Nonetheless all movies about the human-robot-relationship we could find were too dramatic or even melodramatic in our opion. That's why we wanted to create a short film that is dealing with the topic, but with a rather light and funny/sarcastically look on it. In this case it's what the human does to the robot than the other way around. Unfortunately a production has a lot of expenses: The amounts of the budget will be used as displayed below: \u00a0",

The nearby Army base Ft. Lee, recently underwent a major construction project which added on more space and bringing more military personnel and their families to the area. In recognizing the population growth and less entertainment, there is a lane for providing such. After several years of contemplation January 2016 I launched my own company Renaissance Entertainment Group a company to create a lane that would provide quality entertainment to the community in which I live. On March 3rd (my birthday) we held our first concert. The video above recaps part of the awesome magical night. In starting this project on kick starter the funds generated would allow Renaissance Entertainment to book quality entertainment in a timely manner, market and advertise fully in television, radio and print, also create a calendar of events for future planning by the artist fan base.",

  "This campaign will help fund Company 157's production of \"Sisters Matsumoto\" by Philip Kan Gotanda. Company 157 is the oldest undergraduate student theatre organization at the University of California, San Diego. \"Sisters Matsumoto\" follows the story of three sisters returning to their childhood farmhouse in Stockton, California after years of incarceration and upheaval in Japanese American internment camps during World War II. Together, the sisters must navigate their new lives and reimagine their dreams. The show's co-directors, Alexa Mark and Halle Sousa, have wanted to bring this project to life for over a year and are so excited to see it finally coming together. They hope that the show not only teaches audiences about this important part of American history, but also helps promote racial diversity in the performing arts.",

  "Since starting Berg's Bags with my son two years ago, it has been our mission to make the best disc golf bags without compromise. The last two years of manufacturing our own bags has gotten us to the point of designing what we believe to be the best professional disc golf bag on the market.\u00a0The IceBerg is the sixth bag we have made to date.\u00a0 The IceBerg disc golf backpack has been designed and extensively tested by our entire Berg's team over the last six months, including the two current Australian MPO National champions. Luke (Bayney) Bayne, the other current doubles National MPO Champion will be at the European Open with the IceBerg in July this year. Every MPO champion in Australia will have an IceBerg this year, will you?? Don't miss out on this game changing disc golf backpack as they will sell out.\u00a0 PREVIOUS PROJECTS:). The Satchel\u00a0 The Wedge THE ICEBERG DESIGN TEAM\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thank you to the rest of the design team with a special shout out to\u00a0Reece Vellios (Disc Connection).\u00a0The IceBerg wouldn't be here without you!! As with any new project there are always challenges and risks. It is always possible to lose a shipment at sea, unforeseen logistics issue, or have a problem with manufacturing. In the last couple years our team of professionals have risen to the challenge of doing what many deemed impossible, by manufacturing and delivering all shipments on time in an uncertain world. If history is a precursor to the future, we can't be more confident in fulfilling our commitment to you. This is the greatest disc golf bag ever designed, and nothing will deter our amazing team from bringing this incredible disc golf bag to our disc golf family. The IceBerg disc golf backpack project team started with a stable and tough foundation in which the entire bag structure relies on. The bottom of the bag sits atop two full length rails for maximum stability. They have been strategically placed just far enough from the edges as to make it impossible to come into contact with the lower back, and provide maximum stability. These rails are set atop a thick very tough waterproof tarpaulin bottom panel. The rails also function to keep the base of the bag from shifting or moving. This design has been proven to be the best for stability, and for durability. The result is a very stable bag on uneven or sloped surfaces.\u00a0 The next step was to create a bag that can be worn all day in comfort. The double reinforced 1cm thick shoulder straps are to be connected at the top on the third prototype version. Having the shoulder strap fall across the entire upper back provides an even distribution of weight instead of directing all the weight onto two points on the shoulders. The IceBerg is equipped with two large upper back pads, and a full length lumbar pad which provides an airflow channel to keep your back dry. \u00a0 \u00a0Prototype Version 2 Has unconnected Straps\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prototype version 3 is slated to have a connected upper shoulder strap configuration with full length double reinforced straps(No D Rings)\u00a0 The vertical stature design of the IceBerg disc golf backpack keeps the centre of gravity when directly over the centre of the base rails. This makes the IceBerg extremely stable under all conditions. This is demonstrated in the IceBerg video above. Having a well balanced bag increases it's comfort as well.\u00a0 Well organized storage has been engineered in the IceBerg starting with a large divided top pocket, with room for up to eight discs.\u00a0 The IceBerg has a dedicated full length pocket for your stool, umbrella, or retriever.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two large expandable full length side pockets flank the IceBerg with the right side having a phone/small item pocket inside.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inside the full length side pocket on the left, there is tall item strap, a marker pocket, and an extra large marker pocket that will hold writing instruments of any size.\u00a0 The IceBerg Version 3 will have slightly larger side pockets measuring 80mm wide, which will accommodate 4 putters or mid-range drivers. \u00a0\u00a0 The left 80mm side pocket has a removable divider which will easily accommodate two extremely large drink bottles for those hot summer days. At the top of each side of the IceBerg there is another small zippered pocket that will accommodate a mini or other small item, and we have equipped the IceBerg with the latest waterproof zippers to keep your gear and discs dry . The final detail that we are most excited about is the 5 zippered-in removable supports which allow the IceBerg to fold flat so that it can fit into a suitcase or small car for travel.\u00a0\u00a0 Our whole team have tested two prototypes of the IceBerg in the last few months. In the first Prototype V1 we tested the the overall design shape, accessibility of discs, storage of gear, and its stability on uneven ground. A bag that falls over, or has inaccessible discs and accessories is just not functional or fun. The second Prototype V2 was a much closer representation of the final bag with the all the pockets and dividers in their final place. The outer shell of the bag is made from the highest quality water and dirt resistant 600D denier, and the inner liners are made from heavy duty 420D, not the standard 210D of many bag producers.\u00a0 Version three is in the process of being made with the new connected shoulder strap configuration. The current double 1cm thick strap design is pretty comfortable, but we are always pushing to see if we could make it even better in terms of comfort and strength. There will be also be dedicated putter pocket built into the front flap.\u00a0 This is the moment you can join the Berg's family. The Berg's team have designed the best disc golf backpack on the market, and this is your chance to get one.\u00a0 Thank you for your interest, Michael(Mr. Berg)Spangenberg :)",
  "The Hole Hog will be a self-aware, often ironic and satirical publication which looks at issues relevant to Arts students in Melbourne. Our editors are all Creative Writing majors with a thirst for silliness but a drive to push this project into reality. Despite its tendency to send itself up, there is the underlying aim within The Hole Hog of linking the community of Arts students together and creating discourse about issues that apply to us all. It will also be a publication which featuring work by emerging artists and students alike, giving opportunities for new voices and talents to be heard.\u00a0 It will take the format of a rather diminutive newspaper; an ironic reference to traditional publications of yesteryear. Most of the money raised through this campaign will be used to cover the cost of printing, though as this is a student project we have almost zero overheads (we're not getting paid!), so every single donation makes its way straight to either printing or possibly planning a launch event. As a result, we are grateful for any donations no matter how large or small.",
  "What we have heard over and over and over again from friends, popular queer writers, book reviews, and people on the internet is that the queer community wants to see stories about people like themselves that don't fixate on how \"alternative\" our lifestyle is, or the various \"issues\" we face, like coming out, transitioning, understanding their sexuality, etc. We want to enjoy the same awesome books, movies, video games, etc. that we have always enjoyed. We just want our protagonists to be queer. \u00a0Vitality is a literary magazine filled with entertaining stories of all genres that feature queer protagonists. We include short stories, poetry, comics, art, and anything else you can fit in a magazine. The possibilities are absolutely limitless. And every single one centers around queer people.\u00a0 We have already released a short mini zine to show off the kind of thing we're about. You can download it for free at our website - click here! But we need you to take these stories to the next level.\u00a0 Your donations will go directly towards making Vitality happen.\u00a0Our first issue is slated for early 2015, and we hope to make it about 60 pages long, filled cover to cover with short stories, flash fiction, poetry, comics, and art all centered around a positive portrayal of queerness. With your support, we will be able to pay our writers and artists a fair, industry-standard price for their work. This will encourage quality writers to submit to the magazine, and support queer artists, enabling them to produce even more great work.\u00a0 We will be able to create a beautiful, vibrant magazine without cluttering it up with ads. The only ads we will be printing will be minimal, and go in a special \"Thank you\" section at the back of the magazine, leaving the rest of the pages to be 100% content. We will be able to do a full-color print run of the magazine, as well as publish digital copies. Color printing costs a ton, and with your help we'll be able to print Vitality in all its glory without skimping on quality. If we are lucky enough to meet our goal of $5,000, we have prepared the following stretch goals: Here is a handy chart to help you figure out the reward levels: To download our sample mini-zine, go to ReadVitality.com/minizine! Our first issue will be along similar lines, but with loads more content. . Ads\u00a0: We will work with you to create your ad to the best of our ability. We have the right to refuse offensive or rude ads, or ads that violate the spirit of our magazine.\u00a0 The t-shirts will be screen-printed, cotton charcoal grey unisex t-shirts, and come in adult sizes from S-4XL. We are offering TWO OPTIONS for t-shirt designs. On the front, they will say \"I'm a ______\" and on the back \"and my story is vital\" with Vitality's url on the back. We will write in your custom identifier on the front in permanent, high-quality Vitality-blue t-shirt paint. We're going to use professional-grade t-shirt paint and heat cure it so it will not come off in the wash. The idea behind the shirts is to say \"I'm a [queer character] and my story is vital!\" so your shirt can say \"I'm an asexual astronaut\" or \"I'm a gay unicorn\" or \"I'm a transgender sorcerer,\" or anything you like! However, we will refuse to write rude or offensive things on the shirts, so keep it clean. This is an EXAMPLE of our idea for the t-shirt. Sizes and placement are not FINAL. Text, text color, shirt color, etc. are final, however.\u00a0 And when we handwrite it, it will look something like this. Again, note, we are actually going to hand-write these, so this digital image is just an example. ((for identities beginning with a vowel, we will add an n to make it \"I'm an.\")) This is an EXAMPLE of our idea for the t-shirt, not the exact t-shirt. But the front WILL have the logo and the back WILL say \"queer stories are vital.\"\u00a0 Stuff packs - two stickers and two bookmarks with the Vitality logo. Stickers will be vinyl 2 x 3\" stickers with rounded edges. Bookmarks will be double-sided with rounded edges with the Vitality logo on one side and \"queer stories are vital\" on the other side. A rough example of what we're going for with the sticker and bookmak designs: \u00a0^^NOTE: NOT THE FINAL DESIGNS. ROUGH EXAMPLE ONLY.^^ Due to Kickstarter regulations, we cannot provide more than 10 of a single item. The only exception to this would be if you would like to purchase copies of the first issue to donate to a GSA, library, or other organization that would not actually be sent to you, and even then, we cannot send more than 10 to a single location.  For t-shirts - add $15 for each additional t-shirt.\u00a0 For copies of the first issue - add $10 for each additional copy. Stuff packs - add $5 to your pledge and receive an additional stuff pack containing two stickers and two bookmarks with the Vitality logo Dot Four Two Nine (online LGBT magazine) wrote a piece about Vitality Magazine for their culture section!

  "Camp Three Peaks is a rustic, Christian summer retreat for teenage girls! A week of hiking, adventure, and communing with the God of its 19th-century founders... a God that doesn't traditionally number people like 13-year-old Charlie Lamonte among His (Her? Their? Its?) flock. The only black camper in the group, and queer besides, she struggles to reconcile the innocent intent of the trip with the blinkered obliviousness of those determined to keep the Three Peaks tradition going. As the journey wears on and the rhetoric wears thin, Charlie can't help but poke holes in the pious disregard this storied sanctuary has for outsiders like herself\u2014and her fellow camper, Sydney.

  "About Don, Pat & Tom\u00a0 Hi! We are Don, Pat & Tom, an all-female theatre collective based in New York City and named after our founding members' fathers. We tell original stories and make our own work. This summer, we are premiering our inaugural production, leaves, at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe Festival at Greenside Studios with a New York preview at 59E59 Theaters' East to Edinburgh.\u00a0 Don, Pat & Tom is comprised of Alex Highsmith, Amanda Lea Mason, Eryn O'Sullivan, Kate Bancroft, Naomi Lindh, and Elizabeth May.\u00a0 Introducing leaves A brand new play with original music, unique puppetry and a bit of magic, leaves tells the story of three women grappling with their own myths. Mot, Rue, and Niamh\u00a0live in \u201cOutside Time,\u201d where there is no death - only leaving. Friends and family come and go, messages appear in various shapes, the poetry of Walt Whitman lives and breathes, yet things stay perfectly, monotonously the same. When a family crisis rocks the three women, they must band together to step outside of what they know, to a place inside time, where their ideas about the world must shift.\u00a0 leaves is directed by Elizabeth May and co-written/performed by founding members Alex Highsmith, Amanda Lea Mason, and Eryn O'Sullivan with production design by Kate Bancroft and production management by Naomi Lindh.\u00a0 leaves is our first production as a company! The show was born out of love and a need to tell women's stories. What began as a search for a three person, all-female play turned into developing a theater company focused on new, original work with a basis in personal mythology.\u00a0 Beginnings In August of 2018, our fledgling company flew to Edinburgh, Scotland - the site of the annual Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the largest of its kind in the world. We worked our little buns off all year to save for what was to be an educational journey; our goal was simply to check. it. out.\u00a0 Our eyes glimmered at the prospect of bringing our own work to an international stage. But we were ignorant in the ways of this mysterious foreign beast. What would we take? How would we get it there? Was this really possible? All we knew for sure was that we needed to get our hands dirty. So, on our own dime, we took a working-pleasure tour to Scotland- seeing as many shows as we could and learning so much our heads came real close to exploding for all the joy and art. This was where we wanted to introduce our new company to the world. Ed Fringe was perfect for us.\u00a0 Now, armed with information and buckets of ecstatic memories, our second journey to Scotland is underway. This time, we\u2019re bringing a show of our own.\u00a0And we're doing it right. What is the Edinburgh Fringe? The Edinburgh International Fringe Festival is a theatre festival in Scotland that runs throughout the month of August. It is the largest of its kind with performers, theatre companies, and tourists alike flocking to Edinburgh from all over the world. There are hundreds of shows every hour of every day, the streets are filled with music, food and \u00a0performers, and it seems as if the entirety of the UK and surrounding area shows up to partake.\u00a0 \u00a0A silent disco, 200 deep, skips down a main drag in Edinburgh during lunch time. What drew us to the Edinburgh Fringe specifically is that it is renowned for catapulting the careers of theatre artists on an international stage. Cool actors who've gotten their start at the Fringe include Steve Coogan, Trevor Noah, Tilda Swinton, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. We are over the moon to be included and to partner with Greenside Studios for our performances. They have created an incredible following and nurtured a sterling reputation with the festival over their 14 years in existence.\u00a0 Meet the Team Alex Highsmith (co-writer, performer) Alex Highsmith was raised in Utah and has been doing theatre since she was 8 (her first gig was singing the national anthem at a local high school karate tournament).

  "What is Dumbing of Age? It's a webcomic you can find on the Internet, and it's about freshmen entering college. It stars Joyce, a fundamentalist Christian who was previously homeschooled, and her unlikely new friend Dorothy, an atheist who wants to be President. They're surrounded by a varied cast of fully-realized characters, such as Billie, the alcoholic ex-cheerleader with a Resident Assistant problem(?), and Amber, the Internet shut-in who solves her rage issues by dressing up like a superhero and fighting crime.  Oh, right, and Joyce's childhood best friend, that unflappable smartass Becky, is hiding out from her jerkbutt dad 'cuz she was caught smooching her roommate! This book would collect \"Year Six,\" spanning the four storylines that start on August 31, 2015 and complete on September 3, 2016. This includes new commentary, behind-the-scenes artwork, and new character designs into an 228-page tome with luxurious glossy paper all bound up into a sturdy presentation.  Seriously, these books are gorgeous. Sometimes when we get solicitors I whip out a book to show them how pretty it is. And there will be a foreword by Jeph Jacques! \u00a0 In addition to the year of comics from the DumbingOfAge.com website, the book also includes 24 bonus comics that were originally created exclusively for the Dumbing of Age Patreon! \u00a0 There are also a few pages of bonus material including unused strips and alternate punchlines! To print 2000 copies of this first book at over $8 apiece, I'll need to raise approximately $17,000 to afford the printing costs. Add Kickstarter fees and taxes (oof) and the like, and that means I'll have to raise approximately $24,000 total. So that's the number on the board! Four years ago I did stretch goals to unlock website updates for Saturday and Sunday. Some of you thought updating 365 days a year would destroy me. Well, it did not! \u00a0IT ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER. And so let's keep that going. Stretch goals are in place to elongate those Saturday and Sunday updates for another year. Otherwise Saturday updates end on May 10 and Sunday updates end on May 30. More about stretch goals: Last two years I did die-cut character magnets, and that was pretty popular!  And so I'm gonna do more, right?  Obviously.  We're going to do them similarly to last time, as well, by unlocking some pledges for additional characters as we rise in pledges.  Ultimately, we will unlock a magnet that everyone who orders physical goods will receive if we reach a certain point! \u00a0So, at $50k, I will send 2\"x4\" Becky die-cut character magnets to everybody who ordered snail-mailable goods. If you ordered any number of real made-of-paper books, you'll get a Becky character magnet with your order! (Sorry, folks who pledge only for the PDF, but there are not envelopes for PDFs in which to put magnets!) But in the meantime, we'll start off with some pledge tiers of character magnets that you can choose from!  We got Jocelyne, we got Carla, and we've got both Jocelyne and Carla together!  Plus, we have a pledge level where you'll get every single magnet unlocked by the end of this Kickstarter.  \n\n\u00a0 Let's list these stretch goals all list-like:\u00a0 *\"everyone\" meaning all who pledge for physical goods Returning again this year are the digital commission reward pledge levels! For $100, $150, and $300, you can get a digital commission piece of artwork of one, two, or two characters totally making out, respectively! Each is at least 6\" long in some dimension, and will be sent to you in TIF and a smaller PNG form, the former of which you can get printed and framed if you like. Each one is unique, even if all of you ask for the same character!  At the $300 makeouts commission pledge level, you also get one each of all the magnets unlocked by the end of the Kickstarter. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "What it is:\u00a0 #irepresentNW is a movement we've created to showcase some of the most talented rappers, singer/songwriters, producers and visual artists the NW has to offer the world.\u00a0 How it will be done: We will do this in a series of elegantly produced 11/2 to 2 minute videos highlighting the artist, his or her local surroundings and their vision for the art-form. As our video team is preparing and releasing videos to the world, we will take to to the studio and create the music.\u00a0 Where it will take place: Spokane, Seattle, Portland... an artist from or currently residing in each city will be showcased in an #irepresentNW video.\u00a0 Who will be creating it: The ad campaign will be shot and edited by industry pro's Brandon White of Hoss Productions and Ian Cranston. The album will be recorded, mixed, and mastered by T. HEW!TT, a seasoned engineer and graduate of The Art Institute of Seattle's Audio Production Program. The manufacturing of the final product will be done tastefully and masterfully by a CD Replication company local to one of the 3 cities. Afterall, the point of this thing is to support the NW! Why it should be done: Between the parties involved, there is over 30 years of combined experience in the Audio, Video and Graphic Design fields. These are people who have dedicated most of their lives to their art. We have developed an amazing concept that will help show the world what the NW has to offer.\u00a0 Thank you very much for reading and pledging. We really hope you enjoy the final product!!!",

  "Hi Kick starters. Thank you for viewing my page. Your support is massively appreciated. The idea behind Dave's Delights has been something I have been working on for a few years. I love baking cakes and during my Chemistry degree, I took an experimental approach to baking and noticed that in slightly changing certain quantities i could improve the end product.\u00a0 I would squiggle these changes into a lab style book and it got me thinking, why not create a similar book so that people can bake like a chemist. Your help is needed to fund an initial print run of the book (not yet completed). This will help me to continue with the rest of the master-plan. Stage 1 - Cooking Book - This is the starting block for Dave's Delights. This will help me to establish a brand and create a platform to launch future ideas/projects detailed below.\u00a0 Stage 2 - Merchandise - This will be using the Dave's Delights logo. Current ideas include aprons, T-Shirts, Sauces, Hats. Stage 3 - Cafe - The idea is to start a cafe, possibly in the center of Manchester to help feed homeless people. Customers would purchase cakes/coffee and eat/drink. they would then put a postit note on a wall. If someone couldn't afford food, they would then take a note from the wall as the previous person had already covered it. I would also like to use this idea to offer employment to people who would otherwise be overlooked by society. This is the long term goal. Realistically\u00a0funding for this would probably need \u00a350k+ which is why I am starting with building a brand via the cook book and merchandise. \u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to read my project. Any support you can provide will be massively appreciated.\u00a0",
  "An introduction of what we are about Hello everyone, name is Marshall Long, and I am proud to launch this kickstarter campaign to get the \"Sunday Before Monday Podcast\" off the ground. \u00a0The whole idea for the podcast came because of a tradition my best friend Anthony and I have of meeting up every Sunday to catch up with each other and vent about the week, tell stories, and most importantly laugh. \u00a0It helps us get away from all of the noise of life, we cherish these Sundays, (hence the name Sunday Before Monday) and every time we meet we say to ourselves, \"We need to let people hear our conversations\", and now it has become our dream to put microphones in front of us while we talk so that we can let people hear our stories, and relate to our typical struggles and triumphs. Most of these stories are flat our hilarious, and we want to provide our audience with a bit of laughter before that Monday morning alarm clock goes off. \u00a0Our conversations lead down one rabbit hole to another, and the journey that our conversations take is amazing. \u00a0With Sunday Before Monday, you will get insight into intriguing topics, gut busting laugher, and unbelievable stories. We will cover any and all topics that you can think of. \u00a0There will be episodes about sports where we will have ex-proffesional athletes come on the show and give a backstage look at the life of a professional athlete. \u00a0Some of the episodes will cover the expanses of science, we'll have on guest such as medical surgeons, and astronomers. \u00a0Where we will then pick their brain about the wonders of their fields. \u00a0We also have 6 local stand up comedians who are scheduled to come on the show, and trust me, those episodes will be impossible not to laugh at. \u00a0So from sports, to science, to comedy, and so much more. \u00a0We will cover it all. The main focus of the \"Sunday Before Monday Podcast\" is to lighten up the \"Sunday Scaries\" and provide everyone with a 2-3 hour break from the stress of having to go back to work the next day, or the dreadful task of waking up early, or even the boring job you may be stuck at. \u00a0We want to relieve the stress of all of those things with insight, laughter, and wonder. So crack open a cold one, sit on down, and listen with us. Long Term Goal\u00a0 Our long term goal is to become a staple on the apple podcast charts for years to come. \u00a0We want to make the \"SBMP\" acronym synonymous with great stories, laughs and good times. \u00a0We want to turn it into a nation wide brand that benefits both our sponsors as well as ourselves. \u00a0In two years we want to consistently have hundreds of thousands of listeners tune in to each show, and hopefully from there, grow that number into the millions. \u00a0It will be a long hard road, but we could not be more excited to get started. \u00a0Reward Breakdown \"The Sunday Before Monday Podcast\" Bottle Opener Keychain ($15):\u00a0Bottle opener keychain with our logo and slogan engraved on the top. \u00a0It will read, \"The Sunday Before Monday Podcast, Relatable Laughs\" \u00a0\"The Sunday\u00a0Before Monday Podcast\" drink koozie ($25): Drink koozie with one of our original design logos printed on the front and back. It has our classic microphone design along with our SBMP acronym. \u00a0\"The Sunday Before Monday Podcast\" Baseball T-shirt ($50): Baseball Style T-shirt with a red, white and blue color scheme. It has our classic microphone design along with our \"SBMP\" acronym on the front of the shirt. \u00a0Both comfy and warm. \u00a0Can't go wrong here. \u00a0We appreciate all of the support that we hope to get from the bottom of our hearts, and we look forward to bringing you a rocking' podcast every single Sunday for years to come.",
  "I came up with the idea for The Adventure Journal after getting our own family caravan. I wanted to be able to keep track of my family's camping holidays and record those precious moments, but all the travel journals I came across were aimed more at international travel or bullet journaling. I wanted something that was simple and fun to fill in. I originally released this journal last year on my Etsy store and while I was happy with the design, it was difficult to create by myself and the handmade factor made the journal too expensive so I removed it from my store and saved the design for a later date! The journal was designed with a combination of prompts to help you to get more unforgettable memories down on paper. Don\u2019t worry though, I\u2019ve made sure to leave plenty of space for those that have their own style of journaling. There\u2019s something for all journalers out there! The pages are designed to capture 12 adventures throughout the year. Each adventure starts with a planning section to help you get ready for your trip and plan some things to do while you\u2019re there. After all, planning it out is one of the most exciting parts, right? I have kept the style straightforward and fun throughout \u2013 just like camping itself! For me, camping outside is all about enjoying the simpler things in life, being in nature, and spending quality time with family and friends. The Adventure Journal is purpose-designed to capture all of that! The journal itself will be A5 and consist of up to 160 double-sided pages. I have designed 104 of these and I welcome suggestions for other must-have journal sections. Alternatively, the rest could be a combination of graph and lined paper for those that like to record their adventure in their own way. The cover will be laminated in soft velvet while the internal pages will be printed on a high-quality 250gsm matte paper, which should be super smooth for writing on with your favourite journaling pen! I personally love the Trip Highlights page that provides a space to record the favourite parts of your trip, including the best food eaten and your most peaceful moment! The Adventure Journal offers lots of different ways of recording your trip with pre-made sections for remembering the details of your pitch, what you loved and didn\u2019t love so much, what the weather was like, and some of the activities you did. There\u2019s even space to proudly display your favourite snaps too \u2013 us campers are usually pretty nifty with a camera too! The Adventure Journal provides so much more than a place to record your trip! There\u2019s a bucket list of traditional camping activities that we all need to try once and some suggestions for what to do on those days when the weather isn\u2019t so kind. Your journal will help shape your journey as well as record it! It was a challenge, but even the Health & Safety section is whimiscal and lists some of the key safety points to remember to make sure your trip is not only fun, but safe too! There\u2019s lots to enjoy when flicking through the journal. As well as prompts, free writing space, and activity suggestions, there\u2019s also a miniature hand-illustrated map and a playful poem. This playful journal is not only fun to fill in but will continue to make you smile when looking back on your trips. The playful, hand-drawn design on every page makes the journal appealing for everyone and offers plenty of space for you to make it your own. We all know that camping adventures throw you lots of surprises along the way, some good and some not-so-good that make for great stories, and there\u2019s room to capture it all! The rewards available include a copy of my illustrated map of the UK, my adventure print, and a large adventure sticker. They are all printed on quality, smooth matte photo paper or sticker paper.\u00a0There will also be an additional page at the back of the journal to list the names of everyone that backs the project as a special thank you from me! Keeping a record of our trips has become more popular than ever and The Adventure Journal is a one-of-a-kind, purpose-designed journal for all the campers out there! It fills an existing gap in the market and funding would allow this product to be affordable so that there will be even more happy campers!",

  "When your very existence is defined by your blade, how do you keep yourself sheathed? In the aftermath of a devastating war between clans, two swordswomen try to find their way forward in this strange new world of peace: a jaded soldier trying to escape her past, and a young warrior driven by an inherited thirst for revenge. A tale of an unlikely friendship tested by the bonds of honor and the terrible price of forgiveness, Sheathed combines movement and theatrical storytelling to explore the emotional depths of why we fight. We still have 1 day left in our campaign, so let's make every moment count! For our final (home)Stretch Goal: we love our theatre artists so much, that we want to make it all about them! Any funds we raise over $3,500 will be used directly to boost our artist honorariums. As a small theatre company, it\u2019s a constant struggle to try to compensate our artists for all their hard work and dedication (a nigh-impossible feat because, honestly, they are PRICELESS). So please help us show our actors, designers, and production staff a little extra love, and let\u2019s STRETCH this Kickstarter together right up til the very \u00a0end! We asked for the moon, and you STRETCHED to answer! Thanks to your continued support, our Stretch Goal of $3,500 means that Macha Theatre Works can now offer an affordable $10 ticket option for our 2pm Sunday matinee on March 17. Our\u00a0matinee time slot has proven very popular for those audience members who don't have the means or ability to attend events in the evenings; by lowering the ticket price for this performance, we hope to provide an extra boost for these folks to come out and see our show. Not to mention, free parking on Sundays and a mind-boggling variety of restaurants in the surrounding International District neighborhood, perfect for a yummy bite to eat before or after the show! Thank you for STRETCHING with us! Presented by Macha Theatre Works, in association with Theatre Off Jackson\u00a0 March 8 to March 24, 2019, Theatre Off Jackson (409 7th Ave. S., Seattle, WA) Starring Ayo Tushinde, Sunam Ellis, Fune Tautala, Maile Wong, Natalie Berg, Isis King, and Dylan Smith.

It also marks the fifth collaboration between the powerhouse team of director Amy Poisson and playwright Maggie Lee, whose previous productions include the successful New Providence trilogy of steampunk plays: The Clockwork Professor, The Tumbleweed Zephyr, and A Hand of Talons. Sheathed is set in a new fantastical realm, combining genre influences from Japanese samurai epics, classic Old Westerns, heroic medieval legends, and buddy-cop oddball friendships. But in true Macha Theatre Works style, our strong female characters lead the way in this tale, carving out their own destinies with their swords, but also learning the true price of violence. We have built an amazing team for our show, including an incredible multicultural cast and a legion of talented designers, and we can't wait to share this new play with you! While Macha currently has a budget in place to cover all basic production costs, we have some big dreams in creating the sights and sound of Sheathed. We are combining live music, movement, fight choreography, and puppetry into a one-of-a-kind theatrical event, and every extra dollar can help make our grand vision become a reality. This is where you come in! All funds raised through this Kickstarter campaign will be used directly for this production: approximately 70% will be added to the design budget, 20% will help offset rental fees, and 10% will go toward our marketing costs.

  "Hello! I'm Pamela, and I am the artistic director of the London based, not-for-profit company Time Zone Theatre. Our aim is to encourage collaborations between British and International artists, and to support artists in bringing their work to the UK.\u00a0 Background: In 2016, I met American playwright Tom Coash, and he told me about his play CRY HAVOC. It sounded like a gripping and very current play, and - after reading it - I made the decision to bring this to the UK for its European premiere. No matter how long it would take to make this happen! What followed was a long search for the right venue, and in summer 2018, the Park Theatre - one of London's leading Off-West-End venues - shared my passion for this play, and agreed to programme it as part of their Spring 2019 season. This is a hugely exciting opportunity to introduce Tom's play to the London theatre audience, industry professionals, and arts critics. Your donation will help us to make it happen!\u00a0 About the play: \u00a0 The European premiere of Cry Havoc by Tom Coash, starring Marc Antolin (West End, National Theatre, RSC, Young Vic), James El-Sharawy (Clywd Theatr Cymru, Southwark Playhouse) and Karren Winchester (National Theatre, West End) is a passionate love story about two men who are worlds apart. Set in present-day Cairo, Cry Havoc is a passionate love story between a spirited Egyptian and an idealistic British writer. In times of turmoil, Mohammed questions his responsibility towards society when he contemplates leaving Egypt for a life in the UK with his partner, Nicholas. The two men are forced to confront their cultural identities, traditions and a repressive government in a gripping search for love and faith. Tom Coash\u2019s poignant, intimate play explores the relationship between the Western world and the Islamic Middle East through the eyes of two people asking if love can bridge even the widest cultural divide. The play will be performed from 27 March - 20 April 2019 at Park Theatre in London, UK: https://www.parktheatre.co.uk/whats-on/cry-havoc About the playwright: \u00a0Tom Coash is an American playwright, director, and teacher.

Namesake is the story of Emma Crewe, a woman who discovers she is a Namesake, a person with the power to travel to other worlds, places we know on Earth as fantasy and fairy tale lands. This power has rules, Alices always go to Wonderland, Wendies always go to Neverland. Each Namesake has a specific destination and mission, in order to keep the multiverse balanced. But Emma goes to Oz in the stead of the expected Dorothy, unveiling a magical conspiracy plot that\u2019s more than 100 years in the making, with Emma and her unique powers at it's core. While Emma is stumbling down the Yellow Brick Road, her younger sister Elaine discovers she\u2019s a Writer \u2014 one gifted with the power to make stories come to life. Will Elaine be her sister\u2019s key to come back home?\n\nAided by magic-wielding twins from Oz, a half-Cheshire Alice, a devilishly charming Jack, a sword-wielding Lost Girl, a hungry card soldier, and a confused Canadian, Emma must walk through many stories to find everyone\u2019s happy ending. Book 3 begins in the aftermath of the Oz saga. Emma returns home, but rather then finding her sister, she finds herself in the clutches or a group calling themselves the Rippers, who seem to know a lot about her powers, one peculiar Ripper nicknamed Nose, seems to even have childhood memories with Emma. On her side, Elaine is on a quest to reconnect with her newly Earth-bound sister, against all odds. Namesake has been published online for the past 6 years, with 5 books available digitally, and 2 in print. Namesake has a strong, growing reader base thanks to it's passionate team and compelling story. The Namesake Team is composed of Isa (story and art) and Megan (story and design), with Meg Syverud, Gisele Jobateh and Pascal Michaud credited for flatting on various chapters. The team is fascinated by classic fairy tales and literature, and aims to adapt and quote their favorites in ways that both engages the readers and respects the original works. Namesake is currently starting book 6 online, can be read HERE, has a Patreon HERE and is part of the digital publisher and studio Hiveworks. Namesake book 3 is approximately 180 pages long, and will be available both in softcover and hardcover (limited edition). The print edition of book 3 will includes re-drawn chapter covers, character art, and a new print and ebook exclusive story. The Hardcover edition will be limited to 500 copies, just as the limited editions for book 1 and 2 were. \u00a0 The art is all inked traditionally, with digital coloring.

This item will be limited to 112 copies on superb high quality paper with a signed and numbered plate. But the BEST limited item of all is this adorable (limited to 12), handmade Cheshire cat! How cute! Devilish and pocket sized, this travel Cheshire is ideal for any writer who needs a magical friend.\u00a0 \u00a0 The handmade Cheshire cat is a creation of Threnodi. If we reach our goal and beyond, allowing us to hoard that sweet, sweet print loot - like dragons obsessed with books, scrolls, and other paper related things - we plan on releasing stretch goals! $20,000 - Bookmarks added to physical tiers! $40,000 - Reprinting book 1 in softcover and hardcover! $50,000 - Such a secret, massive spoilers. Book 3 was a hard book to do, initially. It was being drawn during a very hard time in Isa's life, which was reflected in the darker storyline. Emma pulled through, and so did the team, leading us to the overall message of Namesake, which is, stories can change the universe. So, thank you to our readers for their support, thank you to our families, our loves, our friends, the community of artists at Hiveworks, and of course, thank you Grimm, Perrault, Andersen,\u00a0Madame d'Aulnoy, Mcdonald, Rossetti, Sherazade, and all the other storytellers across the ages.

He recently graduated from N.Y.U. with a BFA in Dramatic Writing.\n I am currently an MFA Film and Media Arts candidate at Temple University in Philadelphia, but this film is more than just my graduate thesis. It's a project with characters I've cultivated for the past year and it's probably the closest I will come to carrying a child (sorry, mom, you'll have fur-grand-babies). I love comedy, and I especially love seeing women in comedy, and it's so important to me to be able to provide opportunities to create and collaborate with other ladies in the biz. Through these strong, funny female characters, I hope to make you laugh, cry, and then feel extremely lonely because you wish you had friends as cool as these characters. \n We are currently in pre-production for the film and are working diligently on getting everything in order for production that will take place in late September. The total budget of the film will be around $15,000 but we're attempting to raise at least half of that through this Kickstarter campaign. Your donation would help us afford production expenses like permits, equipment, lodging for cast and crew, production design, reiki sessions for our actors, acai bowls for everyone on set, and a crystal \u201chandler\u201d in Lindsay\u2019s trailer. Just check out our very impressive graph for a real breakdown of where your money is going. \n \u00a0 We have a handful of fun rewards for each level of donation, and any amount you are able to contribute would be appreciated.

This is how I\u2019m feeling today:\u00a0 \u00a0And this is what I wanna do at my store today: Followed by me fleeing forever and going here: This is how I\u2019m gonna achieve that dream: You see, I want to quit in the most amazing, memorable way possible and secretly film it.

  "Let me tell you a little about me and why I created this project on KickStarter. Some of ya'll may know me as Shirlita Boone but others know me as \"Ms. Precious.\" Born in Maryland but currently residing in Atlanta, Ga \"The city of opportunities.\" I am a singer-songwriter looking to finally began my career. The reason I am starting so late in the game is because I allowed others to tell me what I could and could not do. I can no longer sit and watch my dreams slip away from me. Ever since I was a young girl, \"I always had a passion for music.\" Especially, growing up with a family full of musicians. As I got older, I was introduced to various recording artists and producers that has made a huge influence in my life. I love different styles of music but r&b is what I focus the most on. My goal is to create Songwriting Workshops all across the globe for young children looking to pursue music as a career. This will allow me to expand my business status not just nationally but internationally as well. As of now, I work with young children at a before and after school at SprayBerry 2.0 as a teacher and a substitute and I just love every opportunity I get to work with these amazing kids. What makes me stand out from every other songwriters is my creativity, perfection, consistency, and the structured mindset I have. After singing-songwriting for over 6+ years, it is now time for me expand my horizon. Everything I have learned over the years, has helped me build my own sense and style of music. Singing-songwriter is not just something I do as a hobby but something I was born to love and do as a career. As I always said, \"Anything is possible, if you set your mind to it because the Sky Is The Limit.\" with hard work and dedication, i know that I will succeed. *(Working through personal experiences)\u00a0*(Selling songs to other artists) *(Becoming a performer) *(Co-writing with others) *(Telling a story) *(Getting deep into the craft of combining words and melody) *(Connecting with an audience through your own songs) *(Trying something that is out of your comfort zone) *(Experimenting with new music styles) *(Expanding your knowledge of a musical instrument through songwriting) *(Becoming part of a community) *(Expressing emotion) *(Sharing your talent) *(Happiness) Singer-Songwriter Workshop:\u00a0 This course is designed to provide you with an opportunity to perform your songs and receive feedback from faculty and peers. Songwriters can accompany themselves, have someone accompany for them, or use pre-recorded music.\u00a0 Music Composition for Songs:\u00a0 Topics and techniques include groove writing, melody writing, modes, and interesting and useful harmonic progressions.\u00a0 Lyric Writing:\u00a0 Topics include prosody (setting words to music and vice versa), brainstorming techniques, and writing from titles.\u00a0 Creating Your Own Demo and Recordings:\u00a0 Producing quality demos and ways to market them. MIDI and audio workshop sessions are continually held at a center (To Be Announced). Business of Songwriting:\u00a0 Each class discusses different topics related to songwriting and the songwriter (including publishing, copyright laws, mechanical rights, ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, and promoting your songs). Hip-hop Songwriting:\u00a0 In this class, you will learn how to write effective hip-hop songs by studying the lyrical and compositional elements involved. The class will listen to current hiphop songs, analyze different hook structures, and perform in-class writing and improvising exercises. Topline Writing for Pop, R&B, and Dance Songs:\u00a0 You don't always have to sit behind a piano or a guitar to write a song. Many of the biggest songs these days are written using a technique called toplining. In this workshop you will learn how to write a song (possibly a hit song) using this technique. Closing Statement:\u00a0 Living in this world, nothing is free. Especially when it comes to the arts.\u00a0With the money I raise, I can finally start seeing my dream turn into reality. I'd be nowhere without you all and I can't wait for the day I can give back to the people who has supported me. Thank you in advance for your contributions and support! God bless you! Much love.",
  "Hello. I go by the songwriter name of HeartOfThePen. I am a songwriter out of Tennessee. Just to specify I am not a singer/songwriter. I do not sing. I'm a songwriter only. With that being said I need your help. I would like to start up my independent record label/ production company entitled Hits Songwriting Production. My overall goal for the company is to create great, soulful, inspiring, entertaining, and heart provoking music for aspiring artists as well as for the die hard fans of music. My personal mission musically is to re-event R&B music and to bring it back to it's glory like once before. Now days R&B music is not as appreciated and celebrated as it once were. As a songwriter and a lover of R&B music I want to change that. People say that R&B music in this generation is dead but i don't believe that. So as a songwriter i want to start a movement within my small company to bring back that soulful, sexy, and feel good R&B that people like myself are craving for today that is not influence by Hip-Hop music or any other genere. I just wanna write and create really good music to the world.I love music and I love to write. I just wanna share my gift to the world and i would love to do this full time so that i can leave something special behind for my 4 year daughter who goes by the name of Lauren. With the overall funding of your generous donations of any amount I plan on starting up the company and immediately begin working on my first project which will be a free project to everyone who loves R&B music and to everyone who supported this project from day one through donations etc. As i'm sure alot of you know being your own boss takes a lot of sacrifice \u00a0and cost a lot of money when starting your own record label. The funds will also be going toward funding the R&B Is Back musical project( to be release in February 2016), studio time, artists to provide vocals to my songs, music producers, copyrights, business license, marketing, songwriting projects with artists, etc. As i just stated i am working on a project entitled \"R&B Is Back\" which i plan on releasing in February of 2016. It will be a free musical mixtape with ten to twelve R&B records all written and arranged by me, produced by up and coming producers, and sung by talented up and coming artists. The project will feature some of the best R&B music that a songwriter like me has to offer. I'm asking you to please support the bringing back of real R&B music as well as music in general. Uploaded above is a video of a song that i wrote for a very talented artist by the name of Mykel entitled \"Slip Away\". That song is just a taste of what i have enstore for the fans of real, creative, and authentic music. To listen to more of my work go to\u00a0https://www.reverbnation.com/heartofthepen.\u00a0I would appreciate everyone's support and i promise you I will not let you down. Thankyou and God Bless.\u00a0",
  "Greetings, Mizarks!\u00a0 My friend and co-host Barbara North and I are pro wrestling fans.\u00a0 The difference between us is that Barb has been a big fan since she was in her twenties in the late 90s and I've been a fan since I was 9 back in 1983.\u00a0\u00a0 Through research and conversations with people inside the wrestling industry, I've become something of a wrestling historian.\u00a0 My experience in broadcasting and my love for wrestling landed me a short-lived gig as both a booker and TV production designer (neither of which got far for reasons I won't go into here) with a short-lived promotion in Washington State. Barb and I decided that we wanted to launch a podcast that tackled various topics in the worlds of professional wrestling and sports entertainment (and we understand that there is\u00a0a difference) from both a male and female perspective and in a forum that is uncensored.\u00a0 We also want to draw more attention to wrestling in the Pacific Northwest, which has a rich wrestling history. Currently, we have 10 episodes completed and we \"air\" the show on Twitter (@MVWPodcast), YouTube and our Facebook page (facebook.com/marsandvenuspodcast).\u00a0 But, we want to reach a broader audience.\u00a0 The only way for us to do this is to upload our show to a podcast server that will distribute our show to services like iTunes, Stitcher and Spotify.\u00a0 The problem is that it costs money to do that. Barb and I have day jobs.\u00a0 But, we have bills to pay, mortgages and rent to pay, car payments...life.\u00a0 We don't currently have any ad revenue.\u00a0 We've reached out to NW wrestling promotions to offer free advertising so that we can cultivate relationships with the promoters and wrestlers AND spread the word about wrestling in the Pacific Northwest. We're looking to raise enough money to cover at least a one year subscription with Libsyn.\u00a0 With that expense taken care of, a wider distribution and more platforms for listeners to catch our show, Barb and I can focus on trying to sell ad space on our show and promote our show.\u00a0 With luck, we'll be able to finance the show ourselves after the first year. Please help us reach our goal ($480) so that we can try to build this show into something fans look forward to hearing every week! Thank you in advance!",
  "Gentritrying is a book that explores a personal case study of a Millenials life battling through gentrification. \u00a0The concept comes from the endurance of trying through evictions, job struggles, the big city, and of course social aspects of an ever-changing revolving door of the gentrifying neighborhoods to the neighborhoods of lower-income communities.",
  "Without accurate news, without a way to inform themselves, the citizens of a democracy cannot make proper informed decisions. It represents a death knell for functioning republics like our own. Unless we can read the news confident that we are reading the truth, we start to lose our way. We start to lose sight of what is really going on around us. \u00a0How should we respond to the challenges at hand? We should now, more than ever, take a long hard look at the news we receive. We hear the term \"fake news\" tossed around fairly often these days. That doesn't make the phenomenon any less real though. \u00a0All across the internet, in newspapers and on forums, there is false information spreading like wildfire. It happens every day. From exaggerated details to completely fabricated stories, fake news is one of the defining issues of our era. We need to do something about it. If you ask anyone what we should do about it, they will provide you with no answers. They will agree with you that the problem is real and that it is getting worse. When you point out the immediate and undeniable dangers of fake news and propaganda, they will tell you that they share your concern. Still, that is not enough. At DotComCrowd, We are going to cover prominent topics in the news and provide insights to the reader to give a bigger picture on prominent topics to inform, and help stimulate critical thinking.\u00a0 Here's how it works. Getting Started on DotComCrowd All you need to do to get started on our platform is to create your account, You can then download any topic related reports specific to your interests. \u00a0Good news, you can conduct your own inquiry without a paid subscription similar to any other news site. \u00a0If you wish to browse our report topics and want to download any full report, it will be made available for the cost of $3.00 US. \u00a0Authenticated account subscriptions will be available at $9.00 US a month. \u00a0Contributors to this Kickstarter will get a discount on this monthly fee (shown below). Say that you want to know more about a topic of debate for a prominent topic that is circling around. On DotComCrowd, you can get that information, all through a few clicks, all via our reliable research techniques.\u00a0 Our product leverages an intelligent search engine, made available on DotComCrowd.com (future site) so that you can look up any past reports and sift through the entire catalog of information, knowledge, and insights we are collecting. We want you to feel empowered when you use DotComCrowd, and be sure that you are getting all of the data that you need.

The DotComCrowd concept is a bold one, without a doubt, but it is also one grounded firmly in technologies that are already available. We are making it easy for you to tap into the tools and the resources that you need to push back on the spread of fake news. When you sign up for our platform, you can make yourself part of the solution, not part of the problem.

What We Need & What You Get Right now, we are turning to you for help raising the funds that we need to complete development on DotComCrowd and then get it online. Our fundraising goal is $5,000 which will cover engineer and designer costs, as well as the infrastructure that we need to purchase, including hosting. If we raise anything above our goal, of course, we will be in an even better position once launch day arrives. Whatever we raise in excess of our goal, we will divert to marketing, promoting the DotComCrowd concept to an even wider audience.

  "\u201cNow, here in Britain we\u2019ve just an election where everybody argued about who won. Nothing much happened: Gordon Brown looked bewildered for a few days, and then we got a coalition. But in Iran, there were riots, \u00a0and lots of people died. It was a unique moment. I was there to see it. Not many British people got to be there at that time. Actually, not a lot of British people get to be there ever\u201d Part theatre, part drag cabaret, Lipstick: A Fairy Tale of Iran is a 2 hander play with songs, which fuses storytelling, vaudeville, theatre, lipsynch and boylesque, in a story of rage, redemption and weaponised whimsy which straddles Tehran, Derry and London. Lipstick premieres at Omnibus Theatre on 28th Feb 2019, (previews from 26th Feb) and runs to 24th March.\u00a0 In \u00a0early 2010, just \u00a0after the \u00a0contested \u00a02009 Iranian \u00a0election, \u00a0during riots \u00a0urging \u00a0the \u00a0removal \u00a0of President Mahmoud \u00a0Ahmadinejad \u00a0from office, I went to Iran on a theatre residency. The experience changed my life. Lipstick: a fairy tale of modern Iran was inspired by this. At that time, Iran was part of a collection of Middle Eastern territories the US Government still titled \"the Axis of Evil\". Prior to visiting, the \u00a0title \u00a0had \u00a0coloured my assumptions \u00a0of \u00a0what \u00a0I \u00a0would \u00a0find \u00a0there. My assumptions \u00a0were \u00a0challenged, \u00a0on \u00a0a \u00a0daily \u00a0basis, throughout my stay.\u00a0 In a curious way, that constant and intense challenging of assumptions felt in some way similar to the more straightforwardly joyful discombobulation I found in the drag and cabaret world I had started to work in at home.\u00a0 Lipstick was borne out of a desire to interrogate and celebrate the challenging of assumptions, the challenging of my own beliefs around feminism, ethnicity, ethics, faith and gender, which I experienced at that time.\u00a0 I started writing Lipstick four years ago, when Britain felt a safer place than it does now. Iran's almost impenetrable diplomatic and cultural borders felt a world away from my experience at home. \u00a0 Sadly, \u00a0four years later, we \u00a0now don't \u00a0have \u00a0to \u00a0look \u00a0too \u00a0far \u00a0outside \u00a0the \u00a0edges \u00a0of \u00a0our \u00a0own \u00a0nation \u00a0to \u00a0see \u00a0borders \u00a0that threaten \u00a0our \u00a0capacity \u00a0to \u00a0engage \u00a0with \u00a0people \u00a0we \u00a0see as \u00a0different \u00a0to \u00a0ourselves.\u00a0 As \u00a0Brexit \u00a0looms \u00a0ever \u00a0closer, what \u00a0is \u00a0it \u00a0doing to \u00a0our \u00a0perceptions \u00a0of \u00a0people \u00a0we \u00a0see \u00a0as \u00a0Other? \u00a0What \u00a0does \u00a0the \u00a0threat \u00a0of \u00a0a \u00a0hard \u00a0border \u00a0in Ireland do to our already heightened fear of terrorism? What role does tightened immigration here, and our Government's tacit acceptance of Trump's travel bans and sanctions to Iran, \u00a0play \u00a0in \u00a0this? \u00a0 How \u00a0do \u00a0we \u00a0fight \u00a0to \u00a0keep \u00a0our \u00a0personal, \u00a0emotional \u00a0borders \u00a0open, \u00a0while \u00a0all \u00a0around \u00a0us, governments build physical and ideological walls?

What power do we have to say:\u00a0 To present this work so close to the date Britain leaves the European Union is my assertion of that power. To premiere Lipstick at this time creates a space to discuss and to protest the closing of borders, be they physical, intellectual, legal or emotional, and to celebrate diversity, fierceness and community. Lipstick is performed by Siobhan O'Kelly as Orla and Nathan Kiley (also known as drag alter ego Topsie Redfern) as Mark.\u00a0 Siobhan won Best Actress at the European Independent Film Festival in Paris for her role in Sophie At The Races. She was also nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role Film at the IFTAs this year for her role in Klondike. \u00a0Nathan has performed extensively in the West End, including playing Mary Sunshine in Chicago. Topsie was the first runner up in Drag Idol UK 2013, and won Best Drag Newcomer in the 2014 Boyz Scene Awards.\u00a0 Lipstick is produced by Olivier nominee Paul Virides, and choreographed by Vault Festival award winner Molly Beth Morossa.\u00a0 Lipstick will be presented alongside\u00a0 We will be creating an environment around the show which encourages discussion, dissent and vigorous interaction. Maybe unexpectedly for an appeal about an arts project, I am going to talk to you about maths.\u00a0 If you are not a practitioner, theatre economics may surprise you. Because of the Arts Council, other foundations, and brilliant schemes like Travellex, you can often go to see big shows in big theatres for \u00a310 - \u00a315. This is not a reflection of what they cost to put on, just that we are lucky enough to live in a culture that understands the value of using subsidy to make art accessible.\u00a0 However, this means that ticket revenue for fringe theatre in no way reflects costs. Lipstick's projected ticket income represents about 1/3 of the actual costs of putting on the show For this show we will be charging \u00a313-\u00a316 for tickets, because we and Omnibus Theatre want the show to be economically accessible to as many people as possible. (We are also offering 50 free tickets across the run to two charities who will share them among people for whom \u00a313 is still prohibitive). \u00a0 We could put the ticket price up to \u00a339-\u00a348, but that would exclude many people who would like to see it (and who we would like to see it).\u00a0 We could expect artists to work unpaid, but this is a horrible precedent to set, it devalues the work, training and skill of artists, and creates an ironic situation where you might not have to be rich in order to sit in the audience, but you do have to be rich in order to appear on the stage. 7 weeks full time work unpaid is not a thing many of us can afford to do. Or we could ask you reading this, are you in a position to help us keep prices low while ensuring our artists can live, eat, travel, stay warm and stay healthy while making and performing the show? If you are only in a position to contribute the cost of a ticket, please, save your pennies on here and just book for the show!\u00a0 If you are in a position to make a substantial donation, please don't let us stop you!! People like you are our life blood and we are very very grateful.\u00a0 But if you are somewhere in the middle - if you could, without discomfort, pay the actual value of a ticket - please would you consider booking a ticket but also popping the difference in the kitty here. By doing so, you are helping ensure that we can sustain keeping our work available to people who cannot afford to pay more, and that the artists whose work you will see are there on the basis of their artistic excellence not their financial privilege. \u00a0 Above and beyond the economic reasons stated above, your support would mean the world to me and all the team creatively.\u00a0 This is a piece of work we all care deeply about: on a political level we are all very invested in its message; on a creative and professional level, it allows us to develop our artistic practice, present a high level piece of work, and collaborate with people we love.\u00a0 I personally have directed extensively, and have written three plays, but this is my debut full length work as both writer and director. You will be helping all of us develop our work, our profiles and our commitment to the causes we care about.\u00a0 I am so excited to present Lipstick at a genuinely inclusive, female-led theatre which has already supported the show's development.\u00a0 Omnibus a multi-award winning theatre in Clapham,\u00a0offering a vibrant artistic programme inspired by the legacy of the old Clapham Library building. The venue is home to a 90-seat studio theatre (where Lipstick will be performed), a caf\u00e9/bar and two performance and rehearsal spaces.\u00a0 Omnibus Theatre was founded in 2013, following a seven-year campaign to save the old Clapham Library building. The theatre's patrons are\u00a0Dame Judi Dench, Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Richard Eyre, Matthew Warchus and Maggi Hambling CBE. The theatre won the Open Space Award in 2015 and has just been nominated as The Stage's Fringe Theatre of the Year. Omnibus Theatre is a home of storytelling \u2013 a small place to encounter big ideas. We are driven by the legacy of our former library building to tell stories, familiar and unknown, in South London and beyond. The theatre's mission is to create performance that has the power to inspire audiences, to change minds, to bring us together. Omnibus Theatre nurtures emerging artists and new voices, presenting work that is ambitious and relevant. We are committed to making our work affordable and introducing it to new audiences. You can expect a warm welcome when you step through our doors. We have reached our target with three days to go - thankyou all so so so much - so we have added a stretch goal.\u00a0 With deepest thanks to a match funder, if we can get this to \u00a33800 by the end, we will receive \u00a3800 match funding, to create a Trainee Assistant Director role, paid \u00a3400 p/w, so an emerging artist can work full time on a full professional production without having to worry about earning a living at the same time.\u00a0 If you would still like to contribute, this is where your money would go.\u00a0 Many thanks for all your amazing support xxx",

Build onto your NTO library if you already own the first book, or get caught up in style with one of the collections (check out the rewards below!)! Continue unraveling the curious rivalry 'twixt laconic, mechanically-inclined Vane Black and wanted rogue John Henry Hunter through:\u00a0 Updating like clockwork since autumn of 2010, Next Town Over\u2019s web incarnation has picked up readers, popularity, and its fair share of kind words:\u00a0 I\u2019m Erin Mehlos, an independent (and self-taught) comics creator, editor, publisher and mom from the frozen north of Wisconsin, USA. I'm the creator of Next Town Over, Hell's Corners, the fair pay, inclusive anthology Poor Wayfaring Strangers (successfully crowdfunded earlier this year), and a contributor to several other projects, including NOBODIES and the Eisner-nominated 24 Hour Comics Highlights 2005. I wear a lot of hats, I spin a lot of plates, and I don't have an overabundance of cash, which is where you come in!\u00a0 \u00a0 Volume 2: No Particular Fear will collect Next Town Over's most recent four chapters (#5-8; Wayward through Diamondback Ridge) into a quality foil-stamped trade softcover featuring over 130 pages of pure comics and another (estimated) 30+ pages of extras, including conceptual sketches, bonus artwork, guides to Next Town Over locations & characters, some of the fantastic entries to Next Town Over's various art contests, and more!\u00a0 I will also be printing a shorter run (500 copies, total) of a slipcased, clothbound hardcover edition with a bound-in, signed and hand-numbered limitation page to match the Volume 1 hardcover. The first volume of Next Town Over was a great book, largely made possible by generous backing from people like you, but I vastly underestimated the costs associated with making it such a great book.\u00a0 Now, it's important to me that I make this second volume a perfect match for the first on your shelf -- whether you own the softcover or limited hardcover -- but I'm a lot better acquainted with what that's going to cost, and unable to shoulder so much of the burden myself this time. A run of 1000 trade paperbacks + 500 slipcased hardcovers of this volume of Next Town Over, when you factor in printing, logistics, an ISBN, etc. -- nevermind my time collecting and prepressing the book -- is going to run upwards of $8000; shipping it out to you folks (international shipping has gotten ludicrously expensive) is expected to cost close to $2000, and then of course there's Kickstarter fees, payment processor fees, taxes....\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 $14,000 \u2013 NEW 3-page comic from Gus Carlson, creator of Tourist Unknown added & exclusive to the book!

  "What is it? A Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker. The Vision The KASA Project.\u00a0 I want to make a bluetooth speaker that will plays great music and answer questions, play songs and call people that you want to call when you ask it to. The initial speaker will only play music via bluetooth however, we will be adding more capabilities to the speaker in the future models. The money will fund research and development of future projects as well as future products too! Hey Kasa, How will it be made? How will it be made? I will be 3D Printing some of the bluetooth speakers and creating a mold base for the majority. The electronics will be ordered but designed and programmed by me. We will strive to use Bluetooth 5.0 however, if we are not able to we will revert to 4.2. The Lithium ion battery will have 1000mah or 1400mah. The only downside is that it is not fully waterproof. The speaker can get wet and still operate however, it cannot be fully drenched in water or it will eventually malfunction. For anything else I may have forgotten send me a question. Hey Kasa, How much does it weigh and what are the dimensions? Extras The photo you see is only a prototype and will keep people informed via my blog on my website: www.kasatech.org To ensure that we have enough money to continue this project and beyond this project we will also be offering 3D printing services.",

  "EXPLOITATION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \"Exploitation\" is usually a bad word, but when it describes a movie genre, it's actually a relished by fans of that style.  Well, it's not really a genre by itself.  Horror, comedy, and thriller genres can fall into the (positive) category of \"exploitation.\"  \u00a0\u00a0 But this is not a documentary that teaches you about movie styles.\u00a0 Rather, \"Exploitation\"uses the movie-making setting as the environment for this tragi-comedy. \u00a0\u00a0 Bill Zebub is not a genre purist.\u00a0 He likes to mix things that aren't normally together.\u00a0 His bizarre associations between seemingly unrelated concepts is what drives his stories. \u00a0\u00a0 Bill Zebub does not have the budget of Hollywood, but he has independence.\u00a0 He can explore subjects that are not considered good for mainstream stories, and he can depict situations that go far beyond mainstream sensibilities.\u00a0 This doesn't mean that he is better than the mainstream - it means that he uses his freedom instead of being ashamed of his indie status. \u00a0\u00a0 He only has his own money to lose, which makes him answer only to himself, not investors.\u00a0  The Movie \u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps you consider comedy to be a social mirror.\u00a0 Perhaps you prefer a more slap-stick approach.\u00a0 Maybe you like sarcasm.\u00a0 Comedy has several forms.\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 Bill Zebub noticed that some comedy makes you laugh at failure.\u00a0 This might seem cruel, but in such cases, laughter is a harmless release of negative energy.\u00a0 Some evolutionary psychologists say that laughter was our pre-language way of communicating to other humans that the situation is not serious.\u00a0 When a person slips and falls, you laugh because there is no injury.\u00a0 But if there is an injury then there would be no laughter, unless you are sociopathic. \u00a0\u00a0 This movie is about a director's failure.\u00a0 It's not about the movie world, even though movie-making is the setting for the story.\u00a0 Although the primary stimulus for laughter is the director's failure and total misery, there is enough sarcasm, dry wit, slap-stick, and other forms of comedy for you to at least smile once. \u00a0\u00a0 Judgmental people may look upon the images or descriptions with condemnation, but knee-jerk reactions are immature.\u00a0 Bill Zebub has spent his career fighting such prejudice. You keep hearing \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" -\u00a0 Hopefully you are the kind of person who might read a few pages before deciding. \u00a0\u00a0 Bill Zebub writes ugly scripts, and he challenges you to find the hidden beauty. Supporting this movie. \u00a0\u00a0 This movie is getting made no matter what.\u00a0 In fact, a few scenes have already been shot. \u00a0\u00a0 Why would you support this if it's going to be made even if no one contributes?\u00a0 It is because every dollar that is raised goes toward making the movie BETTER.\u00a0 Even if the just the minimum of $500 is raised, that means that more expenses can be afforded.\u00a0 If $40,000 is raised, it still goes toward the making of the movie.\u00a0 It's not going toward a luxurious car that will be written off as a company vehicle. \u00a0\u00a0 Again, this movie is being made no matter how much money is raised, because the director has already set his own money aside to make the movie at the bare-minimum costs.\u00a0 He has prepared for the worst-case scenario, and the movie has guaranteed distribution. \u00a0\u00a0 What this means is that there is no guilt-trip being placed on you.\u00a0 It also means that the director can stand on his own feet.\u00a0 He does not rely on hand-outs.\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 If you participate, you get something real for your money.\u00a0 A limited edition cover that will never be available outside of this crowdfunding campaign, available for the cost of a regular movie - that is something real.\u00a0 If you want to re-sell it at a later date for an inflated price, they YOU will be the one who will befit from the investment.\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 Bill Zebub is You also get a chance to obtain some movie props from previous Bill Zebub titles. \u00a0\u00a0 As for he credits that are available, they are not\u00a0 fake :producer\" credits which some campaigns offer.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Associate Producer\" or \"Executive Producer\" credits are bogus in such campaigns.\u00a0 Go to the Producer's Guild website to learn that those are positions that do NOT mean \"someone who gave money to the movie-maker.\" Those credits\u00a0 mark you as a fool.\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 Actually, there is a part in the script that mentions this practice of hoodwinking people into getting \"producer\" credits. Your help \u00a0\u00a0 Whether you contribute in exchange of a DVD or something larger, every bit helps the movie.\u00a0 You cna also help by spreading the world about this crowdfunding campaign.",

  "Hi,\nI\u2019m Dave Glass, and I have a passion for early film comedy. Lloyd Hamilton was an important comedian, who was influential in the development of screen comedy and was highly respected by fellow comedians like Chaplin, Keaton and Charley Chase.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s tragic that only a small proportion of his output survives.\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m very excited to announce that, in association with Dave Wyatt, we\u2019re campaigning to bring to DVD some of Lloyd Hamilton\u2019s rare surviving shorts.\nSo what are the titles?\u00a0 Well, we have FOUR films from his first series at Mermaid \u2013\u00a0DYNAMITE; THE SIMP; APRIL FOOL and MOONSHINE.\nThese were all released in 1920, back to back, in the order above.\nThese are wonderful 16mm prints which will be scanned digitally to provide the best possible quality and gently restored where necessary. (These are the same rare prints that were taken by myself and Mr Wyatt to show at Slapsticon at Indiana in 2013).\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that these are complete 2 reelers. The 9.5mm versions that are in circulation, are heavily edited versions. The quality of these 16mm prints is also vastly superior. For example, here\u2019s a frame grab from the 16mm Moonshine print we have: So those four films should be enough, yes? Welllllll\u2026..\n there's more! In addition to these four rarities, we\u2019re delighted to announce that the Danish Film Institute have kindly agreed to let us include the recently discovered Lloyd Hamilton Fox comedy HIS MUSICAL SNEEZE (1919). We (you) will be paying for the best possible quality transfer (ProRes) to tickle your eye balls with. \n\u00a0 AND... if that\u2019s not enough to whet your appetite, we\u2019ll also include a recently discovered 16mm print of one of his later shorts, A HOME MADE MAN made in 1928. \nPhew!\n\u00a0 So you\u2019ll be getting SIX  2 reelers \u2013 that\u2019s 2 hours of ultra rare Ham!\n\u00a0 All films on the DVD will be provided by a top UK accompanist (to be announced) and the DVD box art will be produced by a professional graphic designer. \n\u00a0 Now, we\u2019re aware that MOST of the interest shown in this project will probably NOT be from the UK. \u00a0Therefore the disc will be Region Free and made to NTSC (USA standard) which also plays on UK/Euro machines.\nAlso, if you\u2019re non-UK based, then there's the usual additional postage cost on top of the pledge (just as there is for overseas backers who pledge USA projects).\nHowever, we've made it as low as possible PLUS we\u2019re offering an option to receive the DVD disc, with or without the usual DVD case & art work, which will help towards reducing your shipping cost bill, if you so desire. Details are shown against the various pledge options.\n So, if successful, we aim to get this thing done and dusted at least by the end of November (and sooner if we can!) \n\u00a0 To finish, a couple of IMPORTANT points:1)\tThis DVD will be produced purely for those that back it. At the moment there are no plans to make it generally available afterwards.\n2)\tThis project is only set to run for\u00a021 days, so if you dither you miss it!\u00a0Don\u2019t delay\u2026. pledge today!! \u00a0 Before closing, I\u2019d just like to thank Ben Model for his encouragement, advice and support for this project. Thanks Ben!\n\u00a0 Lloyd Hamilton was a huge comedy star and deserves greater appreciation and recognition.\nHopefully you\u2019ll be able to make a pledge and discover the artistry of Lloyd Hamilton yourself. \n\u00a0 Thanks so much,\n\u00a0 The Dave\u2019s (Glass and Wyatt)\n",
  "There is a write up about me that goes like this: \"Introducing Dallas' next big star: Liv Free Raw. Captivating. Honest. Focused. Transparent. Uninhibited. Fearless. Undeniable. Even these adjectives wouldn't do Liv Free enough justice. Admired for her ability to become the focal point in a room without saying a word, she is the embodiment of a star, possessing an uninhibitedness with an uncanny reticent that tends to intrigue everyone she meets. Talented, fearless, and extremely proud of where she's from, Liv Free is poised to be the next big thing to come from the great city of Dallas.\" To many, this seems like a lot to live up to but for me this truly is an honest description of who I am and how my life is. I have the passion and the desire to entertain the world and use every blessing that God has given me in a way that inspires, equips and helps others. I don't pretend to be someone that I am not. I strive to promote self confidence and fearlessness in my music and my image. I don't believe in boxing myself in or stepping on eggshells to express myself and I think that is what sets me apart from other singers: the fact that I will sing and say and act in ways that most people wish they could but don't.  '1 Hunnid' Having released two introductory singles ('OD' and 'Hold Me Back') in April 2015, I got my confirmation that I have a platform to be the type of singer that I strive to be and really begin to pursue music as a career. I received so much love, support and attention in such a short amount of time and I can't be more grateful for the opportunity to work even harder to show more of the world who I am and my talents. '1 Hunnid' (produced by Campion Bond) is a song I made about confidence in oneself and knowing that you are amazing regardless of whatever obstacles that try to keep you from what you dream or pursue. Its about being fed up with the views and regulations of anything that keeps you from being who you want to be. With a dedicated team behind me, I am looking to exceed all expectations and push further with this single, but I need YOUR help!  In order to cover video and promotions cost, I am setting up this Kickstarter in hopes that everyone who has heard of me and believes in me, my team and our spirit (and even those that haven't),\u00a0can help to be apart of this single. My team consists of gifted and hardworking supporters who dedicate their time, skills and efforts to me without pay and this is just as much for them as it is for me. The donations made will all go towards the filming and production costs of the music video (Directed by LaReign Storm), and if donations exceed our goal, funds will be dedicated to putting together a video release party in which we hope every person who donates and supports can attend to see this dream as a reality.  I know that everyone may not be able to donate monetarily but please know what I am thankful regardless. If you can't but you still took the time out to read this and share, THANK YOU SO MUCH. To everyone that can donate, there is no way I can thank you enough but I plan to try by giving my all in this project and providing as many opportunities now and in the future as I can to show you that you are appreciated and your time, efforts and money are not wasted. Look out for the updates!!  With love,  Liv Free",

  "\u00a0We have revolutionized amplifier safety upgrades through our simple to install and cost-effective Amp Defenders. \u00a0Amp Defenders save time by allowing musicians and/or technicians to enhance amplifier reliability with our plug and play technology. Amp Defenders prevent amplifiers from 'going up in smoke' by stabilizing the rectifier and power tube circuits, preventing spiking, and isolating tube shorts without any modifications to the amplifier. Help us take this product from a working prototype to a more finished product, enabling us to buy components in bulk and helping with incorporation costs. Vintage tube prices are higher every year, as the number in circulation dwindles. There are some new manufacturers, with the new popularity of analog audio equipment. However, newer tubes are not made to the same specifications as vintage tubes. Many prized vintage tubes were produced during a time of war. Tubes used in military equipment had to be made to a higher standard. Manufacturers became adept at making rugged tubes and utilized increased quality control. While analog equipment is making a come-back, demand is still much lower. Today, many tubes are produced in China and Russia for the consumer market. These tubes have different requirements and different profit margins. For instance, the internal components are often crimped together instead of welded, making them more vulnerable to shorts caused by thermal cycling (heating and cooling from turning them on and off). These new tubes have become known for higher rates of premature failure known as \u201cinfant mortality.\u201d Many factors affect this depending on the equipment being used and how, as well as the tube itself. Vintage amplifiers in the US were designed for two-prong cables using 110V; while today, we use three-prong 120V power. This almost ten percent increase can be enough to push a tube past its maximum safe operating voltage. Some problems are not caused by the tubes themselves. Many people are buying kits to replace their rectifier tubes with solid-state for various reasons. These solid-state rectifiers are often ten to fifteen percent more efficient than the tubes they replace. This sounds good on paper, but the increase can cause problems with the electrolytic capacitors and requires the amp to be re-biased or risk damage. Solid state rectifiers also do not allow the tubes in the amplifier time to warm-up, without a standby switch. This can eventually cause the power tubes to short due to the deformation of the cathode. When tubes are the issue, they have two failure modes. Normally, a tube can die, much like a burned-out lightbulb. In this instance, you can easily swap in a new one, bias the amp, and you\u2019re good to go. Sometimes, a tube will short. In this instance, the tube will usually take multiple components with it, causing a cascading failure that results in a high repair bill or a new amplifier. Amp Defenders isolate your amplifier\u2019s components, preventing such failures from spreading. They are inexpensive, easy to install, and do not affect your amplifier\u2019s function, sound, or feel. Rectifier Tube Amp Defender The Rectifier Tube Amp Defender prevents a rectifier tube short from causing other amplifier components to fail, and the only thing lost would be the rectifier tube itself. In the event of tube rectifier failure, we will replace your Rectifier Tube Amp Defender for the cost of postage. Typically, the Rectifier Tube Amp Defender is fine, but it should be inspected to ensure the continued protection of your equipment. We feel it is simply better for you to replace it, which is why we offer such replacements. Power Tube Amp Defender The Power Tube Amp Defender protects the power tubes, the output transformer, and the speaker. Depending on the design of the amplifier, it may also protect the power transformer and filter capacitors. The Power Tube Amp Defender protects against power surges, stabilizes the output section, isolates the power tube from other components in the event of a short, and protects the power tube and output transformer from spiking by diverting them to ground.

However, they lack final fit and finish. \u00a0They do not necessarily represent the look of the finished product.\u00a0 The structure of our rewards can be a little confusing. We are offering Amp Defenders in either the Power Tube or Rectifier Tube model. You can pledge more based on the reward tier if you want extras. The amount per unit for add-ons is specified in description for the reward. The configuration of the Amp Defender will vary based on the tubes they are used with. To make it easier, we will ask you in the backer survey the tube model and we will note the proper configuration. In the backer survey you will need to specify the following: Retainer Clips \"Bear Trap\" style retaining clips, most common in Fender amplifiers. We prefer other retainers as these can damage the base of the tube. They are available as an add-on to your Amp Defender for $1 each. Retainer Extension Springs Many amplifiers use spring style retainers to keep tubes secure. The added height of the Amp Defender may be past the limit of the springs. We will offer extension springs to compensate for the added height, to be added to the current spring for a better fit. They are available as an add-on to your Amp Defender for $1 per set (2 springs).",
  "After 3 years of development, the 3D printed automated pickup winder is finally here! As a guitar builder, the struggle of making handmade pickup machines became too much and I knew there was lots of room for improvement. With the Dragon, all you need to do is connect the parts and choose how many turns you want. The dragon doesn\u2019t only offer you easy access to custom pickups, but also fast returnability. Decide the way you sound with your very own custom single coil within 5 minutes and under 20 dollars. You can easily create a humbucker pickup too, this in 10 minutes and under 40 dollars. Getting a pickup made the way you want it will cost you $102/\u20ac90 approximately for a single coil. A humbucker is even more expensive with a price of $145/\u20ac125 for A-brands quality pickups. The dragon makes the production of custom pickups about 5 times less expensive, while keeping the quality high (when using good quality materials). The Dragon is produced in house which means every little part gets a personal quality check by the founder Steven. He is responsible for the production, functionality, and design of the machine. It\u2019s handmade with an Ultimaker S5 and after many tests, we found the perfect filament for this: The Colorfabb N-Gen Lux in Black Diamond. The material uses diffuse reflection to scatter light in all directions which hide individual print lines and creates a smoother finish. Following the great maker movement that has happened in the last decade with desktop 3d printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, waterjets,\u2026 it is pretty clear that there is a need for manufactural independence. People don\u2019t want to shop and look for something that might soothe their need, they want to make the very thing they imagined. And with all this beautiful technology it\u2019s all possible in a matter of hours.\u00a0 Here at Nebula, we follow this line of thought, because why settle for something that everyone owns and uses? Instead, we want you to create your own identity, the sound and feel you hear when you imagine yourself playing the guitar.\u00a0 By using 3D printing and all of its advantages we aim for a Belgian, high-quality brand that delivers beautiful, high-end musical freedom. By manufacturing in house we are constantly hands-on with the manufacturing process. If there is a flaw that our costumers report, it can immediately be fixed.\u00a0 People that want their own identity and makers that want to create a business around guitar pickups can produce the product they envisioned. Luthiers, music stores, repair shops and so on, can service broken or old pickups with ease.\u00a0 Be a maker. Designed, produced, assembled and packaged in Belgium. Decide the way you sound",
  "Appetizers, Main Course, Desserts Chef Gustavo Pasquini \nIn 2012 I began my cooking journey in Brasil and studied at  \u201cSenac, Juiz de Fora\u201d, in Minas Gerais, developing my basic culinary techniques.\u00a0  Later I worked in a local restaurant, and rose to a role in management, helping to increase the clientele base. I then discovered a refined bistro called \u201cAssunta\u201d in Minas Gerais and cooked as a Chef de parti. In this place I became sure of what I wanted for my life. Learning an important chef\u2019s culinary art at that time aroused my desire to live abroad; learn English and improve my culinary techniques.  Following this experience I traveled to Ireland in Europe and began working in an Irish restaurant as a Kitchen Porter and later working as a Chef de Parti.  Having met my girlfriend, I embarked on the third part of journey to Thailand in 2014 where I gained an Asian cooking experience and improved my International culinary techniques.\nIn Bangkok I had the privilege of undertaking a course in one of the most prestigious international networks of French cuisine; \u201cLe Cordon Bleu\u201d.

  "Buenas! Como muchas personas, siempre me he replanteado escribir un libro y por fin he sacado tiempo y dedicaci\u00f3n para ello. El libro radica en, aproximadamente, un 75% de mi propia historia y de mis experiencias vividas. Todo enfocado a relaciones amorosas fallidas, amores plat\u00f3nicos, errores ajenos y propios que he ido desarrollando. Al final se observa como va cambiando mi punto de vista de las cosas, como pago con unas personas lo sufrido por otras, como me lo hacen a mi. Esta es mi historia, llena de desamores, \u00a0desencantos y desilusiones.\u00a0",
  "Hey! As the campaign winds down, you should definitely check out the stretch goals! - - - \u00a0My name is Ngozi and I'm the creator of Check, Please!, an online comic about hockey, college, and the frequent baking of pies. Since the summer of 2013, Check, Please! has updated about every other month with complete, fully-illustrated episodes. I successfully Kickstarted Year One and now I\u2019m back to print Year Two and reprint Year One! Check, Please! follows Eric \u201cBitty\u201d Bittle, a former Georgia junior figure skating champion, vlogger extraordinaire, and master baker who gets a scholarship playing hockey at Samwell University. Not only is Bitty bite-sized for a hockey player, he is not at all a bro and has one great fear: getting checked\u2014or hit\u2014while on the ice. The first volume of Check, Please follows Bitty\u2019s freshman year. Over the course of the school year at Samwell, Bitty manages to befriend his bro-y teammates and find a home, all while dealing with the brooding Jack Zimmermann, captain of the Samwell men\u2019s hockey team and former hockey prodigy. \u00a0 Bitty\u2019s sophomore year is the the volume we\u2019re Kickstarting! From moving into the Samwell Hockey Haus at the beginning of the year, to saying goodbye to seniors at graduation, Bitty's life changes a ton during his second year at Samwell. And you can read all about it here! The goal of this project is to collect the comics from the second volume of Check, Please!\u2014aka, Bitty\u2019s sophomore year\u2014into a full-color printed book. Not only will the finished book compile the main comics, it will also include extra features such as concept pages and a wealth of author notes\u2014all of which are book exclusive! I\u2019ll also be reprinting Year One\u00a0which is currently sold out. The last campaign was incredible. It was the largest project I have ever undertaken and I learned a lot from it. I want to make sure that there are as few complications and delays as possible this time around. Another change for this campaign\u00a0is that instead of signing books themselves I'll be signing sticker bookplates for any physical editions. For the Year One kickstarter, I had to fly to Austin, TX and sign books for two days straight--this slowed down the shipping process immensely. By doing signed bookplates that are included with your physical copy, you can apply the bookplate yourself or tuck it inside if you prefer! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u2606THE BOOKS - You can get Year Two and Year One in digital, softcover, or hardcover formats! Both books come with author notes and extras not seen on the web. You can even get physical editions that come with signed bookplates!\u00a0  \u2606 PRINT SETS - A set of FOUR (4) Year Two themed postcard sized (4x6\u201d) prints. The images above are examples, the final prints will be different. \u2606 BITTY'S SAMWELL JERSEY - That's right, you can own Bitty's Samwell jersey! I'll be working extensively with a real apparel company to create number 15's white Samwell sweater!  \u2605 ARTIST BOOKPLATE - Custom bookplates are bookplates that I design, print, illustrate on, and glue into a book with PVA bookbinding glue. This is as custom as it gets!  \u2605 DIGITAL COMMISSIONS\u00a0- A high-res, full-color PG-Rated digital illustration of up to two Check, Please characters with a simple background. Please have your commission idea ready. I'll shoot you a message during the campaign for approval. If I'm not comfortable with the content or rating, you'll be able to lower or cancel your pledge before being charged. Thanks you!  \u2605 BE-A-WELLIE! \u00a0- Get drawn into the comic as a background character at Samwell University and become part of the Check, Please universe! You send me a photo and I'll send you a message before the comic update in which you appear! \u00a0",
  "Thoughtful Dinosaur is the story of Billy Veloci, a young lady velociraptor who just graduated from college, got a job, and has her life planned out. Unfortunately her plans are jacked when she gets fired (along with 99% of the rest of the company, because the CEO liquidated it and took the funds with him to elope with his mistress). Now Billy has to piece her life back together and figure out how to adult the best she can. Here's what some lovely folks have said about it: \"It's a delight!\" - Dragonhide Studios\n\n\u00a0 \"Never pretentious or overwritten...If you\u2019d argue that the fantasy is kind of a gimmick, in the sense that the story could happen just as well with human characters, I won\u2019t deny it, but it is done with so much charm and expressiveness that I don\u2019t mind at all, and neither should you.\" - Provocative Praise \"Maybe I need to use hundred-dollar terms like zeitgeist and touchstone and generational trauma, or tell you what it is to be a post-grad Millennial, in the ways that Kelci\u2019s comic does. I need to explain to you how much it hurts to see your entire peer group grow up together, go through the system, follow all the rules, and still come out defeated. I need to tell you how heartwarming it is to watch them get back up again, take hands with them, and maybe put on some silly hats together as we go into our new enterprises as Silly Hat Specialists. But Thoughtful Dinosaur already does that, and better than I could.\" - Jeff Laclede, creator of El-Indon and Ask the Werewolves The story was published originally for only patrons on Patreon and email newsletter subscribers. Now, the KickStarter is here to make it a paperback book!\n\n\u00a0 Hold it! I can hear you say. Who are you?\n\n\u00a0 I'm Kelci Crawford, creator of Thoughtful Dinosaur and many other comics, including Seeing Him and Johnson & Sir (both of which were successfully funded on KickStarter. Thank you, backers).\n\n\u00a0 Wait \u2013 you have a Patreon? Why not just use those funds?\n\n\u00a0 The patrons on Patreon made the actual drawing of the comic strips possible by paying for art supplies \u2013 thank you patrons! However, the funds aren't enough to get a book fully funded, printed, AND shipped. That's why this KickStarter campaign is happening.\n\n\u00a0 Where's my money gonna' go?\n\n\u00a0 Here's what your funds will help cover (and yes, this is number time, so stick with me):\n\n\u00a0 What about Stretch Goals? We made our initial goal, which is AWESOME! Now, if we can meet these next milestones, the following rewards can be divided out to backers: **ACHIEVED!!** $500 - THOUGHTFUL POSTCARDS\u00a0All backers who pledge to get a paperback copy of the book get a nice and thick 5 inch by 7 inch postcard included in their rewards! (Digital backers will get this as a desktop download). **ACHIEVED!!** $600 - BUTTONS EVERYWHERE\u00a0All backers who pledge to get a paperback copy of the book get a 1.25 inch button (design coming soon). (For digital backers, the design will be an icon you can use for Twitter, Tumblr, and other social media). Can we make it past $600? I don't know, but it would be Jeffin' AWESOME if we did! Please give what you can and spread the word! If you're broke, spread the word! Tell your friends who love dinosaurs to support Billy Veloci. Thank you for reading. You. Are. Awesome.",
  "As you can see by our photo below, we have tested several proof of concepts. With the advice of professionals, we have designed and developed the perfect MP3 player for those with memory challenges; specifically Dementia, including Alzheimer's Disease.\u00a0 The aging process brings many challenges, including confusion and frustration over today's technology. Melody Matinee has simplified our design by decreasing the number of easy-access function buttons to two. We have compartmentalized the SD Card, Volume Control and an added Master On/Off Button. And, the unit will automatically shut-off after playing 10 songs.\u00a0\u00a0 We reduced the cost and the weight by changing to an ABS plastic, eliminating Bluetooth, WiFi and other unnecessary features. The Music Player is portable, rechargeable and continues to feature a headphone jack.\u00a0 This campaign is to pay the balance of our engineering charges, the CAM programming fee and produce our portable working prototype.\u00a0 We know the connection between music and memory is very significant. It is thought that the part of the brain, which processes music-memories, is among the last of the brain regions to decline. Although our SD Card can hold approximately 200 songs per GB, many of our end-users may forget the previous song and enjoy the limited familiarity of particular artists and/or songs. Each unit will include ten \"Top 10\" songs from when the end-user was 15-19 years old; part of their \u2018reminiscence bump\u2019. Note: Our friends, featured in the video, were recorded listening and dancing to Elvis Presley's \"All Shook Up\". However, due to copyright laws, we have changed the music for this campaign.",

  "Frank and Maisie catch the same bus to work every single day. Eventually, they pluck up the courage to talk to one another. In Andy Lake's wittiest and most romantic script yet, the short film follows their year together, as they grow closer and further apart. Oh, and it's all set\u00a0waiting for - or on - the Number 19 bus. This is a film for anyone who has ever fancied a total stranger on the bus or the train or the tube, and never done anything about it. Andy Lake will be directing the film and playing the part of Frank. He has previously written, directed and starred in Humble Pie and Jim's War - both generously\u00a0funded by the Kickstarter community - and if you enjoyed them, you will LOVE The Number 19. He has been a part of many theatre productions and short films, including\u00a0the much acclaimed\u00a0Journey Home (dir. Alex Campbell), which screened at the BFI Future Film Festival, the National Film Festival for Talented Youth, and the\u00a0Sundance Film Festival\u00a0in the US. When Andy's not creating charming little dramas, he works as a radio presenter and reporter\u00a0for the BBC and LBC. Christine Lloyd-Fitt studied Fine Art at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, before getting a masters in Cinematography at the National Film and Television School in London. For the past fifteen years,\u00a0she has worked as a cinematographer on feature films, short dramas and award winning documentaries for the BBC and Channel Four. Sam Gamble worked with Andy and Christine on both Humble Pie and Jim's War, and is currently reading Film Production in Winchester. He has also written and shot a handful of his own short films. Clare Day and Jon Beech make up the production team. They both have bags of experience in taking a project\u00a0from a concept to a\u00a0final product, having worked on both Humble Pie and Jim's War, and on many other projects as writers, producers, directors and actors with local companies including WRiTEON and The Revellers. Professional lighting designer Gregory Jordan will also be working on the project, Will Barrington and Mikey Pavlou will be looking after the sound on set and the foley in post production, and the wonderful Sam Booker will be composing an original soundtrack - which you can hear a taste of in the video above. We must also express our sincere appreciation to Mick and Jean Ward for offering the use of their beautiful bus. All of our team are taking time out of their busy schedules to make The Number 19 volountarily - but we still need a little bit of money to cover all of our expenses.

  "Hey guys! It's Samantha Poitier, here, aka Sam.  I was inspired to start writing and composing music again about two months ago. That is how I created the ballad, \"Try\". This song is about someone who meets a person who is not open to love because of past hurts. It's a soulful plea to someone to open up the heart to the possibility of love and happiness by giving it a \"try\".  I believe this is one of my best writing projects to date and I would like to see how far this song can go by recording it professionally and releasing it on iTunes. Who knows, if this actually becomes something you may be helping the next big recording artist get on the world stage. Let's do it!",

  "Littlebrain Theatre is raising money to fund our devised stage adaptation of Vittorio De Sica's 1948 masterpiece Bicycle Thieves. This is a 60-minute, 9-actor adaptation of the film that will be developed during Fall 2018, for performances in Winter 2019 in Chicago.\u00a0 WHAT IS \"BICYCLE THIEVES?\" Consistently ranked among the greatest works of world cinema, Ladri Di Biciclette (1948) is a hallmark of the Italian neorealism movement. Directed by Vittorio De Sica (Umberto D, La Ciociara), the film is notable for its sweeping camera shots of post-WWII Rome, juxtaposing the poor working conditions of the city with the natural beauty of the city's architecture. The story \u2013 about a man named Ricci and his son Bruno, and their quest to track down a bicycle once it is stolen from them \u2013 asks powerful questions about the relationship between class and ethics, and what people are willing to do for their families when pushed to the edge. The film was awarded a Special Academy Award in 1950, and claimed the #1 spot on the first Sight & Sound Critic's Poll, being named the best film ever made only four years after its release. As of the 2012 Sight & Sound poll, Bicycle Thieves remains listed at #33 on the Critic's Poll, and #10 on the Director's Poll.\u00a0 WHO ARE LITTLEBRAIN THEATRE? Littlebrain Theatre consists of producer Clare Brennan and director Zach Barr. Both are Chicago-based theatre artists, who have joined forces to collaborate on this initial piece of work. The term \"little brain\" serves a double meaning: as the nickname for the cerebellum, the part of the brain that plays a role in both motor control and language comprehension, and as a description of the kind of work we produce \u2013 art that requires just \"a little brain\" to understand. We are committed to telling stories that are easily understood and accessible to as wide an audience as possible. Theatre is for everyone, and Bicycle Thieves is a story that all audiences can gain from hearing nowadays. WHY NOW? WHY \"BICYCLE THIEVES?\" Italy in the late 1940s was just coming out of the Second World War. The economy was weak but just beginning to grow again, the country was divided into political factions, the working class found it difficult to get well-paying jobs, and the overall atmosphere was a sense of foreboding dread that the world wouldn't get better in the future. Sound familiar? While not a perfect parallel to our current climate, Bicycle Thieves' setting provides the perfect opportunity to have a conversation about the link between class and ethics: how the two affect each other, and how easily one person's ethical failings can be easily explained by a society by scapegoating their class. Naturally, every case is more complex than that \u2013 and Bicycle Thieves proves this, by allowing an audience to watch as the backstory behind one person's lapse in morality is given the necessary context to identify and understand it, without condoning it. It's a story that's honest, yet uplifting, in a way that makes it necessary in a divided time in history. WHY SHOULDN'T I JUST WATCH THE MOVIE? Bicycle Thieves celebrates its 70th anniversary in 2018, and a modern audience's reading of the film changes dramatically from how it affected audiences upon release. With a new stage adaptation comes the opportunity to double-down on the aspects of the story that are most impactful for a modern audience: the ethical questions it asks, the picture it paints of life in an urban environment, the pressure to find a job that supports your family. At the same time, the adaptation allows us to revisit and revise certain aspects of the film. We plan to cast the adaptation with a diverse group of performers, varying in gender, age, race, ability, and experience. De Sica made it a priority that his movies employ non-professional actors, and not simply film stars. We hope to do the same, inviting in a mixture of actors of different experience levels to bring fresh thoughts and opinions on the source material into our rehearsal room. A stage adaptation also brings a unique challenge to capture the emotional impact of De Sica's brilliant shot compositions. The ensemble-based method of devising keeps our focus on the emotional weight of each moment of the film, rather than simply transcribing the script and performing it verbatim. The stage imagery will compliment the film, rather than replicate it.\u00a0 YOU MENTION \"PERFORMANCES IN WINTER 2019.\" WHEN, EXACTLY? We are currently applying to take Bicycle Thieves to a festival in Chicago that performs in Winter 2019. While we will formally know if we've been selected for the festival in mid-October, we are planning for either option. If we are selected, we will perform with the festival. If not, we fully intend to rent a performance venue and move forward with the project nonetheless. As more information becomes available, we will keep you in the loop.\u00a0",
  "It's from a play called Bluebird by Simon Stephens. He wrote The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time at the National Theatre, Fatherland at The Lyric, Seawall at The Old Vic.

A man, in a Hawaiian shirt, sucking Special Brew through a straw. A prostitute of indistinguishable age. A bouncer in black jacket and dicky bow. He has met them all. But despite listening to confessions, fantasies, even the odd flirt, there is something he can\u2019t speak of to anyone. Except his ex-wife. If only she would answer the phone. \u00a0\"Woah, what's going on there?\"\n\n\u00a0 Well, that would be spoiling it. But what we CAN tell you is that we have a whole bunch of car parts on stage plus a pretty epic 1990s playlist.\n\n\u00a0 \"I like the sound of that. Who's putting it on?\"\n\n\u00a0 Space Productions is the home grown, professional theatre company at the Space in London, a performing arts and community centre in Tower Hamlets, East London which has been providing support for emerging artists and creative opportunities for the local community for 30 years.  \u00a0We exist to re-invigorate modern classics for a new audience. We are passionate about finding plays from the past 50 years that excite us and deserve a new lease of life - hence Bluebird.\n\n\u00a0 We believe in the power of the ensemble, working collaboratively to create courageous and captivating work, actively seeking to find, nurture and showcase emerging talent.  This will be our 25th production since 2007. Success includes sell out performances and six Off West End Award Nominations. \"I'm not sure I've ever been to the Space before...\"\n\n\u00a0 We are fast becoming one of the most exciting fringe venues in London \u201ccontinually providing a launch pad for new talent\u201d (Spy in the stalls, 2018) programming \u201cincredibly ambitious and interesting new work\u201d (Theatre Box Blog, 2018).

  "I've been drawing Nothing to be Done since March this year, and I am very much still going. I finished the first chapter back in June, and since then I've been trying to figure out if it'd be possible to print it. Turns out, the answer is yes! Hey folks! So as of a few days ago, we hit the funding goal! I should have been more ambitious, methinks. But to make up for it, here are some stretch goals- if you want to see these included in your rewards get the word out there and get your friends to back it! ACHIEVED! \u00a3350: Mini prints: All backers with physical rewards will receive a kickstarter exclusive A5 mini print on watercolour paper! ACHIEVED! \u00a3450: Bonus art: All copies of Nothing to be Done issue one will contain 4 extra pages featuring art by guest artists! ACHIEVED! \u00a3600: Enamel pins: All backers with physical rewards will receive a kickstarter exclusive enamel pin to glitter at people from their lapel or bag or wherever they choose to put it! \u00a3800:\u00a0Website upgrade: I'll upgrade the website and get it off Tumblr. There'll be a better archive system, amongst other benefits!  \u00a31000: Bigger books: Rather than 12x16 cm, all copies of Nothing to be Done issue one will be 15x20 cm! Nothing to be Done opens with a woman called Frankie waking up in bed, incredibly hungover, while someone bashes her door down. Or at least tries to. When she eventually makes it to her door, she discovers it's her best friend Jones. \u00a0Jones is... a friend. Jones is Frankie's best friend. Jones is at least as mentally unstable as Frankie is in a whole different way. Jones has decided the world isn't real. \u00a0And so they go to the pub. \u00a0And that's kind of what happens. They spend a lot of time in the pub talking about what happened. What might happen. About breakups. About depression. About delusions. About hypotheticals. It all sounds a bit sad laid out like that but I'm not sure it is. Well, personally I think it's pretty good. But I'm not the only one, apparently. \u00a0Besides various folks who've told me they enjoy the comic, Richard Bruton gave it a very nice review over at the Forbidden Planet International Blog, where he not only called me 'older and wiser' (the fool) but also said lovely things such as this: \"And over the 60+ pages Johnson (pretty much) absolutely nails it, giving us page after page of Frankie and Jones talking, the back and forth between the two characters naturalistic and real, his conversational tone spot on, you can hear the post breakup misery in Frankie\u2019s voice, feel every bit of regretful hangover headache as she shakes off last night so slowly, barely processing what Jones has to say for the first twenty or so pages. And once she does realise what he\u2019s saying, her anger kicks in, anger at him for coming to her, today of all days, with another one of his idiot ideas, anger at her girlfriend for the break up, anger at the bottle of gin for being drunk last night, but most of all an anger at herself for fucking it up, fucking it all up once again. So much of the joy of Nothing To Be Done for me is the sheer energy of the artwork on each page, with Johnson\u2019s style switching from earlier work, developing into something of far thicker line, utilising a really fabulously limited palette of colours, rarely switching from what you see here on the page, the exception being a carefully considered flashback sequence or two. I\u2019ve enjoyed his work from the very start, and oh, it\u2019s such a pleasure to be able to point you at something very new and very, very good from him.\" If you donate to this project, you have access to a whole bunch of perks including my everlasting love, the book, sketches, and did I mention my everlasting love? If we make more than the minimum I'll look at ways of giving all of the physical pledge levels more, until then, it's what you see on the rewards listings!",
  "Angora is a sheltered young girl who is sent on a mission: to find the center. Her journey will take her from the depths of the southern jungles to the deceptive warmth of the desert cities, to the bitter peaks of the Northern Territories where a new war has broken out after years of uneasy peace. And as the bonds of civilization slowly weaken, monstrous powers with their own motivations walk the earth once more... but who will be left to inherit it? The Meek is a long-format, character driven adventure about the gray areas between the good and bad, revenge and forgiveness, life and death. I am overjoyed to finally make a print version of the comic available to readers old and new :] \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0For years, the only way to enjoy the entirety of The Meek has been online, through the webcomic format. Now, for the first time ever, I will be printing the first three chapters- nearly 150 full-color comic pages- for readers to enjoy in physical form. The art and formatting has been fully refreshed for this volume to bring you the best looking version of the comic that has ever existed. The books will also feature all-new bonus material that has never been available before. Anyone who has followed my work for a while knows I have notoriously resisted merchandising my work. But in honor of my first Kickstarter, I am excited to introduce some stretch goals and special rewards: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Additionally, as we meet our stretch goals, the physical quality of the book will increase as well with gloss, french flaps and more! These additions will not come at any extra cost to you; as we unlock our stretch goals, the book in your reward tier will simply become more beautiful.  I am a biologist, an educator, and a self-taught independent artist.  I've been working on this comic in one form or another since my early teens, and have been hosting and posting the comic online for readers to enjoy for free since 2007. The response to my work throughout the years has been incredibly gratifying. I am so thankful for your readership, and excited to be able to finally give you a physical copy of the comic that means so much to me. \u00a0 This KS would not be possible without the kind support of Music: Decisions Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

  "\u201cThe Cloned Orphan: A Tragedie Most Black\u201d is a dramatization about a woman named Sarah who sees someone who looks just like her, but as she uncovers the mystery she learns there are even more of them. She may be a clone, one of many, but she will do all she can to live life her own way. With scenes and highlights from the story, this trailer-of-a-play will get you intrigued and caught up on Clone Club- but with a Shakespearean twist. This will be a slightly different style than what we've done before. Our previous projects have been mostly music video parodies and original sketches featuring popular characters, but this one will be more like a trailer than anything else. We will recreate a variety of scenes from the first four seasons of Orphan Black, but rephrased as if they were written by Shakespeare himself. It will also be performed on a stage to help give a more theatrical feel, which is something new and exciting for us! Our script was written by the lovely Aurora Culver, who has a plethora of experience producing and directing stage plays. She is the founder of On The Edge Theater Productions, which has put on several full Shakespeare performances including Macbeth and Twelfth Night. We are thrilled to embark on this journey with her! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *** Stephano Salazar (who played John Laurens in A Very Hamilton Christmas Parody) as the sassy Felix!

We found a theater that will accommodate us during this busy season of play productions (L.A. Fringe Festival!), but it is going to cost us for the full 10-12 hours that we need to shoot our video. Not to mention use of their lights and equipment! You've probably noticed that every clone has her own unique style, so we of course need to represent that in this video. While many of our costumes will be provided by friends and crew members, we still have to pay for those pieces we don't yet have. Our goal is to have a mixture of Shakespeare's Elizabethan style and a more modern look (like in the actual show).\u00a0 Wigs! Obviously our main actress won't have the right hair for every clone, so we'll need to have some convincing wigs for her to change into in each scene. Each clone (and Felix!) also has very different makeup styles. We may also need to do special effects makeup for such things as blood on Helena (because let's face it-- when isn't Helena covered in blood?), scars on one of the Castor clone's faces, etc.\u00a0 We already have our camera but we'll need to rent some lighting equipment to help emphasize or diffuse the theater lights.\u00a0 Craft services is important for a full functioning, hard working crew. After that 10th hour, a pick me up can really go a long way! Plus, our cast and crew will need a hot meal to keep them fueled for the second half of shooting. And since it will be the beginning of summer in southern CA, tons of water is a MUST.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *** The more support we get, the better the final product!

  "The Percussa micro Super Signal Processor (mSSP) Eurorack Module is a powerful Eurorack DSP module based on one of the fastest ARM processors available, the quad core Cortex A17 at 1.8GHz, and high end AKM audio converters offering 8 in / 4 out with up to 192kHz sample rate and 32-bit resolution, DC coupled.\u00a0 The mSSP comes with 50 pre-made patches covering a wide variety of synthesis techniques such as wavetable, granular, subtractive and modal synthesis, supporting polyphony and multi-timbrality, and a Mac and Windows software editor to support creating and editing your own patches. Explore some of the video demos below.\u00a0 Scroll down for more demos. The mSSP comes with 50 modular synthesis patches offering polyphonic wavetable, granular, sampling and traditional synthesis techniques, multi-channel audio processing and much more, all in only 26HP of rack space and for only $549.\u00a0\u00a0 The mSSP will also come with a Mac and Windows editor allowing the user to create and edit patches. The editor will connect with the mSSP hardware for real-time updates to patches and will support the SSP as well.\u00a0\u00a0 Audio and Control Voltage I/O DSP Processing Synthesis Engine Development Kit / VST support Display, Graphics and User Interface\u00a0 Connectivity On-board Storage Dimensions and Front Panel Power The demo videos below show two patches running on the mSSP functional prototype:\u00a0 All sound was recorded on the Percussa SSP, using its built-in multichannel recorder, and was then synced to video afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0 The mSSP comes with one of the most powerful ARM processors you can get in a eurorack module: a quad core A17 at 1.8GHz, which provides over 20,000 DMIPS of processing power. The A17 processor we use in the SSP and the mSSP is about 40x more powerful than the Cortex M processors popular in other eurorack modules.\u00a0 By putting more processing power into the user\u2019s hands, we empower them to create better sound and do more within a smaller eurorack system:\u00a0 The mSSP will come with a Mac / Windows software editor allowing patch creation and full editing. Besides that the mSSP will be preloaded with 50 modular synthesis patches which lets users easily create powerful sounds: Below is a preliminary list of patches (subject to change) that will be included with the mSSP. Of the 50 patches we will provide, 25 patches will be based on suggestions and votings of the mSSP backers. So you get a chance to suggest patches and vote on them!\u00a0 Any patch that has been created on the SSP, can be loaded onto the mSSP as well. So besides the patches we will develop you will have the chance to load patches from the SSP community.\u00a0 The UI of the Percussa SSP will use the same philosophy of the Percussa SSP, where only one \u201clevel\u201d of pages is used, to avoid menu diving. There are 2 pages on the mSSP:\u00a0 User Interface Design of the Percussa mSSP\u00a0 Both the mSSP and SSP are equally powerful in terms of DSP power and sound quality, since they share the same CPU as well as the same family of high end audio converters. The table below shows the differences between the two modules in detail:\u00a0 The mSSP software will use the DSP engine we developed for the SSP, featuring more than 25 different synthesis modules. The patches shipped with the mSSP use combinations of these modules, and through the menu system of the mSSP it will be possible to change the parameters of the modules used in the patches.\u00a0 Selection of upcoming modules and features on the SSP:\u00a0 Additional features and modules requested by SSP users are described in the Percussa SSP forum. Since we shipped the SSP we have averaged 1 software update every 1-2 weeks.\u00a0 The Percussa mSSP module is currently a functional prototype, based on the Percussa SSP, which was successfully funded on Kickstarter in September 2017, with first units delivered in June 2018.\u00a0 Here is what we\u2019ve already done development wise for the mSSP:\u00a0 The mSSP module will be based on the carrier PCB design of the SSP, but needs several hardware engineering changes and optimizations in order to produce it at a lower price and to make it fit within 26HP of eurorack space: Besides these hardware modifications, there is also the following to be done software wise:\u00a0 If you are located outside the United States, please note that import duties, taxes or VAT is not included in the pledges. When your shipment clears customs, you (the backer) might be liable for paying import duties or taxes to the customs office in your country.\u00a0 If you are located in California, please note that sales tax is not included in the listed pledges, and depends on the county / city we are shipping to. At the time of shipment, we will calculate the correct CA sales tax and send you an email with a secure payment link asking you to pay the correct sales tax amount for the address we are shipping to. Outside California, within the United States, sales tax is the responsibility of the backer.\u00a0 The HS code for customs classification of the module will be 9209.94.80 00 (parts for musical instruments for which the sound is produced electronically). \u00a0 This kickstarter project would not have happened without the support of our SSP users and community, as well as close friends in the electronic music and music technology communities, and enthousiastic eurorack users.

  "The idea came about as I was trying to enjoy some music at the hot tub and the pool with my family. \u00a0It was very inconvenient to have the device outside of the tub or pool to keep it safe. So I thought of a way to keep all devices together, while floating, be able to skip a song, search or turn the volume up or down without getting out of the water.... that sounds like a good idea. I am a product developer, and I had many ideas of possible products that people may like or find useful, but this is a very simple idea that just made it very easy to pursue. Its a product that made sense to me, and it will make sense to others; plus its very affordable. \u00a0You really get the bang for your buck. \u00a0its technically three products in one. \u00a01. Water proof speaker, 2. a water proof floating phone case, and the innovating part of the product, 3. the inflatable base. Stage 1 - The concept: \u00a0A little background on the origin of the initial concepts; We started thinking on the inflatable as the main base, and how to bring all the elements in the same environment. \u00a0Our first design was an attempt to keep an easy and accessible interface to the user at the same time keeping the devices safe. \u00a0That's how we came up with our 3 core design goals:\u00a0 1. Easy to set up and use, \u00a02. Portable, and 3. keep the devices safe. Stage 2 - proof of concept: \u00a0At this stage we started documenting all design parameters for each one of the elements. we received our first prototypes of the inflatable body, phone case, and samples of speakers, batteries and drivers. Stage 3 - Design clean up: \u00a0We finalized gathering all product requirements and started modifying more of the aesthetic part of the project to make it more appealing. \u00a0When we introduced the product industrial design to the project, we discovered a whole spectrum of possibilities to make our product great.\u00a0 During stage 3, we tested the new design features, received revised prototypes of the inflatable, and with all audio specifications from stage 1, we teamed up with a speaker \u00a0manufacturer that will design and manufacture our IPX7 speaker. Stage 4 - Design challenges and troubleshooting: After testing the new design, there were minor and major challenges that came about. \u00a0Starting with minor challenges, the inflatable body was too small for the total weight of the upper portion. \u00a0The design of the inflatable itself was a challenge from the manufacturing perspective. \u00a0But we ran into a major challenge, the cellphone overheated in 30 minutes of use on direct sun heat. \u00a0This was a show stopper, we could not risk peoples devices. \u00a0So, we went back to the drawing board. By recognizing the major challenge, and trying to keep the our core design features, we found a way to keep the devices protected from heat. Also keeping the versatility and convenience of the product, we solved for the main challenge and kept our core design goals:\u00a0 1. Easy to set up and use, \u00a02. Portable, and 3. keep the devices safe. Stage 5 - Final design, ready for manufacturing: During the design stages of this project, we have established a great relationship with those who will be making our product come true. Our vendors are key to the success of this project, and we are now working on a small batch of marketing samples to push our product. \u00a0We will be heading all our marketing initiatives in Miami, FL. \u00a0And during those events, we will be raffling 15 - 20 products per event. \u00a0As we work on the final stage of this project, we can share the final product renders. \u00a0We cannot wait to launch our product and bring the fun to any environment. \u00a0Specially water.",
  "We present you an innovative stand to greatly comfort your headphone experience. Our headphone stand gives your headphones a sturdy place to rest on. But that's not all, it also brings you an unique switching ability between multiple input devices. The input devices connect through the stand to your headphones. The two knobs on the device make it easy to adjust to your preferred sound or input device. Headphones shouldn\u2019t suffer on your desk or some cheap plastic. Our stand is made from an authentic combination of wood and aluminum. These natural yet durable materials ensure your headset to rest conveniently. Our handcrafted Dutch design fits right in place when deployed. The Kubuni Headphonestand originated from a couple of problems. A lot of people spend long hours behind a desk, be it for work or entertainment. Headphones are an important part of that place. This created the need for a product that could hold our headphones for us, which enables a clean working space. The product is making the life of the user much more convenient, since the product is tackling many problems. Plus it's all put in a durable casing, with zero environmental impact. Seeing the branch doesn't have such a similar product, we have decided to take action. When we started developing the stand, we found some other needs and implemented these into the product. The first need was to control the volume of your headphones with one physical knob, so we placed one on the product. The second need was to have the possibility to wirelessly connect with your pair of wired headphones. This makes that you can easily enjoy some high-quality music via Bluetooth from your smartphone. And when you want to switch back to your wired source, a desktop, laptop, record player or anything else, you just switch back in one click. This is all done by using the second knob put on the product. And since we appreciate good music, we strive for a super clean sound. We therefore integrated some ingenious solutions and deliver an external ground-loop. This results in a very clean listening experience without any unwanted noises. The Headphonestand is a unique product which will be sold in limited numbers. We especially grant crowdfunding backers the option to choose from four different kinds of wood for their stand. Backers who choose a special edition are granted with a personal engraving on the stand. You can choose your engraving and the kind of wood in the survey at the end of the campaign. The whole package of components is wrapped in a durable and handcrafted casing. We've used high-quality aluminum, together with a few very beautiful wood veneers. All the materials were selected with quality and environment in mind, and are crafted with ultra-precision. The beauty of the product is a combination of techniques used to produce. The wood parts are fabricated using pure craftsmanship and traditional methods. The steel parts are laser cut and bent by using more modern techniques. And finally the assembly is done by hand, so we can guarantee qualitative products, put together with care and passion. We carefully select our material suppliers for quality and environmental friendliness. Although this comes at a price, it does make a difference. The same goes for our components, when possible we select the more reliable suppliers. This is sadly not the case on almost all products on the market today. The product is designed so it can be easily repaired and disassembled for recycling. This is how we make a circular economical product. The remaining environmental costs are invested in projects helping the earth. This will be made possible by multiple charities. In the end you will enjoy a beautiful product, and the earth isn't negatively affected. The quality of the product is of significant importance. We regularly check on the production process and make sure every stand is checked on damage before shipment. If your stand is not as it should be, we will gladly hear from you. \u00a0Inside of the product are several components, all with the aim to improve audio quality and provide you ease of use. We use high-grade Qualcomm chips to realize precise wireless sound, with full bass. To make sure there are no unwanted noises whatsoever, we also implemented an isolated converter to guarantee there\u2019s no interference noise. Should there be any noise from your own device, no problem: you can connect the delivered ground loop with your cables for optimal sound. The volume control and switching system we use are high-grade analog parts, what also applies to the aux-ports. Why Kickstarter We turned to Kickstarter because we saw ourselves on the leading edge of a new way to create sustainable products to the market. Most of the products on the market nowadays are not environmental friendly. Our vision is to make a change to the consumer electronics market by creating an environmental friendly trend. The funds raised during this campaign will assist us to place initial orders with our manufacturer. International Backers While our shipping partners ship worldwide, it's still possible that in a rare case your country is not available for shipping. If that is the case, we will contact you to discuss further options. Please also note that you will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region. Please contact your local customs office if you are unsure. \nEstimated Delivery Shipment can vary for backers depending on your order and the destined address. While we do not expect these to change, it is possible that the estimated shipment month may shift. We will provide updates when/if the estimated shipment date changes. Warranty  We stand firmly behind our products. Each Headphonestand has a 1-year limited warranty. Contact us if you think you apply for the warranty, our warranty terms can be found in the general terms.",
  "A mysterious fatal sound has reshaped the world and its technology. Humanity is now fundamentally divided and the source of the attack may still be out there, biding it's time. Young Gregg Emilio dreams of flying in a sky that hasn't carried airplanes in a century. On the other side of the world Lorentz Skyfall dreams of going back to work at sea, where he used to explore the world and its old, lost technology. The Din is a character driven story divided into two timelines: Gregg's and Lorentz'. As their paths unfold, we will find out that they might have more in common than merely being dreamers. The Din is an ongoing online comic currently at two chapters, and more to come. The comic is currently published online by Hiveworks, here:\u00a0http://www.dincomic.com\u00a0 This comic is not suitable for children, as it contains graphic violence. This crowdfunding campaign's purpose is to fund the printing of chapter 2 of The Din. Chapter 1 has already been printed. You will be able to buy the chapter 1 book here if you wish!\u00a0 * The books are printed in English. All the pages of chapter 2 has been drawn and gone through one proof copy print (as seen in the video).\u00a0 This is the work I have left before I can start the actual printing of the book: \u25d8 Another round of proofreading\u25d8\u00a0Adjustments to the art \u25d8\u00a0Finalize colors\u25d8\u00a0Finalize .PDF for the printer * Examples of my colored pencil sketch style with simple shading: Tumblr Link\u00a0 - I will put more effort on the Kickstarter sketches than those shown on Tumblr.** The USD is approximate and the currency might change during the time of the campaign. Here's a breakdown of the expenses. It's based on the goal to print 200 books. These books will be used as rewards in this Kickstarter campaign and for me to bring to comic conventions. The number of books is scalable in case I reach a higher goal. Fees are based on the fees of Kickstarter, Payment and an eventual need for BackerKit.\u00a0 Since this is my first time running a Kickstarter, I have included a Misc percentage in the plan. This will mainly go to unexpected material expenses and if books were lost in shipping. \u25d8 50% Printing Costs\u25d8 35% Shipping Costs\u25d8 11% Fees\u00a0\u25d8 4% Misc \u00a0* The Vixiearts print seen in this image is just an example. If the stretch goal of KR 50 000 is reached, she will draw a The Din related piece that I will make into an art print!** Curious about Vixiearts? Look at all the lovely drawings over at her Instagram!*** Want to see the official prints? Have a look at them over here.\u00a0 I'm the writer and artist of The Din. My passion is telling stories through sequential art, animation and games. When I'm not spending time creating The Din, I work full time as an animator and game artist at Hello There\u00a0in Sweden (Avicii | Gravity, Taekwondo Global Tournament & Kung Fury: Street Rage).\u00a0 I have been creating fanzines and comics since 2006.

  "People always stock up on large amounts of food raw materials in the refrigerator especially during the pandemic in case the sudden lock down. That's why we designed Norrast, a perfect companion for home refrigerators. Its small and compact design fits nicely into the limited space of a refrigerator and releases powerful energy to eliminate potentially bacteria and odors. Noorast adopted the ultra clean technology that can cover all dimensions in the fridge space. The built-in air pressurization allows 360\u00b0cycle and fast release actively, effectively reducing most offensive odors, providing you with a safer and odorless food storage environment. The Noorast deodorizer provides 3 modes to adjust and is able to match different volumes of fridge, even a 300L fridge can be purified in 30 mins. Meet your different needs and save power. The Noorast deodorizer delivers a sustained and steady release of efficient ozone, killing harmful bacteria and eliminating odors, keeping the fridge smells fresh and long-lasting. Noorast releases ozone to effectively inhibit the release of ripening agent on the surface of fruit and vegetable to prolong the effect of food preservation period. The safety of food is extremely important. One of the ozone effects is oxidation of pesticide residue in fruits and vegetables and destroying its effective gene, significantly lowering concentration of pesticide residues. Noorast weighs only 120g. It is easily powered by Type-C cable and continually works for 30 days with full charge. With the splints design, you can just clip it to any shelf corner of the refrigerator, saving you more space by not taking up storage space at all.\u00a0 Not only for the fridge, you can take it out when you are on a business trip or out traveling. Bring this portable ozone generator with you, and you can clean and sterilize everything anytime and anywhere!",
  "After the successful launch of our Tom Rice A-11 in 2019, we have continued our mission of working with veterans to share their legendary stories. This led us to Vince Speranza, a WW2 veteran of the 101st Airborne Division. Since then, we\u2019ve been working on developing a watch fit for the hero: the A-11 Vince Speranza Edition. Vince made a name for himself at the Battle of the Bulge as a machine-gunner, manning an M1919. He was part of the heroic defense of the Belgium city of Bastogne. Created in honor of the fallen heroes and veterans who fought and resisted against all odds at the Battle of the Bulge, we are proud to present our A-11 Vince Speranza Edition. \u00a0Assembled in the USA The A-11 Vince Speranza Edition is a watch that we\u2019ve been on for months to provide you with the best possible value. Featuring American Assembly, a choice of Swiss or Japanese Automatic Movement, and a double domed sapphire, we\u2019ve built a quality watch made to withstand tough everyday use. Our A-11 is powered by a choice of either a Swiss or Japanese Automatic Movement. These types of movements feature a self-powering mechanism forgoing the use of batteries to keep track of time. The watch will recharge itself with the movement of your wrist as long as you use it daily. For the more nostalgic, both movements will also feature manual wind-up - just like the original A-11\u2019s did.\u00a0 A neat feature included in both packages is the ability for movement hacking - another key component of original A-11s for coordination between different groups. Original A-11s featured a domed acrylic glass which was cheap to manufacture and easy to scratch. We\u2019ve modernized our A-11 by using the strongest glass available to the industry today: Sapphire.\u00a0 Extremely scratch resistant with a 9/10 on the MOS hardness scale you won\u2019t need to worry about going rough on this watch. In addition, we\u2019ve kept the original double dome shape of the crystal in order to stay as authentic as possible giving a unique side profile and personality to our A-11 VS edition. All our A-11 Vince Speranza Edition watches will be using high-quality Italian Leather to ensure comfortable wear and solid resistance to tear. We\u2019ve gone into a custom design for both versions of our straps to include references to Vince's trusted M1919 30.cal Machine gun.\u00a0 Our M1919 Strap reproduces directly the barrel of Vince\u2019s Machine Gun whereas the Machine Gunner strap features an embossed M1919 drawing on the front and, an engraving on the back referencing Vince\u2019s Battle of the Bulge experience.\u00a0 The caseback is probably the most unique piece on our A-11 Vince Speranza Edition. First off, we\u2019ve got many questions about the bullet and its impact on comfort. Rest assured, we\u2019ve tested it out over multiple weeks with no issues whatsoever to our wrists. \u00a0Also, a diverse panel of Bloggers and YouTubers have received samples and highlighted that the watch was comfortable on their wrists. Indeed, we went for an original design featuring a down-sized 30.cal bullet on the case-back at Vince\u2019s request. We\u2019ve also added markings that tell the story behind the A-11 watch and, make sure that the sacrifices made by our veterans are never forgotten. Army Veteran Vince Speranza served in the 101st Airborne Division, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment. He survived the brutal winter of \u201944/\u201945 and the Battle of the Bulge, one of the deadliest battles in World War II. Speranza tells many stories of his time in World War II in his book, Nuts! A 101st Airborne Division Machine Gunner at Bastogne. He fought in combat as a machine gunner, freed Holocaust survivors and became a local legend for his selflessness. A-11 wristwatches were manufactured during WWII according to a U.S. military standard. American watch companies like Elgin, Waltham, and Bulova produced these watches. Most of them had white hands and Arabic numerals, as well as 60-minute graduations on their plain black dials. These watches were mission-critical as they allowed for troops to coordinate their attacks and effectively communicate to each other. The Vince Speranza A-11, in many ways, is an upgraded version of the original A-11 watches produced in WWII. \u00a0The reinterpretation doesn\u2019t have a diameter of 32mm anymore, but it\u2019s available in two larger sizes of 38 and 42mm.\u00a0",
  "WHY ARE WE FUNDRAISING? We really need your help to meet the basic costs of bringing our critically acclaimed new solo show to the Baillie Room at Assembly Hall, one of the top venues at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival. REALLY WANT TO HURT ME is written and directed by Ben SantaMaria, and performed by Ryan Price, under the company name of Flaming Theatre. WHAT'S THE PROJECT? UK charity Stonewall\u2019s 2017 School Report study found that nearly half of all LGBTQ pupils still face bullying and half regularly hear homophobic insults, with frequent experiences of low self-worth, self-harm and attempted suicide. REALLY WANT TO HURT ME gives audiences an intimate, first-hand experience of what it's like to survive these traumatic experiences through the personal history of one boy. This funny and painfully honest play is about growing up gay in Exeter in the '80s, with only the magic force field of your favourite pop songs to protect you. It's about how the rigid social rules of the real 1984 often felt closer to Orwell's version of it. It's about the all-consuming shame and fear that gay and gender-nonconforming kids battled with then \u2013 and still do now. It's about the innocent joy of loving Culture Club's \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?\" like your life depends on it. Because in a way it actually does. And it's about the pain of wanting to run away from the place that's shaped your whole life, and celebrating that lost time for all the things you couldn't appreciate about it back then. So it speaks directly to younger and older audiences alike. We started out with London performances of a 20-minute version last year, which was longlisted from 1136 entries for Heretic Voices, a national monologue writing award at the Arcola Theatre. We then managed to secure funding from Arts Council England, together with generous support from Kickstarter donors, to develop a full-length production. Our first previews at Exeter's Bike Shed Theatre were selected for their Judges' Pick of the Festival industry showcase. Our sold-out London previews at the Old Red Lion received seven 4-star reviews.\u00a0West End and Broadway director Sean Mathias saw the show there and said:\u00a0\u201cBen SantaMaria\u2019s rites of passage play REALLY WANT TO HURT ME is funny, touching and beautifully showcases the talents of the charming Ryan Price.\u201d On the strength of these reviews, we secured a booking with Assembly, one of the most prestigious Edinburgh festival venues. This is a huge opportunity for us to build on those previews and share our story more widely, with a full run at the biggest theatre festival in the world from 2-27 August. These Edinburgh dates will be a crucial next step for Ben's company Flaming Theatre, which he's relaunching for this run. We hope to tour the play across the UK after this. Ben has been selected for this year's Edinburgh Lab at Soho Theatre, to continue preparing the show for August with their guidance. Opening Doors London, the biggest UK charity for older LGBT people, has also invited us to perform the short version of our play at their summer party for 200 guests at\u00a0NBC Universal's Skyline Bar. Following on from our successful post-show discussions with Amnesty UK's LGBTI Network, LGBT History Month and School's Out UK, we will continue to organise events that reach out to the wider LGBTQ community and their allies when we tour the show later in the year. WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP? Arts Council England doesn't fund tours to Scotland, so we need to raise the money for our rehearsal room bookings, travel to Edinburgh, accommodation, venue fees, flyers, posters and also keep ourselves afloat for that month.  Ben is committed to continue paying Ryan an Equity-approved actor's fee for the Edinburgh run, so he can afford to keep performing the show so brilliantly. Ben's own wages and living expenses won't be covered by the goal we've set for this campaign. If we manage to reach our target, any amount raised above that would help him to be paid for his work as well. Either way, we won't make a profit - we're doing this for the project. So any amount you can spare would be hugely appreciated, and we promise it will only be spent on essential production costs. Thank you so much for supporting our work! You're helping to bring vital, three-dimensional stories of LGBTQ life experiences to new audiences. WHO ARE WE? Ben grew up in Exeter. He was selected for the National Theatre Studio Directors' Course and has directed a wide range of classic, devised and new plays in London and Cambridge, including JARMAN GARDEN, a critically praised multimedia production about the late artist Derek Jarman at Riverside Studios, which was a finalist for the Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust Award. Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys called it \u201ca beautifully choreographed tour through Derek\u2019s life and world.\u201d Ben assistant directed at Shakespeare's Globe and co-directed AFTER ORLANDO for Chaskis Theatre Company at Theatre Royal Stratford East and The Vaults, Waterloo.  His latest play LULLA reached the top 100 list from 1060 entries for the 2017 Verity Bargate Award at Soho Theatre.\u00a0His other plays have been staged at venues including Theatre503, Southwark Playhouse and ARC Stockton. Ryan trained at East 15 Acting School and The Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. He was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Bursary and chosen to represent the Conservatoire for the Stephen Sondheim Student Performer of the Year Award. He performed with Action to The Word in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM at Latitude Festival and on the National Theatre's River Stage. He toured Austria with Vienna's English Theatre in THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES and performed in new musical THE MASTERS OF MYSTERY at the Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury.",
  "Rights of Spring is an Yaoi webcomic. Yaoi is a genre that focuses on homosexual relationships. It is a work of fiction with gratuitous sexual situations, graphic content with fantasy elements and is not intended for minors. Way back in 2008, I got an idea for a Mature story.  It wasn't much; I just wanted a cute bee and a sexy flower to have yaoi hijinks together.  I didn't realize how it would take off and become popular with yaoi fans.  I was happy to get my story out there. It was very rough, crude even, but people enjoyed the world and the characters I created. Some even added to the growing world. The story of Rights of Spring centers on three couples: The Free Lovers- Chrys and Pio, The Fated Lovers- Ori and Lillybell, and The Forever Lovers- Nodus and Lyle.  It follows the development of their love and how it affects all around them.  There's romance, drama, comedy, and of course lots and LOTS of love making-Yaoi style! \u00a0A lot has changed in my life (drawing skills included) and I wanted to reboot the story so it flowed better.  I also wanted to change the look of it so I relaunched Rights of Spring to much success!  Because of the adult content, it was tricky to get printed copies of it made. I was lucky to have had a great friend who worked at a print shop and asked no questions! This time around my skills in layout, design, and colouring has made it possible to give my fans the best and steamiest comics around.  As well as give new fans a taste of what they might have been missing!  Yaoi fans are the best group of fans I have ever had the pleasure of being part of and that's why I'm doing this Kickstarter. Rights of Spring is my heart; it\u2019s on each page and each book and I want to share those sweet, cute and smutty pieces with you. \u00a0The goal is simple! 1,000 dollars is enough to get 50 copies of each book made and the supplies to get them shipped safely to their new homes! No sweet Hawaii vacation for me folks. Here's the skinny below! \u00a0Can't leave you hanging without some goodies! Here are the rewards for your support! Note these designs are not final. \u00a0Say What? We blow pass our goal!? Now what? Stretch Goals of course! WELL NOW I PASSED THE TWO GOALS AND NOW I ADDED THE THIRD! NOW THE GUEST ARTISTS!!

  "WHO AM I? I\u2019m Stefan (as some of you may already know), a Final Year Media Production Student at Bournemouth University, keenly interested in creating moving image and pushing my creative skills. This project represents the final unit of my degree and is an opportunity to present everything I have learned throughout the past three years. I hope the finished project will showcase my talents as a filmmaker and will be something I am hugely proud of. THE IDEA I am creating a pre-pilot comedy in the style of a mockumentary, along with three short promotional trailers.  It is centred around a young wrestling enthusiast and \u2018aspiring filmmaker\u2019 by the name of Daniel , who creates wrestling tutorials and videos for YouTube. After a few hiccups with his videos, Daniel and his best friend Stuart decide to go about creating their very own Wrestling Academy whilst an amateur documentary crew who have caught wind of their plans look to record and film their journey.  The trailers will supplement the pre-pilot and showcase each of the three main characters: Daniel, an amateur video maker and lover of wrestling; Stuart, his sidekick and BFF who comes up with the idea of a wrestling academy; Christina - the no-nonsense, level headed leader of the documentary crew.  THE BUDGET Given the nature of the project and my position as a Student, I want to make sure that my project is not held back by lack of funds and as a result I am raising money to cover production costs.  Your donation will ensure that I can create a high quality production. This will include the hiring of talent, set/costume design, transport costs and on set costs such as providing food and drink for the cast and crew. A rough breakdown of the budget is shown below: ~40% Set/Costume  ~30% Talent Hire ~15% Transport ~15% On Set If you do decide to support this project I cannot thank you enough.

  "Benevolence is a drama that guides the audience through three separate journeys taking place in different locations and periods of time. However, each of these three storylines is brought together by their characters\u2019 aim to do good, to do the right thing - even though their actions may not be perceived that way from the outside. The first story takes place in the late 1980s where a young married couple goes through the post-honeymoon stage in their lives. Work and external pressures test their marriage and force the characters to fight for what they believe is the right thing to do. The second story opens a window in the lives of a couple in their early 40s as they take a much-needed road trip through a small town near the coast of California. Set at a local campsite in 2000, the audience gets to experience what a second marriage can look like when the couple has learned from their mistakes of their first marriage and now attempts at second shot at everlasting love. When faced with difficult decisions, we find out what exactly the characters define as their \u201cgood intentions\u201d. The third and final story centers on a father and his passion and unique love for his only son. Having lived through a roller coaster of emotions, that range outside of what the average person would and should experience in a life time, the characters are inspired to live their lives by doing the right thing, by and for those intimately involved in their lives.\n",

  " Ctrl x is the perfect controller for all types of synthesizers and plugins, thanks to its workflow and to its big multi-touch screen, we can have all the values mapped as well as get access to any of them in just 2 clicks. Feature The synthesizer is a present we are going to give to all the Kickstarter sponsors who get the Ctrl x, to support us in this venture. Oscillators \nWe have a polyphonic synthesizer with 2 oscillators based on samplers through the soundfont power.\nClassic waves, samplers from our favourite synthesizers or sampled instruments can be loaded on to it.\nCtrl-x collects different types of synthesis such as FM and RM or one complete section to carry out waveshaper and other sections for synthesis by phase distortion.\nBoth sections can be mixed with our oscillator sf2 or be used as single signal.\nIt also counts on a unison engine with pitch independence to diffuse these voices through a different spectrum from the original signal.\nA sub-oscillator with classic waves and octave selection complete the oscillator. Filters\n\u00a0 Filters and more filters sum up this section. We offer you different types of filters: classic filter emulations, transistor ladders, diodes, state variables, comb\u2026 with more than 50 types of slopes. And all these come with a slight equalization and a soft distortion to give character to signal. Modulation The stuff gets serious here. The LFOs also work through soundfont; again, hundreds of waves available to modulate. Adds a slight entrance fade or uses some from the sequencers to shoot the tune and create innovative rhythms in an easy and quick way, without forgetting the available modulation envelopes. The Matrix is the en-routing brain. We\u00b4ve divided the modulation destinations into two areas: One to choose the section and another to choose the value, to avoid huge menus, the quick allocation is thus guaranteed. \u00a0Hardware\u00a0 \u00a0 \nAt Ctrl x we count on an integrated step sequencer to use either with hardware or with software. Its multi-touch screen gives us quick and intuitive edition. The encoders give us the precision for certain more sensitive aspects. Together they are the perfect team. \u00a0We consider template creation something which is always tiresome, that\u00b4s why we\u00b4ve made an effort to create them in the quickest possible way.\n\nWe\u00b4ve created a software where you\u2019ll be able to produce and personalize your own templates in a quick and simple way. To learn more about this, let\u00b4s take a look at the video. \u00a0If you like making a mess with stuff and you aren\u00b4t afraid of programming, Ctrl x is compatible with Arduino, which is why the possibilities are almost endless: Send some messages through the mackie control protocol to control your sequencer reproduction or stoppage, create your own arpeggiator or customize your machine. \u00a0Ctrl x is in its prototype phase at the moment, even if all its electronics and its programming is already in its final stage. The moulds are produced with a 3D printer, that is why the finishing touch is still really far from its final result. That is due to the fact that injection moulds have a very high cost, surpassing the \u20ac25,000. This is one of the reasons for the crowdfunding, another one is the importance of producing big quantities, as this cuts prices on components, materials and labour, allowing us to reduce the sales price.  After several years working on different prototypes related to music production, we created Ctrl Boy - a complete midi controller. Our first intention was to put it in a Kickstarter, but as we saw that there was a lot of potential in the system we had created, we decided to launch other functions such as step sequencer or synthesizer and further optimize the midi controller.",
  "Murel\u2122 is proud to bring the Murel Venom\u2122 to you!\nThese headphones are truly different from what you've come to expect from wireless headphones. The Murel\u2122 Venom offers incredible HD sounding audio from a completely wireless headphone! We've specially designed the Venom to withstand and stay securely in your ears during the most aggressive and strenuous workouts.

We are confident that the Murel Venom\u2122 are the last headphones you'll ever need! - HUGE DRIVER - \nWith a huge 8.6 mm driver, the Murel Venom\u2122 delivers incredible sounding HD audio. You can expect to experience a deep bass with defined and sharp mids and highs. The Murel Venom supports lossless CD-quality audio to ensure an uncompromising audio experience. - BLUETOOTH CHIP - \nThe Murel Venom\u2122 features a Bluetooth\u2122 chip made by Airoha\u2122 Technology\u2014a leading Taiwanese chip maker. This bluetooth\u2122 chip helps the Venom\u2122 to maintain it's incredible Bluetooth\u2122 connectivity...even during the most strenuous activities and workouts. - HOOK DESIGN - \nWe've spent extra time and care in the design and development of the Venom\u2122 ear hooks. They are made of a soft TPU which wraps around, and securely hugs your ears. The material is soft so you won't feel any fatigue or pain...even with hours of usage. \u00a0- ANTENNA - \nThe Murel Venom\u2122 is outfitted with a Patent-Pending CUx\u2122 (Copper Alloy Antenna). This antenna has an unbelievably strong signal. You can expect a consistent and interruption-free user experience while listening to your music. In addition, the Bluetooth\u2122 connection is so strong, you will be able to stay connected with a 200-feet open-air connection with Bluetooth 4.2 and an incredible 400-feet open-air connection with Bluetooth 5.0. - MICROPHONE - \nWe've equipped the Murel Venom\u2122 with dual Omni-Directional Microphones for a crisp and clear audio experience while speaking on the phone. - LARGE BATTERY - \nWe've also included a large lithium-ion battery which will accommodate up to 8.5 hours of listening between charges. Never run out of fuel while working out again! True Wireless Headphones Features Incredible Audio with: Huge 8.6 mm Driver for Deep Rich Audio\nDual Omni-Directional Microphone for Hand Free Calls\n100 mAh Lithium-ion Battery (Each Earbud)\n600 mAh lithium-ion Battery (Charging Case)\nRare-Earth Copper Alloy Antenna for Superior Connectivity\nBluetooth 4.2 & 5.0\nCompatability:   IOS and Android Smart Phone Devices\nPackaging Includes:  3 Sets of Ear Tips, Charging Case, USB Charging Cable, User Manual\n Specifications: BLUETOOTH RANGE: 400ft\nWORKING VOLTAGE: 3.4-4.2V\nLITHIUM BATTERY CAPACITY: 100MAH X 2\nCONSISTENT WORKING TIME: 8.5+ HOURS\nCHARGING TIME: 1 HRS\nFREQUENCY RANGE: 2.402-2.480GHZ\nCHANNEL SPACING: 2MHZ\nTRANSMITTED POWER: CLASS 2\nTALKING FREQUENCY: 8KHZ & 16KHZ\nMUSIC FREQUENCY: 44.1KHZ & 48KHZ\nMODULATION MODE: GFSK, (\u03c0/4)DQPSK, 8DPSK\nDRIVER DIAMETER: 8.6MM\nIMPEDANCE: 32\u03a9\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE: 16\uff5e26KHz\nMICROPHONE: 4015\nMICROPHONE SENSITIVITY: 42db\u00b13db\nMICROPHONE DIRECTION: OMNI-DIRECTIONAL  \u00a0The Murel Venom\u2122 securely and comfortably hugs your ears.

Your ears won't get fatigued liked they do with other truly wireless earbuds. - POWERFUL DESIGN - \nWe've designed the Murel Venom\u2122 to be as small as possible and still deliver an incredible HD audio experience. We strongly feel that current truly wireless headphones on the market completely miss the mark by designing their headphones with small and weak drivers--which produce weak and poor sound. In addition, many truly wireless headphones only offer 1-2 hours of listening between charges. \u00a0IN THE BOX: YOU WILL RECEIVE: THE MUREL VENOM HEADPHONES, CHARGING CASE, 3 SIZES OF SILICON EARTIPS, USB CHARGING CABLE, AND USER MANUAL.\u00a0 We've taken extra care in the design and development of the Murel Venom\u2122 charging case. The Charging case will charge your headphones up to 3 times...thereby extending your music playtime to an incredible 25.5 hours before you need to charge the case! \u00a0- PERFECT FOR EVERY ACTIVITY - \nThe Murel Venom\u2122 is the perfect headphones for almost any activity. The unique one-size-fits all hook design keeps the headphones securely in your ears while doing the most aggressive workouts, bike riding, jumping, running, etc. Feel secure and confident your headphones will stay put doing any activity! The Murel Venom\u2122 is also great for the not-so aggressive activities, like watching movies, taking calls, or just listening to music. The Murel Venom\u2122 delivers HD-quality sound while doing all of your favorite activities. \u00a0- THE BEST TECHNOLOGIES - \nThe Murel Venom\u2122 boasts a partnership with companies like Liquipel\u2122 and Comply\u2122.  Liquipel\u2122 has an incredible nano-coating treatment which protects against water and sweat. And Comply\u2122 supplies us with foam ear tips which enhance both the sound and fitment when paired with the Murel Venom\u2122. \u00a0- MUREL ZERO - \nLast year we launched and successfully delivered the Murel Zero\u2122. Our backers loved the HD-sound quality as well as the incredible strong Bluetooth\u2122 connectivity. But we realized through customer feedback that security of the fitment was lacking. \u00a0- FRANKEN-PROTOTYPE - \nSo we set out to improve upon the current design by adding a flexible hook that wraps around the ear. We took the Murel Zero\u2122 and a hook from another set of headphones and used special bonding puddy to create our first rough prototype of the Murel Venom\u2122. We personally used this custom prototype in the gym and loved the fitment! We realized we were onto something big!  \u00a0- ROUGH SKETCHES - \nFrom the hand-made sample, we developed sketches that would give a rough outline for the dimensions of the new design. \u00a0- 2D SCHEMATICS - \nFrom these rough sketches, we designed and developed in more detail the outside shell of the new design. Every angle and dimensions was added to make sure the overall form of the Murel Venom\u2122 was covered. In fact, we used giant circles to give the outside curves their form. If you look closely you'll notice that every line on the Murel Venom\u2122 is curved. This gives the overall design a very futuristic and avant-guard feel to it. \u00a0- 3D MODEL - \u00a0From the 2D design we had a 3D designer create the 3D CAD files in SolidWorks. This design only included the outside walls and did not include the inside components. Those inside details would come later once we've finalized the outside form. \u00a0- RENDERINGS FIRST ROUND - \u00a0We were a little early in doing the 3D photo-realistic renderings from these early 3D files. But we wanted to get an idea of how the final product would look. These renderings would later be modified and altered slightly by the factory in order to accommodate the design of the components on the inside. \u00a0- DFM - \"DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING\" - \nWe then started to work closer with the factory. In order to get the 3D files ready to be manufactured, the factory engineers created the DFM files \"Design for Manufacturing\". These files are the final and complete files the factory will use to create the injection molding tooling, as well as source the components which will be used during the manufacturing process. The DFM file is the last step before the manufacturing process can be started. \u00a0- MACHINE PROTOTYPE ONE - \u00a0From the DFM files the factory produced two different sets of prototypes. These are hi-fidelity prototypes which are used to test the overall design of the headphones. As you can see in this photo, we did consider embedding wire inside the ear hook in order to allow the user to custom form the hook to fit the ear. In the end we decided against this final design. Instead, we use the natural spring of the TPU material to maintain a comfortable and snug fitment around the ear. \u00a0- MACHINED PROTOTYPE TWO - \u00a0The second prototype set was identical to the first with exception to the hooks--which didn't include the internal wire. We decided this was the best design for the headphones. We added some modeling paint to see how the finished and final colors would look. \u00a0- FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE - \u00a0Our last prototype is a 100% functional prototype. It features all of the electronic components that will go into the final product. This is the unit we've been testing for sound quality and Bluetooth\u2122 distance and connectivity. We can confidently say it has exceeded our expectations. The fitment is secure and doesn't fatigue the ear. Also, The HD audio sounds incredible! And the Bluetooth\u2122 connection is hands down the best we've ever experienced. \u00a0- FINAL RENDERINGS -\u00a0\u00a0From the final DFM (Design for Manufacturing) 3D model we were able to generate hi-fidelity photo-realistic renderings to show how the final product will look once in production. We love how the white looks in this final design embodiment, However, we are open to doing other color combinations once certain milestone are met.  - FINAL ALUMINUM PROTOTYPE - \u00a0We decided that for the final prototype and the final production we would make the Venom out of machined\u00a0aluminum to give it that high-end and study look and feel.\u00a0 \u00a0- BE PART OF THE MUREL VENOM STORY - \nYou are the last step in the Murel Venom\u2122 story. We have come as far as we can without your support. With your support we can bring this awesome product to market and into your hands! let's do this! \u00a0Murel\u2122 has multiple patents pending on the Murel Venom\u2122. One of which is the CUx\u2122 (Copper Alloy Antenna) which has both an incredible extended range of connection as well as superior connection without interruptions. Secondly, we have a design patent pending for the Venom's\u2122 unique design. We feel strongly that these two patents along with the superior manufacturing capability of our factory, the Venom\u2122 will provide an experience like none other. Q. How do I choose my color?\nA.

The sound quality is on par or exceeds that of wired headphone that I have owned. And it is true that the Murel Zeros have no skipping. Thanks for a great product and hope to see more outstanding products in the future!\" \n\u2013 Richard  \"The Murel's are one of the best campaigns I've ever backed. You guys delivered in a timely manner with a great product. The bluetooth connection is smooth and the music is strong and clear. Love that they are priced for the average person\" \n\u2013 Isabel \"Personally i like sound to be represented in a spacious, lively way with the emphasize on the bass. Finally i understand that comparing wired to wireless and earbuds to headphones is not a fair comparison in soundquality but my goal is simply giving an idea of the soundquality. Songs: Editors - Honesty (44.1 khz / 16 bits mp3) Pearl Jam - Man of the Hour live (44.1 khz / 16 bits FLAC) Raging Fyah - Fight (44.1 khz / 16 bits mp3) Kim Andr\u00e9 Arnesen - Magnificat performed live (2822.4 khz DSD) While doing this comparison i found that i am even more impressed with these wireless earbuds then beforehand. The overall sound is neutral and for earbuds very spacious with good details. The quality is definitely above average. It does however all come to down to the perfect fit. In my case this means i regret not buying the extra comply tips since i am guessing this would improve the overall fit in my case. So would i recommend the Murel Zero's to others? Yes, rid yourself of wires but not from good quality and get these Zeros\"\n\u2013 Etienne \"I have been thinking of sending yall a thank you since I got my headphones. These headphones have joined my all my other tech in my gig bag for everyday life. The headphones are a true life saver whenever I just need to sit back and relax with my music. The simplicity of turning them on and getting them connected before getting out of my car makes my life quick and easy. The clarity and sound of the drivers are exceptional and I'm so glad I backed this project. keep up the great work, I'll be buying more products soon\" \n\u2013 Ricardo \"I must say that I am very happy with my murels. I have backed fireflies earbuds and murels on KS and there is no comparison which earbuds sound better and hold a longer charge. Another bonus is being able to answer incoming calls whereas with my fireflies I always had to take one earbud out to answer incoming calls.\" \n\u2013 Dan \"I had a pair of wireless sport headphones from another company that just weren't performing up to par for my needs. With only 11 reviews at the time of purchase, I took a risk on these headphones and couldn't be happier. Great headphones; I can't recommend them enough.\"\n\u2013 Tony \"I Love these headphones. Design is great, sound is loud and clean. I am confident that this company will continue to put out great products and continue their exceptional customer service.\"\n\u2013 Gary \"I have been using the Murel P01 earbuds for about a year and a half. I have loved their fit and length of charge. They will last 8 hours on a charge. I run ultramarathons and spend a lot of time running at one outing. The earbuds stay comfortable and don't fall out of my ear. I'm looking forward to my next pair, the P02's!\"\n\u2013 Mark \"These are great buds! I love mine. They fit nicely and are sweat resistant. I highly recommend these. Their customer service is excellent!\"\n\u2013 Mike \"I have to say that this company stands behind there product and will go above an beyond to make sure there customers are happy and that to me is the greatest thing about these headphones. When I was having issues they were quick to respond and provided excellent assistance. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.\"\n\u2013 Shopaholic \u00a0Murel\u2122 is proud to be a company that is born from crowdfunding. We believe that together we can make something much greater.

We have been showing our GT-R headphones at various headphone shows around the globe and have received approval from many seasoned audiophiles.\u00a0  Following are some of the comments and reviews from the revered audiophiles: We also received an official, independent measurement of the GT-R from Head-fi.org using their state-of-the-art headphone measuring system to strengthen the credibility of our claim for high sound quality. Check out the interview of co-founders Peter and Joe from the video below: The proprietary single-sided 65mm planar magnetic driver used to power the GT-R provides extremely transient and quick bass response and treble extension that far exceeds regular headphones in the market. The open-back design means that the back of the headphone housing is open. This allows the sound-stage to be ever so expansive, and its imaging to be accurate and realistic. The GT-R is designed to be comfortable for long listening sessions by utilizing the self- adjusting headband, exquisite protein leather and super-soft memory ear pads and padded headband. The ear cups rotate 180-degree to fit the contour of your head perfectly. The GT-R is beautifully constructed with the premium high-strength steel and highest quality protein leather for prolonged durability. Each part is meticulously prepared and precision- assembled with near-zero tolerance for play. The GT-R has already gone through prototype stage of development and is in its final stage of development. The fund from Kickstarter will allow us to open required tooling and secure raw material in order to kick off the production. It was for the love of music. It was the respect for all musicians of the past, present and future. It was for the struggling instrumental buried under the heavy bass line. It was for the audiophiles craving that crystal clear and mind-blowing detail. We wanted to bring the ultimate aural experience in a package that is simply affordable for everyone - because we believe that everyone deserves good sound. Our quest for the ultimate sound has just begun. We're working relentlessly with world's renowned audio engineers that have brought some of the best sound to the market as well as local and global musicians in different genres ranging from hard rock, hip-hop, EDM to jazz for that advanced sound. We are fully focused in packaging and delivering this superior audio in the most durable and the most comfortable chassis.

It's about that season in a dad's life when he feels the responsibility of fatherhood but he's still getting comfortable with the title. The first season of the strip kicks off with the birth of Wes\u2019 son, Parker, and - together with his wife, Kari - Wes must ensure that his child thrives in a warm, loving environment with plenty of food and water. Parenthood is hard! But it\u2019s also hilarious! So at least it has THAT going for it. Together, we\u2019re going to raise the funds to publish the first collection of MOLEBASHED comic strips and essays titled MOLEBASHED Season 1! The book will collect the entire first season of the comic strip (August 2015-April 2016) and feature plenty of extras, including a foreword by Michael Jantze, creator of The Norm! Not only will this be the first MOLEBASHED collection, it\u2019ll also be my first book in SIX YEARS! I\u2019m psyched! One of the nice things about self-publishing the book is that it will look exactly the way I want it to: a sturdy paperback cover with a matte finish and French folds, matte interior pages, Bluetooth\u2026 OK, it won\u2019t have Bluetooth, but it\u2019s gonna be a sharp-lookin\u2019 book! Even if you never read it, your friends will be super impressed by how cool it looks on your shelf! For you book nerds, here are the specs: Dimensions: 9\" X 9\"\u00a0Cover: 135 lb text, Matte, French Folds Interior pages: 85 lb matte text, Full Color, Full Bleed Page Count: 148  Wes Molebash is a first-time father in his mid-thirties. A big kid at heart, he wants nothing more than to be a great father and an attentive husband. Though it seems he\u2019s taken to fatherhood quite naturally, don\u2019t be fooled by his calm demeanor; he\u2019s screaming on the inside.\nSIDENOTE: The Cartoon Version of Wes is about 10% more interesting and 20% thinner than Real Life Wes. Kari Molebash is an amazing wife and mother. Not only does she work part time, but she runs the household, manages the bills, and ensures the safety of both her \u201cboys\u201d.\nSIDENOTE: The Cartoon Version of Kari is NOWHERE NEAR AS COOL as Real Life Kari. Parker Molebash is an infant. He loves to sleep, drink milk, and spit up.\nSIDENOTE: The Cartoon Version of Parker is pretty darn accurate. You want rewards? We got \u2018em! There\u2019s a whole slew of reward levels that you can scroll through on the right side of the screen. Some highlights include a copy of the book for pledging as little as $20 to the campaign, and some nice premium awards for the hardcore fans and book retailers such as original MOLEBASHED artwork, custom social media avatars, and book packs with deep discounts! So make sure to check out ALL the rewards to see which one tickles your fancy! \u201c'MOLEBASHED' features a reliable narrator because he\u2019s a real person. It\u2019s Wes. And Kari. And Parker. It\u2019s a window for Wes to shout from, but a mirror for the rest of us. We\u2019ve been there, are there or will be there: It\u2019s that simple.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Michael Jantze [from the foreword] (The Norm) \"Wes has created that strip the internet (and the world) needs right now: a funny, loving, crazy, silly, cute, adorable strip about young people making even younger people and surviving it one day at a time. If you've been there, like me, it will bring it all back, but if you haven't yet, it will make you want to be there! Oh- and it looks like Michael Jantze's and Bill Watterson's love child - how great is that?! \" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Tom Bancroft (Disney Animation Vet, Character Designer, Webcomicker, Author, Podcaster) \"I don't read many webcomics. If you know that, and you know me, you might not think that I'd regularly follow a slice-of-life webcomic about a mild-mannered, church-positive couple and their baby, but you'd be dead wrong. With MOLEBASHED, Wes has created something that he very clearly cares about, and he manages to make even the most mundane task or child-friendly observation funny. And I needn't say anything about the art; Wes' style has always been a draw, and his delicious color scheme on MOLEBASHED is icing on the art cake!\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Danielle Corsetto (Girls With Slingshots) \"MOLEBASHED is a comic I faithfully follow, and quite honestly I don't follow a whole lot. The artist, Wes Molebash, is a down-to-earth guy who keeps his strip clean, minimal, friendly and full of heart. It's just himself, his wife and baby... and a six-color color scheme. Webcomics have mostly been dominated by fanboy gamer culture and a swarm of disenfranchised misanthropes, while MOLEBASHED represents a rising revolution that returns to the beauty of everyday slices of life in the tradition of the Sunday comics we grew up with. It has my highest recommendation.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Matthew Paul Mewhorter (Cancer Owl) \"I can't think of many more occupations in life that need to be approached with a good sense of humor than being a husband and father. Wes' strip MOLEBASHED delivers all the charm and humor of raising a young family, but spares me from having to change the diapers.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Anthony Holden (freelance story and development artist) \u201c\u2026 sharp artwork, wry observations on being a parent and \u2014 to my mind \u2014 incredibly true-to-life observations about the supreme comedy of raising a human.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Lucas Wetzel (Laugh Tracks GoComics Blog) \u201c[MOLEBASHED is] a delight, warm, funny and sweet.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Richard Bruton (Forbidden Planet) The primary goal for this project is to raise $12,500.

  "Hi there and welcome to the Kickstarter campaign for My Life in Japan the comic book!\u00a0 Glad you asked! My Life in Japan: The Comic Book is the comical adventures of my life as an American girl married to a Japanese boy, living in the countryside in Japan. It's also the follow-up to the wildly successful Kickstarter for my first comic book two years ago, My Japanese Husband Thinks I'm Crazy.\u00a0 I've gotten a lot better at drawing and storytelling since then (and learned how to color my comics on the computer!) It's a comic book! My Life in Japan is a 150 page comic book in full color, filled with 29 hilarious, awkward, and true stories about me and my husband's (Ryosuke's) life in Japan.\u00a0 We're an international, married couple that lives smack in the middle of rice fields and mountains. Our town is old and doesn't have a lot of non-Japanese residents, which leads to some pretty funny incidents.\u00a0 If you've ever wondered what it would be like to live in rural Japan, this is the book for you!\u00a0 Each of the twenty nine episodes ranges from ten to fifty panels (so basically a couple of pages) and are drawn from the heart.\u00a0 This book is about me (Grace) and my husband (Ryosuke).\u00a0 Personally, I love Kickstarter because it's built to get projects off the ground that otherwise may never happen. With my first Kickstarter, I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of support and messages I got from people who wanted to see my comic book come to life.\u00a0 Kickstarter also allows me to provide the product directly to you, without a middleman, and to figure out what y'all actually want.\u00a0 I've published one comic book with Kickstarter and two without it - and the experiences have been vastly different.\u00a0 There's no comparison; Kickstarter is the way to go as an author.\u00a0 You do? That's great!\u00a0 Right now I publish my comics for free on Tapastic and the Challenge League LINE Webtoons. You can read them on either site for free :) OR A majority of the comics in this book have been published online, free for anyone to read. I also drew some exclusive ones just for this book - a little over 25%. \u00a0 So where does all the money go? Good question. Right now:\u00a0 The goal of this Kickstarter isn't to make money. The goal is to print this wonderful comic book that I'm really, really proud of and to get it into your hands.\u00a0 The profit is going to come later, from selling whatever books I have leftover on my Etsy shop.\u00a0 Yes, totally!\u00a0 I'm planning on printing about 300 extra books to sell on my Etsy shop after the Kickstarter is finished and all the rewards have been sent out. Once I've finished sending out all the books for Kickstarter, I will post an update here letting people know they can buy the leftover books on my site. \u00a0 That being said, once I sell out of leftover books online, that's it.\u00a0 The end.\u00a0I can't print any more.\u00a0 The printer that I'm using has a minimum order of 1,000 books and as much as I want to get my comic book into as many hands as I can, it's not possible to keep more than about 200 books boxed in our living room at any one time. I have a couple different \"reward levels\" depending on how much you want to spend. They are:\u00a0",
  "Please watch the video to hear me speak on this project. Over the years, I have learned how to pray. There are certain ways to do it that are successful. Successful means that your prayer is heard and there is a result. A result is always good, revealing, uplifting and enriching. So this project is to take the prayers that I know work, and share them on the web so others may do the same. There are daily prayers, Sabbath prayers (day of rest), and prayers for special occasions such as marriage, birth of a child, death in a family, prayers to change a person's destiny for the better, prayers for safe travelling, and more. It makes no difference the religious affiliation of the person praying. The web site will be set up where the user can choose the prayers he or she wants to say, and beside each prayer is a text box that they can enter their own notes and prayers to go along with the ones that are there. There is also a full blog to get other members' feedback. Each user can log in and see their own notes with the prayers each time they log in or a visitor can see the prayers already there. A user may have an important prayer to add, and after logging in, the user can choose make public or publish their note or prayer so that other users may see it and use it if they wish. Accessing and opening an account and doing all of the above is all free, with no monetary cost to the user.\u00a0 In addition the user can choose to purchase the app for their desktop and even buy a paper workbook edition signed by me. I decided to build this because: 1. I am a developer and I know how to build the web site. 2. I am a FileMaker developer and so know how to create single user versions that can be put on a desktop or an iPad . 3. I have said these prayers for many years and repeatedly have been successful in getting help when needed, and getting uplifted during my workday. I believe other users will get the same results. 4. There are certain guidelines to use when requesting from the Creator. I use these guidelines. Not everyone knows how to ask or what to ask for. So by putting this on the web, others will benefit as I have.",

  "You've just been to the doctor. You must go gluten-free, but how?  No Hassle Gluten-free cookbooks can help you make the transition in a healthy and easy way. In our low-cost cookbooks, we show people how to go gluten-free with food that is both tasty and nutritious. But we go further--we show you options to save money (gluten-free food is often very expensive) and easily create fabulous food at home. Our tips and techniques, based on our nearly 30\n years of combined experience, will easily help you through this life-changing transition!  We found that many of our customers were just not ready for an electronic cookbook (we are offering our FIVE electronic cookbooks through Amazon.com) and begged us for paper. So we reformatted them and searched for a way to introduce our product line to a wide variety of customers, and defray some of the expensive start up printing costs.  Your support would help us 'kickstart' the paper side of our business and allow us the ability to share free sample copies with medical professionals, schools, care providers, etc. These samples will demonstrate how fabulously healthy and tasty our recipes are and help us build a sales platform for our business.

  "When does a utilitarian insulated bottle become a work of art? When wrapped with a pattern of exercising demons. That\u2018s what this Kickstarter project is all about. The design is going to be produced on bottles of three colors\u2014red bottle with black demons, black bottle with white demons, and white bottle with black demons. Bottles are constructed with an insulating vacuum layer sandwiched between two layers of premium, food-grade 304 stainless steel. Miraculously, cold beverages stay cold and hot beverages stay hot, but not at the same time. Tests show up to 6 hours for hot coffee and up to 24 hours for water with ice. Mouth is more than 2\" (51mm) diameter for easy slurping. You can easily slip some ice cubes through this aperture. And you\u2019ll have space to get your scrub brush in there when you clean. Screw-on plastic top won\u2019t leak when you tip your bottle over at the gym. Flip-up sippy spout allows you to drink without removing the top. Removable, interior straw enables you to get to the dregs. All plastic parts are BPA-free. Tip: To prevent leaks when the bottle tips over, close the sippy spout. Duh. Bottle diameter is 3\" (76mm) so it will fit in most cup holders. Will probably also fit on your bicycle bottle rack. Height of the bottle with lid on is 10.5\" (25.5cm). Without the lid, the bottle stands 9.5\"H (27cm). Capacity is 24 ounces ( 700 mL). Production will be completed at Asia\u2019s top manufacturer of stainless steel insulated bottles. These folks routinely produce high-end bottles for the leading global brands. They\u2019ll use premium, food-grade materials and test each bottle to ensure the vacuum insulation works. All plastics are BPA-free.\u00a0They\u2019ll do the decoration using water transfers (decals) which proved to be the most durable in our tests. Schedule. \u00a0Assuming this project reaches the funding goal, production will go fast and we should be ready to ship by the end of October 2022. Maybe sooner. ******** You\u2019ll be amazed at all the places you can use your insulated bottle, including: \u2022 Out for a walk, run, or bike ride \u2022 In church, jury duty, or exorcism \u2022 While beekeeping, chasing Sasquatch, or spelunking \u2022 While stargazing or on a stakeout \u2022 Toiling in a job that reminds you of Hell \u2022 While couchpotatoing and more. Clean your bottle after you use it. If it held just water, a rinse and dry will do the trick. But if you were sipping coffee, tea, margaritas, or kryptonite, a wash out with mild soap is the way to go. Swish inside with a bottle brush to get any nasties. Always rinse thoroughly and dry before use. To protect the demons decoration, don't use the dishwasher or scrub the outside with harsh abrasives.\u00a0 If the interior gets nasty from neglect, you can mix half water and half white vinegar, shake, and let sit overnight. Rinse thoroughly and you'll be good to go. You\u2019ll find plenty of other recipes and exotic concoctions on line. Plastic lid and straw can go in the dishwasher on the top shelf away from the heating elements. Leave the lid off if you plan to store an un-used bottle for days or weeks. ******** Shipping. The cost of shipping will be added to your pledge based on where you live. These days, shipping costs are astonishingly high. But acquiring distinctive stainless steel bottles that could make you the envy of your friends might be something that you can justify. Just the local neighborhood. Because shipping has become so unreliable, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. I wrote a blog about the international trade mess, if you care about these things. Customs. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring your insulated bottles during their next trip. Tracking number. You will receive a tracking number when we ship, so monitor your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled (often in the last mile of their journey). Monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly. Where are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home. Fulfillment is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time. ********\nProject updates. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you\u2019ll think that I am a pest. You can also receive a trickle of news about Don\u2019s projects, sketchbook, and ridiculous blog by joining the Calamityware mailing list. Sign up for our newsletter\u00a0here. Questions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page. Leftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com.\u00a0A good place to find some unusual gifts.

  "The history of guitars is a history of innovation. Electric guitar players throughout the world have always loved to create new and unique sounds regardless of their favorite musical genre. Tim Clarke, the inventor of the Pitch Pilot, has felt that passion for his whole life. He was always intrigued by the unique string-bending sounds made possible by the \"B-Bender\", invented over 50 years ago, and the other string-benders that have come along since. But as much as Tim loved the sound of traditional bending devices, he couldn't help but wonder if maybe there was a better way. What would it take to make\u00a0a string-bender that could bend the pitch both up and down? What if you could put it on any string? What would it sound like on the G-string, or the low-E? Could you design a string-bender that wouldn't require the permanent alteration of the instrument, and could you do it affordably? With these issues in mind, Tim set out to make his own string-bending device over 6 years ago. His first prototype was cobbled together from scrap metal and the handle of an old nail clipper. As his design evolved, he began to contemplate a model that would work with a Fender or Gibson guitar. Tim started by creating a prototype for the Gibson Les Paul.\u00a0As he continued to perfect his design, his enthusiasm grew, and when he shared his device with fellow guitarists they were enthralled with its capabilities. He knew he was on to something. Creative uses followed; some wanted two for their guitars, discovering that a \"B\" and \"E\" set-up is awesome! It immediately opened up new stylistic possibilities. Motivated by the enthusiasm of his fellow guitarists, Tim started work on a production model that he could share with everyone.\u00a0His goal was to make an affordable and easily-installed product requiring no modifications to the guitar.\u00a0 Whether you play country, jazz, rock, R&B, heavy metal or anything else - Pitch Pilot will allow you to add new and unique elements to your sound. It is a revolutionary and versatile device that will be give you endless sound possibilities! Check out this review by Guitar World to see Paul Riario give a prototype of the Pitch Pilot a workout! Riario says, \"Pitch Pilot is an innovative mod that allows you to transform your guitar into a bender on any string\". Note: The handle design as shown in the video has been reworked since this video was filmed, to allow palm muting. See the changes in the gallery videos! The Pitch Pilot allows for new musical expressions, allowing guitarists to expand their sound repertoires.\u00a0After a simple installation, any string can be manipulated in pitch, bending the note up by as much as three semi-tones or down seven.\u00a0 Similar in use to a whammy bar, this low profile device stays out of the way until, using nothing more than finger or hand pressure, the guitarist bends the note up or down with a simple push or pull on the handle - on a single string. The remaining strings remain in standard tuning, opening up new ways to play. With a quick and simple alteration, guitarists can create endlessly dynamic musical sounds unlike anything previously possible. Starting at a very affordable CA $75.00 or less, the Pitch Pilot includes the device itself and everything you need to install it. - Bends notes to an exceptional degree, both up and down, offering\u00a0a range of pitch alteration unmatched by any other bending device. - Is easily installed and removed without any permanent modification to the\u00a0guitar. - Can be installed on more than one string on a single guitar, to allow independent manipulation of pitch on multiple strings.\u00a0 \u00a0 - The handle rotates out of the way for palm muting. -Does not interfere with the simultaneous use of a vibrato/whammy bar. The Pitch Pilot sound potential is not limited to B-Bending.\u00a0It can be a G-Bender or an E-Bender or any combination you wish.\u00a0So put wings on your strings! Today, a Pitch Pilot model compatible with Gibson Les Paul and Gibson-type bridges is already in production and available for sale on our website, so now it is time to produce a Pitch Pilot compatible with the Fender Telecaster and Stratocaster.\u00a0The prototype is finalized and ready for tooling and production, but we need additional funds to make that happen.\u00a0 We appreciate your support in bringing the Fender model to production!\u00a0With your help we can deliver both Gibson and Fender units - whichever your preference - by June 2018. Pitch Pilot units are manufactured in Canada, with U.S. components,\u00a0 by a high-precision machine shop.\u00a0It is well-engineered, extensively tested, and manufactured to robust standards that will provide thousands of hours of creative play. The Pitch Pilot costs considerably less than competing benders, starting at CA $75.00 for this campaign, with a reduction in price for every additional unit.

  "I started auntydaren.com to help with people who were finding it hard to make ends meet. first of all the site started on face book and got a lot of followers. I have now started a website and am hoping to start a community store that sells food with short dates at a discount price. Not only short dates but food that is donated by local businesses, the idea is to charge a price that people want to pay and to give free to people who have nothing. Its my dream that no children or familys go with out a proper meal. I will also post ways to get the most out of your shopping on my website and produce free books to help for those who have no computer.",
  "My goal is to produce an educational and insightful podcast which sheds light on the complicated nature of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. Since I contracted Lyme in early 2007, the internet has vastly increased and offers substantially more information about Lyme and its co-infections. The problem is that a great deal of this information is often contradictory and controversial.\u00a0 I want to raise funds to put together a stellar podcast with professional and personal perceptions and opinions on Lyme and its co-infections. This will include visits to research facilities like the\u00a0Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University in New York and\u00a0Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Research Center in Baltimore. At these research centers, I plan to engage in a number of interviews with professionals in the field of tick-borne and infectious diseases. Also planned is a visit to Igenex labs in Palo Alto, CA. This is a lab which specializes in running lab diagnostics on Lyme and its co-infections. Interviews with some Lyme sufferers will also be conducted to get a personal insight into this disease and its complications. I also plan to interview some of the 'moderators' from the online Lyme forums I used to follow back when I first contracted chronic Lyme.\u00a0 The funds raised will be used for straightforward purposes: filling up the gas tank on my Honda Fit for travel, taking time off of work to travel for conducting interviews, paying an assistant to help me record/edit/produce the podcast, covering basic lodging while on the road interviewing. I want listeners to come away from this podcast with a better understanding of Lyme disease and its co-infections and also an appreciation for the rapidity with which these diseases are spreading.",
  "Pawel & Ebola is a new play written by Marianna Ellenberg which will premiere at the Kitchen in February 2018. It is directed by Marianna Ellenberg in collaboration with Greg Zuccolo.\u00a0 http://thekitchen.org/event/marianna-ellenberg-pawel-ebola The Kitchen is a singular New York arts space which presents performance, experimental music, visual arts and dance in one space. The Kitchen was founded in 1971 by The Vasulkas, and has presented works by Laurie Anderson, Eric Bogosian, Robert Ashley and many other luminary artists. Pawel & Ebola follows an adult brother and sister duo - the fictional offspring of infamous 19th Century French neurologist Dr. Jean Martin Charcot - who lives in an abandoned mental clinic in New England. The sibling's world is disrupted as they come in contact with a bizarre cult named \u201cThe Method\u201d. The play focuses on Ebola\u2019s struggles with identity, religion and gender as she overcomes both her brother\u2019s dominance and her mother's abandonment while discovering her own spiritual powers. The play constructs a portrait of contemporary American gender relations, which despite the strides of the women\u2019s movement, continues to offer women limited options of subjecthood, citizenship and social status. \u00a0 This work combines live audio experimentation, and an original set by designer Jian Junn to create a world that traverses time periods, and cultures (from 19th century fin de siecle France to contemporary American blue color digital labor.\u00a0 Pawel & Ebola weaves together various discourses: mental health terminology, judaism, New Age, mysticism and millenial colloquialisms to create a world in which personal and political trauma coincide with narrative fragmentation and an absurdist humor. We produced a benefit performance with David Lewis gallery to cultivate an audience base and begin to raise funds; With my directing and production team, I have fine-tuned the script through workshops with a collective of film and stage performers, including Hannah Gross, Modesto Flako Jimenez, Tallie Medel, Tavish Miller, Erin Mullin and Rafael Sanchez.\u00a0 I have forged working relationships with a core group of performers and designers and with the addition of your support, we can take this work to the live stage. Funds raised will go to stipends for the designers, composer, performers and crew, rehearsal space, and materials for the set, costumes and props.\u00a0 Our Kickstarter Pledges will Assist in: (1) Set - Covering our design team's creative and technical work, including designing and building the set and video and lighting. (2) Costumes - Original costume design and production by Nancy Stella Soto and Hanna Tornudd. (3) Props - Designing and building props and furniture. (4) Rehearsal Studio - Reserving additional rehearsal space for the last two weeks of rehearsal. (5) Cast - Paying our incredibly talented, award winning cast. (6) Music and Sound Design - Working with award winning composer Paula Matthesun in collaboration with sound designer Anthony Dean. \u00a0 \u00a0I've been making video, photography and performance since 2005 and this is my largest scale project to date. My previous work includes the 2014 film \u201cThe Deflowering of Ariella Von,\u201d a feminist romp into nineties subculture and a teen coming of age story. Previously, I made a series of shorts critiquing mental health advertising culture and the production of the \u201cpatient/consumer\u201d. I have worked intensively with composers and electronic musicians, to produce multi-media projects since the early 2000s. Consumer advertising, feminist politics, mental health and Jewish culture each impact my work, which aims to explore various aspects of female identity and how it\u2019s influenced by social, medical and religious authorities.

  "'Standing Ovation Productions' are about to put on a one night performance of Suff'ring, fringe theatre director Helena Pickford's magnum opus, a hard-hitting tale of women's suffrage, 100 years after women over the age of 30 won the ability to vote. However, with minutes to go until the play's beginning, all hell breaks loose... With a lead actress halfway across London, a family of four trapped on set, extra-marital love affairs, Moldovan melodramatics, a drunken octogenarian and body-bags, things aren't looking up for Helena and her producer Kim...not to mention that they'll have to use the props, sounds, costume and a couple of actors from the play on before them. Oh...and the play before them was a Vietnam War epic. There's a Hollywood director and Millicent Fawcett's granddaughter in the audience, so whatever happens the play must start, even if it means their careers will end... --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Suff'ring\u00a0is a new farce from the writers at StraightUp Productions\u00a0(Mark Bittlestone, Will Dalrymple and Will Penswick). We are putting it on at the OSO Arts Centre in Barnes from January 16-20th (not the 19th). With this farce we want to as ambitious as possible to give our audience the ride of a lifetime in this riotous and ridiculous production so any donations would be appreciated immensely!

  "I decided to direct Shakespeare\u2019s fairy tale romance, The Winter's Tale, to explore the beautiful relationships between the characters in this play, and to illustrate how the world changes when powerful kings let jealousy and wrath cloud their judgment, often to the detriment of their families and kingdoms. We've been examining how the other characters come together to fix the world that the kings broke, and restore love, trust, and unity.  We've set the play in Napoleonic Sardinia, a time in history when tyrannical rulers were being overthrown and people were exploring new methods of government. During this time Charles Emmanuel IV (of the House of Savoy) and his family lived in Sardinia. He abdicated the throne after the death of his wife in 1802. His grief and inability to continue his duties reminded me of Leontes mourning his wife every day, refusing to move forward with his life or find an heir for his kingdom.  Sardinia is a beautiful land full of magic, sheep, and shepherds. We're recreating the beautiful Sardinian traditional costumes, and will be performing a dance modeled after traditional Sardinian folk dance. The Winter\u2019s Tale is a spectacular work that is often overlooked in Shakespeare\u2019s canon. Please consider donating to help us bring this powerful story of hope and reconciliation to life. And be sure to join us when we open in February!

  "Hello Everyone, My name is Daniel Frost and today I wanted to share with you my idea. I love cartoons and anime a like, but I mostly like the older cartoons of cartoonnetwork and nickelodeon such as Edd, Ed, and Eddy, Robot Boy, Camp Lazlo, etc.. As you all know those shows are no longer here. I decided with the help of loyal supporters that I would revive some of those shows in spirit. I can't really make a lot of comics about old shows due to \"issues\" that may occur, but Power Puff Girls in general may be an accept ion. I would like to first revive the old cartoon \"Power Puff Girls\" in the art form of colored-manga(Anime) and create my own story line and plot. \u00a0My new title for it is called \"Power Puff Girls Teen:Omni-Verse\". Hopefully you all can help me reach my goals or even further than that! I will be posting updates on my comic. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
  "THE BOOK Well, it's not an ancient illuminated manuscript, but it's got a lot of heart! This will be a 50 page paperback edition (8.5\"x5.5\").\u00a0Hey, cut us some slack. Even Garfield had to start small! The book will feature over 50 different cartoons from the first year of the webcomic, remastered in full detail and reformatted for the book plus\u00a0BRAND NEW, EXCLUSIVE CONTENT. \nOh, and, FYI, this book may not be historically accurate, but it is anatomically accurate and often suggests adult themes with a queer perspective, so maybe don't buy it for kids, okay?  Cool. Glad we got that out of the way. REWARDS\n Besides the book, rewards also include an exclusive tote bag available only through the campaign (and featuring an adapted version of THIS cartoon), 5x7 cartoon prints and, for the super fancy backers, a random smattering of premium rewards featuring our characters including a pillow (printed with our signature Hibernation cartoon) and cross-stitch! How gay is that? You could even choose a name for our Sabertooth Lion and Sassy Bee characters! THE CREATORS\n Why are two grown men making a cartoon? Good question. Way back in 2014, Dave was wasting time at work, scrolling through his Instagram feed and admiring all the filtered throwback cat food photos when he came across the whimsical drawings of a bearish looking fellow from Minnesota, Bill Ferenc. Suddenly, he was reminded of his awkward adolescence and the endless afternoons he spent reading his favorite cartoon books like The Far Side and Bloom County. Dave was inspired to make his own cartoon series about naked, gay Neanderthals and, after a few months of gentle harassment, Bill finally agreed to collaborate with him on The Corporeals. Since then it's been a creative partnership made in social media heaven. \nCAMPAIGN GOALS\n Our modest goal of $3,500 will allow us to print the book and cover campaign costs. In case you didn't already know, if we don't make our minimum funding goal, no money will be collected and the book will not be printed. Sad face :( However, if we surpass our initial goal, not only will you receive your rewards BEFORE Christmas, you can be assured that any extra funds will go directly to producing more cartoons as well as\u00a0convention fees, promotional expenses and, if we're really swimming in it, we'll use some of the extra scratch to finally fly Bill out to Comic Con next summer! Believe it or not, Bill and Dave have never met in person! Hey, dreams can come true, right? Plus, if we reach a stretch goal of $5,000, all backers who donated $25 or more will receive a FREE BUTTON! \u00a0WHOOP! \u00a0WHOOP!",

  "Currently I live with my roommate and best friend who's educated in the field of nutrition and health. I prefer asking him all sorts of questions about cooking, training and health.\u00a0Now it's time for me to move and therefore I can't just ask him anymore. This is why I made this project based on the most important thing he taught me, namely to taste the food, enjoy the food and never hold back to \u00a0try something new. By learning to make and appreciate good food, I have found it much easier to eat healthy and in variation. Cooking is once again a thing I can enjoy to its fullest. \u00a0 Why I need your supportAt first I designed this poster for myself, I wanted it to hang in the kitchen as a tool and to remind me about the importance of taste.\u00a0I started searching around but failed to find any designs that I liked and no international versions. Therefore I was eager make my own up-to-date interpretation and share it with you. The problem with this is that I don't have the money to cover the cost of a large first batch, which I need to bring down the pricing of the poster.\u00a0I want this to be easily accessible and affordable to anyone interested to learn more about nutrition and cooking.\u00a0I also want to share this easy guide-to with everyone and hopefully will help you as much as it has helped me. Become a part of the project by sharing the project or pledge for a poster or a magnet for yourself or as a gift for your health and food obsessed friend.\u00a0 Why you need the flavour compass and how to use it\u00a0There's nothing quite enjoyable than having a good tasty home-cooked meal. One can only tolerate that bland, dry chicken breast for only so long!\u00a0Therefore it's important to use some of the five basics flavours if not all.\u00a0With the flavour compass you'll be able to learn how the tastes go well together. An example of that could be if you have something salty, you can balance it out with something sour. Think about a tequila shot, this usually goes well with kosher salt and lemon (sour) or maybe just the cheeseburger example from the video.\u00a0 With the flavour compass you'll get great and common examples of how to combine different tasting ingredients to accentuate each other's flavour. Hopefully, this will add some inspiration to your own cooking. These are only a few examples to get you started in the right direction, there are many other endless amount combinations for you to experiment. The\u00a0compass is divided into five different sectors, with each color representing one of the five basic tastes, sweet, sour, salt, bitter and umami.\u00a0\nMoving inwards, in the outermost ring, you will find raw, unprocessed ingredient groups that are great representatives of that corresponding taste and form the base of your meal.\u00a0The next ring contains the processed foods you can find when you go out shopping, these are can be used when flavouring your food.\u00a0In the innermost ring, you can find inspiration of what you can use to garnish your dish.\u00a0In the corners, you will see how the tastes match each other, by the smaller color circles. These will describe how the flavour pairs interact with one and another.\u00a0\n The rewardsThere are different kinds of rewards, and then some choice of colour, you can see them illustrated below. The examples are not the finished prints, they are mock-up of prototypes. I will fiddle with colours and font sizes to make it look perfect for when you get it. More about that in \"risks and challenges\". \u00a0",
  "I make a lot of cupcakes. I mean, I make a LOT of cupcakes. They're not plain old vanilla and chocolate.  A lot of the flavors are based on mixed drinks, or soda, or other drinks-- and occasionally breakfast and candy. I also draw, and right now what I really want to produce is a book of cupcake recipes that I've developed over the past few years, and the ones that I have listed in my little handy book of flavors. This is where you come in. Making cupcakes can get expensive-- finding taste testers isn't hard, but finding people who will help with the expenses of making those cupcakes is. As is finding someone who is interested in publishing this book-- which is why I'm electing to self publish for now. Anyway, a round of gourmet boozy cupcakes for all. :)",

I'm a writer, director, and storyteller hailing from USC School of Cinematic Arts. My films have been accepted to The Student Academy Awards, HBO, and SAG-AFTRA Short Film Foundation.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm a Sundance Lab Fellow,\u00a0Ryan Murphy (Glee, Scream Queens) Television Half Foundation Fellow,\u00a0\u00a0Project Greenlight (Matt Damon, Ben Affleck) winner, and the writer/director of the viral short film, A Black Twitter Date.\u00a0 \u00a0 Most of you know me as\u00a0@XLNB, the homie who tells Twitter stories!\u00a0 I've done over twenty-eight Twitter stories, including The Twerkulation, The Patti Pat, Bust It Open 4 Daddy 421, Tariq The Cheat, The Barbershop Chronicles, & Big Donk Susan.\u00a0 Still, no other story I've done has gained the love, following, & viral notoriety than TINA AND THE GUCCI FLIP FLOP. TINA & THE GUCCI FLIP FLOP follows the story of my friend, Tina, who found herself trapped in a closet when her lover's lover comes home. It's a tale of betrayal, cheating, being trapped in closets, and big, wet farts.\u00a0 Tina skyrocketed me from a following of 8,000 to 25,000+ overnight. The twitter story was featured on Complex, Buzzfeed, Imgur, Reddit, Global Grind, Thought Catalog, Distractify, Clutch Magazine, and more! Now, I have a following of 57,000, and verified status, all thanks to this amazing Twitter saga.\u00a0 Now, a tale of unfaithful spouses, metaphorical closet prisons, and gucci flip flops would be enough, but we learned new, educational ideas like... \"Pooched the cooch\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lady parts feeling like apple pie.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And why it's important to lead, not follow.\u00a0 \u00a0 But, bar none, the memes incorporated into the story, ESPECIALLY, the Alfonso Ribeiro reactions took the story to the next level.\u00a0 \u00a0 The next day after I tweeted the story out, it blew up, and that was gucci flip flop history.\u00a0 Many of you have been asking me if I planned to turn my Twitter stories into film. Well, now it's happening!\u00a0 We are going to raise $35,000 to turn Tina & The Gucci Flip Flop into a LIVE ACTION SHORT FILM, for you!\u00a0 Everyone who donates to the Kickstarter, will receive a digital copy of the Tina & The Gucci Flip Flop comic, created by me, and illustrated by Celia Moscote.\u00a0 The first fifty people to donate $100 or more will receive a limited edition, physical copy of The Tina & The Gucci Flop Flop comic book.\u00a0 Nov. 27th 2016 - Everyone who donates from 3:30pm to 11:59pm on Nov 27th receives a limited edition, Tina & The Gucci Flip Flop Poster!\u00a0 TINA & THE GUCCI FLIP FLOP: THE LIVE ACTION MOVIE, will work on a budget of $30,000 for pre-production, production, post-production, and marketing. $5000 of this budget will go directly to fulfilling all Kickstarter prizes (production of physical copies), plus the 8% fee taken by Kickstarter. If we exceed our goal, 90% of our budget will be used for the film, while 10% will be set aside for production and shipping of our Kickstarter prizes, and 8% fee by Kickstarter.\u00a0 *Variables such as location availability, actor's schedules, post challenges, etc...can cause the timeline to shift.\u00a0 TBA:\u00a0Exclusive premiere of Tina & The Gucci Flip Flop on Bureau of Creative Works Six Weeks After Bureau Premiere: Tina & The Gucci Flip Flop premieres on Twitter \u00a0 I had the privilege of becoming a part of The Bureau, an audience supported filmmaking collective that has provided me and 11 other filmmakers each with a grant to produce an original, low-budget short film. \n created by Mike Ambs and Erica Hampton.\u00a0 \nTINA & THE GUCCI FLIP FLOP will have a six week exclusive premiere on The Bureau's platform, in early 2017. During that time you can get early, exclusive access to not only TINA & TINA & THE GUCCI FLIP FLOP, but their entire library of short films as well by signing up for their free trial. It costs you nothing to sign up and helps The Bureau to continue providing filmmakers with start up funding for their project. The platform is a Netflix-esque subscription model, where, after your free trial, for $4/month, you will have access to an new and original short each month as well as all previous films, BTS and lots of extras.  Six weeks after Tina's premiere on The Bureau, we will showcase the film directly on Twitter, for it's public world premiere!  In the past few years, an ongoing conversation has been happening in Hollywood in regards to \"diversity.\" For many, this discussion began with #OSCARSSOWHITE, a hashtag created by April Reign.\u00a0 According to a recent study by The Director's Guild of America, only 17% of all episodes in the last television season were directed by women, while 19% were helmed by ethnic minorities (male or female). A study by the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA\u00a0pointed out, \"at every level, in every arena, women and minorities are underrepresented in the industry.\"\u00a0 April Reign\u00a0outlined a 10-point plan for change.\u00a0 I'd like to add my own rule, for my film. This rule will be known as \"The Majority Rule.\"\u00a0 The Majority Rule is defined as - All roles during pre-production, production, and post-production, pertaining to crew, must be helmed by an overwhelming majority of woman, people of color, and/or LGBQT individuals.\u00a0 Essentially, from the Producer, all the way down to the Production Assistant, we will majority hire individuals who are underrepresented.\u00a0 This will not be an easy task, but change must start from the bottom-up, and I'm willing to begin here.\u00a0 Now, some will deem this as \"exclusionary\" or possibly, \"racist.\" It is neither. Providing opportunities and advancement for underrepresented voices and people within Hollywood, is the cure to Hollywood's lack of representation. The individuals who are excluded by \"The Majority Rule\" will never face systematic underrepresentation in Hollywood, therefore, we must focus on those who need the uplift.\u00a0 Diversity must also champion inclusion, where we build a space allowing women and minorities to feel comfortable participating. We hope to exemplify this on the set of Tina & The Gucci Flip Flop.\u00a0 We need your help and support! Let's make Tina come to life! If you love my work and want to be a part, this is how you can do it.\u00a0 To learn more about the story and director go to -\u00a0 MY RESUME FACEBOOK MY TWITTER TINA & THE GUCCI FLIP FLOP TWITTER STORY READ ALL OF MY TWITTER STORIES MY PORTFOLIO SITE IMDB SUNDANCE LAB ANNCOUNEMENT XAVIER BURGIN - WRITER/DIRECTOR Xavier Burgin attended The University of Alabama before being accepted into USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts for TV & Film Production.\u00a0 Xavier\u2019s filmography has been accepted as a semi-finalist in the 43rd Student Academy Awards, The American Black Film Festival, HBO Short Film Competition, & Raindance Film Festival.

  "Recently, the average NFL career decreased yet again... to 3.3 years. So how is it that a clearly below average player like Reno Mahe was able to play four seasons? The reason this is significant is because after 4 seasons, NFL players are vested in the league's pension plan and will continue to draw significant income. One group, however, who seems to continually draw an NFL tenure disproportionate to their skill sets are the members of the Mormon Church. A church that requests its members donate 10% of their income back into the church. A church that Reno Mahe belongs to. And a church whose membership includes the man who kept Mahe, and other Mormon Church members, in the league far past their ability would warrant: Andrew Walter Reid. Your funding will be used to aid and support the work of Stew McCoy and Nykolai Bilynsky as they delve deep into the numbers and see exactly how the numbers line up.\u00a0 The results of the investigation will be made available first via audio file.

I VALUE MY ANGEL INVESTORS & YOUR INPUT  I have worked with a great designer to put several design and formatting ideas from my initial sketches. Since the MOTIVATION PLANNER is for everyone that shares the same passion for life and their dreams and not just for me to use I would like for my angel Kickstarter investors to assist in deciding on the final daily page design template, look and feel.  As soon as the project funding is finalized I will email anyone receiving an\u00a0MOTIVATION PLANNER the final two daily planner templates and ask for your vote.\nBelow are some pics of how my initial idea for the daily planner page, developed into the draft design:  WHY DO I THINK THERE IS A NEED? \nI decided to put the MOTIVATION\u00a0PLANNER together for a couple of reasons. The first was my frustration when one day I could not find one of my books with inspirational quotes and my gratitude journal. The second reason was the requests I received from my clients in my health and wellness practice. \nI found myself having to go to separate sources and places to find things and to remember where I had written them.  At times I would misplace one of my books or journals and I could not find where it was at a time when I needed it most. Sometimes I would forget to complete my gratitude thoughts for the day because I had misplaced my gratitude journal.\nIt is also costly having to purchase each year so many journals/notebooks, a planner etc. to document all my information and thoughts. Referring to separate books and sources was also time consuming. Time I could spend doing something else such as relaxing.  Often in my health and wellness practice my clients would ask me what my daily life and organizing practices were and I found myself referring them to multiple sources to obtain information and to record the information. Some clients would get anxious and overwhelmed when they could not locate some of this Information or could not easily find it.  I wanted a one stop shop where all of this information was consolidated in one place and I could not find any product that encompassed all of this and could do all of this. \nWith this planner I can now refer them to one place with all the useful information included in there for them. It is now in one convenient place making it easier to complete and create a daily practice.  Everyone can now invest in one streamlined planner that provides all the life tools that they need making life easier. \nI want to inspire people to make decisions from a place of love and gratitude. It will help people keep focussed on their dreams and to not lose sight of them.  Also in my life I have had no family or other human support network. I searched for ways and tried many self-help tools to support me in achieving my goals. Many of the tools that worked for me to help me feel supported and to keep going in life are encompassed in the MOTIVATION PLANNER.  A THANK YOU GIFT FOR SHARING US  Share our Kickstarter campaign and you will get a FREE \u201cKICKSTARTER MOTIVATION STARTER KIT\u201d PDF file which will include:  1.

  "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PAU is a pocket-sized drum set that we can bring around with us to create music anytime and anywhere. It lets us bring our own music with us by letting us tap out whatever we want on it, whenever we want. As musicians ourselves, we understand that the urge and the inspiration to create music happens spontaneously.  PAU brings the ability to create music to anyone, so that anyone can play and create music anytime, anywhere. PAU is inspired by the Ocarina, an ancient instrument used in many different cultures, PAU is a handheld instrument with finger positions similar to the holes on an Ocarina that allow for quick finger movement to create complex rhythms such that speed of tapping is not compromised. PAU has 7 tactile buttons that are mapped to the position of drums on a drum set. Simply connect the audio cable, press the button, hear the drum beat and continue tapping away! The ergonomic curves of PAU are specially designed to fit into the palm of the hand and the symmetrically placed buttons allow for both left and right-handed usage of PAU easily. Of course, you can choose to play PAU however you wish! Every drummer has a different style of playing. We'd expect this to be no different on the PAU! \u00a0We gave PAU to a band to try out. Here's their reaction. \u00a0 PAU is an intuitive, tactile, easy-to-use\u00a0device that allows anyone to create music easily, in any situation. PAU is so easy to use, anyone can use it! Audio jack, 7 buttons Just plug into the audio jack and press the buttons to start creating music! There is no learning curve to using PAU, and start tapping away whenever you have PAU with you! PAU is compact enough to fit into our pockets, or into our palms, so that we can tap away whenever we want and stick it into our pockets whenever we need our hands for other things. PAU features a standard 3.5mm audio jack. Plug in earphones, speakers or even into a mixer. PAU is perfect for jamming in privacy.\n\nPerfect your beats in privacy, and wow your friends when you are ready!\u00a0 As musicians, we understand how fun it is to jam together. Simply plug PAU into a speaker of a mixer, and experience the joy of making music together. Why look at the buttons when you can feel it? Just like a real instrument, the keys on PAU are made of tactile buttons that allow you to feel where they are so you can continue tapping away, eyes-free. When our friend / colleague / family member cracks a bad joke. For the past few months, we have been prototyping and developing PAU to create the most user friendly version of it, and combing the electronics market to source out reliable suppliers.  We believe in creating a high quality product that is user-friendly, intuitive and functional, yet at the same time, aesthetically pleasing. We experimented with different shapes, sizes, button mechanism and finishing before coming to the final prototype.\u00a0 The final prototype consists of an inner and an outer shell, providing structural support for continued pressing while maintaining the sensitivity and touch of the buttons. - ~3\" by 4.5'' (~7.5 by 11 cm) - 7 Tactile Push Buttons\u00a0 - 3.5mm Audio Jack Output - Arduino enabled \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 'HEY, stop playing, you'll disturb the neighbours'\u00a0-Mum 'Oh no' D: - Me Sounds familiar? As musicians, this phrase is often something we hear from people around us (especially our parents). As non-musicians, this is also often the reason why we do not get to learn music.\u00a0 Most instruments currently available are large and bulky, and create much sound (music/noise) when played. This makes it hard for musicians to carry around their instruments and to play whenever they feel like it so as to not disturb other people. As we also lead busy lives constantly on the go, the opportunities to make music decrease as we are unable to carry our instruments around, so we end up just listening to music instead. At Bethm, we believe that there is another way to bring music to people. Right now, we have created a pocket-sized instrument that can be played silently on the go.\n\nBy reducing the size of instruments, increasing tactile sensitivity and allowing for greater customization and recording, we hope to bring music creation to a larger group of people so that they can experience the joys of making music together.\n\n\u00a0 PAU is merely the first amongst our range products. Through this campaign, we hope to gain valuable feedback that will help us continue on improving our products. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

  "We would also love to send a quick thanks to all our dear media friends and fans for the generous sharing of their experience and feedback over social networks and Youtube! Some MERKUR Watches We've Made: \u300aA Truly Great Automatic GMT for under $300! Merkur GMT Pilot Review\u300b\u00a0 by Just the Watch \u300aMechanical Chronographs under $250?! - Merkur Pierre Paulin VS RedStar \"Seagull 1963 Panda\"\u300b by Just the Watch \u300aA Prime Panda! Merkur / Pierre Paulin Panda Review\u300b\u00a0 by Relative time Philip, MERKUR's founder and lead designer, has been a military fan from childhood. He\u2019s been so obsessed with a gang of little buddies in junior school sharing and discussing military gear and aircrafts. As times passed by, the little boys grew up, leaving their hometown for different colleges and universities, and moved onto very different paths. They\u2019re not that close anymore and only contacted once a while at summer breaks. After university graduation, Philip carried on the passion in aircrafts and aviation and started his career with a famous European airline. It was until quite recently that Philip realized his best buddy has also carried on that same passion and becomes a pilot; their paths crossed again, chatting about old days and picking up the old hobby on military aircrafts. Now that Philip is quitting his 9-to-5 job and starting his venture as \u00a0watch manufacturer, their conversations now have a new addition: pilot watches. In memory of this great childhood friendship, they decide to co-design a watch series paying tribute to the fascination upon pilots and aircrafts and their watches. It was not a hard decision for them to come up with the design language and theme; neither did they have any technical difficulties (Philip happened to be very familiar with mechanical chronograph movement, and the ST19 movement can offer the best size and manual winding texture when applying the chronograph function). But instead... One key consideration on top of both Philip and his friend\u2019s mind, is that they want something of their own; the design has to incorporate some unique features onto the classic themes, not just making another replica of the well known models. After many late nights of brainstorming and sampling, today Merkur brand is thrilled to be introducing the \"Big Eye\" Military Chronograph series, coming in two very funky colorways. From Design to Prototype\uff1a There's many more later watches built to pay tribute to the famous pilot watches but they either directly copy the \"Mark XI\" or the \"Big Eye\" features, while we spent much time and effort in figuring out the perfect match and give-or-takes. The first look at the MERKUR \"Big Eye\" Chronograph series, it highlights the standard formula of military watches. When it comes to case design, obsession in vintage was admittedly the driving force behind the decision. Our watch would be a lovely addition to your personal charm, not a burden. Aligned with many chronographs of the 1940s and not like modern bulky chronographs, the sleek 38mm size and 18mm lug size design are absolutely comfortable to wear on a daily basis; the thickness of 13.6mm would truly make a difference on your wrist. And we offer 40mm case too for you to have a better choice about this sport chronograph style. In history, the military preferred acrylic because it would flex under pressure and not shatter in the cockpit of an aircraft. To maintain originality and our watch's 'warmth', its vintage feel and the slight, bespoke domed acrylic crystal was chosen by us. The pleasing distortions it makes when the watch is viewed at certain angles is just awesome. Rest assured, Acrylic will scratch but it is easily polished with a compound such as Polywatch or even toothpaste. Also,We Provide A watch case with 120clicks rotating bezel and Sapphire GLass. We are super pumped upon our final draft and to add more fun into our offering, we will offer two different combinations and colorways. Both will be available for you to choose from and back for! Only For KICKSTARTER Black/Green Combination\u00a0 We are developing a Gradient Green dial Especially for KS. this is our Brand new Desgin ..with Stronger cream luminous . \u00a0 Classy series with retro Black/ Cream combination A serious military colorway, the simple and neat Black/ Cream combination is low profile at first glance, but results in much more open space on the dial and feeling less cluttered. You should be comfortable to wear it and proudly talk about it across gatherings with die-hard military or pilot watch fans. Urban series with Light Grey/ Red hand combination A more casual and daily colorway thanks to the light grey dial; contrasted with the very sharp white subdial and red chronograph hand. We built this for everyday use, it's so chilled and young that you might even want to wear it to a date with your beloved ones. Beyond the history story, we're essentially renovating a vintage inspired watch for modern use, and shall serve as grab-and-go piece for whatever look you're on today. Every detail, texture, fonts and finishing of our products has been meticulously thought through to make sure it sends tribute to some greater watch designs yet has a unique MERKUR aesthetic language. We've been working recklessly between our design team and the production team upon every design and product details. Transparent Case Back for Sapphire Case The Mechanical hand-winding ST-1901 Movement has an incredibly rich history; even though it's more commonly known as a Chinese representative in the chronograph movement, it is indeed a blue blood swiss innovation with proper transfer of licensing and intellectual property. In the 1960s and to compete against other major movement manufacturer (the Longines, Valjoux, Minerva, Lemania and Landeron's), Venus decided to partner with the young China government; shared their design and drawing of Venus 175 to help build the first chronograph for Chinese Air Force; and expect the supply chain in China can scale quickly and bring prosperity to the very mature yet easy to maintain design. We all know the latter story, China has become world factory and can produce ST19 movement with great quality after careful adjustment, and exceptionally affordable,making it an ideal choice for this project. As we scale quickly we have never given up on standard and quality control. On the contrary, we decided to form a special quality unit- the MERKUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT (MTS) to review all product quality along the production and before dispatching to our end customer. Specifically on mechanical chronographs, we commit the right position of all chronograph hands. Please check your MERKUR products at arrival and both hands would be in exactly the right spot after first time re-positioning- that's our commitment to worldwide fans of MERKUR. We offer standard two sets of strap: French leather. They're of impeccable design quality but carefully considered to match the watch design. Our strap manufacturer already work for renowned watch brands and their skills greatly enhance our watches. Straps for Acrylic Case\uff1a18MM Straps for Sapphire Case\uff1a20MM We like to think that the MERKUR quality comes across in our packaging as well. They will be made out of high quality wooden cases to reduce use of plastic material; with a delicate bronze plate that would age and add in more robust and mechanic texture . Kickstarter campaigns make ideas into reality. It\u2019s where brands and designers can meet up and share their visions for unique lifestyles and value proposition with the watchfam communities that will come together to fund them.

Founder, Owner & Lead designer: Philip Li Philip has been the guru of China watchmaking. At university Philip started part-time trading mechanical watches and through which he's able to learn about the market and production; more importantly, to see how China factories are producing best quality parts for Swiss brands meanwhile stuck with copycat in their own brands and designs. After his graduation and six years working on a 9-to-5 job, he still found great passion in watchmaking and \"Design in China\"; he decided to quit his well-paid job at famous int'l airline and found Merkur. Philip knows exactly how difficult it is to be an independent watch company but he has great confidence in China's very mature supply chain and its aesthetic and design capabilities. Philip draws all stretches, prototypes and blueprints by himself over AI/ CAD, and places very strict control on quality assurance and mechanical specification to make sure his 'Design in China\" plan can be well executed.",
  "Hi everyone, we're Avni Patel & Philip James McGoldrick. We're bringing to you Mariage Blanc, a play by Polish playwright, Tadeausz Rozewicz, - but it's our REIMAGINED version. Coming to the UK stage for the first time, this play is Directed by Philip and Produced by Avni. With essential help from our core team: Perfumers Sarah McCartney and Harry Sherwood,\u00a0set designer Solrun Osk,\u00a0costume designer Bronya Arciszewska and extremely talented performing cast - we are all about collaboration.\u00a0 The important bit We need your help to raise, \u00a32750 to kick start\u00a0this unique project into action.\u00a0 Why is it unique? Below we explain, the incredible\u00a0story, why we're doing it at all, why your support is so important, and our ambitious vision.\u00a0 --- In a 19th Century household, Bianca has been raised as a boy and is now suddenly to be married off upon her coming of age. Facing the torment of burgeoning womanhood and the sexual expectations of marriage, Bianca becomes increasingly consumed by surreal phallic visions while clinging onto the remnants of childhood.\u00a0 It's safe to say, we're inspired by the bravery and willingness to challenge taboo. It explores themes of gender identity, sexuality and the challenges of womanhood against a backdrop of male dominance and patriarchal tradition. We believe these are not only poignant contemporary issues, but this play can contribute to these current conversations by further exploring the complex effect these pressures can have\u00a0on women at any stage of life.\u00a0 We strongly believe this play stands in its own right as an important piece of literature, a timeless piece which can tell the story of overcoming adversity through tenderness and humour. Importantly, it also shows a positive representation of women in literature.\u00a0 We have an amazing idea, to bring this play to life in truly unique and interesting way - and we want you to be part of it. Your donations will form the basis of our collaboration.  There are 3 main reasons: We want to create a visceral Theatre experience involving smells, to bring\u00a0this\u00a0humorous yet dark play to life in an\u00a0intriguing and innovative way. 1. CAST As you know we really want to pay our cast fairly. These two women are a part of a larger cast. They are all incredibly talented and we hope to give them the opportunity\u00a0to flourish\u00a0in these complex and intriguing roles with your help.\u00a0 --- Our main character Bianca will be played by one of Hero Talent Group's biggest stars Mollie Lambert.\u00a0\u00a0 When asked about the importance of the play, Mollie replied: \"At a time when people are listening to each other a lot more...more people feel like they can have a voice [to express their sexuality and gender].\" \u00a0 Helen Baranova will play the supporting role of Pauline. She has performed in numerous plays including a 5 star production of 'Voices From Chernobyl'.\u00a0 When asked what themes speak to her personally? Helen answered:\u00a0 \"Women are sexual beings and I... agree with it ... It\u2019s good to see [that explored] especially from a male writer, that\u2019s unusual.\" 2. PRODUCTION DESIGN The production designer Solrun Osk Jonsdottir, a National Film & Television school (NFTS) graduate is working hard at creating the perfect mood for this piece. Working with new textures, light and fabric in a challenging space, you can see Sol's ideas are ambitious - help us breath life into them! \u00a0 \u00a0 3. COSTUME DESIGN Our costumes will be designed by talented designer Bronya Arcziszewska, who's Polish heritage connects her to the play. Perfectly capturing timelessness, with your help, we can source and make these wonderful designs. Bronya's vision is to start by designing the base layers of underwear.  And for the buttoned openings of the nightdress to show glimpses of the base layer. 4. SMELLS DESIGN Mariage Blanc will be staged for the first time ever as a sensory experience.\u00a0 Key information about our smell design: Benefiting\u00a0from the knowledge and experience of the crazily talented perfumers Harry Sherwood and Sarah McCartney, from 4160Tuesdays perfume, scents like Semen, halitosis, violets and custard, are already in the making! 5. ABOUT THE DIRECTOR Born in 1987 in Warsaw, Philip James McGoldrick is a British citizen and National Film & Television school (NFTS) graduate. In 2009 he finished his Master's degree in Audiovisual Arts at the RITCS film academy in Brussels.

  "This September, Concrete Temple was awarded a matching grant from individual donor, Todd Wiener. When he so generously donated, he wrote: \u201crefer to me as a longtime admirer of your artistic vision who made this matching gift to encourage others to lend their support.\u201d We are of course humbled and honored by Todd\u2019s support and generosity. \n\nThe funds raised by you, and Todd\u2019s gift, will be used for the development of PACKRAT, our new puppet play and its developmental workshop presentation. Every dollar that you give will be matched by Todd! And, there are a lot of puppets to make!  The puppets will be diverse in style: modified Bunraku, rod, hand and large parade-style, fully articulated puppets.  We will also make use of projections and video and anticipate working with 5 puppeteers. \n\nOur fundraising goal for this phase of development is $3000, to be matched by Todd to give us $6000! The funds will be used to make Phase I of the project happen, from developing, building, and performing the puppets to paying puppeteers, composer and technical staff.\u00a0 Summer 2016, Concrete Temple Theatre was in-residence with Montello Foundation, in the Sagebrush Desert of Montello, NV. The Foundation is \u201cdedicated to supporting artists who foster our understanding of nature, its fragility and our need to protect it.\u201d  This experience has inspired us to create a work that is focused on: what is preserved, saved, collected, and what is ignored, discarded, forgotten; a piece that is an investigation of what happens when a being thinks themselves separate from their environment and how the adaptability of nature can be used as an example of what needs to be done when faced with adversity. We have chosen a packrat as our main character, as packrats are natural collectors. Our hope is to present the first full workshop production of PACKRAT fall 2018 in Flint, MI. (It will take us a year to create the first full version of the piece.)\u00a0 Our goal is to work within communities, developing and presenting new work, while encouraging others to create, so after Flint, we will then visit other neighborhoods and people with PACKRAT!\u00a0 Most recently, we have worked in Laurinburg, NC (June 2017) and Flint, MI (Sept-Dec 2016) and in South Korea (January 2017):\u00a0Gwangju Cultural Center (Art House), Baekseok University, Cheonan City, and in JeJu, South Korea: working with disabled puppeteers at Jeju Special Self-governing Province Rehabilitation Center, inmates at the Jeju Juvenile Corrections Facility, and elementary students at the Global English Center.\u00a0 Working within different communities across the country and world, connecting people and giving them an opportunity to participate in theatre is not only a joy but vital work. \u00a0As Katherine Young, Teacher at Mott Middle College, Co-Artistic Director Fly-Town Puppet Theatre, Flint, MI wrote: \"Our kids tend to not get a lot of opportunities for exposure to other people, places, and things and those experiences are absolutely crucial for their cognitive, social and emotional development and for them to gain a sense of possibility and build a vision of their own future, which unfortunately so many of our students lack.\" \u00a0",
  "My webcomic, SPQR Blues, has been collected into little minicomics, but it's never had a nice, perfect-bound, collected version with a fancy cover. I'd like to put one together for the comic's Tenth Anniversary! What I'm looking for:\u00a0the cost of a modest print run. Basically, I don't have the means to print any number of copies. What you'll get: a copy! Extra art and goodies and stuff! Plus the gratitude of the Emperor and free sausage rolls at Petronia Vitalis's tavern, should you ever find yourself in Rome 1,940 years ago. Could happen! Could have happened already! Time travel is confusing. Plus: OK, now you know everything. Sort of. SPQR Blues is set in ancient Rome in the years leading up to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. I (aka Klio) began the webcomic ten years ago as part of relearning to draw after recovering from repetitive stress and nerve injury. Ordinary guys need epics too: Rather than the more typical Roman epic about gladiators and orgies and imperial assassinations (not that there's anything wrong with that), it\u2019s about the lives of ordinary people in the city of Herculaneum, Pompeii's less famous neighbour--though there are the occasional murders, mysteries, banquets, and battles. Many of the characters are based on people who really lived in the town. Our hero Marcus Antonius Felix, the self-described descendent of a slave of the much more famous Marcus Antonius, arrives jobless, homeless, and missing his clothing, but carrying a lot of secrets. The first job he gets (after putting on some clothes) is as bodyguard for a wealthy teenage girl in danger, Petronia Iusta. Subsequently: intrigue, murders, flashbacks, goddesses, star-crossed lovers, ursine intervention, more misplacement of clothing, heroic accountants, gambling, slave-dealing, swords, sandals, earthquakes, seven emperors, and a jug of wine. You can see the comic online. There are some mature themes, and the art and language in the printed version will be unexpurgated. It's not extremely racy, but it's written for adult readers. What the funding will cover: PDF edition, bookmarks, art prints, posters, saucy portraits, original sketches, random sketches based on words in my big box o' Latin flashcards, custom-made Roman-style wood-&-wax note tablets (very nifty! I'll post pics!), and absolute(ish) imperial power! I've tried to offer a lot of possibilities so you'll get something fun for supporting the print run. Some of the art prints will be created only for Kickstarter and not be made available anywhere else.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it is insanely expensive to ship overseas. You'll be asked to add $15 for shipping to destinations outside the US and Canada. See the latest updates! November 2005: If you have any questions, just ask, and thank you for your support!",

I am from a very small town where there isn't a lot of support for artists. Releasing this next project would mean the world to me and my fans.

  "In the midst of a 7 year journey to fulfill my dream - just when I got to the tip of my iceberg...I was laid off in January 2014. For seven months, I rode the most stressful roller coaster ride of my life, music was my only escape. My determination to complete this album was the only thing keeping me from running away and joining the circus.  This album has so much significance in my life because it tells the story of this struggle, not only during my unemployment, but all of the struggles I endured personally and professionally, in the last couple of years. Music became my therapy. Postponing the album was not an option for me. I never gave up.\n\u00a0 And so, I turn to you, my friends, family, peers, colleagues, supporters, music lovers. With your help today, I can continue to make this dream a reality, even after my setback. The donated funds will go directly towards: Digital Distribution I appreciate and thank those of you who can support. Any contribution can make a difference. And the best part? Even if the goal is reached, you're still able to donate, as there's no cap! And if I'm blessed with going over budget, that will only help me further promote this album and beyond.

  "Who doesn't love champagne!! It's used to celebrate weddings, birthdays, the holidays, you name it. I've fallen in love with it and think that more people need to be aware of it's cullinary pairing potential. It's not just for your average mimosa Sunday brunch. You can structure a holiday party around it and I'll show you what foods will pair well in order to knock your friends and guests socks off. It's similar to wine pairing, however champagne is unique in that the bubbles can add or subtract from the food. But don't fret I'll guide you to the perfect pairing that you can claim all your own in front of your friends and family.\u00a0 I've secured the bubblyandbites.com website and will be able to showcase the cookbook and development timeline once the project gets off the ground.

  "We know: it's rare to hear the words soft, chewy, gooey, and awesome to describe gluten-free baking. \u00a0Gluten-free baking seems to have its own unique and often sad vocabulary of words - brick, sawdust, dry, disappointing, and frustrating. This is why we are publishing our cookbook. We want to bring happiness back to eating in spite of gluten and other food sensitivities, and that might just start with an incredibly tasty, messy, and - yes, gooey - gluten-free, dairy-free cinnamon bun. All of our recipes have been developed by Four Spoons Gluten-Free Bakery co-founder Nicole and enjoyed by lots of people from all over the world. Many of them have come back for seconds, emailed to thank us, or told their friends.\u00a0 Here is a quote from one of our bakery customers, Owen (self-described as the carrot-cake guy). \u00a0 Over the course of a couple of years, it became an integral\u00a0part of my Saturday routine... racing to the Farmers' Market after breakfast\u00a0for my breakfast \"dessert\"... a piece of Four Spoons' scrumptious carrot cake. With a thick coating of delicious frosting and a secret ingredient -\u00a0I have long suspected pineapple but we'll see when the recipe comes out - it was always a pleasure, not to mention a pleasure to chat with Matt for a couple of minutes between customers. Thank you for the amazing and healthy baked goods as well as the good company, and all the best for your future (and very interesting) projects. - Owen\u00a0 \u00a0It's one thing to read about a recipe and try to create it; it's another to be able to watch someone else make it and then do it yourself.\u00a0We know that the learning curve is steep when it comes to baking gluten-free. We want to make it as easy as possible for you.\u00a0This is why we will be producing a 20 episode baking series on our YouTube Channel in conjunction with our book. You'll be able to follow Nicole step-by-step through each recipe, from start to finish.\u00a0 \u00a0Here is an example of a video series we created for our mini cookbook, Flaky: Gorgeous Gluten and Dairy-Free Pies.\u00a0 Check out this tasty teaser trailer for our gorgeous gluten-free cinnamon buns. \u00a0These are the best gluten and dairy-free cinnamon buns ever. \u00a0 Our cookbook\u00a0Soft, Chewy, Gooey, Awesome \u00a0will be filled with beautiful photographs and be professionally designed.

  "For the first two seasons we reached the Kickstarter\u2019s goal and then Samuel retreated to his cave for months and months to make the show. Which is all well and good but, what were you supposed to do in the long mathless months waiting for episodes to start? Especially as we all knew that once they did show up all the mathematical stories were going to be gone less than two months. That is why this year Relatively Prime goes monthly. That\u2019s right, 12 new episodes of Relatively Prime for your mathematical enjoyment, and the first episode will come out March 31st, just one month after the final episode of Season two. So not only no waiting around this time, but you can be assured of great mathematical content on the last Thursday of the next 12 months when you back this Kickstarter. And each of those 12 episodes will feature wonderful mathematical stories. Stories like: The schedule is not the only change Samuel has planned for season 3 either. He is also excited to be working with some new collaborators, like Anna Haensch and Annie Rorem from The Other Half to help bring a greater diversity of voices and stories to the show. Relatively Prime is a small show with huge ambitions, and Season 3 is by far the most ambitious so far. Please help us tell these wonderful mathematical stories. Sample Episodes: Season 1 \u00a0Season 2 The Rewards: If you want more than just the warm feeling of knowing that you helped create more awesome mathematical content for the world to consume you are in luck because with your support comes the chance to get one, or many, of these rewards. Funders List Your name on the Season 3 Funders List at http://relprime.com RelPrime Extra Exclusive access to at least one full length interview per episode and other bits which do not make it into the show Pin Show your allegiance to the greatest mathematics podcast in the world with this great pin Let everyone know just what you use your notebook for with this Kickstarter only RelPrime notebook Postcard Samuel will send you a postcard in one of the places where he goes to get an interview. Credit Read Your voice will feature in one of the episodes reading credits for the show. Voice Over Samuel will record up to 30 minutes of audio for you. Do you have a short story that you want recorded, need 30 new outgoing voicemail messages, or maybe you just want to hear Samuel read names from the phone book. This is your chance. (The content is subject to basic decency standards and Samuel reserves the right to not record content he finds distasteful) Ad/Personal Messages Be it one episode, half the series, or every episode you can have your own 30 second message on the show. This will let you reach an audience of some of the smartest, coolest, and most beautiful listeners in the world, and if you happen to make calculators, protractors, or compasses this would be the most receptive audience you could hope to target. (Once again basic decency rules apply here) Interview Samuel will call you up and interview you. He will then burn that interview onto a CD, draw some album art on it, and send it to you. Signed Script Samuel will send you one page of the scribbled on, annotated, and actually used scripts that he will use to produce the episodes. Custom Story Samuel will produce a story for you on a topic of your own choosing. Samuel will work with you to make sure that the topic is one that is feasible to cover, and just like the ads or voiceover basic decency rules are in effect, but other than that feel free to make Samuel create a story on whatever you desire. Extra Episode Exactly what it sounds like, except beyond just making sure that everyone gets yet more awesome Relatively Prime to listen to Samuel will work with you to develop the theme for the episode, determine the best people to interview, and make production decision like music choice and story ordering. Your Own Samuel Samuel will travel to where you are and give a talk at your institution about mathematical storytelling or he will do your yard work or he will produce a live Relatively Prime in your living room or he will cook you and your family dinner. Really he will do pretty much any legal work that you would have him do for the day*. (Please add $850 if you are not in the USA) *This is not really limited to a single day. If you support at this level Samuel would be more than happy to teach a week long workshop on producing math and science media for your University. The only catch is for stays longer than one day housing of some sort(including couches or floors on which to crash) would need to the provided. How your money will be spent: If the goal is met the money will be used to cover the expenses of creating a 12 episode series. These expense include equipment, travel, hosting, freelance fees, research materials, Samuel\u2019s salary, and extra white board markers. Bonus Goals: If more than 750 people back the new series one of the wonderful people behind the video above, Rob Schultz, will do an animated mathematics story. If we raise double the goal a video version of one of the episodes will be created. Credit for the video goes to the wonderful Rob Schultz, Lewis Sequeira, and Natalie Hazen.",
  "The main purpose of this project is to start-up my company, Orchard Audio LLC, and to launch its first product - CRISPIN. CRISPIN is a high performance stereo audio amplifier, which features low-feedback, low-impedance true-balanced output, high bandwidth and most importantly, sound quality.  The result is a better-sounding amplifier at a fraction of the cost of its competitors.  To realize CRISPIN\u2019s highest potential, Orchard Audio partnered with Digital Amplifier Company (www.CherryAmp.com) to utilize their Maraschino Module using Cherry Amplifier Technology\u00ae.  As the first company to bring the Maraschino technology to the market, CRISPIN further sets itself apart from the crowd as a future-proof, forward-thinking and sonically optimized contender. In a world of module based amplifiers, the Maraschino Module using Cherry Amplifier Technology\u00ae sets CRISPIN apart as a future-proof, forward-thinking, sonically optimized contender.  Other module based amplifiers on the market use tremendous amounts of negative feedback to correct for output error.  The result is ringing and high-frequency hash much like the mega-feedback Class-AB amps of the 1980s. CRISPIN offers amazing bench measurements without massive feedback or phase compensation networks. The Maraschino difference is simply better sonics. The harshness associated with other Class-D amps has been eliminated. Digital Amplifier Company is extremely selective of their partners and their amplification technology is well respected and known in the industry. With this product you can get access to Cherry Amplifier Technology\u00ae\u00a0at a reduced cost. The Audio Beatnik had the following to say after previewing CRISPIN: \"There is a top-to-bottom balance that makes the amp addicting.\" and \"Well, this unit must have been implemented very well; it had a very open, clear, transparent, and alive sound.\"\u00a0See the full article here. The funds from this project will be used to make the first production units of CRISPIN, as well as to purchase some lab and testing equipment to continue growing the business and come out with more cool products. \u00a0 \u00a0",

It is sad that I can't find a suitable container for my tools after long time searching in the internet, all the stuffs I can find are either ugly or too simple.

Last month, I visited a TCM museum, there I find out my fellow acupuncturists hundred years ago using handmade needles bags as following: In the old days, the needles are made of sliver or gold, they are expensive and precious, doctors use them, sterilize and use again.therefore, they do not need the bag to have several layers to hold the needles. Time changes, nowadays acupuncture needles made of stainless steel comes with very low price, and in order to avoid infection, doctors have to use one-off needles for each treatment. I think it for a long time, finally inspired by the scroll, I design this item. Scroll design is simple, but I make it with 3 storage space inside: I can't wait to share the sample: (need to spent time and money to ask factory to make it for me) Finally, for every supporter of you, we can offer free laser logo service on the bag, check following samples:",
  "Star Power follows the adventures of Danica Maris, young astronomer chosen by an ancient cosmic force to be the last of the Star Powered Sentinels. It is a tale of adventure, heroics, and space. Because space is awesome. Star Power and the Search for Black Hole Bill is the second volume of the series, collecting issues 6-10. After Danica's showdown with the dread Countess Nurak-nor at the end of Star Power and the 9th Wormhole, the Star Power was critically damaged and it seemed Danica's powers were lost for good. Now Danica embarks on a dangerous journey in a desperate attempt to reignite the Star Power. Meanwhile the notorious space cowboy Black Hole Bill escapes Galactic Defense custody. Dangerous people intersect in a remote corner of the Millennium Federation and Danica will be faced with a choice that will change her life forever. \u00a0So what are we backing here? We're here to bring Danica's second adventure to print! The book will match Volume 1 and be a gorgeous 144 page book, complete with fancy spotgloss cover. Last time we came to Kickstarter to fund a book printing, we made an amazing book. We plan to do no less this time. We're ALSO doing the limited edition hardback version right out of the gate. So we're asking for a bit more than last time, to ensure we maintain the quality product our readers expect and deserve. Our rewards primarily focus around the comic itself, which we are making available in a variety of ways for a variety of readers! However, we are also making some special rewards available for our backers, things you can only get when you support our book via Kickstarter. Michael's wife, Alyssa, has come down with a debilitating case of craftitis and as part of her treatment plan has agreed to make a limited number of Star Power felt dolls! STAR POWER DOLL NOW AVAILABLE AS ADD-ON! Alyssa has graciously agreed to open up the number of dolls she can craft, so that backers can add $5 to their pledge tiers and receive the doll as an add-on. Her case of craftitis must be far more advanced than previously thought! Once again, Michael and Garth will be doing custom illustrations for a limited number of generous backers. Please note: commissions are delivered as high resolution digital files. Please also note that these are SINGLE character commissions, and both Michael and Garth reserve the right to reject any specific commission request. Three of our most generous backers will have the opportunity to make an appearance in Volume 3 of Star Power: Star Power and the Mystery of the Zel Gux Dynasty. While we can work your appearance into the comic as a human, the world of Star Power is full of strange alien life and so, as an alternative, backers will be able to help design one of the alien races found within the Millennium Federation. We're using Backer-Kit this time around, so lots of things can be tacked on to your pledge. Just total up what you want and add that amount to your pledge. We'll sort out the details during the survey process at the end of the campaign. Kickstarter Exclusive 11x17\" Print -$15 \u00a08x10\" Covers -$10ea \u00a0Extra Copies of Volume 2 -$25 If one copy just won't do it, you can always add on to your pledge for each additional copy you want. If you need more copies of Volume 1, we suggest visiting our store and straight up buying them. Scale Star Power Statue If we meet our 4th and final stretch goal during this campaign, in addition to the book print run, we'll be having a run of scale figurines of Star Power sculpted. These statues will be available as an add-on. We're still in talks with the manufacturer, so pricing and size are not yet set. Michael Terracciano and Garth Graham have been creating comics for over 20 years combined. Michael, the writer for Star Power, is probably best known for his fantasy webcomic Dominic Deegan: Oracle for Hire. Garth Graham, the artist, cut his teeth on the webcomics Comedity and Finder's Keepers. They've been friends for years, and both share a love of science fiction and a sadness at the state of affairs of modern superhero comic books. Not being the kind of people to bitch and moan when they could actually do something about it, they set to the task of making the super-hero comic they wanted to see. One with space, and punching lasers, and female characters who were people first.",
  "Furry. Loveable. Beer-and-stale-air-scented. Meet Bar Dog, canine denizen of Buz's, a neighborhood bar. Thanks to readers like you, this Kickstarter raised the funds to create the Bar Dog website, where you can read episodes of Bar Dog, submit story suggestions and vote on what happens next.  Bar Dog was inspired by a few different things\u2014my own goofy dog Asta, the years I spent working as a bartender and an old, rather jaded looking dog I saw lounging in an armchair in a neighborhood bar. I thought there was something really funny about the canine perspective of the human experience, and I loved the idea of a story that goes back and forth between the above-the-table human world and the under-the-table canine world. As I was finishing the first episode and deciding what would happen next, I thought\u2014what if I put Bar Dog online and let readers decide? So the idea of a \"crowd-plotted canine comic\" was born. Here's how it works: This will be a really fun (and funny) way for readers to be involved in creating an ongoing story. So I'm raising funds to pay a designer and web developer to create a\u00a0Bar Dog website, where people can read Bar Dog, submit story ideas, vote on what happens next and discover mouthwatering cocktail and dog biscuit recipes. (More about the website below the rewards.)\u00a0 There will also be a lot of great rewards, ranging from Kickstarter-exclusive comic books to t-shirts, posters and original art.\u00a0 Here are some pictures of the rewards. How will the Kickstarter funds be used? Most of the funds are going towards hiring a developer and designer to create the Bar Dog website. I'm hiring a professional team to create the site, not \"my cousin who makes cool websites.\" This is because the website needs to not only be well designed, but have great functionality. On my end, I need to be able to easily log on and upload new episodes, read through audience story suggestions and put my favorite suggestions up for the crowd's final vote. I am very right-brained, so it's important that I have a simple, hassle-free user experience on my end that doesn't involve me entering a bunch of code or doing anything too technical. The Bar Dog audience also needs to have a seamless and easy user experience. They need to be able to easily read a Bar Dog episode, which will be followed by an entry form where they can enter a suggestion about what happens next and submit it. When it's time to vote they need to be able to easily enter their information or log on to vote. In order to create a website that functions this well is a job that requires professionals who are on their game. I approached two different companies and received estimates of around $5000. I am upping that to $6500 to cover contingencies such as the site taking longer or being more difficult than expected and for updates or changes that need to be made in the first few months after the Bar Dog site goes live. The remainder of the $10,000 I am asking for will be going toward the printing and shipping of the Kickstarter rewards as well as Kickstarter fees and processing fees. And now, for your reading pleasure, here are the first 12 pages of Bar Dog. Each page is a photo of the original 11 x 17\" art with some tools I used to create the art. I hope you enjoy it.\u00a0 Bar Dog Episode 1:\u00a0 Thank you so much for your support! Answers to some frequently asked questions are below. Questions: 1.\u00a0Is Bar Dog a choosable adventure story? No, Bar Dog is determined by majority vote. Readers will vote on three storyline suggestions, and the one that receives the most votes will determine the next part of the story. 2. Why is Bar Dog green?\u00a0I was doing lots of messy green\u00a0and black drawings when I originally drew\u00a0Bar Dog,\u00a0so I decided to keep that look, since it creates an interesting nighttime feel and lends a grungy dive-bar texture to the story.\u00a0Here's an old notebook page of one of my first\u00a0Bar Dog sketches (warning: graphic puking visual):\u00a0 3. Do you talk to your dog? If so, what are some of the topics you discuss?\u00a0Yes, I do talk to my dog. It's usually about going for a walk or having dinner or a treat. Sometimes I talk to my dog about other topics, such as the presidential debates or red carpet fashions, but those topics are generally greeted with a blank stare.",

The benefits of this book are healthier dining choices, simple and easy steps to create a meal everyone can enjoy, confidence boosters and educational awareness for those who feel as lost as I did. The funds raised will used to research the highest quality most nutritious ingredients by way of nutritionists, dietitians, holistic practitioners and group studies. I will also need to have high quality beautiful photography, publishing and distribution.\u00a0 This book is something that was placed on my heart and I want to help others who struggle with autoimmunity as well as those who want to have overall cleaner living. Thank you in advance for your support!!! Sincerely, Arkeisha Cox",
  "Alice, Bella, Sarah and Lucy are four new mums. They were all told what to expect from new motherhood, but no one really tells you the truth. The fantasy vs reality. As our story progresses we see the struggles and triumphs of being a new mum and how post-natal mental health is an under supported trek, not only for those going through it, but also those watching loved ones face it. The play follows these four women's individual experiences and how their intertwining lives lead them to realise they are not alone. The money raised by this Kickstarter will be used to help fund the Research and Development (R+D) period for 'The Edinburgh Test'. This will include a week of R+D rehearsals and a regional tour around the UK, sharing the production with a range of communities to gain feedback from mothers and audience members, ensuring our production is as authentic and relatable as possible. The \u00a32,200 raised will be put towards the hire of rehearsal space during the rehearsal week, the travel, venue hire and accommodation\u00a0costs during the tour and the payment of our artists. Any donations to help get this show on its feet would be hugely appreciated, and check out the rewards that are up for grabs with your donation! Thank you in advance for your generosity.

  "My name is Cecily. I am a R&B singer and currently reside outside of Houston, Texas. I am in the process of creating an album. I am currently in the studio and enjoying the creative process of song-writing, as well. My objective is to finish my album, which will be entitled, What could have been, as well as create an onsite MTV music video in LA by a February 2015 deadline. Currently, I am utilizing multiple promotion tactics to increase current sales on my single, \"Butterfly.\" In the music business, time is of the essence and I need some financial help with my current music project. Although it is highly ambitious to be a musician in this competitive market, I believe that it can be accomplished with community support. Dream the impossible.",
  "First let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a young woman who grew up on a Canadian military base, and was constantly surrounded by the army and it's lifestyle. When I was old enough to understand, I found out that my great-grandparents had served in World War 2, and to a military brat those people who served in war are heroes.  Throughout the years as I grew older I found out that my two Great-Grandfathers had served over seas for the Canadian military. One had been in Holland hiding from the Nazi army, and the other had been wounded by shrapnel in a town in the Netherlands.  Now that you know the background story of how I came to be interested in the military, let me tell you what I plan to do. First, I will be finding as much as I can from my family to get as much information about where each of my grandfathers were stationed while they across the lake. From there I will make a list of all of the major Canadian battle sites, the places my grandparents were and major Nazi Concentration camps. My plan is to visit all of these places and document the feelings and history that I experience in these places. If possible I will be able to compare photos from my family with ones I will take myself.  I will have been the 4th generation since my grandparent's to have visited those spots, and I would like to write a memoir while I do it so that others my age can learn about the history of these places in today's culture and how they came to be what they are. And of course, the KZ camps are important to visit because they are the reason that the Second World War was fought and why my Grandfathers were sent to Europe.  Please help me explore my family and countries history and allow me to write my memoir and share my adventure with the world. ",
  "Hey everybody! Thanks for checking out my kickstarter page. What I'm trying to accomplish is to purchase some basic audio equipment for our Fantasy Football league podcast, the QC Connection Fantasy Football Podcast. During the football season I will do a weekly recap of the QC Connection Fantasy Football League, as well as news and notes throughout the offseason pertaining to the league and its competitors. The equipment purchased will help improve sound quality for the listener as well as open up opportunities for Skype interviews online, which is one of the new additions I have planned for next season, interviews with each league member throughout the season. If this is up your alley let's make it happen! Thanks for reading and \"Play fair, and have fun!\"",
  "Back in the summer of 2015 I was introduced to the world of web radio. With a start on a show called Double Take Radio, I soon became a regular on the show. Right before the summer ended I started my own show called The Jason Echolls Podcast. With a panel of friends, we talk about the week's events on Saturday and during the week day we will do subject based show's.We take callers during the show and let them be a part of the show. It's both fun and informative the show's that I do. But to do the 4 hour shows that I'm currently doing is costing money. So I'm reaching out to the people for funding for the podcast to keep the great content on the air. The money will be used to cover month fees charged by BlogTalkRadio (the podcast's show sponsor).",
  "It emulates classic and modern tube amps with true analog sound circuitry in order to avoid the monotony of digital amp modeling.\u00a0Use it anywhere with all the convenience possible \u2013 standalone or controlled with your smartphone. The poets One has four channels, each representing a different gain stage with its own unique voice. It offers you a very bold soundscape with a variety of distinctive amp tones, seamlessly transitioning from blues to classic rock or hard rock to metal. Bubbly sparkling crunch sounds are possible as well as a dark and punchy high-gain\u00a0pandemonium. Plug into the poets One, and playing the first notes you'll notice the amazingly tight\u00a0bottom-end and the crisp treble. Harmonically rich and detailed chords go along with\u00a0resonating single notes, even when cranking up the gain further. Let's give you an idea of what the channels sounds like: Texas Twang: A shimmering bright and very dynamic sound with sparkling distortion on top, inspired by the tweed amps of the early sixties. Great for Jazz, Country and Blues. British Classic: This channel nails the sound of amps like Marshall\u2019s Plexi and Super Lead. It offers a crunchy, growling distortion which is adjustable in a wide range with your guitar\u2019s volume. A perfect match for any kind of rock, blues and punk. British Modern: A \u201cHigh Gainer\u201d with creamy compression that invites you to explore all the varieties of metal sounds \u2013 from eighties Heavy Metal to brutally dark. U.S. High Gain: In the tradition of Californian high gain amps, this channel offers you an ultra fast attack, a vivid reaction and virtually unlimited gain reserves. Suitable for any kind of clear and powerful lead sounds, it is adjustable for a wide range of musical styles. Controlling the preamp can be easily done with just two buttons: A true bypass switch for enabling or disabling the unit and up to six presets that can be selected by pushing a momentary switch. The pedal\u2019s state and the active preset are visualized by six LEDs. You can use your smartphone to modify existing sound presets or create new ones. The poets One app provides the following functions: channel selection, preset selection, storing and retrieving the presets. Additionally, the sound of a preset can be adjusted by controls for Boost (Texas Twang only), Gain, Volume, Treble, Bass and Mid (amp voicing). For power supply, use a 9V battery or a supply unit with 9V \u2013 12V and (-) polarity on the inside (\u201cBOSS standard\u201d). The power consumption will be about 55mA max. Two LEDs allow monitoring of the supply voltage \u2013 green: voltage is okay, red: change battery by time. Bluetooth is supplied by a certified Microchip Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module. For switching the wireless connection on or off, you need to press and hold the select button for more than 3 seconds. The BLE status is visualized by a blue LED. In October 2015 we started looking for a small, affordable guitar preamp with several channels and a dynamic sound that comes as close as possible to high quality tube amps. And it should have smartphone based real-time operability and all the convenience that comes with it. But we found nothing to fit the bill. It seemed that there was merely the choice between an analogue stomp box with only one good sound configurable via potentiometers or a digital modelling device with intuitive setup but poor sound. So what constitutes a \u201cconvenient device with a perfect guitar sound\u201d? How can all the advantages of analogue and digital worlds can be combined? That was the point at which we decided to create the \u201cpoets One\u201d. Here are the main features we put on our wish list: We started with the development of the analogue audio section of the circuit. Because our device should be battery powered we decided to use semiconductors instead of valves to emulate tube sound as close as possible. Another point is that the settings-adjustment circuitry should be digital to allow smartphone based control. In addition, digital control components can\u2019t withstand the high voltage common to tube circuits. It was a stony road. We tested hundreds of diodes, op amps, capacitors and other components which would be responsible for a perfect sound and added several weeks of LTspice simulation.\nThe goal was to emulate tube distortion without compromising dynamic response and to avoid the noisy and jarring sound typical when using semiconductors for signal clipping. Another major challenge was the tone stack design. In particular the mid filter should be able to manipulate the preamp\u2019s voicing range from \u201cclassic tweed\u201d to \u201cmodern metal\u201d. We achieved this by designing a filter where the amplitude, centre frequency and Q-ratio can be adjusted with just one control. Upon completion of the sound stages the first prototype had been created \u2013 albeit a breadboard design with mechanical switches and potentiometers. The next challenge would be to develop a digital control that doesn\u2019t affect the audio quality. Checking out a lot of digital switches and potentiometers, it turned out that only a few components on the market would be suitable for our purposes. We envisaged that the link between control circuit and smartphone would be an Arduino equipped with a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module. But we soon realised that the open source Arduino software is not efficient enough for our needs. Additionally the Bluetooth module had a big issue with latency. So we developed a completely new control unit, coded our own operational system for the underlying Atmel microcontroller and chose a professional Bluetooth module with the possibility to implement a private BLE stack. While we where at it, we also decided to create a complete new housing. Almost every FX pedal uses Hammond aluminium cases. But using Bluetooth inside a metal case isn\u2019t ideal and it also seemed a good idea to have a modern design with a direct view into the inner PCB and several LEDs. Eventually we designed a 3D-printed housing with a massive transparent cover out of hardened plexiglass XT. Having a functional breadboard design is one thing \u2013 creating a professional mixed signal SMD unit on a multilayer PCB another. Parallel to the programming of an attractive iOS app with intuitive handling we had to suffer disappointment on our first PCB. Due to the high gain of the audio circuit and the pulses on the digital part of the power supply caused by the BLE module we had several EMC issues. Furthermore, numerous SMD film capacitors downgraded the audio quality and therefore we had to take a step back and replace them with through hole parts. At that time we began to work with professional German manufacturing companies in order to ensure the best manufacturing quality possible for PCB and SMD soldering. During the entire development process our guiding principle was to make no compromises in respect of sound. After nearly one year of work, two PCB redesigns, a new ground concept, a special power supply circuit and different revisions of the case we finally had a fully functional \u201cgolden master\u201d.\nAnd after half a year of testing the poets One on stage, in the studio and practice rooms with professional guitarists we are proud to present it to you on Kickstarter: The poets One. Hey there, this is Mathias and Alex Poets from Hanover, Germany. Mathias is an electronic engineer and experienced in building, servicing and repairing tube amps. Alex studies computer science at the university, he is proficient in app development and embedded programming.\u00a0We just wanted to know if it\u2019s possible to create a true analog guitar preamp with tube-sounding distortion and a smartphone based control, which we started developing nearly 2 years ago: the poets One. For further information on us check out our bio. :-) The development process involved many of our (musician) friends who always were\u00a0on hand with help and advice. Without them we wouldn't have come as far as proudly presenting the poets One here on Kickstarter. Please join our little community and help us by backing this project. Due to the expensive high-end audio components and the SMD assembly it's not possible to manufacture small quantities of the poets One at acceptable costs. Depending on the funding level, we will have to\u00a0acquire either\u00a03D-printers or injection molds needed for the manufacturing of the housings. If you are ready to accompany us, please support our campaign and spread the word! Become a backer and help us bringing the poets One into the world.",
  "Everyone has a fairy tale dream, every bedtime story brings memorable childhood, warm, sweet and full of love. Thus, three art-major dads established Howcat Studio, studied children's favorite fairy tales and their loved board games, combined with the most popular education model, created three unique fairy tale houses. Make those fairy tales come true. Each fairy tale house has about one hundred wooden pieces. Each colored piece can be perfectly assembled together. Numerous details, detachable items bring the entire model to life. Come with light, let the finished fairy tale house has a fantasy color. For children: With the help of their parents, they will love the feeling of pressing the parts down one by one with their tiny hands. For teenagers: It is a fun STEAM Toy to train their patience. The process of finding parts, pressing them out, and assembling them together improves the ability of observation and logical thinking. For grown ups: Believe me, the 3-hour immersive building experience will leave you wanting for more. Is it over when the fairy tale house is built? of course not. You also own a board game.\u00a0 Rolling dice, flipping cards, answering questions, and being the first one to reach the destination. Let everyone enjoy this family and friend time. The rules are simple, 2-4 players, move their character on the board by rolling dice, and whoever reaches the finish first wins. There are two kinds of special colored grids on the board. If the player walks there, they must draw cards from the corresponding color.\u00a0 \u00a0According to the instructions on each card, complete the task and receive corresponding rewards or punishments according to the result. If we can reach our goal, we will solicit card content from our backers, so that every backer who wants to participate has the opportunity to join us in the creation of the fairy tale house. It's not just a craft, but a piece of art work.\u00a0 The actual fairy tale house is more eye-catching than the photo. With led lights, which let it become the most dreamy night lights at night. In the evening room, with the moonlight outside the window, the shadow hits the wall, just like a gorgeous fairy tale world. A perfect gift for any occasion for your lovely children. All three fairy tale themes are available for the reward.\u00a0 STEAM is Arts Integration with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. It\u2019s an approach to teaching and learning in which STEM education principles are taught through the arts. \u00a0\u201c [STEAM is] a great learning tool and can serve as an on-ramp to STEM for underrepresented students. Engaging students\u2019 strengths using art activities increases motivation and the probability of STEM success. [Art is] a way of offering more diverse learning opportunities and greater access to STEM for all types of learners. \u201d \u2014Ruth Catchen Acquiring knowledge should be a happy experience, like a good harvest. Share and get some great ideas. We got tons of inspiration from Kickstarter's cool campaigns, which helped us a lot when creating the Fairy Tale House. We hope to improve our design through more interaction with the backer.",
  "This is our second \"6mm/8mm-scale\" STL-Campaign. This time it's all about space skeletons called \"CRONZ\". All sculpts are designed for the small scale, pre-supported and test-printed for the most enjoyable printing experience.\u00a0 The STL-pack contains warriors, elite warriors, horrors, heavy weapons and a Lord. The STLs come unsupported, single pre-supported and in a number of five on a strip (also pre-supported). Like the \"Plague Warrior\"-campaign - if this campaign is successful there are some Stretch Goals to unlock. The first one: \u00a0Two types of CRONZ Destroyers. A normal one on the right and a heavy one on the left. Next one - a fast and sneaky RoboSnake Stretch Goal 3: A big MechaSpider on a base (the spider is spitting MechaBugs). The base and the spider are two different parts so you can easily decide to assemble the spider on your own bases. Next: A floating Pyramid that give fire support. Also a two-part model with its own base. Stretch Goal 5: A floating PortalPyramid! Useful to give fire-support and for teleporting CRONZ to the Battlefield. Comes also as a two-part-model (Pyramid+base). Stretch Goal 6: Ancient Artillery for heavy fire-support. Added to the running campaign because of a supporter voting - two CRONZ Gods! Finally you can get the STLs from the successful \"Plague Warrior\" campaign for privat use (Add-On option).\u00a0 All Miniatures ran through several test-prints to optimize the design. These prints were made on an Elegoo Mars 2 pro with the following settings: Two different resins were used for the prints: \"Elegoo Standard Photopolymer grey\" and \"Wanhao Waterwashable clear\". Terms of use: Ankylo Miniatures owns all images, files, logos and documents from this campaign. If you are purchasing\u00a0the \"CRONZ INFANTERIE\"-Pledge you are purchasing a license to print the files for non-commercial use only. You may not sell, share \u00a0or distribute any of the digital files. You may modify the files for personal use only and not create any derivative works that are used in any commercial manner.

  "We were sittin\u2019 around the ol\u2019 ranch the other day and realized, by gum, it\u2019s been three years since we\u2019ve released a Least I Could Do collection! We also realized it\u2019s really weird when we talk like grizzled prospectors, but the book thing was the main realization. \n\n So what to do about this? Well, we want to get caught up as fast as possible, and with Least I Could Do entering it\u2019s unprecedented 13th year, we thought we\u2019d take a swing at releasing three volumes of Least I Could Do all at once!\n\n That means 3x the strips, 3x the laughs, 3x the commentary, and unfortunately, 3x the cost. \n\n Which brings us to today! Being big fans of Kickstarter (over 70 projects backed!) we know that this is a fun way to get you, the dedicated and beloved reader, involved in the process, offer up some cool, limited edition rewards and help us get three years of Least I Could Do on your shelf as fast as humanly possible! \n\n Least I Could Do is a webcomic that\u2019s been running since the days of dialup and cell phones that just barely made calls. Created by playboy and man of intrigue Ryan Sohmer and was joined in it\u2019s third year by full-time juice-specialist and artist Lar deSouza. \n\n Least I Could Do (or LICD for those cool enough to abbreviate things) follows Rayne Summers, a man who chooses to live life \u201cconsequence free.\u201d You know that little voice in your head that warns you that Christmas dinner is not the time to bring up your Uncle\u2019s casual racism? Rayne doesn\u2019t have that voice and would end up spelling out his concerns with his peas.\u00a0 \n\nRayne\u2019s friends have been with him from the start and have grown over the years to embrace family, careers and relationships. Others\u2026 well, OK, mainly Rayne, have chose to continue partying like it\u2019s 2007. In LICD volumes 10, 11 & 12, much of this growth (and regression) is explored with the most hilarious of results. \n\n Least I Could Do is a comic strip, but it\u2019s also a window into a unique world. It celebrates the joys of growing up, while never once letting it go too far.  It encourages opinion and discussion, all the while winking at you regarding Duck Tales. \n",
  "UPDATE (7/27/15): I've made the first chapter from Multiplex: The Revenge (Chapter 11) FREE for anyone, not just backers \u2014 to give you a taste of what the book will be like. Reward packs which include the Book Three eBook set will now also include the first chapter of Book FOUR (Chapter 16). If we can reach the following milestones, I will watch and draw comics of the Multiplex 10's resident film snob Jason reviewing selected works of his arch-nemesis, Michael Bay. (One strip per movie!) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Multiplex\u00a0is an online comic about the staff of a movie theater. It has been running for ten years \u2014 since July 10, 2005. I've previously run, funded and fulfilled two Kickstarter projects, for the print collections\u00a0Multiplex: Enjoy Your Show and Multiplex: There and Back Again. And now, the Multiplex gang is back, hoping to raise funds to produce a third collection\u2026\u00a0Multiplex: The Revenge! Multiplex: The Revenge will contain Chapters 11\u201315 of the series (strips #217\u2013338, which ran from March 2008 to March 2009). In this volume, Jason and Angie get serious, the Multiplex 10 and Flickhead crews battle it out on the silver screen (sort of), and Gretchen has her long overdue comeuppance. All of the Multiplex books strive to be new-reader friendly, so if you haven't read either of the first two books (or haven't read them in a long time), there will be a six-page \"The Story So Far\" comic to get you up to speed. And even if you've read all the comics online, there will be about 35 pages of all-new material to flesh out all the dramedy. That's over four months worth of comics! All the new material means there's finally room to answer one of the questions I get asked most at conventions \u2014 \"Whatever happened to Brian?\"\u00a0Brian (and his accomplice) will turn up in a few bonus strips spread throughout the book expanding on their existing appearances, and culminating in an all-new arc at the end of the book set on opening night of Zack Snyder's Watchmen! Rather than working on the new material for the book sporadically in my \"free time\" (ha!) between freelance design or illustration work, with your help, I can get the book in your hands next year. I know I would rather be working on Multiplex, and I know Multiplex fans would prefer that, too! I hope I can count on your support to help me continue the Multiplex book series. I'm Gordon McAlpin, the writer and illustrator of Multiplex. I've previously run \u2014 and fulfilled \u2014 two Kickstarter projects, for the first two print collections. Multiplex: Enjoy Your Show\u00a0(Book One) was enthusiastically reviewed by the Chicago Tribune, Fandomania, Weekly Comic Book Review, Comics Waiting Room and a host of other comics sites and publications. Multiplex: There and Back Again\u00a0(Book Two) won the Gold medal for Graphic Novel/Drawn Book\u2013Humor/Cartoon in the 2014 Independent Publisher Book Awards. PDF eBooks!\u00a0Multiplex is illustrated with vector shapes using Adobe Illustrator. The PDF eBooks preserve the art as vectors, making them the best possible reproduction and a really fun way to read the strip, especially on a tablet. The eBooks will be made available to backers as they are completed. Chapters 1\u201311 are already finished\u00a0and will be made available to backers with them in their reward packs as soon as the project is successfully funded! Mini-posters! The set of three 11\"x17\" mini-posters included in several of the rewards packs will feature the movie poster parody artwork from the T-shirts for the last two Kickstarter projects \u2014 plus one brand new design parodying a movie poster suggested by you, the Kickstarter backers. Brokeback Multiplex? The Multiplex Strikes Back? It's up to you! (Posters will be folded in half for shipment.) UPDATE: I totally forgot about another older parody poster I did, so let's make that FOUR instead: Bookmarks! Bookmarks included with the Basic Sponsor Pack (and up) will look similar to this. The \"frames\" will pull from throughout the Multiplex series, however, not just Book One: Sketches! Original character sketches included with Premium Sponsor Pack will look something like this, though not all sketches will be toned with Copics; I like to figure something out that feels appropriate to each sketch: Be an extra in Book Three! With the Extra pack (as well as the Strip Pack and the Dinner and a Movie Pack), you will appear in one of the bonus comics for Book Three. You may or may not have a line of dialogue (they haven't been written yet; it's kind of the luck of the draw), but you will get a digital image of you as you appear in the strip suitable for use as a social media avatar. Movie Review Comics! With the Movie Snob Pack (and up), you can select a movie \u2014 any (non-pornographic) movie \u2014 for me to write and draw a review comic strip featuring either Jason and/or Kurt, whomever qyou prefer (if you have a preference). Here's an example from the Book Two Kickstarter project: NOTE: To keep shipping costs down, all physical rewards will be shipped at the same time, in as few shipments as possible, when Book Three is ready to ship \u2014 approximately September 2016. The funding goal \u2014 the\u00a0amount needed to create and ship the books and all the rewards \u2014 is $24,000. The largest expense, of course, is the print run. Due to increases in both labor and material costs (probably inflation, too), the printing quotes I\u2019ve seen have been at least 30% higher than for Book Two (despite identical specs and projected quantities), and so the funding goal needs to be higher to account for that and the increased fees and income taxes. I'd also like to use BackerKit (or a similar service), which introduces an additional expense but should greatly simplify the fulfillment and pre-order process for non-backers \u2014 as well as give you the ability to upgrade your rewards package even after the funding period has ended. All the numbers below are approximate, but this breakdown gives you some idea of where the funding will go: This budget is meant to give me a little wiggle room, because at $6,000 for roughly six months of work, I\u2019m only making about minimum wage for the time I\u2019ll be working on the book and will not be able to absorb any overages as I did with Book One. (This factors in $600/month from\u00a0my ongoing Patreon project, which covers the ongoing expenses for the webcomic during that same timeframe.) Kickstarter funds will be used solely for book-related expenses.\u00a0If there are any funds remaining once the project is completely fulfilled, I will continue to push forward with the bonus material for the collected editions \u2014 and include the eBooks of any chapters produced to backers with the Book Three eBooks (Chapters 11\u201315). As with the Kickstarter projects for Books One and Two, this project doesn\u2019t only fund the print run for the books, but also the production of the new material in the book. I'm hoping to have the books and all rewards in backers' hands in September 2016. I think this is a fairly conservative estimate. If we go over the goal, every penny pledged will go toward the production of future Multiplex collections. For every additional $2,000, I\u2019ll be able to continue working on bonus strips for the collected editions and laying out the print book \u2014 reducing the production costs needed for a future Book Four Kickstarter Project. Chapters 16\u201320 comprise Book Four, which was conceived as the conclusion to \u201cAct One\u201d of Multiplex\u2019s planned nine book run. $26,000: CHAPTER 17 EBOOK \u2014 I'll also produce the bonus comics for Chapter 17 AND add the finished eBook to all reward packs that include the Book Three eBooks. $38,000: CHAPTERS 18\u201320 EBOOKS \u2014 I'll produce the bonus comics for Chapters 18\u201320 AND add the finished eBook to all reward packs that include the Book Three eBooks. (Chapters 18\u201320 don\u2019t have as much new material in them as 16 or 17.)

  "The Earth Cultures Cookbook is truly a labor of love! It chronicles the efforts of WORKS, Women Organizing Resources, Knowledge and Services and the Earth Cultures Initiative's five year journey nourishing individuals and families of modest means in Los Angeles.  It will contain compelling stories of people transformed by this work, food equity advocates and farmers.  It is a proven formula, a blueprint for others who want to create healthy communities. The truth is that many people have very little access to fresh, healthy whole food, and little education about how to prepare healthy food. So we decided to do something about it and create an opportunity to have organic pop up produce markets in the middle of food desserts so instead of teens buying Dorritos and snow cones they now can snack on apples and bananas. We\u2019ve offered nutrition information classes that inspire healthy culinary creations in the kitchen so moms learn how to magically add nourishing ingredients like kale and eggplant to fun dishes like mac and cheese. We\u2019ve taught community members how to engage local politicians effectively to create change through letters and initiatives that help their communities lose excess weight and get healthy.

  "I am a senior Art major at Bridgewater College in Bridgewater, Virginia; working on my senior Art Thesis project. This project will consist of a gallery opening and show in December 2013, consisting of original paintings. I paint animals in an unrealistic manner working with acrylics, brushes, and pallet knives to bring life and texture to my work. I feel that it is important to take time to notice nature's beauty in a society that can't slow down to enjoy nature around them because of deadlines, busy schedules, and time clocks. Because of this, I bring the city lights and flash of our society's colors to my paintings of animals in hopes of catching the viewer's eye, and causing them to stop and truly look at the beauty of the animals in the world around us. The funding provided will be used for supplies including canvas, artistic and professional acrylic paints, brushes, pallet knives, and frames. I paint with passion and emotion in the hopes of bringing the viewer joy, and helping them reconnect with nature in this fast paced life.  This project is about LIFE!  Slow down and look around you! You will see the beauty of God's gifts to us all around you. I challenge you the next time you are driving on a back road, walking down the street, or just sitting on your porch, to LOOK AROUND! You will see some amazing things when you slow down and enjoy the beauty of nature and life around you. ",
  "Welcome to my first kickstarter for my new series of enamel pins; Choose your weapons!! This is a project i've been working on for a couple of months now and includes original designs of typical and non typical RPG weapons as well as a few sneaky extra weapons commonly found within games and anime.\u00a0 Hi! I'm Lauren, the creator, artist, designer and sole founder of LRNPage. I'm mostly known for apparel these days but I have created several pins this past year and I always enjoy creating more and already have several new ones in the works.\u00a0 I am the one solely responsible for picking, checking, managing and posting all orders for LRNPage and I always strive to offer the best product possible :) I'm super excited about this weapons series and I hope you are too!\u00a0 Designs are unlocked with more pledges. Please pledge for the designs you want, and if it doesn't unlock you can always reduce or cancel your pledge.\u00a0If all designs are unlocked more stretch goals will be added. Unless stated otherwise all pins are hard enamel and gold or silver plated according to the depicted artwork.\u00a0 Once pins arrive to me, I will grade them accordingly, checking for flaws and ship out backers pins according to what they have ordered. This may take several days to complete so please be patient with me. I will keep everyone updated on the status of this. UK backers can expect to receive their packages in 2-5 days and international buyers can expect theirs typically within 1-2 weeks after shipping, but please be aware it can take 6 weeks depending on location. International buyers will not recieve a tracking number, please message me if you need a tracking number, UK post doesn't offer this as standard and will be charged extra for this service. UK packages are sent out second class mail.\u00a0 When will I be charged? You are charged when the campaign ends in mid-late January.\u00a0 If I don't pledge now can I buy the pins in your webshop? Please understand that I am using kickstarter to fund these pins and so, if a design doesn't get unlocked the likelihood of it being in the webshop is slim. To try guarantee your favourite design being available you will need to pledge in the kickstarter.\u00a0 When will my order be shipped? As soon as I recieve the pins, you will recieve an email estimating the time in which I will ship them out. Once i've shipped your pledge I will email again to confirm it's been shipped. After that it is dependant on location. Please read the shipping section for information on shipping estimates and how they will be shipped.\u00a0",

  "STOP watching, READ THIS! \nIn my slideshow you can see a lot of my beautiful work. Why am I not in the video? This is because I feel my pictures speak better and louder than I ever could. Trust me it\u2019s better than hearing me stutter and stammer through a presentation and you not understand what I'm about. I'm better behind the camera.  \nSo, who am I? \nMy name is Lesley Reid. In 2007 I discovered a passion for photography. That has gone perfectly with my childhood passion for all things nature and the beautiful landscapes of my home province. Since then I have been striving to capture the beauty of the land I live in all around me.  \nSo, where is this beautiful place you might ask? \nI live in Newfoundland, an island off the east coast of Canada. Newfoundland is about twice the size of the United Kingdom, but only 1/13th of the population. This makes for large amounts of untamed nature and large sections of beautiful landscapes. Hence, why I am \u2018Capturing the Beauty of Newfoundland\u2019 and sharing a beauty that many people don\u2019t even know exist. Just this year a tourist told me that Newfoundland was the best kept secret in Canada and that he wished more people could come and see it. I want to share this beautiful place with the world.  \nSo, what\u2019s the problem? The photos in my video are great! But unfortunately, the camera used for most of those amazing shots is broken, R.I.P., and I can't afford a new one.\u00a0If I want to continue capturing this beautiful place I need a camera. This is the reason for my kickstarter campaign. I\u2019m trying to raise the money to purchase a camera so that I can share a piece of the beautiful place I call home with the world. As a gift of appreciation, Backers will receive a little gift as outlined on my page. Please help me bring Newfoundland to the world. I thank you so much for your support! \nCapture Island Photography: Capturing the Beauty of Newfoundland!\n",
  "Introductory First and foremost, thank you for taking some of your valuable time to visit my Kickstarter campaign. I have been a weddings and events photographer for over 2 years now and the sole breadwinner in my family. It's taken me a while, and the urging of friends, to get up the courage post this.  I believe in working hard and that there is no free lunch. Throughout my career as a photographer in Singapore, it has been quite challenging competing with several other photographers, new or old. Most of the time I would be shooting with my Nikon D5300 with a Nikon 17-55mm lens whereas others, if the budget fits, I would be renting a Nikon D810 and a 24-70mm lens from my preferred rental center.\u00a0 It has been a rewarding few years meeting with clients and working with various make up artists on the job whilst shooting a wedding. it was also the hardest work I've ever done and there was no paycheck to boot. However over the last wedding that recently have passed, I found out that my digital SLR have not been performing the way it used to be. Purchased it from a collection of my hard earn money, I can't bear to let it go.  I had hoped to repurchase at least one camera and lens before the new year, but life (medical emergencies, dialysis billings, rent etc.) happened and it was not possible. \u00a0 I love photography, and having a dysfunctional camera was like losing a limb. Let alone providing a service to my clients that is not top form would greatly affect my income. As soon as I have enough to purchase my camera and lens, I will commence my landscape photography immediately!    So, I'm offering a trade.  For $50 and above you pledge towards a camera and lens (Nikon D810A and 24-70mm 2.8 lens), I will have the respective rewards sent to you. \u00a0Funding Through Kickstarter\u00a0\u00a0 Whether or not you contribute, thank you for taking to time to stop by.  Keep pursuing your own dreams and don't let anything stop you.  Life is beautiful. A percentage of the funds would also be used to produce the rewards that's meant for this campaign. And finally the Kickstarter fess. \u00a0",

  "Let\u2019s face it.  Today\u2019s foods ares killing us slowly.  With the GMO\u2019s and food being grown for size and speed of getting it to market, the nutritional value is nil.  Factoid:  It takes 12 carrots today to equal the \u2018nutritional\u2019 value of the same size carrot grown in the 1950\u2019s in the U.S.  \nThe results -- 9 out of 10 Americans suffer from some form of Degenerative disease or syndrome.  8 out of 10 Americans are overweight or obese.  Fortunately, more and more people are turning to organically grown food.  Many folks are even growing their own in smaller gardens and some folks are even banding together to form \u2018Community\u2019 gardens.  We truly are what we eat and people are sick and tired of being sick and tired and taking drugs just to function.  That is not how are bodies were made.\nDue to personal health challenges, we started growing our own food and wanted to go organic all the way.  Not as easy as it sounds.  The seeds must be GMO free and not treated with anything.  The soil must be organic as well.  Water must be chemical free.  Fertilizers must be chemical free.  The answer is vermicompost.  So where to get it.  There is an eclectic mix of local suppliers throughout the country and fewer that sell nationwide.  We ordered vermicompost from several different suppliers via the internet.  We were not impressed with the results.  So we decided to make our own.  That meant growing worms.  The first attempt met with minimal results.  As with anything else, education is key.  So we became educated on all things vermicompost.  Vermicompost (Worm Poop) is in HIGH DEMAND around the nation.  We started with 1000 Red Wigglers (Eisenia Fetida).  Six months later and a whole lot smarter, we have approximately 4000 worms.  We have harvested the Black Gold (worm castings/poop) twice within that time.  The results from using our worm poop are AMAZING so much to the point that word has gotten out that we were making high quality vermicompost in our local area and request started pouring in for some of this amazing black gold.  We even produce our own organic based worm food from our gardens that increase worm growth and sexual maturity.  This means more reproduction of stronger healthier worms and way more vermicompost.\nBased on research and what the market will bear, we sell our 64oz / 1814 gram container for $19.95 per container.  In our target market, we are unable to keep up with demand.  \nWe are looking for investment capital in order to tool up and build a facility that will allow us to increase production while maintaining quality.  We also want to create a website for our black gold.  It is our intention and desire to grow this into a viable business to support and help grow the organic community throughout the country and around the world in order to promote better health through better food.  Quality is our top priority. \nThis is an opportunity for you to be a part of a movement that is growing and is a vital part of the human race becoming healthy again.  This is not a fad or the pet rock.  So join our team today.

  "Hello, My name is Robert Sandage. I am the screenwriter, producer, and director of THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I am from Decatur, Illinois and live in Decatur where I would like to see THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE filmed at. I have looked up locations in my home town and can visually see the movie being made. I have a list of actors that I would love to see play the roles of the characters that I have created for THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE is a 80's style horror movie with the special effects that are old school effects. I am trying to capture is the creativeness that I enjoyed in horror movies from the 80's. There will be some CGI effects used, but I do not want the entire movie done in CGI though. I have a list of actors who come from a variety of horror films from the 80's that I fill would embody the roles in the movie. THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE will be filmed in Decatur, Illinois and Louisiana. Michelle Torres will be the producer on the Louisiana film crew and has a role in the movie as the TV broadcasting anchorwoman. I will be releasing her characters name eventually on the IMDB board once the film is going to be made.  What is THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE about? Well I had entered a contest and a part of the contest is where you submit a LOGLINE. I had that done and added it to the campaign here for you all to be able to watch. The devil hatches a plan to encase a succubus into a rare jewel or diamond. That rare jewel or diamond winds up on a engagement ring. A boyfriend who is in love with his girlfriends buys the ring and decides to propose to her. The sweet innocent virgin accepts his proposal and the ring is placed onto her finger. When that happens the succubus then possesses her and she begins to claim souls for the devil. The more souls the sweet innocent virgin claims the more her power to shift change and look like any woman that would appeal to any man alive taking their souls. I have spoken to a lawyer in Decatur, Illinois and it is not cheap to hire a lawyer to write up a Letter Of Agreement or a contract. I have even spoken to some of the actors agents and assistants that they have to see about them appearing in THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. In order for this to happen I am needing to have the movie fully funded. This is not my first time creating a campaign page for THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I honestly admit that I was asking for too much money to make it happen. Hiring the screenwriters, director, production staff, casting directors, art directors, lighting crews, and editors is not cheap at all. That is why I am seeking $2,500,000.00 to $3,000,000.00 for a budget for THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I am needing your help for that. I have set up prizes to meet my goal into making this happen. If you love 80's style horror movies then I promise you that you will love THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I would love to see this happen and make it happen for everyone to enjoy including myself. Thank you for your time and making this happen. Robert Sandage",
  "Update 5-12-14: Wow! Two weeks left, and almost half of funds raised. Most of the projects that fail on Kickstarter never raise more than about 10% of their goal, so we are on a great path. I should mention here that our family and friends have been more generous than I could imagine, and your faith in us is a massive inspiration! To celebrate you guys, we have created a special Thank You image, tagging all of our supporters. Head over to the Logan & Royce Facebook page to check it out!\u00a0 Update 5-5-14: Almost at $2000! Special thanks to the band Bon Saints, who have contacted us and agreed to allow use of their music free of charge, to nerd-tastic fan haven\u00a0dorkly.com\u00a0for helping spread the word on Twitter, and to production company\u00a0Atomic Imaging\u00a0for getting involved and offering their industry standard facilities and equipment for a fraction of the price!\u00a0 This has been a lot of work so far, but even more fun. This week we will be hitting blogs, personalities, and unique funding sources to help get the word out. Take care, and talk to you soon!\u00a0 -Radek\u00a0 People are ready to have fun with zombies again.\u00a0 Although a few projects like The Walking Dead have explored these creatures, I believe there is room in our cultural landscape for a\u00a0more tongue-in-cheek romp through an apocalypse. Think 'Thelma and Louise' meets 'Buffy: The Vampire Slayer', with a sprinkle of 'The Road' for flavor. Let me back up.\u00a0 Logan and Royce began as a self-challenge to play recreate some of the visual effects of (what else?) The\u00a0Walking Dead. A motion graphics and visual effects artist by trade, I was fascinated by how the show\u00a0was able to ingeniously blend simple techniques to create very convincing effects, and believed I could build from these while applying my own spin. I strung together\u00a0methods and shots I wanted to try, collected a small crew, secured a shooting location, and went to\u00a0work.\u00a0 But in those few hours of shooting, a funny thing happened. Our two leads developed a fantastic\u00a0rapport and we got to talking. What were these two gals doing in this strange world? How did they\u00a0meet? The world has ended, so why the heck are they so at ease? Where did the zombies come from,\u00a0and why do most seem to be clones of just one actor? (Surely it can't be because only one extra showed\u00a0up for filming...)\u00a0 The Project We'll\u00a0produce an online miniseries, two episodes long, approximately 10 minutes each. Why not one, longer episode? That lets us\u00a0tease you guys with a great cliffhanger midway through!\u00a0 The Goal In order to create this project from start to finish, script writing to signed DVDs, we need to raise $15,000. This\u00a0might seem like a lot, but it's surprisingly low-budget compared to other shows. For 20 minutes of video content, the\u00a0average US Sitcom costs over a MILLION DOLLARS. House of Cards runs roughly $1.5 million for 20\u00a0minutes. The Walking Dead? Nearly $3 million. Even the fantastic online\u00a0web-series\u00a0Videogame High\u00a0School (season 2) cost $150,000 for 20 minutes of show.\u00a0 How can we do it so cheap? We have a community of people that will work for the experience and the\u00a0love of the concept. We can call in favors with regard to crew and locations. We own much of the\u00a0equipment needed, so rental costs are lower.\u00a0 Our\u00a0Financial\u00a0Plan What's next?\u00a0 Free online distribution! Online entertainment is only going to grow in the future, and the savvy content creator would do well to position themselves to take advantage of this trend! Machinima, Indieflix, Amazon,\u00a0and Hulu are just a few targets we will shop the show around to. Even if none of them bite, with enough followers there\u00a0could be a full season in the works. Anything is possible!\u00a0 But first, we need your help!\u00a0 With funding platforms such as Kickstarter, you, the audience, are empowered to choose what gets\u00a0made and what you want to see by voting with your wallet before a single scene is filmed, instead of\u00a0waiting to see what the networks or mega-studios decide your content for you.\u00a0 Why Kickstarter?\u00a0 As one of the most prominent of the crowdfunding services\u00a0available,\u00a0Kickstarter has grown over the past few years from a relatively unknown, niche funding source for artists\u00a0and creative people to a force to be reckoned with. Filmmakers Spike Lee and Zack Braff have raised\u00a0millions for their next projects using Kickstarter. This summer's Veronica Mars movie broke records with\u00a0a total of $5.7 million raised in just 30 days. All from ordinary people that wanted to see the projects\u00a0made, the vast majority pledging between $10 and $50.\u00a0 These are not simply donations. In addition to supporting the creative effort, backers receive\u00a0awards based on their level of contribution.\u00a0 We don't want to flood you with a bunch of trinkets or stickers that you may never use. Instead, we offer experiences. We will take you on the filmmaking journey with us, fromexclusive\u00a0behind the scenes production updates to having a say in the script and editing process, to being a zombie extra in our show!\u00a0 But there is a catch to Kickstarter. It's not for the faint of heart, one must wholeheartedly believe in their vision, for if the financial goals is\u00a0unfulfilled, the project\u00a0receives no funding at all.\u00a0It's an all-or-nothing\u00a0horse race, exciting and nerve wracking in equal measure.\u00a0 How can you help?\u00a0 Aside from pledging to our campaign, and bagging yourself a perk in the process, help spread the\u00a0word! Facebook and Twitter are great, but word of mouth is still the best avenue for sharing the love. You know that\u00a0nerdy guy in your office that gushes about Game of Thrones every Monday? Or your friends who nerd out\u00a0to Joss Whedon's Firefly? Perhaps they'll get a kick out of\u00a0getting our shooting script ($10 backer reward) or getting blown away on set ($500 backer reward).\u00a0 Teaser Trailer Crew\u00a0 Created by: Radek Michalik Production: Josue Miguel \u00a0 Makeup Effects: Joe Mistretta, Kristine Mistretta (4-Finger FX Studios)\u00a0 Royce:\u00a0Deneen Melody\u00a0 Logan: Lauren Clark\u00a0 Zombies and Production Assistance: Ben Vonstein Editing and Computer Visual Effects: Radek Michalik\u00a0",
  "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For Debut Launch of Line in May, 2013 \u00a0 My most recent sumi-e paintings have been on Habotai silk scarves. I have an opportunity to display my newest work at\u00a0\"The Goods: An Artisan Festival\" at Orfilia Winery,San Pasqual Valley, San Diego CA. I need materials to paint fifty 22\" x 60\" silk scarves in two weeks, then get them to my seamstress for hemming in time for the festival. I estimate the cost of materials and production to be $1,500. Backers who contribute at least $40 to this effort will be rewarded with a hand painted Habotai silk scarf, (20\" x 20\"), or 20\" x 60\" for a pledge of $80 or more.

  "Your support is crucial to the success of this campaign! Please take a closer look at the project description below as well as the terrific rewards on the right that I am offering in return for your generous contribution. Thank you! Project Description: I\u2019ve been invited to have my first one-woman show with Reginald Ingraham gallery in Los Angeles May 25th. I am really excited about this great opportunity to share my work on the West Coast.The exhibition is titled, \"Had I Been Raised In the Village...\" and will showcase many of the paintings in my current body of work.\u00a0 As a Rwandan living in Harlem, New York, I work to configure ways of demonstrating my in-between state of being stuck in a perpetual transit lounge. I mine diverse sources such as imigongo cow dung painting patterns, Matisse's color palette, and the visual effects on the severely deteriorated exterior walls of old colonial buildings on the West coast of Africa. I use these points of inspiration combined with oxidized metal detritus I discover on my walks around the city to create works that reflect issues of displacement, cultural adaptation, and what it means to be an immigrant today. My work questions assumptions around hybrid identity in this increasingly globalized world. In exploring these issues, I focus on the transitional material of iron oxide as well as industrial thin-set mortar/concrete to create my paintings and installations. I coalesce disparate components, suspending them in space, to suggest geographical collision. I am creating new pieces over the next month to be included in the exhibition and I\u2019d be humbled to have your support to help with developing and shipping these works. Many of the works in the exhibition are 4 x 4 feet and with objects protruding from their surface. They will require special attention to build crates to protect the work on their journey to L.A.. Your support is an important part of my success in completing the works for the exhibition and making sure they are properly shipped! You can donate any amount.  If you\u2019re in LA you can come to the show...I\u2019d love to meet you.\u00a0 The Kickstarter campaign is all or nothing and my project will not be funded unless we reach the goal!

Reginald Ingraham Gallery: A little taste of some of the work in the series: Some of the Rewards: MONOTYPE: Monotyping\u00a0is a type of\u00a0printmaking\u00a0made by\u00a0drawing\u00a0or\u00a0painting\u00a0on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or\u00a0matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to\u00a0acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of\u00a0paper\u00a0by pressing the two together, usually using a\u00a0printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using\u00a0brushes\u00a0or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque colour. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.

  "\nFor the past year and a half, ever since I moved to London, I have been preparing for my first solo painting exhibition. Having studied painting in Brooklyn, New York at Pratt Institute and since been heavily involved in the Brooklyn art scene, it is my dream to spend the rest of my life creating art and making it my career. I have spent more time than I ever have on this project and I can't wait to see it come to fruition. But I need your help. Living as a working artist in it's beginning stages is a financial struggle. There are many hours needed to have a productive studio practice so it has been hard to save money with part-time work. I am sure with a little help, I can use your support to launch myself into the art scene and show the world all the hard work I've been doing. I can sell my work at this exhibition and make contacts which will further my career. This specific exhibition will show off my newest series of oil paintings while also highlighting some of my older work which has brought me to this point. I've brought to life a dream world where animals live as you and I do and combined it with the the magic of realism with it's devotion to light. Check out my links to see what I've been working on. Your contribution will go to renting the gallery space and the remainder will go to paying for promotional items and gallery installation materials. Any contribution would be more than appreciated. As an artist, your love and support is invaluable and essential.",
