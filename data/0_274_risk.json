  "We understand the challenges that lie ahead of us. Some industry experts say that the market for protein bars is too crowded. These days companies decide to focus on one niche and cater to specific needs of their customers. Ademi\u2019s mission is not only to spread vegan lifestyle, but to innovate and bring out the best in nutrition technology. We sincerely believe that Ademi bars can survive with this Kickstarter campaign plus sales projections that we are planning to generate by adding more flavors and controlling our own supply chain along the way.",
  "Team Unicox Superfoods has taken significant steps to ensure this Kickstarter is as successful  as possible. \n\nWe're a startup and during our first production run things may get delayed. Ingredients can ship late, packaging can be incorrect and things can go wrong in our supply chain. Any of these things could cause us to ship our first products later than we expect. That said, we will keep our backers updated on any and all developments.\n\nIf we reach our funding goal during the preorder window, we will be able to produce our first run with our co-packer in April, May and begin shipping in June .\n\nGiven our capacity for production has limits, if the demand exceeds this capacity, we'll likely need to push out our delivery timeline. However, Unicox Superfoods would have to go truly \"viral\" for this to happen.",
  "With an experienced writing and production team, our production company is confident in achieving its goals and overcoming any challenges from concept, creation to distribution.",
  "With a full month and complete flexibility on my end, it's hard to imagine that anything would get in the way of this project. In some *insanely unlikely* event that I am unable to paint during my stay in Sparkill, a rescheduling of modeling sessions at a later date will occur as necessary and painting will continue once home in Kansas City, thereby completing the paintings and fulfilling the rewards. The schedule may be affected, but not the result.",
  "The challenge is assembling the people and equipment needed for this.  You need cameras for photos and videos. A studio is a must to be able to create the many different images I want. And finally, I need to hire models or bring in survivors from around the country to take part.",
  "My obstacle is Mentoring for new business, I would be my own boss, I'm new to running my own business, I have a passion for this to succeed, so with help (and funding) I will make this work.",
  "Risks once the film is funded successfully is the film location and crew.",
  "Aside from accidentally summoning a demon, there are many risks associated with making this film. Primarily, pushing the bounds of what our camera systems are technically capable of will be a challenge to say the least - but our months of testing and prep has us confident we can do something new and exciting, and fun to watch.",
  "A challenge we face is time. We plan on the film being complete and released by the week of halloween. All of the creators work fulltime jobs outside of their film jobs (which during filming can also be fulltime) so getting the film shot and edited and released in 60 days will be a challenge. \r\nOur short 'Meat' was shot edited and released in two days with a 100$ budget. So we are fully confident in our ability.",
  "I have made 40+ pins at this point and so I have a good idea of what I'm doing. There may be delays due to unforeseen circumstances (weather, holidays, imperfections in the pins, etc.), but I will do everything in my power to make sure these pins are in your hands by May.\n\n***NOTE: Backers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply. I'm not responsible for delays due to customs. Actual colors may vary slightly from proofs.***",
  "I'll need to hire a writer, make up artists and put together a film crew and editors/sfx, all for a relatively small amount.  This will be tough to come up with skilled people and basically this is the first time I've done anything like this, so this movie will probably suck. lol  So many people have tried something like this and failed, zombie movies are a dime a dozen, but there are so few good ones,  I want to create something that is action packed and for zombie film lovers which I am one of.",
  "To be honest without your support we wont get this done, in preparation we have been in contact with a location agency and well as freelance after effects people. our crew are a bunch of film buff and we are ready to go. casting the crew will take some time as we want the best for your money. to be honest our risk is very minimal but it all can't be possible without your support.",

  "I believe the risks and challenges are few. I did my best to tailor the expected delivery time on each the incentives according to what I've learned about the process of making records in the past.\r\nBarring an act of God, there is little that can prevent me from completing this project and honoring the incentives.\r\nThat said, scheduling of the studios and musicians, completion of cover art and issues with pressing can all contribute to delays in completion.\r\nI will keep you all abreast of process as events unfold.",
  "The main challenges involved with recording this record are preparing the material and making sure that we are all healthy both mentally and physically before we get into the studio.  We have a limited time to complete this project and we are on a tight budget.  But we feel confident that with the love and support of our friends, family and community, we can work through any obstacle that will arise.",

  "I have experience with kickstarter as well as been in the pin making business for a year now. I'm able to make the process a lot smoother but a full disclosure is always warranted. I have a designated manufacturer I work with but have expanded my interaction to multiple as a fall back plan. My pins come from overseas so that explains the time necessary to produce all the enamel pins. \nAll designs displayed so far are tentative designs until I can get a better idea of what is possible with the the mold to make these designs accurate. I will try my best to adhere to the original design as much as possible however.\nDue to the timing in the global problem of COVID 19, I've added a buffer month just in case something gets delayed or if the pins need more time to be made.\n\nSome manufacture errors are possible in mass production so if there are any B-grade enamel pins of greater than 15% in a batch, I will request a remake for quality which will have a bit of a longer wait time. I will be on top of quality check before and after receiving pins to the best of my capabilities. Please note that some slight color variation may occur from my original artwork due to each viewer's monitor settings and what colors can actually be generated in reality. \n\nI am the sole person designing, planning, ordering, packing and shipping out the packages. If any delay comes along, I will certainly let you backers know as soon as possible and keep you all updated. I will answer questions to the best of my ability.",
  "1. Delay of shipping the pins due to slow production because of local holidays/defects.\n2. Actual color of the design might not look exactly the same with the digital art design posted.\n3. If you have any problems or concerns with the shipping of your parcel, please contact me ASAP through email or message me directly on Instagram and i will help you with my best. But in the cased that you missed out on receiving your parcel it is your responsibility to contact the courier.",
  "We're transparent in communicating the physical and mental demands that come with running a restaurant. It's no secret that a bigger space means that the responsibilities, expenses and maintenance will double. One of the biggest risks is not having the right team to divide the responsibilities amongst. We've experienced this in the past. We've been working from within our current team to build a better structure for operations, prep and service.\n\nAnother risk in opening \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" is the challenge that comes with running two locations. The structure and demands of our small cafe is being scaled down to accommodate a breakfast and brunch menu w/a fresh juices, coffee and tea in the early half of the day. Our full service location will be for lunch/dinner and nightlife service. Strategically having these locations open at different times will help with balancing out the managerial needs and maintenance of both spaces.",
  "The only possible risk is that i might ship your products with a little delay.",
  "Vegan food is hotter than ever and it is growing every day at the moment.\nWe hope to be one of the first vegan food trucks of our kind here in Sweden, and by being first together with serving amazing food we hope to become more and more popular and more and more known, so that we eventually can open up a 2nd and then a 3d truck, there is a dream about Vegan EVERYTHING being in both Denmark, Norway and Finland as well in the future.\nThere is risks and challenges with everything you decide to do, but if you never try then you will never know. Vegan food and healthy food is everywhere, but a vegan food truck serving the vegan food that we are going to serve is something we have not seen here and that is what we are so optimistic about!\nIf a problem would show up, we would just have to work our hardest to solve it.",
  "As anyone who's traveled knows, crazy can and does happen. All you can really do is plan for contingencies and adapt when they occur. I will be purchasing travel insurance best suited to cover the nature of this trip in case something major does happen. Should travel plans change backers will be updated. Also all artwork will be fully insured during shipping for full reimbursement to backers should it be lost or damaged and there is no possibility of replacement (ie. original artwork not prints). \r\n\r\nThough I've tried to plan my trip for the most suitable weather for outdoor painting, it is always possible that some days that might not be true. If the weather is not cooperating and I'm not able to paint outside I'll do my best to find a interior sheltered location in which to paint, or do an extra painting another day. But if I'm not able to complete all the plein air paintings purchased by backers while on the trip, then the remaining number of paintings will be completed in studio from photos once back home in the same style and size of their plein air counterparts and backers receiving these paintings will be notified of the change. \r\n\r\nLastly, though access to wireless internet is common place while traveling these days, we all know that sometimes it goes out. I'll do my best to update my blog at least once a day, but if there are internet problems it might be late.",
  "The biggest risk and challenges  associated with participation in Spectrum Miami is taking the time away from my students and finding the extra time while I'm teaching to keep my creative projects moving forward. The risk is spending the time and money to put on a good quality exhibit and not achieving the results I need to keep moving forward as an artist. If I get picked up by one gallery, or sell the pieces on the floor, I will consider it a success. But its long term growth as an artist and advocate for the arts which has led me to take this project on.",
  "There's no risk involved, especially if you liked issue 1 and 2. When the project reaches it funding goal it will be professionally printed and posted to each and every person who funded the project.\r\n\r\nThe magazine is guaranteed to be at least 68 pages in length, in full colour containing articles about eight bit computers written by enthusiasts of eight bit computers.\r\n\r\nIssue 1 and 2 was successfully funded and received positive feedback. Issue 3 aims to be even better.",

  "There is many risks and challenges ahead for us, most notably that we will fail to raise the required amount and the project fails. This is will be most unpleasant and will mean that all of the money raised thus far will be returned to it's lender as this is an all of nothing vehicle.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we might face is that Belan Hall is under such heavy snow that we will not be able to get there. If this is the case we will scratch our stubble and agree on an equally creative (though less remote) place to record.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we could face is that we don't receive any bookings for festivals, which although unlikely, could happen, as at this stage we only have it in 'word' and not 'writing'. If this is the case and we fail to agree on any festivals the THE FESTIVAL prise will be refunded to the sum of \u00a3300 and the THE VIP will be offered as a makeweight.\r\n\r\nThe final challenge will be staying fit and healthy and creative, if for any reason a release date is pushed back we will give you ample warning and communicate throughout.",
  "With your support we will have our project completed and ready to deliver by March 2015. We will keep you up to date with all progress and feel free to contact us for any reason at JustinAlanBlackBand@gmail.com.",
  "We are giving ourselves the month of November to fully realize the songs and ensure our confidence during the recording process. The most realistic challenge we think could happen would be the need for more recording time and in turn more money. An obvious risk is the potential inability to reach our goal of $1,500. This would be a set back to the creation of the album, the production of CD's and general saving for future tours/recording projects. We hope to release the album in the early new year.",
  "Filmmaking is always a complicated and involved process with room for many unforeseen problems (trust us). However, with our amazing team, I know we'll overcome any problems that arise in a creative and effective way.

You're part of the team now!\r\n\r\nAnd if another fire comes our way you can BET we'll fight it off with our BARE HANDS!!! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqw1gq-5UZY)",
  "Primarily everything is being planned by myself but there are some things that require speaking with and coordinating everyone involved will be a bit tough. This project is also a bit experimental as everything will be edited on tablets(i Pad) with a wide selection of interesting editing programs that create surprisingly great quality videos. Casting the actresses for Claire and Moira could also be challenging as they are iconic characters with a specific look but thankfully there are a few theatre student volunteers who are interested so it'll just be a matter of choosing the right people. Lastly there's finding the right location to film at that reasonably captures the look of the various environments within the game, but with enough research a place should be found.\r\nI personally believe with the right amount of effort put into all the variables there should not be any issues working on this project.",
  "Every great business venture involves some risk.  I feel I am very well prepared because of my years of experience in the food service industry.  Everything from waitressing to cooking to bookkeeping.  I have over 20 years under my belt to handle the hustle and bustle of preparing and serving food.  I've utilized many resources to properly guide me on my journey to entrepreneurship.  Most invaluable has been my business advisor Matt from the CT Small Business Development Center (SBDC).  He has successfully assisted in the opening of over 50 food based businesses and his tutelage and guidance has been my greatest gift.  I believe slow and steady wins the race.  So my goal is to expand Dutch's without going \"too big, too soon\".  A consistent quality product is always my first priority.  My focus for successful business will be proper financial management, well developed marketing strategies, building a strong team, superior customer service and continuously looking for opportunities to improve.  Our biggest challenge will be attracting non vegan customers.  To overcome that challenge we plan to have as much face to face contact as possible.  I believe that most people are open to listen and try something new once even a small amount of trust is established.  If we can be on hand to answer questions about ingredients or preparation it will help them gain a better understanding and be less fearful of eating something new.  It only takes one bite to be hooked.",
  "There are two major challenges: this being a collaborative project and being held outside.  The commitment from the artists is present, however, emergencies do arise at the most unexpected times.  The other is the weather, if the weather stops the event it will be rescheduled for a later date.",

  "Well, we could freeze to death... no just joking! There is the risk that no northern lights will appear or that the weather will be so cloudy or foggy that even if there are northern lights, we won't see them. But this is why we go for 3 weeks to get a good chance of clear nights with hopefully lots of northern lights. Otherwise there are no risks just fun in the cold winter nights ;-)",
  "The biggest challenge will be getting all the calendars out to backers in time for the holidays. The funding period closes on the 8th of November and the printer has assured me that I can get an eight day turnaround on printing. With an estimated seven days to ship at the most, I'm looking to have the calendars by the 23rd or 24th of November. It'll be hectic, but I believe I can get them all shipped within two weeks. That means they're out my door two and half weeks before Christmas. If the response is so large that I need to hire help to make that happen, then I'll do that.",
  "There's actually very little risk!  The first issue is more or less done and paid for.  The authors are paid and the artist is paid.  The only one who hasn't been paid is me!\r\n\r\nLet me explain.  I intend to put out this high quality science fiction magazine regardless of what happens on this Kickstarter.  So, why am I Kickstarting?  Because I intend to use Kickstarter as an investment platform. By supporting this first issue of Cirsova, you are investing in the future of the magazine.  Proceeds from the Kickstarter will be used to fulfill orders and profits will be used to purchase stories for a second issue.",
  "There are many challenges with completing a project of this size. The main one is being able to pay a professional lay out artist to set up the magazine for printing. This is a very specific skill set and it doesn't come cheap!\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is getting all the content together. It takes a tremendous amount of time and creative energy to write the stories, take the photos and put the whole thing together in a cohesive whole. While I've written and published many articles for other magazines, I've never put a whole magazine together myself. The previous editor had years to figure this out and I was part of the team, but I have never been responsible for a magazine from start to finish, so I'm learning as I go. \r\n\r\nThe final challenge; allowing enough time to actually create the content and production. I always think I'll be able to finish a project much faster than I actually do. As you can see from the above video, I originally expected to have this out by early summer. Here it is, late fall, and I'm finally done pulling all the articles and pictures together. I'm working with a lay out artist now to design the magazine, and by the time this campaign ends, I will finally be ready to go to print!\r\n\r\nEverything in this magazine has been done from scratch; there is no pre-made template where you just plug images in and voila, you have a magazine. I'm building it all from the ground up. Even finding a printer has been a challenge since so few places exist now that print in the style I want to print in! \r\n\r\nEvery step of this magazine has been tackled one piece at a time. If further delays come up, it will be handled in the exact same way; with transparency, honest communication and lots of elbow grease!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your pledge and support! Rock on! \r\n\r\nxo Rev. Michelle",
  "The largest risk involved after funding is complete is also the next challenge. After the Registrations are filled out, the Legalities Sorted, and the Teaser is shot, the Over-all Film Budget will be the next Kick Starter Project in order to complete this masterful film project and get it entered into the hands of the Film Festival Circuit and Possible Distribution.\r\n\r\nIf this project succeeds and the over-all budget fails, I will still strive in all manners possible to continue to raise the funds for the Full Feature Film Project.\r\n\r\nBackers who do fund this successful project will still receive all related rewards and promises made in this Project if it does reach its Goal. If the Full Budget Kickstarter Project reaches its goal, the Backers of this project will be automatically credited as promised from this Funding without further Backing necessary for the Full Budget Fund.\r\n\r\nAny amount of funding over this preliminary goal will be transferred to the Full Feature Length Budget Fund Project and bring that Project's Initial Goal lower.",
  "1. I understand that restaurants face their fare share of challenges.  That is one of the reasons we are starting with a food truck.  This will allow us to introduce West Michigan to an all vegan dining experience, while running a lean operation and making data-driven decisions to ensure our success and growth.  Having a seasoned veteran of the industry on our team will help us avoid some of the common pitfalls of a food startup.\n2. The timeline could be pushed back as purchasing, outfitting and licensing a truck can sometimes take longer than planned.\n3. NASA says that thousands of meteors hit the ground every year so the chance of one of them hitting our truck is something that keeps us up at night.\n\nThank you all so much for your continued support with my companies Bit Baking Co. and Cheeyeah and I look forward to sharing this amazing project (and food) with you! \n\nPeace & Love",

  "This is the second time that I and four friends stayed on my friend's land in New Mexico for a month of art creation. Last year was a great success. This year we have planned our schedule and meals, and have a good estimate of our costs. I would say generally the biggest challenge for me is planning. With this project, I have a clear schedule of work and a definite number of paintings to finish, which corresponds to the days of the month of July: 31. It is always good for me to be working on something that I know I will be giving to someone for them to enjoy.",
  "The risks and challenges are fairly minimal. I've already been accepted to the Fellowship and I have transportation. The only obstacle really standing in my way is money.

I will continue to monitor the situation and should any updates need to be made about shipping expectations, I will update accordingly.",
  "The production time of the pins is completely beyond my control, because a manufacturer makes the pins for me after I send them my design. Normally it takes about 4 weeks of production, if there is any delay I'll let all my backers know.\n\nThe colors may change slightly once the pins go into production. If something in my design changes, I'll notifiy all backers.\n\nThe cost for shipping are standard delivery, without any tracking code. This way I can keep the shipping costs low for you. I am not accountable for lost or damaged pins, but if the damage occurs under my accountability, I will gladly have a new pin send to you!",
  "While I am seeking $10,000 to fund the 2nd stage of this new album, in truth that only covers the recording fees. I actually need another $3,000 beyond this to print the album and another $5,000-7,000 for marketing and advertising costs. So, the completion of this project is contingent on gaining these extra funds at some point. I've set this Kickstarter campaign threshold at $10,000, but I sure would appreciate if I were able to achieve much more than that. My dream goal is to raise $20,000. The extra funds will be used wisely in the completion of an album that will be a pinnacle of my career!",

  "We truly believe No Planet B Festival will make an impact from the offset creating a positive energy for the future of our planet. \r\n\r\nBut of course all things have their challenges, and by highlighting them here we aim to to be fully transparent with you, so that we can all grow on this journey together! \r\n\r\nRisks: \r\n\r\n1) Ticket Quantity Sold: \r\n\r\n- Being a first year festival, despite our incredible line-up and fully rounded weekend of activities, we need to consider the possibility of not selling enough tickets to outweigh the expenditure involved in running this festival (which isn't cheap!)  \r\n-We have been planning for this outcome all year, and no pun intended have Plan B, Plan C and Plan D have been thought out. However, if we do not sell at least 750 tickets by May 26th we plan to discuss as team whether we look to temporary put the festival on hold until 2019. As a result Kickstarter will not charge ANY money from your accounts. \r\n\r\n2) Wet Weather: \r\n\r\n-As much as we want that Coachella festival weather, we need to face the facts that we are in the UK, and as well all know to well....festival 101 rule....bring your wellies! \r\n\r\n-We have a full wet weather contingency in place, however depending on the amount of rain (if it were to happen) we may need to cancel the festival.

This process takes time and might involve delays. However, I wish to have the book published in december 2019.\nPhoto books are expensive to print and a minimum of 500 copies are required to order. Otherwise, the unit price will become too expensive. \nIn other words, it is a 'Limited edition print' and my Kickstarter backers will have priority and a signed copy of the book.\n\nOther challenges with self-publishing will be marketing. Since I have no distributors, I will have to promote the book on the internet. Also, I will take personal contacts with selected book stores in order to have presentation. Additionally, I will of course present the book and do signing during my exhibitions.",

  "Our passion is food!. My husband and I have been in the hospitality business for 30 years.  There are other people selling their sofrito. What separates our product from other ones out there, is our commitment to using only 100% fresh product without preservatives and it is 100% vegan.  In the last couple of years we've been selling our sofrito from home, farmers markets and on ebay. \r\n  There is mainly one company that sells their sofrito at big name brand supermarkets. Since we make our sofrito without preservatives, we know that with an amazing sales and marketing team and plan, we will approach with confidence potential markets. A couple of the markets we will approach with our sofrito are, Wholefoods, Trader Joes (these stores do not sell sofrito). You see, sofrito is used mostly in the Caribbean, so we are here to educate folks on using it on a daily basis to season and marinade all foods. It's so healthy!.  I've researched the benefits of the ingredients in the sofrito and you'll be pleasantly surprised to find out how good it is for a good diet and health promotions. \r\n     We have also pledged to give back to the community. every month, we will choose a charity or family to lend a financial hand.\r\n \r\n      With your monetary pledge, we will :\r\n\r\n.mass production\r\n.All necessary licences \r\n.commercial kitchen rental\r\n.sales and marketing\r\n.distribution\r\n\r\n     We thank you in advance for taking the time to read our story and be a part of something amazing.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nSharon and Jim",
  "What we find challenging is getting 100% funded and finding that perfect spot in the metro.\r\n\r\nBetween us both we have 26 years of kitchen experience both in cooking and in assisting in the day-to-day operations. We have worked the past 5 years in perfecting our recipes and studying the vegan and gluten free lifestyle in order to provide quality products for our guests to enjoy.",
  "Starting any business can of course come with unique challenges. \r\n\r\nSome problems we can foresee are the following. \r\nDelay in getting license due to slow bureaucracy\r\nDifficulty in getting into a suitable kitchen\r\nGetting our product into big shops - supermarkets will be quite challenging to get into. The focus at first will be on smaller shops.  \r\n\r\nWhile we anticipate the bureaucratic problems. We believe that finding an appropriate premises will not be a problem. Also while it may take longer to get into bit supermarkets, we believe that due to the exploding demand for vegan products we will see great growth.",
  "The biggest challenge for me was finding the right producer. And I've already found the perfect guy.\r\n\r\nLorenzo and I did a practice run with my song, Crosby Street, and he nailed it. He wrote parts for a guitar, banjo, bass, keys, even back up harmonies for me to sing for myself. He heard the music I wrote and then he heard the possibility that lies within it. And the best part is that he then knew how to execute it. He knows the best people to work with. And my favorite part is that he knows me. He knows how to push and challenge me to stretch my talents to create something that's better than I could have imagined. \r\n\r\nWith that secure, I feel no fear of risk, only excitement for opportunity.\r\n\r\nOh. I forgot. It will be a challenge for me to stay in tempo, but that's not news to anyone that's seen me play. I promise I'll overcome it. Mostly.",
  "Once this project is successfully funded, I intend to proceed quickly through the tangled process of editing, mastering and recording the album.  Of course, there can be delays at any step, graphic design glitches, finding common time to get everyone together, but having gone through this process many times, I'm confident that I'll have a product for you by this fall - in time for holiday gifts!",

  "I'm a rookie.  I've never made a zine!  My projected costs are based on research, but who knows what I might not have thought of.  I think I have some great connections and leads on promoting it, but some of these put me under some pretty short deadlines.  I hope that those deadlines will be a great motivation to get things done in a timely manner!",
  "There are many risks and challenges with making a film.  One of the challenges we have come to face is equipment we are here to raise some money to overcome that.",
  "The risks for this project are minimal.  If I receive my minimum funding amount, I will finalize, professionally print, publish, and begin to advertise the screenplay.  The actual writing of the screenplay is not reliant on funding of this project.  I am certain I will have it completed by December of next year.  I intend to keep all contributors updated on my progress.  The only major challenge I face is taking this project to the next level.  I have no connections in any aspect of the film industry and would have to rely first on the quality of my final product, and secondly on advice on how to get my product known to those in the film industry.  Those who contribute at this base level of the project are guaranteed success.  Together, we will see where we can take it from there.",

  "Setbacks are almost a certainty, but with precision, focus and lots of rehearsals, we assure that hiccups and hurdles won't be happening. I've set up a very rigid pre-production, production, and post-production schedule and plan to adhere to this 100% of the way. Even in pre-production, we've encountered hurdles, losing a couple of actors, and re-writing things on the fly to keep on line to make a great film. \r\n\r\nI plan on screening this theatrically after it is complete, and then taking it to festival play to ensure that everyone will see what their money went to.",
  "We are going to get this album done, no matter what. If we have busk on the street of downtown Asheville barefoot every weekend for the next five years to pay for it, we will.

There will be many unforeseen hurdles and hiccups, but we will use our brains and our incredible resources and work through them. Thank you for believing in us.",

If I find I'm in need of a lot more pins than I have quoted my manufacturer, then obviously that will cause some delays.\n\n\u2022 Potential minor design changes - my manufacturer has already approved the borb designs so we should be good to go, so i'm being cautiously optimistic that there will be no issues - but you never know! I may have to tweak things during production.",
  "The paintings are completed so that isn't a risk. (This project will clear my art debts and let me buy supplies to create my next project.)\r\n\r\nRisks include damage/alterations to paintings while displayed for publicity or during shipping.

I am doing my best to make sure the paintings will be protected during shipping (glassine, water resistant wrapping and foam board) but damage might occur.",

Within the past year I have decided that I need to share my passion with others. Which is why I have become interested in photography and writing, because I feel they are the best routes to share my experiences with others.\r\n\r\nI am taking on an amazing endeavor. Because of the challenges I know that I will face, I have spent a lot of time researching everything I need to be successful. \r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I am not able to start this project without the help of all of you. Your pledges will pay for my hiking equipment, living expenses throughout 2018, and will allow me to publish my photo book once it is completed.",

I am also not responsible for any taxes, claims, or additional fees that your country may require.

  "This is our 6th Kickstarter and we are very familiar with enamel pin production and order fulfillment. Please visit our Etsy store if you'd like to see our customer reviews. :)\n\nMost of the anticipated potential risks occur in pin production or shipping delays. If a delay occurs during either phase, all backers will be notified. As with all Kickstarters, if this is not funded, there will be no charge to you.\n\nThank you for your support! :)",
  "There are very few risks associated with this type of project, however we understand things may and do arise especially at the worst possible time. Potentially the only real risk that could cause any delays would be in the mastering from digital to analog or from the company chosen to produce the 7\" being unable to complete the project in a timely manner. In which case we would still be able to offer all of our incentives, only at a later date.",
  "Colors & design changes:\nFinal products can have slight color variations from the provided images due to monitor/computer settings. I will work with my manufacturer to try to get the best match for the PMS colors that I have chosen for these designs!\nThere is a possibility that there will be minor design changes to the pins (ie:  line thickness) due limitations in production, but I will try to stay as true to the design as possible. If there are major changes needed, I will notify backers.\n\nDelays:\nSince the pins are manufactured overseas, there is a potential for delays in production and shipping. There is also a small possibility that if my manufacturer sends a high number of damaged/faulty pins, I will have to get them remade as soon as possible. I will keep backers notified if these situations occur!",
  "This will be my second time making a pin via Kickstarter, and my main concern is making sure the manufacturer can deliver by the time I'm asking, which will be somewhere between March and May, but I have previously gone to them for my first pin, and I trust them.",
  "I am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time. There could be production issues that are beyond my control that could impact the delivery date. Also minor changes in the design may occur to prevent manufacturing problems, but these will only be made if it is absolutely necessary and every effort will be made to preserve the original aesthetic.\n\nAdditionally, though shipping logistics could always potentially be a problem, I have reliably shipped thousands of pins via USPS.\n\nIf any issues arise I will be sure to notify backers.\n\nPlease note that everyone's monitors display images a little differently. The colors shown for the pins may vary slightly when compared to the pins in person.",
  "Time. Tackling a large series like this will take time. I plan on dedicating the months of June - October to this project. I will do a few other pieces within this time frame, but only as a quick break. This will be the largest series I've completed, but I have practiced on a 20 piece series of African animals in the same style. Those 20 pieces took about two months, which is how I calculated the time frame for this project.",

There are a LOT of rules about how we're allowed to display signage and we have read them all, as well as acquired all the permits.  We have a professional painter ready to do the renovations on the wall when the weather breaks as well as sources for all of our signage and lighting.  \r\n\r\nWe will be sending out rewards as soon as they are available (which we anticipate mid Feb) and we'll do our best to customize to your liking!",
  "Because we have been running this business for over two years, we already have much of the infrastructure in place and are prepared to meet and overcome any obstacles we face. \r\n\r\nThe designs for our packaging are complete and ready to be ordered as soon as funds become available. \r\n\r\nWe will need to find and secure a commercial kitchen and can pay rent once the project is successfully funded. To fulfill orders, we will need to hire two bakers. Our family has had many years of combined experience in the food production industry--Grigor as a restaurant owner, Christina as a coffee shop assistant manager and baker, and Tony as a professionally-trained pastry chef--which will enable us to start up and run a kitchen that meets all Health Department and FDA requirements.\r\n\r\nIf you have any concerns about our ability to deliver quality products in a timely manner, please ask away and we would be happy to answer any of your questions!",
  "The biggest challenge to getting the record out by September will be making sure the band can all be off for 3 days to make the record.\r\n\r\nThe other challenges that we can forsee we have found help to package envelopes, so that should be covered.\r\n\r\nThis will be 4 songs instead of the 8 we were looking to make in the prior kickstarter project. We have a new studio on board to help us make the project that will make this go quickly and save us some time and money!",
  "I have had a lot of help from friends going through the recording process. As you all know some of the money funding this project has to go fulfilling perks! which if all goes well everyone that becomes part of this EP or \"backs\" will be getting some pretty awesome stuff.

I have already lined up a team of friends that have been there helping me make this record from the start to also help ship your GOODS! Whether I have to drop it off at your house personally or if i have to ship it to the north pole. The idea here is you get what you put in plus more.",

  "There are Risks and Challenges associated with any restaurant startup. Here's why we think VURRITO's standards will mitigate those risks. For one, there is no one currently doing what we do. Our competitors are the non-healthy options that are not good for us. They contribute directly to obesity, heart disease, global warming and animal cruelty (just to name a few). VURRITO\u2122 is a sustainable, cruelty-free food option for everyone. \r\n\r\nOne of the of the most important aspects of a restaurant business is controlling food costs.  VURRITO\u2122 can lead the fast-casual industry in food cost percentage and at the same time, provide the highest quality ingredients!  All of our ingredients are used in multiple menu items, which reduces the cost and potential waste of each product. We also have very little chance of cross contamination, there are no animal by-products, which means no nasty salmonella.  \r\n\r\nWe believe there are multiple effective and profitable ways of bringing VURRITO\u2122 to the masses! VURRITO's model is exceptionally scalable and profitable: this includes catering, food trucks, farmers markets, food carts, as well as wholesale in stores or online. The sky is the limit!",
  "I am hoping for the best result, but of course I need to consider risks.\r\n\r\nThe main risk that arises is that the project will not be funded, so I am setting a goal of \u00a3100 for a start.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge for me is to find 30 different ideas in my head and get them painted onto the paper and to try not to use same elements in the painting. I think that it will be really interesting to see how my head copes with it ))",
  "The major challenge to the project that I see is getting good, usable photos that are adquate for painting references of the 14 fields that I have not personally seen.  While completing 30 large paintings in 30 weeks is a challenge I am totally confident that I can get it done.",
  "I want to make sure I raise money to fund other projects including helping local non profits. I also want to do this together with you so that we all win in being generous to our city whilst also getting art prints out of it!",
  "There are essentially no risks to this project",

Fuh-Ree-Zing!\r\n\r\nOther than that, I've done a successful mini project on Kickstarter already. So I've got a good idea about how it all works!\r\n\r\nThe only other risk is trying to safely get prints out to you. But I'll be really careful to pack them all proper!",

I have allowed for the extra work in my projected time scale and should still have everything completed by December 2013 in this most wonderful of eventualities.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am new to portraiture commissions, please rest assured that I have owned my own online business since 1998 and am very used to fulfilling orders in a timely manner on an international scale. I have also received many jewellery design commissions over the years so the concept of commissioned work is not new to me. \r\n\r\nI already have a printer lined up for the Giclee prints and another one for the postcards and stickers so I'm all ready to go. Yay!",
  "A large risk in our project would be Covid. We'll have to take into consideration how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our filming schedule as well as our cast and crew. To stay as safe as possible, we will be limiting the number of crew-members we have on set, sanitizing all equipment before and after use, and more. We will be taking the necessary steps to stay safe. And following the Texas Film guidelines for COVID safety. Our biggest priority is making sure our cast and crew healthy, comfortable, and taken care of.",

  "Risks and challenges\n- Your card will not be charged if the Dapper Cats Enamel Pin Kickstarter does not reach its goal.\n- There may be delays in production or shipping, due to time zones, and Holidays. However, I will do my very best to make sure that everyone receives their pins and goodies as quickly as possible.\n- Due to the hand-made nature of these enamel pins, there is a possibility of defective pins. (No backer should get a defective pin, so if a large portion of the batch is defective, I will communicate with the manufacturers to get this sorted as soon as possible. I have immense faith in my manufacturer as I've worked with them on three Kickstarters already. They have never let me down so far. \n- Inspections/grading will be another challenge. This will take time! I want to ensure that everyone gets perfect pins, so I usually take about 2 weeks to grade every single pin personally. \n- All US bound packages will include tracking. Some packages may be delayed due to inclement weather, post worker strikes, or other unforeseeable events. I appreciate your patience, and am happy to replace a package if it is marked as officially LOST by USPS on their tracking website. However, if your package is marked as delivered, I cannot replace it. Please make sure that your delivery address is a safe location to receive your rewards.\n- International packages are a bit tricky. These do not have tracking once they leave the US. I cannot replace missing packages due to being unable to determine with confidence whether your package was truly lost or not. To prevent loss of stock, these packages will not be sent twice. You will always be able to see when your package is sent out via the US tracking sent to your email, however, this will not show your package as it travels outside the US. Please make sure that you trust your postal system, and pledge with confidence! \n- I will keep backers posted via the updates tab, and through my social media outlets! Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you have anymore questions! (BraveLittleAvengers @ gmail. com) :)",

  "Common to Utah is the chance of winter hitting in October. To help avoid this potential issue, all scenes that take place outside are scheduled first, with many having the option of being moved to interior locations without hurting the storytelling. There is also the chance of the actual pandemic having a second wave hit around the time of production. This production will be using testing kits to make sure everyone on set is healthy as well as practicing CDC guidelines. Easier to pull off when you have a pandemic in your story and having a killer who is always wearing a mask. If there is a city or state stay-at-home order, the film will be rescheduled for next spring and will not be cancelled.",

  "As with any Kickstarter, this project runs the chance of not meeting  the funding goal. In such an event you will not be charged for your pledge.\nOther risk factors include: \n- Defective pins - which will cause a DELAY in shipment time. \n- Minimal design changes - sometimes certain details are better left  out. I will be sure to negotiate with the manufacturer to ensure that the pins will look as closely as possible to the default designs. I will  provide updates if there are further changes! \n- Lost packages - this risk will be minimized by double checking  your mailing information before sending them to me! Once an item is in  transit, it will depend on the post to handle the package. Any damages  can be negotiated with USPS office(s). \n- Health factors - these pins will be made with METAL. If you have any allergies to such, please be wary!",
  "The only thing that stands in my way of having the new album printed up is providing the upfront funds to purchase the materials & services needed to do so.  It is that simple.  There are no collaborators.  I am doing all the artwork and writing all the songs.  I am recording a SOLO record so no other musicians are involved.  There is only one guy, Patrick Herzfeld, who is recording, engineering & producing the record and we are best friends.  He has recorded three other records ( Graham Wilkinson & the Underground Township, Graham Wilkinson, and Spiritual Accessories EP ) of mine and has been my right hand drummer for over ten years.  \r\nIn the event that Patrick was unable to record this record, simply to address this section of the Kicstarter application process where we assess the \"Risks & Challenges\", I have over 10 other studios I am connected with where I could complete the process.\r\nI have three different companies lined up and ready to print up the record once it is done and have compared their prices (all of them are about the same)... and THAT is the only thing I am doing, printing up the cd's, with the Kickstarter money.\r\nIf I had to imagine the biggest challenge i will face in trying to complete this project, outside of actually raising the money, it would be finding the time in my family's busy schedule where my wife isn't working, or we have a babysitter and I'm not missing one of Zoe's soccer games so i can record - and that can be made possible all with a little communication & planning. :)",

  "The obstacles that come up are mainly financial; making copies of the final product once it is collaged.  Buying glue and scissors and tape and paper. Printing the submitted materials.  Mailing them out.  The financial burden is definitely the largest, but that will be taken care of if this campaign is successful.\r\n\r\nOther obstacles include:\r\nfinding a place that is indoors and warm to actually construct these zines.  There are always coffee shops and really sweet couchsurfing hosts, and i've got a large tarp and some rope, so worst comes to worst, i'll go to a national park and set up camp for a few days of uninterrupted zine construction.\r\nFinding a local print shop i want to give my business too, because i don't want to support any corporations who contribute to the suffering in this world.  That's easy enough, thanks to my pocket god (aka smart phone).\r\n\r\nThose are really the only challenges i can foresee, and their pretty easily solved.  I have a really wide social network and know of a lot of platforms to post calls for submissions and already have a blackbook full of amazing artists to solicit.  \r\n\r\nso, really, the only challenge is funding.",
  "The risk involved in this project is really quite minimal. The biggest challenge is getting advertisers into a very first issue of any magazine. Most advertisers want to see a bit of a track record before committing advertising dollars. So there is a good chance we will take a minimal loss on the first few issues of the magazine. Which is why we need to ensure we are properly funded to make the magazine viable long-term. Now don't get me wrong, there are many ways to get paying advertisers into a first issue, and that will be a huge point of focus. Giving advertisers an incredible looking preview of the magazine is by far the best way to do that.",

  "Because this is my first Kickstarter and I'm not sure how to gauge the reaction or the popularity.  I will be working my hardest to retain momentum and hype for the witch pins. \nIf the project is not able to fully funded, then any pledges made will not be charged! It's all or nothing! \n\n I'll be active with everyone, and for any question that you may have, I can be reached at MousieMagick@gmail.com. \n\nOnce the campaign has been funded my Manufacturer will be given the green light to proceed, Pins will be made, it will take approximately three-four weeks to get them back, and at that point, I will be grading all of the pins for quality.  Rest assured, I'm happy with my Manu, and they have always given me excellent quality. \n\n\nBest wishes x Lauren",

  "There are many risks and challenges associated with starting a food business. The demand for MALK has greatly exceeded our expectations. We just launched MALK in June at a Farmer's Market in Houston and now in February, you can find MALK in several big box grocers and numerous coffee shops and convenient stores throughout Houston, Austin and Dallas. \r\n\r\nOne challenge we now face is meeting the demand for MALK. We are doing our best as a family owned and operated business, but due to the need to produce in larger quantities we have had to hold off on expansion and fulfilling every request . The time has come for MALK to grow. Once funded, we will be able to use this money to purchase the proper equipment and fill any order that comes our way.",
  "There are a lot of variables and challenges opening a bakery/cafe. One of the biggest challenges is location. We have scouted out several locations and we have done our research. We have found several locations where both the community and the cafe will benefit from opening it's doors. Our choice location is Rhinebeck, NY. Time is of the essences. which is why we decided to use Kickstarter. Our target date for opening is ASAP (yesterday).",

Our backup plan is to have the company continue operating even when competition sees the value in our products.  There will be two other divisions of PGI: 1) ERC Corporation which will test other companies products to ensure they are 100% free of harmful chemical to one part in billions and 2) offer  our brand of polymer called Pur-Olyn to companies that want to produce 100% chemical free plastic.\r\nAlternatively, we plan to expand our offering to the healthcare industry which will include items like blood bags, inspection devices, medicine containers and anything made of plastic that should not come in contact with the human or animal body.",

The goal of this project is to get not only our creative works to you, but to get us to you.  \r\n\r\nOnce the project is backed, the hang-ups are pretty simple.  \r\n\r\nThere's always a chance our car could break down on the road, or we get stuck in a snowstorm somewhere on the way.   Regardless. . .we will find a way to make it!!!  \r\n\r\nThe EP is what runs a little more risk.  We are working feverishly to finish the audio portion of the EP production process.

If you come to see us, you can pick up your copy AT THE SHOW!!\r\n\r\nIf you're not in the area, that's ok!   We will mail the prizes right to your door.  This may take a little bit of time, but it will get to you.  Our goal is to have everybody with the EP in hand as soon as possible.  We thank you for your support and want you to be happy!\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a digital copy of the EP, we would be happy to send it to you over the internet!  That way you can get your copy much faster.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to ask us any questions about the project!",
  "While Kickstarter is a wonderful vehicle for creating my first EP, there are always risks involved when it comes to musical endeavors. I'm confident that the risks and challenges will be at a minimum, but they cannot be avoided altogether. The biggest risk we face is time, simply because of how many steps there are to the recording process. Since this project is independent, we are not operating under any major time constraints. Should the process experience delay, it will just take a little extra patience. However, I will do my best to get all of your rewards to you in a timely fashion!",

  "What We Need & What You Get-\r\n\r\nHere's the thing, we cant finish Los Muertos without your help ! We need your support to bring the Lady of the Dead to life! We started filming Los Muertos originally named ICU in the late fall of 2013 and have 1/3 of our film completed (which you can see in our teaser). We created that with minimal funding and have been gaining interest and followers around the world. If passion were money, we'd be fully funded. But art imitates life, and damn it, things cost money! So... we need some. Our $85,000 target is not a lot by Hollywood standards, but it's still going to require many helping hands supporting us with small amounts. We know how hard we all work to make ends meet, so we would never want someone to pledge anything exorbitant. Give whatever you can and if you can't pledge, show us some love on social media! Every little bit helps. Because we cannot finish this film without you, the horror fans, getting involved. \r\n\r\nSocial media has opened so much opportunity and outreach, but we cannot do this alone. If we were able to reach 21,250 people around the world in support and ask them to skip buying just one $4.00 cup of Starbucks to contribute to our film, we would hit our target ! Sounds simple right? It's not. So we have to rely on those of you that do contribute to spread the word and help us motivate others. Nothing is more important than the word of mouth from you, THE HORROR FAN!          \r\n                                 \r\nYou have a powerful voice so please share our movie campaign with others, LIKE our FACEBOOK page and FOLLOW us on TWITTER! \r\n\r\nIn appreciation for you help, we have put together some cool perks for your contributions and will work on adding new ones as we go along, but please check out the ones we are offering now.\r\nThe Impact\r\nBig Hollywood studios are not the only ones that can make great movies. Help us prove that independents like us have earned a seat at the table. Ultimately, the only thing that matters is what you, the fans, think. If it wasn't for you, every movie out there that succeeded wouldn't have. You are the architects of popular culture not Big Studios. Let's take back our movies by making the movies we all wish to see!            \r\n\r\nRisks & Challenges\r\n\r\nOur target goal is entirely for full production costs and solely for the purpose of completing this film. Your contributions and support will help to make a new horror classic come to life! Every little bit helps, even your support in sharing our campaign by visiting our web page and also LIKING and FOLLOWING us on our social media platforms. So please spread the word about Los Muertos to everyone! \r\n\r\nWe will work hard to raise our goal within the next 45 days. All funds will be will be thoughtfully utilized in the best way possible and stretched to its limits.\r\nHow will the money be used?\r\n\r\nWe cant make this movie without a budget, PERIOD! \r\n\r\nWe have 5 areas to cover !!\r\n\r\n1.  30% - Our biggest chunk is obviously crew. We can't get these guys to do anything without waving a little green in front of their eyes. Bringing a KICKASS HORROR will take the efforts of our crew to wear many hats, go without sleep (thank God for coffee!), and effortlessly do what it takes to make this film happen! Our effects, set dressing, makeup/art departments are also in this category and without them we have no magic!!\r\n\r\n2.  25% - Editing is the next expense we will encounter. Since we will shy away from an all CGI platform, we have to depend on the look, feel and sound that a good movie needs. Editing, color correcting, audio and processing is a definite must we cannot skimp on!! \r\n\r\n3.  20% - ACTORS. What will we do without them? Not a damn thing!  Apparently, it's customary to pay and feed these folks? The nerve of some people huh? We need them and we need to feed and buy them ice cream daily. No, but we do have to pay for their skill and talent which brings characters and the story to life. We tried monopoly money, guess it didn't work!\r\n\r\n4.  15% - Seems we cant film like we would like to without permits. Go figure!        But we do need them as well as liability insurance and clearances which falls into this category. The support from local owners of specific locations and businesses for our shoot has been EXTREMELY overwhelming and we've been thrilled that they opened their doors to our production. This all adds to production value and authenticity. Of course location is everything and some do come with a price. So this, too, can be a challenge to consume all our budget. Do I smell favors cooking?\r\n\r\n5.  10% - And last but not least we have PUBLICITY. This little area is what we need to shout out to the media and world that we have arrived damn it ! Yes even social media costs money to be done strategically. Not only social platforms, but shows, festivals and events to promote also need funds. Your continued support in spreading the word about LOS MUERTOS will intensify our efforts even further.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a tremendous POSITIVE NOTE, we have been contacted for distribution already just with our teaser clip and we only have 1/3 of our movie completed. WE ARE JAZZED! HELP US FINISH IT !\r\n\r\nThe bottom line.\r\n\r\nNO sugar coating, just the straight facts. No matter how big or how small the film production company is, obstacles and challenges will arise. The key is to carefully plan a strategy to cover as many possible pitfalls in order to avoid them or correct them. This is why having a production team and mentors behind us with years of experience is priceless. We've helped ourselves even further by hiring really talented actors that have sharpened their craft and bring a wealth of additional support to the table.\r\n\r\nOne of a film's biggest challenges, after financing of course, is production scheduling for both actors and locations. Our writer specifically designed our story with a smaller cast because it allows for greater mobility, less expense and more freedom to adapt our shooting schedules due to availability and other unforeseen issues. The best way to avoid a problem is not to make one. You know, measure twice and cut once!\r\n\r\nBut seriously, we can't finish Los Muertos without actual legal tender and your HELP! So please make it rain... or shower, drizzle, or sprinkle. Even a trickle is immensely appreciated. \r\n\r\nWe will work our hardest to overcome every obstacle, but one of our biggest challenges is immediate -- raising all the financing required to make this film a reality. And this is where you all come in. Your support and word of mouth can make this film fully materialize!\r\nOther Ways You Can Help\r\n\r\nIf contibuting funds is not possible at this moment, there are other very valuable ways to help us out. Help spread the word and awareness about Los Muertos as much as possible. Social media is an amazing asset and you, the horror genre fans, have the power to make a difference.",

The PALM is new, but a working publication, and the goal is equal to our fixed expenses.  \r\n\r\nSummer in South Florida is a time when many businesses simply don't advertise and hunker down for our \"Off-season\", so funding the July issue will not only give us the experience we need to create a Crowd Funding issue, but it will help us get through the financial drought of the South Florida Summer.",

Although I am advertising an expected delivery date of Oct 2015, I am hoping to be able to ship even earlier than that.  I expect to be able to finish shooting and editing images by the end of July.  This will allow me to finish the design phase of the book in August and hopefully have the final version ready to ship in late August or early September.

  "Beyond the inherent risks of the music industry, this is a very low risk project logistically as far as we can tell. We cannot predict how the record will be received overall, but it's a piece of art we very strongly believe in. If it's something you believe in too, we're confident these funds will, at the very least, allow us to help put this record into the world and reach much further than it ever could otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe album is already recorded and basically ready to be released. We've done our homework. We've spent the past few months building a knowledgeable team of people to facilitate this release, and to reduce any foreseeable risk of the funds not achieving their full potential. \r\n\r\nWe have a publicist in place who is ready to begin promotion of the release of the album, a radio promoter on board, and release tour booked. We have a finished album and artwork ready for manufacturing, photographer in place ready to take beautiful photos, and a video artist ready to film and create. We've allowed ample time for executing all of these things prior to our Feb. 25 release date. We have every reason to believe that all of these elements can be accomplished competently and by the deadline of our release date, once they're paid for.",
  "I'm already in the studio working on the songs, so I expect to have it out by February, but sometimes making music seems to take longer than scheduled.

I'm super thankful for all of you that have grabbed the CD's in the past, or came out to shows, or recorded one of my songs for your own record. It's means a lot to me.

I don't need much, but I want to have some good equipment so it makes it more pleasurable for my viewers/audience. I just need some help if there is anybody willing to do that. There have been plenty of challenges in my history of filmmaking and if I were to tell them all to you, we'd be here a while.",
  "Permits may be a challenge, however, If things should arise , then my crew will simply remove any obstacle from the project. Seeing as though I plan on having only a small handful of people in this project, I do not see any of these issues arising.

We are also committed to contributing our own labor - sending emails, licking stamps, stuffing envelopes - to ensure the success of our marketing campaign.",
  "There are a few challenges and problems that I could encounter after this project is successfully funded. Here's how, when within my power, I plan to tackle them:\r\n\r\n\u2013 I could become ill when scheduled to record (I reckon I'll need my voice for that!) - a musician could too. This might delay things about a week or two, depending on when a recording slot is/becomes available for reschedule. I will wrap up warm this winter and try to stay healthy.\r\n\r\n\u2013 As this isn't a do-it-ALL-yourself album and I'll be working with artists, photographers and other musicians, they will have their own schedules too, so, again, there could be slight delays and reschedules here and there. I intend to get everything done before their actual deadlines to minimize the effect of these possible inconveniences.\r\n\r\n\u2013 When recording, mixing and mastering are done, and the artwork is complete, I'll be sending the master off to be replicated and printed, and the packaging to be printed with the artwork. There could be some delays in me receiving these CDs before I release the album, which is out of my hands, and it shouldn't delay the release by too much, if at all. However, if it should happen to affect the release, all that means is the album will hopefully be out in March instead of February.\r\n\r\n\u2013 I am going to be working leading up to and during the Christmas period, so... needless to say, that could definitely throw a spanner in the works. Again, I aim to skirt around this by trying to complete things before their scheduled deadlines.\r\n\r\n\u2013 I already know how exceptionally busy I am going to be from the start of this funding period in November, right the way through to February. The portraits I may be drawing for some of you may take a while... but you will get them!\r\n\r\n\u2013 I am doing this all independent of a label (I actually think this is a perfect opportunity to start my own), which - though I'm really looking forward to it - means there's a lot of work! I'll be labouring diligently in order to fulfil all the necessary tasks, reach the deadlines and get this album out there. Please be patient with me. Thankfully, I've got a bunch of really talented and supportive friends and family to help me with every aspect of this project, give me great advice and encouragement, and... make sure I get enough sleep.\r\n\r\n\u2013 I also cannot overstate how greatly I will need you too. As much as I believe in myself and believe in this album (which is so very much), my belief simply isn't enough - I need yours too. During the funding period, I'll be promoting the campaign and hoping that you'll all jump on board to help spread the word too. But also throughout this whole journey, from here to the very day you get your copies, I'll need your prayers, support and for you to keep me as motivated as you have done in the past. Thank you.",
  "As with any Kickstarter campaign, there is always the chance for delays in production and shipping. I have planned well ahead to give myself plenty of breathing room in the event of delays of complications.\n\nIn addition to this pin campaign, I am working on a large Tarot project through my Patreon as well as a full time Bachelor student. I will be using BackerKit and fulfillment services in order to ensure that neither this campaign nor my Patreon and school work will be negatively affected by the other.",
  "I feel confident about the realisation of the product; I've done a research about the aspects of the project: I've also choosen a pin manifacture, printing studio and the post office.

I'll make updates of every step on the further way.\n\nThe colors on the final pin may appear different than the mock-up designs. The apperance can also influenced by your monitor display settings. I've choosen the Pantone Chart for the colors and in addition black and white. But anyway the colors won't change radically.\n\nThere's always a risk of delayed production times, printing errors and shipment delays. I'll will be sure to keep everyone informed of all changes, if any issues come up.\n\nPlease note: Backers will be responsible for any import taxes of their country or custom fees. Please beware of that, before backing the project. \nThank you for your time and understanding!",
  "Rest assured that I have already done more than one pin before, I have my connections and know which manufacturers to trust and which to avoid. Very common risks in this type of project consists of shipping or manufacturer errors/delays.

  "Our first challenge is to find a suitable commissary kitchen to work from. If we had more funding we'd start our own kitchen but as a stepping stone we plan to rent space in an existing kitchen. We have several leads on kitchens already but so far these are all kitchens that have non-vegan food prepared there. While this is an acceptable plan B for us at this time, we would definitely to find a fully vegan kitchen such as partnering with an existing vegan restaurant that does not offer lunch service or has extra space.\r\n\r\nOur second challenge is logistics, setting up our delivery system. We're still determining whether we will hire our own delivery drivers or use a contracted service. We've contacted several existing delivery services and the challenge is most will only deliver orders received through their websites, whereas we plan to take orders off our own website and need those processed for delivery. \r\n\r\nOn the technical side we face the challenge of making a simple, easy to use interface for ordering. Our website is a Wordpress site with Woocommerce and it will take some custom programming to enable pre-ordering and scheduled deliveries.",
  "The only real risk here is missing out on helping me make the best pizza I've ever had.",
  "This project has been challenging because working with a great producer has added much travel and schedule juggling resulting in greater expense and less income as time has been given to travel and record.  Once this project is completed I am unclear with how to proceed but I am talking with seasoned recording artists and learning so much about how this differs from my experience as a Live performer only.  I do hope to tour the Pacific Northwest when the album is done and share what I believe God has given me.  I don't know who else needs to hear that life is full of unwelcome events and moments ~ but it does not change who God is and what He has in store for you.  I know He has shown me this.  Suffering is what this world offers.  Thank God this isn't all there is.  That's my message.  You can cry.  Then be glad.  In weakness - He is strong.  In tears - comes joy.  Thank You Jesus.",
  "As with any, especially creative project, there are risks and challenges. I have a great crew working to help me accomplish my goal of releasing my debut solo album, Maiden Voyage. But their could be unforeseen obstacles. Perhaps it will take longer to get each song exactly the way we want it. We may be counting on a certain musician to add a fiddle or accordian track, and they could have an emergency that would keep them from keeping their recording date.  Would we move ahead, and just lose the musical vision we had for that artist's contribution?  No, probably not.  We would work them into our schedule, and it could cause the record to be released later than we thought.\r\n\r\nThere could be problems with the actual physical production of the cd.  It could be delivered with technical flaws, and we would have to send it back to fix the problem. \r\n\r\nWe are fully committed to this albums release, and I believe the biggest risk would be that it would be ready later than we hoped.\r\n\r\nAs far as our incentives go, it could be a challenge to schedule your house concert or party at a time that works well for us both.  But as I said before, I am committed and determined to fulfill every promise, and we will find that perfect date for me to perform at your home or wherever you would like.  I am very much looking forward to this aspect of rewarding and thanking my backers for their support. \r\n\r\nThe money raised will go toward the hard costs of making the CD, and paying my marvelous musicians and production crew. And if  we exceed our goal, these dollars will go towards funding a tour to support the record, and for publicity and promotion.",

I will just have to see what level of interaction is required but I can see it bogging me down if I'm giving updates on Kickstarter, the Google documents, and the blog. I will play this by ear and will likely set a schedule for these things. I will maintain the blog updates, which are practically daily, but that's not feasible across the blog, Google docs, and the Kickstarter page. The Kickstarter page and Google docs will become more regulated and will likely be updated once or twice per week.",
  "Risks and challenges are few. There are lots of places that do CD duplication and production and they do great work. I've priced some local and national businesses and have narrowed the choices. I've got a great designer working on the album jacket and I've secured the rights to use a photo by renown photographer Art Shay on the cover. My hope is to keep duplication and production local; I like to keep my money close to home. In short, everyone on the \"team\" knows what they are doing and they've done it before, so the risks are minimal. If we make the goal, we'll have a record.",

However, there are a lot of moving parts with importing. Unplanned or unforeseeable events may delay shipment from our suppliers and in effect delaly delivery of your Crownby Program. \n2) Quality Control. This risk exists anytime a product is outsourced.

However, these pins are being manufactured for me - therefore the production process is outside of my control. Potentially we could hit delays if the manufacturer experiences any issues. Other small issues could be slight changes in linework or color.

We are focusing this year on films in a digital format to reduce the logistical risks involved with a 35mm format. We have also moved forward our close of programme date by one month. (we currently have 80% of feature films confirmed)\r\n2)\tFunding gap: We have started our funding campaign earlier than in previous editions, and of course, Kickstarter should help us fund the festival in advance.\r\n3)\tKey volunteer risk: We have established teams of at least 3 individuals in each key area, allowing us to react quickly if for some rason any member of the team needs to take a break",

Availability of our guest speakers.  We are still scheduling the line up of speakers and have not made any promises as to appearances.  However, we believe our roster of speakers from last year proves our ability to produce an array of stimulating speakers.\r\n\r\nThe major challenge is expanding the audience.  Being in our second year allows us to capitalize on our first year's publicity. In addition to that we plan to purchase ads in local newspapers, online media, and industry trades, and reach out to community and student groups.

We opened The Chromatic Dragon in 2015, and that was 10 times more precarious because of the liquor license.

We've already invested over $50,000 in the project to get this far and one of the things a successful Kickstarter will do, in addition to providing additional funding, obviously, is demonstrate to our investors that there is a market here in Savannah for the type of business that we have planned.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have nearly the perfect team for overcoming this obstacle.  People said a gamer pub would never work.  Not just any people, but people who have made their careers in the Savannah food & beverage industry.  They told us gamers wouldn't come out to a pub.  And they told us the ones who did would not spend any money.  They told us we needed to have ESPN and girls with bikini tops and basically the same thing every other bar has.  But we proved them wrong with The Chromatic Dragon and we want your help to do it again with 8-Bit Donuts.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would be remiss if we didn't mention the very real possibility that Cthulhu, the Great Old One, will awaken from his aeons-long slumber and drive the world into a long, dark age of madness.  But we feel like our team is ready for that challenge, as well.  After all, insane Cthulhu cultists need gourmet donuts and craft coffee, right?  And, with so many tentacles, Cthulhu would probably enjoy playing all of our arcade games at the same time!",
  "The good news is, the landlords accepted our offer for the lease! They were aware of our reputation and keen for us to have the tenancy. We've been going over our current figures and projections with a fine-tooth comb, ensuring our calculations and business plans are watertight to give the business as a whole the very best chance of succeeding in its aims.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to keeping our start up costs as low as possible, but are also aware that we will have to maintain the running of the Junction shop, in addition to recruiting and training new staff. Jon won\u2019t be as free to do as much of the work as last time. Therefore our labour costs will be higher.",
  "A lo largo de los a\u00f1os no hemos podido ser beneficiados por alg\u00fan programa cultural del Gobierno del Estado ni del Gobierno Federal, para nuestra asociaci\u00f3n es importante seguir difundiendo todos los valores humanos a trav\u00e9s del Cine.

  "Imprevisti possono sempre mettere a repentaglio la realizzazione di un evento come il Fantafestival, ma, considerati i nostri 37 anni di storia, siamo fiduciosi di essere in grado di affrontare qualsiasi evenienza dovesse accadere.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nUnforeseen events can always jeopardize something like Fantafestival, but, given our 37 years of history, we are confident we'll be able to overcome anything that should happens.",
  "Any expedition to remote parts of the world holds an array of risks and challenges. The two largest potential risks for this expedition will be weather concerns and the scarcity of animals in the region. I hope to create shots of multiple wild animals but there is no guarantee that I will find all the subjects I am looking for (polar bears and arctic foxes being some of the more challenging animals to photograph in their natural habitat). The same goes for the Aurora Borealis, another natural phenomena which hopefully will manifest during my time there. With two solid weeks out in the field I feel confident I will be able to meet both of these goals.  Barring any major equipment failures, I should bring back thousands of exposures resulting in a large array of images to choose from.",
  "I've been designing and manufacturing hard enamel pins for almost a year now and have yet to encounter any sort of challenge that wasn't easily overcome. However, this being my first keychain design, things might work a little differently, considering it's a new type of item. But I trust in my contacts with the manufacturer and I will do everything in my power to ensure that this product turns out the best that it can possibly be."
