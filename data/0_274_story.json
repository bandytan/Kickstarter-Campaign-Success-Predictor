  "Ademi Bar: Our Journey While looking back and thinking about where our journey started, we realized that the story of every entrepreneur and of every immigrant in the United States is very similar, it is the story of unimaginable hard work and never ending efforts to make it work. It was no different for us. Here we were in 2015, the newly immigrated and entrepreneurial just-married couple. I, Aizhan, think that this is where our journey had begun\u2026 Aidar thinks our journey started when we said NO to meat, but that is just a few months later, so let's not think about little differences but common points. It was 2015, when we started experimenting with food and trying out cooking for people. As new folks in town (country), we thought sharing food is the fastest way to find like minded friends which eventually turned out to be a good plan. Please note this for yourselves if any of you happen to move to a new place with no friends or family. We were cooking different sweets and snacks, sharing them with friends and neighbors. Then we started selling our creations at the farmers markets, pop up events and local stores here in San Francisco. You will be hearing this a lot throughout our Kickstarter campaign because we treasure all these moments very much and want you to see how much fun it can be - the cruelty free food, doing business and building your life from scratch. Being an entrepreneur by nature is not an easy thing. For us, being a true entrepreneur is finding one thing that motivates you so much that you are ready to put your whole life into it, as I said, not easy. But we were very lucky, we\u2019ve found that one thing that motivates both of us very much - the FOOD. The History Behind Ademi Bar We launched Ademi as a natural snack company back in 2016. We were influenced by traditional Indian treats like fruit based laddoos. We developed our own recipe and came up with a product Almond Date Bites. We worked on a label design, purchased packaging and obtained permission to sell at a local farmers\u2019 market. Although we tested out Almond Date Bites and a variety of other different products, the idea never really took off and as a result Ademi went into hibernation until February 2019. It was our family, friends and past customers who inspired us to design a new product. We went back to the drawing board but this time we wanted to make it right. We used the knowledge that was already gained and decided to try out a few of our recipes of plant-based protein bars.\u00a0 Some of them worked and some didn\u2019t. We had a fair share of triumphs and setbacks. But over time Ademi bars were selling out like hot cakes. People from different parts of town became frequent visitors to our tent at the farmers\u2019 market. We even started to deliver Ademi bars to local Bay Area marathon and triathlon clubs who were praising our bars and spreading the word. And of course we got some nice triathlon swag for free! That was the most precious, sweetest and coolest time. We experimented with different packaging too, because our original packaging was not strong enough, or couldn\u2019t hold the vacuum, or wasn\u2019t professional enough.\u00a0 This was all valuable feedback from our customers, which we listened to and followed. We always came back to our drawing board and re-designed, re-packaged and re-worked our bars. This kept us on our toes and prepared us for the next push. We outgrew the farmers\u2019 market and found a manufacturing partner who helped us to improve our recipes and introduced us to the world of professional packaging. With all new packaging and manufacturing support our capabilities became endless. We started selling Ademi bars on Amazon and to the local Bay Area shops and supermarkets. They quickly gained popularity on Amazon and in the Bay Area.\u00a0 At the same time we developed marketing and sales strategy and found more about our target customers. Our buyers like that Ademi bars are not overly sweet, large in size, great for digestion, high in dietary fiber and chickpea protein, low in ingredients list count and taste good. Ademi bars simply do their job! With our success in the last few months, it has become clear that we've outgrown the farmers\u2019 market. We have worked hard, but have sometimes really struggled to keep up with demand. Why does Ademi Bar need your help? The next step for Ademi bars to grow would be to offer more exciting flavors to a wider audience! The Ademi community is vast, filled with amazing customers who are extremely supportive of our product, our journey, and who share our passion for vegan life style. \u00a0We would LOVE your help and support as we try to bring and widen our passion in the US. We are hosting this Kickstarter campaign to help build brand recognition for Ademi bars and develop new and exciting flavors. While there are a handful of companies that are dedicated to the plant-based nutrition bar arena, we believe we are still early to market. Ademi Bars need your support because we want to make Ademi a part of a plant-based revolution. As a community we can change the way we eat, the way we treat each other and animals and the way we care for our nature. What will our backers get by contributing? You will get our many many thanks for supporting our small business and helping to bring our dreams to life!!! In terms of Kickstarter rewards, you have the options for the following depending on the reward level you choose: (Please see Rewards options; it's a top menu item on a mobile device, or it's on the right on the desktop version) What will our contribution bring to Ademi Bar: We\u2019ve designed two pilot flavors and manufactured beta batch of 5,000 chocolate sea salt Ademi bars, but need your help for the next step: What will be covered by Ademi: When will you start selling? We plan to start selling Ademi bars on November 5th, 2021! We will send updates to backers and post key updates on this page. Why now? We are deeply grateful to our customers and partners for their support and where this journey has brought us so far. The last couple of years have not been easy. Taking Ademi out of hibernation, searching for the right manufacturing partner, developing recipes and packaging design, establishing distribution network by pushing online and offline sales - it\u2019s been a tough play, especially during pandemic. During the last two years we have been able to get to know more local convenience store owners and coffee shop owners than we have ever known in our lifetime. Running a small business makes you get into the funniest situations like discovering that Ademi bars sell in good volumes at liquor stores and the saddest situations where some of our best distribution partners had to go out of business or risked to shut their doors for good due to pandemic. This provided us an opportunity to learn and open our minds. Support from our distribution partners and online customers have been inspiring us and providing much needed validation that Ademi bars can do the job. It is only when they keep calling us back and requesting more bars when the reality hits - OMG, Ademi Bars sell! The excitement, gratitude and faith in our mission and product make us want to push forward! Our distribution partners are waiting for us to develop and offer a wide variety of flavors with beautiful and shiny packaging so that they can start leveraging our renewed capabilities and put Ademi bars on the shelves to compete with other brands. Stores and distribution network partners pretty much sell the real estate in the form of shelves and they are keen on filling the shelves with the few brands that have multiple flavors to offer.\u00a0 This is how products like Ademi bars become noticeable by customers who search for their favorite flavors. We hope this will give Ademi bars a better opportunity to compete, fulfill our mission and expand. Let\u2019s unleash the full potential of Ademi Bar! We are still in the middle of a global pandemic, and the times are uncertain. But, it is what it is, we can\u2019t change it, we can only look forward, carry on and hope for the best. In these uncertain times, we are turning to you - our backers, for your help to get Ademi forward. We\u2019ve done all we could by sustaining Ademi with our savings and loans. What next for Ademi Bar? It is important to continue working and ensuring that growth is consistent. We have the product, mission, now we need to add more flavors, improve packaging, marketing and push offline and online sales. As long as we are in business and not hibernating, the momentum shouldn\u2019t be lost. It will be easier to improve profitability once sales are consistent and rising. We are also planning to control and manage our own supply chain, this way we can manage costs at every turn. What happens if this fundraising campaign fails to meet its goal? It is expensive to run an early stage nutritional food business. If we don\u2019t meet our funding goal, Ademi bars will not live on and we will have to shut down our business.",

Within weeks of adopting a Gluten free diet I started to see visible results. I wanted to go fully Plant-Based, but I never could because I couldn't replace my breakfast.

  "Shortly after the new year, I was notified that I was accepted into the Art Students League of NY's Residency at Vytlacil in Sparkill, NY and awarded a full scholarship to cover the costs of studio and housing for the month of June. I'm over-the-moon excited about this opportunity to submerge completely into my work for a full 4 weeks! I want to maximize this opportunity and the proximity to NYC's unique burlesque scene by bringing these performers into my studio. With this favorable time I shall observe and study each performer and their elaborate costumes from life, creating new works surpassing what I have accomplished to date. I plan to create multiple works during the residency, and am excited to announce those whom I am working with in the coming weeks! I am excited to work with the very top level of performers in the field. Among the list of performers working with me on this project is someone considered to be one of the single most important influences in that field today! The official lineup includes: Peekaboo Pointe, Delysia LaChatte, Amber Ray, and Dirty Martini! The vast majority of funds raised will be used to pay for the performer, model and costume costs for this project. The rest of the funds will be used to cover postproduction costs for posters and prints. In 2010 I started a series of paintings that focused on local Kansas City performers of various types; fire dancers, jugglers, singers, and burlesque artists. At first I saw this as a chance to explore the alter egos of people who develop an on-stage persona and live in a way that is free from the constraints of typical daily American life. Over time I found that something about burlesque resonated with me on a personal level. I began to see beyond performances and props and realized the underlying theme of women who live liberated from the status quo of a misogynistic society. The burlesque stage is a place where women (and men, straight, gay, queer, and transgender all equally welcome) are free to express their sexuality without shame, and without the need to pander to or protect themselves from male desires. Body positivity and self-expression are encouraged if not required, and feminist social commentaries are applauded rather than discounted. What a wonderful world! In my paintings, I seek to stir this feeling of power and freedom in the viewer, allowing them to vicariously experience the confidence, power, and abandon I've felt in the presence of these performers. Moreover, I present images of women as sexual subjects in a medium traditionally associated with respectability, making\u00a0a subtle statement not only about the social perception of the performers specifically, but about women's sexuality in general. As a thank you for supporting my goals during this residency, I will invite you to follow my progress via a secret blog where I will post exclusive photos, stories, and videos throughout the month of June and beyond! I also offer a variety of rewards including posters of some of my most popular paintings, Skype sessions, and original artwork. Finally, if you are as excited as I am about the opportunity to work with one of today's most celebrated burlesque figures, choose a poster, limited edition print, or heck, commission an original oil painting! \u00a0Although life as an artist comes with it\u2019s own set of hurdles and challenges; I have been fortunate to have experienced such intense and moving support from those within and outside the artist community. Knowing that there are people out there that appreciate my work keeps me going through both the challenges as well as the good times... I thank you most sincerely!",
  "In our society, many issues exist that people live with as part of their day to day lives. \u00a0Such issues include discrimination (race, gender, etc.) rape, sexual assault, abuse, bullying, poverty, body image, suicide, depression, and so many more. \u00a0As someone who was bullied for most of his schooling career, I feel very strongly about raising awareness of these many issues. This is a project I have wanted to do for years, but such a major undertaking is of course, very expensive. \u00a0To make this project a reality, I need more than just a single camera. \u00a0I need a studio so that I can mold my photos into what I want. Equipment, such as lights, video cameras, and other items are essential. Finally, it's necessary to hire models or pay to bring survivors to me so that they can be a part of this project. \u00a0This is no small idea.That's where you come in. \u00a0I have created a KickStarter page for this project. My goal is not just to do this for myself, but to raise awareness on a global scale. \u00a0But to do it, I need your help. \u00a0If you support this cause, know someone who is a survivor, or are one yourself, consider donating. Every donation will go towards making this a reality. \u00a0And if you'd be interested in working on this project, contact me! Together, we can improve awareness and the lives of people around the world. Photo credit - Angela Butler on Flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/angelamarybutler/5443734909/",

  "The Cult of Ammon is the story of Chuck and Brad, two naive college kids on a weekend getaway with their new girlfriends. The girls, Amelia and Cynthia, take them to their family\u2019s land deep in the woods for a sexy weekend of camping, drinking, and drugs. The guys start to realize too late, however, that they may have wandered into a dangerous situation. The film is inspired by the classic horror films of the 70\u2019s, exploring the ideas of the occult, nature worship, and human sacrifice. Centered on the traditions of hoodoo, it blurs the lines of what is real and what is a superstition. A homage to horror classics, it will blend the lines of frightening and funny.\u00a0 The Cult of Ammon is an ambitious project, so we're making sure our budget is as tight as can be. Primarily, a large portion of our funding will go to purchasing film, developing and scanning. Finding Aaton a-minima spools has been difficult, but we've sourced a steady supply in California. We're calling in a lot of favors when it comes to equipment rental. In addition to our film needs, a large portion of the budget will be going to our cast. Our crew is passionate about this project, and we are all volunteering our time to make it happen - but we feel feeding, housing and paying our actors is of the utmost importance. Happy actors means better filmmaking for everyone.\u00a0 We've been hard at work creating props and set pieces, and are now at a point to where we are on track to begin preliminary photography in early October. Though we'll be sad to see them go, we are happy some of the more iconic ones will go to a good home.\u00a0 \n We can't thank you enough for all the support, and we'll be sure to keep you updated on our progress. We are story-tellers who are determined to keep the art of film alive - and we think sharing our experiences is the best way to spread the knowledge. \u00a0",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQH2WJmB8CU Decisions is a short horror film from the creators of 'Meat' which is to be featured in the horror anthology series 'World of Death'. This is Johnny Saurette's second time directing.  He is the founder of Cannibal Fx special effects studio. Our team, which consists of Kristen Saurette-Brady and Leann Brady, is fully committed to bringing you an amazing movie experience but we need a little help from you. We are asking for a donation of $1,000 (total) which will go directly to the making of the movie.  The following is a cost analysis:   With the funding we already have from Still Rings True Productions we need: $450 for Special Effects- We are firm believers in practical effects. Cannibal FX will be doing all special effects work and it is a huge chunk of our funding goal but it will be well worth it in the end. $200 for camera equipment- We will be shooting all of Decisions on DSLRS which we own so production cost will be very low. The $200 will be for a boom mic and any unexpected repairs we need. $350 for editing and distribution- The remaining money will go directly to editing and distribution. We are renting a high powered desktop to do our editing on. We also plan on releasing the short on our website however we will be taking pre orders and will be selling our film on DVD along with our other shorts. We will be using any all and all of your contributions towards the film. ",
  "\u00a0Hullo there! My name is Emily, though I go by Leebobawitz on the internet (Etsy, Twitter, and Instagram). Earlier this year I launched the 'I Ship It!' Kickstarter, and together we brought over 15 pins to life and raised over $17,000. As I worked more and more on the project, I realized just how many tropes were still left and how many folks wanted. So, this sequel to the project brings together the top tropes from the last project's poll. \u00a0. These are the designs that were crafted with the guidance of the Draft-Room tier backers. I think they turned out pretty awesome, and they will be available to add on to your pledge! . Along with the monetary stretch goals, there are also social media stretch goals! Help spread the word and unlock additional goodies! After the success of four projects, I have learned a LOT about timetables. The following timeline is made based on the use of my tried-and-true production company. They have produced excellent quality pins and I feel very confident in their abilities to create my pins in a timely manner. This will hopefully make the timeline below a reality. July: August: Late August/Early September: --- My initial goal is to fund the 'A.U. AUTHORITY' pin and the 'I \u2764 FANFIC!' sticker. The goal covers the production of pin, packaging, Kickstarter fees, and shipping. The goal to achieve this is: $350. Here's the breakdown: PINs & STICKERs: 65-70% SHIPPING: 22-25% KICKSTARTER FEES: 8-10% Why the increase from the last project? I want to upgrade the production time, which would make the wait for the pins 50% shorter. It does, however, cost a bit more. Thus, the upgrade to the goals. Thank you for taking a look at my project, I hope that it made you smile and show your favorite tropes with pride! <3",

  "GREETINGS! \n\nHello Friends! Hope this finds you well, hunkering down, readying for winter\u2026 Thanks for checking out our Kickstarter page! First, a few facts about the Lonely Heartstring Band\u2026We met up through the American Roots Music program at Berklee College of Music in Boston. \u00a0For a gig in September of 2012 we were asked to play only Beatles' music--using bluegrass instrumentation. \u00a0From the first rehearsal, there was great chemistry, and we decided that we\u2019d take the band seriously and carry it beyond that gig (and beyond just the Beatles!). \u00a0Our inspiration ranges from bluegrass, old time, jazz, classical music, and more. \u00a0Since 2012, we\u2019ve been writing and arranging our music, exploring traditional music, and touring the continent. This past summer, we toured extensively from May until September, playing festivals on both coasts and in both Canada and the USA. Being our first tour, the band matured in a way that only tour can do, and we feel that we\u2019re ready to make our first record!\n\n WHAT?!\n\n With your support, the Lonely Heartstring Band will make the record of our dreams!  With a dozen songs ready to record\u2013 most of them originals \u2013 and a handful more just around the corner, we think that this January will be the right time to get into the studio. It\u2019s late November now, and we haven't booked any shows between now and mid-January so that we can completely focus on preparing to record. We\u2019re rehearsing almost every day, getting our material studio-ready, and with each day that passes, we\u2019re all a little more excited to get these songs recorded and into your stereos!\n\n WHERE?!\n\n We\u2019ve chosen the Great North Sound Society in Parsonsfield, Maine as our studio of choice for this record. It\u2019s a beautiful 18th century farmhouse converted into a remote, tucked-away, cell-reception-free (yesssss), live-in studio. It\u2019s been the studio-of-choice for some amazing sounding records (Josh Ritter, Lake Street Dive, Joy Kills Sorrow), and we\u2019ve booked ourselves a full week! It\u2019s got a large open main(e) room for all the bed tracks, and the rest of the house will serve as isolation booths for all the extra bits\u2026 not to mention sleeping spaces and tri-harmony-around-the-fireplace-zones. WHO?!\n\n We\u2019ve enlisted the masterful work of David Travers-Smith of Toronto, Ontario to come to Maine and engineer, produce, mix and master this record. He\u2019s worked with fabulous artists (Wailin\u2019 Jennys, Jayme Stone and many many more) and his knowledge of traditional, pop, vocal and new acoustic music makes him the ideal man for the job.  He\u2019s got a ton of experience, and he\u2019ll be coming down early to work some pre-production with us. He\u2019s an awesome guy, and we\u2019re really excited to be enlisting his help for this project.\n\n HOW?!\n\n We\u2019ve lined up everything we can to make this record the best it can possibly be, from David the producer, the studio, the material, the warm wool sweaters and the excitement\u2026 Our last big step is your support through this Kickstarter! So THANK YOU! We love you all. It would he a HUGE help to us if you could share our Kickstarter with your communities. We look forward with sharing our music with you, we couldn\u2019t do this without Your Help!!!\n Stay tuned for updates as we get closer to the release date!",

We are passionate about ingredients and read labels meticulously - Are these ingredients healthy? \u00a0Were they sourced and processed ethically? \u00a0Do any of them cause anxiety because we don't believe they should be in our food? Unfortunately, when it comes to convenience there are few choices in \u00a0non-allergen 100% whole-food, plant-based proteins, today we have few choices:\u00a0 We wanted more convenient, tasty and healthy options - and since, we've been on a mission to make lightly processed 100% whole-food plant-based meat alternatives that are delicious and accessible. \u00a0 We've spent years developing products diverse enough to satisfy the student population at ASU to the international tourists eating NexVeg\u2122 at our National Parks, like the Grand Canyon. Those regional opportunities validated our recipes and allowed us to build a small kitchen; where our purveying, processing and distribution systems have won 2 sustainability awards. \u00a0The next step, is getting NexVeg on your doorstep! Clearly it all starts with 100% whole foods and admittedly, our goal is to do as little processing as possible, as fast as possible. \u00a0 Our micro-batching process lets us choose the freshest ingredients that travel the fewest miles to our production kitchens. \u00a0We lightly process them into NexVeg varieties. \u00a0Then we distribute them utilizing GreenCell sustainable packaging materials, and the direct ground-based shipping services of FedEx\u00ae. We evaluate ingredients for the opportunity to be: We flash freeze and vacuum seal, retaining freshness and eliminating nutritional degradation caused by air or frostbite. We are asking you to take the next step with us toward eliminating animal agriculture by backing our award winning systems to serve more people. We know how hard it is to find out online what's really in your food. \u00a0We love sharing every little detail about what goes into NexVeg.\u00a0 Let's start with these USDA panels and some photos of the actual ingredients that we process into NexVeg. Remember, in order to maximize the quality and minimize the footprint we choose the freshest ingredients that travel the fewest miles to our production kitchens. \u00a0Here's what those fresh East / West ingredients look like, when they arrive at our kitchens. In fact, we take our ingredients even a bit more seriously than that:\u00a0 1) It's delicious. \u00a0We've tested more than 208 recipes and served 1,000,000 portions to get to our 3 current product lines and 6 flavor profiles. 2) It's healthy. \u00a0Whole food diets are medically proven to lower risk of heart disease and control weight gain.\u00a0 3) It's sustainable. \u00a0Lightly processing whole foods consumes less water, produces less carbon and \u00a0creates less food waste than heavy processing of plants or raising animals. 4) It's easy. \u00a0NexVeg is formable like ground meat and cooks fast in a skillet or the oven. \u00a0It is great for bulk prep and can be plated hot or cold. \u00a0There's a variety worthy of replacing the meat in your favorite comfort foods no matter the cuisine. Whether you love the performance protein in the NexVeg Hemp & Seed line or the intense sustainable and healthy eating ethos of NexVeg Tepary, or the comforting familiarity of \u00a0Black Beans, there's a NexVeg product for you:\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps you've seen \"The Game Changers\" , \"What the Health\", \"Plant Pure Nation\", etc... or otherwise learned through your or other's personal experiences; but if your looking for more reasons here's some solid health and sustainability science we find meaningful : \u00a0Hello! My name is Jonathan Netzky. I\u2019m passionate about local, fresh, whole foods and the health and sustainability benefits they provide.\u00a0 Over the last 15 years, I have made farm-to-table dining possible and meaningful beyond my own home. We are now ready to close a gap in the plant-based protein market with a locally-sourced, farmer's market quality, whole-food protein option - that everyone can enjoy! Leading industry chefs have served NexVeg\u2122 products in their restaurants and helped us hone our recipes based on customer feedback. Now, with your backing, we can provide nationwide, direct-to-consumer access to healthy and delicious plant-pure proteins. Ready to join us in this mission? - sharing real food, feeding the change!

  "\u00a0I'm here at it again with some original enamel pin designs as well as fan designs! I started making pins back in late 2018 and my collection has just grown so much thanks to the support found on here and on my other platforms! This time will be a collection of chain enamel pins to add to my hoard of pins! This is a project that needs a much higher capital of funding. So here I am! In spite of this horrible start of the year with the global crisis. I'm going to keep my head up and stay strong making more pins in support and in long term goals. This world COVID has definitely hit myself and a lot of artists down to the ground. Now with the new update mid month, of how our POC are being disgraced and shamed, now more than ever, we need to support them and take care of each other. No matter what, thank you always for the encouragement and please continue to support other artists, communities, and our people. I've learned my lesson in multiple areas in terms of growth in design and making this process much smoother and with even more precaution than before. I will continue to grow and expand my collection beyond even what I have now.\u00a0 \u2727 [ All Large Pins are to be ~38-40mm with Backing Posts x2 ] [ All Small Pins are to be ~28-32mm with Backing Posts x1 ] [Chains will measure at 6-12 cm depending on the design ] \u00a0...\u2726 . .

  "I\u2019m Dr\u00e9 of PintasticPH. This is my first project or campaign on Kickstarter and hopefully I\u2019ll reach the goal to make this project a success. This project is inspired by Taylor Swift\u2019s latest album \u201cLover\u201d. I have already produced one design \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d and out on my Etsy Store. The initial goal of this campaign ($350) is for the Lover Pin. Once the campaign ends and reaches its goal that\u2019s only time where Kickstarter charges you. Then we will send you a survey for you to choose which pin/s you like and also to collect shipping address.\u00a0If the campaign is not successful, you will \u00a0not be charged. During the campaign, these pins will be sold at a discounted price ($8 - $49 USD, if you\u2019re Early Bird). Pins will be sold on a regular price after the campaign ($12/pin USD). This collection features six (6) songs on the album: Pins will have: Timeline: REMINDER AND DISCLAIMER: I am shipping from Manila, Philippines. Pins will probably get to you around September or earlier (Depends on the production of pins). All pins will be sent as registered airmail. Average shipping time is as follows: \u26a0\ufe0f Backers are responsible for any customs fees their country may ask for. I would highly appreciate if you will share this campaign to your friends or on any of your social media. Disclaimer: This is not official a merchandise of Taylor Swift.

  "My name is Francesca Chaney, I am a 23-year old restauranteur and tastemaker. On August 15, 2015 I launched \"Sol Sips\". Originally this concept started as a way to encourage myself and my community to consume more fruits and veggies for more energy and healthier living. I'd wake up early on the weekends and make drinks to sell at my cousin's apothecary in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. At the time, I was also a full- time student at Brooklyn College, a doula and a nanny, As a nineteen year old, I did not have all the answers, but I did know a few things- 1) I'm passionate about curating accessible \"feel good\" experiences for my community, 2) I want to further develop my \"Sol Sips\" concept. After a couple years of doing pop-ups, drafting business plans and receiving feedback from mentors and family, an opportunity for a three month brick and mortar pop up fell into my lap via Craigslist. On December 2017 we opened \"Sol Sips Vegan Bevs and Bites\" in Bushwick, NY with the intention of staying for three months to test the waters. At the end of our three month test run our customers and the landlord of the space encouraged us to find a way to permanently stay. At the time it seemed unpromising to jump into owning and operating a restaurant as a 21-year old while finding the funds to do so. \u00a0I decided to go for it and launched a $50,000 crowd-funder, in addition to a family/friends round of funding. We didn't reach our goal of $50,000- instead we raised $5,000 and my family and friends raised $15,000. Although I didn't reach the goal- I was determined to make it work. Now almost two years later we are here and still standing. \u00a0 The passion and care that we put into our food is evident. We need support with gathering the final resources to open the doors of \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\", our new location in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, NY. This is a refreshing opportunity that would allow us to serve more people, expand our menu and incorporate the elements of fellowship that love so much. This includes live music, dj sets, art, storytelling and most important- a brave and comfortable space for black/poc people and families to commune and be nourished.\u00a0 The inclusivity of this upcoming space is what we are most excited about. We've witnessed the power of accessible wellness and community here in our current location of \u00a0300sq ft. In February of 2018 we introduced out \"Sliding Scale Brunch\", encouraging people from all walks of life to test the waters of plant based food in an affordable manner. They are given the option to pay what they can, based on what they can afford. Our commitment to giving everyone the access to eating healthy is what drives us. It is also what drives our customers to continue communing with us.\u00a0 Sustaining our customer base and the rising volume of our orders in our current Bushwick location is causing the inevitable discomforts of growth which effects the customer experience and also makes it difficult for us to further evolve. We are evolving from the cramped space of our current \"Sol Sips Bevs and Bites\" location- where customers often bump shoulders in this 9-seat space. Our tiny and beautiful space has served as our restaurant/cafe hybrid for nearly two years, we've truly learned the power of \"working with what we've got\". At last, we'll be able to scale it back down to a cafe space where dinners can come in for a quick beverage and bite that can be accommodated with \u00a0the tools and resources we have here in the space.\u00a0 \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" is a larger space that will provide more comfort to our dinners. We encourage our guests to stay for a while and take up space. We are excited to see people bring their friends and family along to enjoy great food, service and a good time!\u00a0 Click below to learn more about our vision for \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" in New York Times' T-Magazine below.\u00a0 Article by Wilbert Cooper\u00a0 We've already invested a lot into our new space and we'll continue to work towards reaching our funding goals. We're confident that this Kickstarter will support us in opening \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" this fall. We are currently training a solid team of staff and working with an amazing architect to complete our design plan of a full-service dinning room, bar and stage. We've started collaborating with artists and musicians who are excited about curating residencies in the space that coincides with our dining experiences. We've even developed a unique and intentional menu that centers afro-indigenous and black southern cuisines with just plants- making most of our menu soy-free and gluten-free.\u00a0 Meeting our goal of $250,000 will enable us to:\u00a0 I've built Sol Sips from scratch- but not alone. Every step of the way I've been met with the support of my \"village\" of family, friends, mentors, community, organizations, allies and strangers. For this, I am grateful. \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" will reflect the power of gathering by providing vitality, love and innovation in every taste, scent, sight and sound.\u00a0 We look forward to sharing space and fellowship with you.\u00a0 Much Gratitude.\u00a0",
  "I\u2019m Greg, I\u2019m the typical \u2018\u2019average italian\u2019\u2019 born and raised between football and tasty food. I spent most of my 20s locked in my room until, five years ago, I decided to give a twist to my life by changing completely my daily routine: sport and healthy food replaced videogames and junk food. It\u2019s been a long time since I got over this negative part of my life and, today, I\u2019m ready to live a better part of it and to put myself out there, focusing everything on healthy food. Cados was born, at least as a concept, circa a year ago; since then my idea has changed many times until becoming the actual one which shares the same aim as the original one, even though it\u2019s a lot different: producing high quality avocado snacks and selling them at an affordable price. To do so I\u2019m going to use an atypical internal politcs, that uses quality and a good price as it\u2019s ONLY advertisement; I wanted, for the same reason, to limit as reasonably as possible the net gain on the finished product (keeping it around 5%) to promote an higher quality/price ratio. The products available at the launch of Cados will be 2: \u00b7 AVOCADO CHIPS: simple avocado chips, ready to be devoured at any time. \u00b7 AVOCUDDLE: the perfect synthesis between the classic potato chips bag and avocado. Despite having in mind 3 new types of snacks I believe, at the current state, that only these are suitable for marketing but it\u2019s also possible that, until January 2020, on the official e-shop some of these could already be available. I want to be very trasparent so, below, I left you a short but complete list of how funds raised through this campaign will be used, with the relative percentages: \u00b7 FIRST STOCK OF RAW MATERIALS (70%) \u00b7 PROFESSIONAL EQUIPMENT (15%) \u00b7 E-SHOP (15%) \u00b7 BETTER PRINTS* \u00b7 FIRST AVOCADO PLANTATION* Those maked with * are additional costs that I consider useful to make the product more attractive and/or to further reduce the price but that I didn\u2019t include in the requested amount and which I would take care just if it were exceeded. I would personally thank whoever decided to believe in my project but, for obvious reason, I can\u2019t do that; i do want to let you know that your support was very important to me, and this is the reason why I wanted to divide the rewards in 3 levels in order to include as many people as possible: \u00b7 HIGH FIVE (5+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 5% discount. \u00b7 TASTE TEST (50+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 10% discount + 1x Avocado chips + 1x Avocuddle. \u00b7 AVOCADO LOVER (100+): LIFETIME access to all the products, current and future, with 15% discount + 1x Avocado chips + 1x Avocuddle + 1x Special Gratefull Avocado. The rewards will be shipped from January 2020 but I don\u2019t exclude a priori the possibility of some anticipation or short delay.",
  "We are two humans who met at the perfect time and since the day we met we have done nothing but grow stronger as individuals and even stronger as a unit. We are Hayley 32 years of age and Joakim 31 years of age and we recently moved a little deeper, but not deep enough into the woods in the centre of Sweden. We met over a shared interest of psychedelics and especially the healing benifits that they have on human beings, we were both very responsible users, something we bonded over and we both have \"magic mushrooms\" to thank for curing f.ex severe migrane and psychedelics in general have helped us both grow a lot. We wanted to show our growth in some way, we wanted to show how the whole world could benefit from the responsible use of psychedelics. So we started with our project \"Hippy Spirit Clothing\" 2.5 years ago and we have slowly watched it grow into something we are very proud of, and we have grown along with Hippy Spirit, a lot as well. The idea for Vegan EVERYTHING came, just like with our clothing brand, from us and the way we choose to live. Today our conscious green eating makes us both feel amazing and cooking and experimenting with food has been a passion since early teenage years, and has become even more fun since turning vegan! :) Healthy, good tasting vegan food is exensive if you eat out today and it seems like everyone wants to put a \"healthy-tax\" on everything and it is really not fair for the ones who really cares about what they eat and needs something quick on the go. We want to change that. We will sell something that we are surprised that we have never seen any food truck our fast food place sell in Sweden and the thing is, we really dont want to say it yet, because we fear someone with the money to start tomorrow will come in and do this before us, this is how much we believe in this idea. As we go we will add a lot, like green smoothies, smoothie bowls, raw balls, avocado on toast, golden milk, chai tea, vegan ice-cream, the list can be made so long, jummy and healthy! Everything vegan of course! Vegan EVERYTHING is so much more than a food truck, it is more of a movement and together with the clothing we design and the music we produce and the art that we make we try in our little way to open up as many hearts and third-eyes as possible! :) And it all start with a healthy diet! You truly are what you eat! :) Chosing to work for yourself is hard, but once you are there it is out of the question to go back to work for someone else. No matter how hard it is, we will not give up! We work every single day to come up with new designs, new content, new music to increase sales to eventually pay for this huge addition to our lives, our Vegan EVERYTHING. food truck idea, but it is going way to slow and we are in the best time ever to start. We have come a long way planning all of this, but we are still basically on step one with all of this since we can not afford to buy the truck or the kitchen that it has to have inside, everything around the whole project is basically done, we have events to go to many places in Sweden, this is events we have spoken to as well as events who has contacted us. Many of these events do not have any vegan food at the moment, so we see a huge opportunity there, with well over 10.000 visitors on an average day. We also want to sell at bigger events in other countries in the summers, this is huge music events where we would fit in perfectly but stick out with our food! *and clothing* We are asking for help so that we have a chance to open up our business before someone else does it and we would hope to raise 200.000sek to make this dream come true. The cost of the van will be the biggest expence, then it might have to be re-built with ventilation and then it needs a working kitchen. Roughly counted this will cost somewhere between 150-200.000sek. We would be forever thankful if we would get help with this project, it is exactly what we are meant to do and we have such big plans for the future and we believe in this so extremely much, we are in the right time with everything and this is not just a job for us, this van will become a part of our lifestyle! Thank you so much! Hayley and Joakim",
  "UPDATE 3- NEW STRETCH GOAL $11,500. Well we made it over our goal of $9500, and then we made it over our first stretch goal of $10000 to add an extra week and location. Now let's try for $11500 and add another week and another place! We can do it!  UPDATE 2- 15% TO ONLINE STORE FOR ALL BACKERS. As a thank you, all of my wonderful backers of this project will receive 15% off in my online store once it goes live (early January). The store will be offering prints and original art, as well as greeting cards and more. Thank you all so much. UPDATE 1- Now that the project has reached it's initial funding goal. Some of you may be wondering what happens with the extra money? Well extra money will go to incidentals on the trip, and if we make it $500 over the goal then I'll add another week with at least 1 city into the trip. REACHED! My name is Jessica, and I\u2019m a fine artist and illustrator living in San Francisco, and I'd like you to join me on a painted exploration through Europe. \nI do many types of art, but one of my favorite things to do is to go out and paint and sketch on location, typically known as 'Plein Air'. For me this is a great way  to see my city in a new way and then to turn around and share it with others. That's what I especially love about making things, is sharing them with people. \n When I was in high school I was lucky enough to go on a trip to Rome, Florence, and Paris. To say that I had a blast would be an understatement, I got to eat new things, interact with people who didn't speak the same language, and see all of these places that were not only beyond beautiful but steeped in history. And that's what did it for me, how amazing everything looked. I still remember winding through these narrow shadowed cobbled streets in Florence that all of a sudden opened up into the Piazza della Signoria. The famous David and the Medici Bank where now towering over my  right shoulder, while a line of marble statues twisted and writhed to my left,  the Tuscan sun played off the stone of the Piazza and the water of Neptune's fountain, all the while the lure of \"Italy's best gelato\" called from across the square. From that moment on I knew I wanted to keep traveling, and when I decided to pursue art as a career, that I wanted to share my experiences through painting what I saw on my travels. \n\n\u00a0 So that's what brings me here today. I would like your help to take a month and paint my way through Italy, France, and Spain creating paintings and sketches of the beautiful and interesting things I see on my trip. I plan to fly out in early May of 2015 landing in Naples, Italy, then head to Florence, Venice, and Milan. Next up Southern France starting in Annecy, then on to Moustiers-Sainte-Marie, and Pezenas. Lastly head to Spain with stops in Barcelona, Albarracin, and Madrid. To keep costs down I would fly back home out of Porto, Portugal.\u00a0 During this month, I will blog daily about my art and my adventures. Anyone who contributes to my campaign, and should it be funded, will be able to follow this blog and read more as soon as each post is published! My schedule will be simple: two consecutive days of art, a day for travel time and location scouting, repeat. My hope is to paint two acrylic paintings and one watercolor each day. Once back home, I will work on prints, wallpapers, and shipping the original artwork to backers in the qualifying pledge categories. Please note the large canvas paintings will take longer to ship as they will be completed upon return. All of the money raised from this Kickstarter will go to helping to pay for everything, from the plane flights, food and lodging, to art supplies, train and bus tickets, and shipping costs to get everything to my backers after I get back home.\u00a0 Travel: plane flights $1200 each way. Month long train pass $850. \u00a0Buses and the occasional taxi\u00a0$250. Coming to $3500 Lodging through Air B&B and food will run about $100/day coming to $3000. Art supplies: New lightweight durable easel (mine is super heavy, clunky, and will not survive baggage handling) $250. Paint and canvas panels $250. Fine art printing $400. Coming to $900. Shipping: Boxes $300. Shipping $1000. Coming to $1300.\u00a0 Subtotal- $8700 Adding taxes, Kickstarter, and credit card fees I'll need you help to raise $9500 for this trip. Thank you so much for taking the time to explore my Kickstarter campaign, and remember to please share on social media.\u00a0 \u00a0Ciao! Au revoir! Adios!

  "It is very challenging to market art, and to try to sell a piece of your heart and soul to the world. Artists often feel forced to be a jack of all trades, while sometimes sacrificing our more personal artistic inspirations. I've learned throughout the years that the business side of the art world is a vital aspect, and unfortunately the creative side is another entirely. I've also learned, that I am not good at doing both simultaneously, which has led me to this idea of going public with a plea for help. I believe this is a breakout year for me as an artist. I've been an art teacher for almost 20 years, and the inspiration I get from my students is astounding. I hope to inspire and make my students proud. I've earned the opportunity to show at Spectrum Miami during Miami's art week. It's the push I needed to have the courage to put myself and my art work out there for the world to see... To broaden my horizons and do what I was put on this earth to do.\u00a0 I hope that by connecting with art collectors, gallery directors and art institutions and by finally being able to share my labor of love with the world, my art will have a greater purpose. If this endeavor is successful, it will provide the catapult for me to be able to support philanthropic art entities, such as \"Artists for a Cause\" and \"Women Supporting the Arts\" in the future.\u00a0 Although the opportunity is outstanding, as a teacher, funding it on my own is nearly impossible.\u00a0Please join me and Team MGMoriginals in helping me reach my goals!

  "Eight Bit Magazine celebrate early eight bit microcomputers from the 1970's to the early 90's. While most publications cover only the gaming aspect of such computers we want to cover the hardware and programming side of things as well. After a successful Issue 1 and Issue 2 Kickstarter campaigns we are delighted to offer even more in Issue 3. You will get a full colour, A5 size, 68 page printed magazine full of great articles written by people with a wealth of knowledge and passion for those computers. Expect programming, technical and gaming articles for the Apple II, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Sinclair Spectrum, Atari 8-bit and more!  Everything 8 bit from games to programming to hardware projects to enhance your enjoyment of those eight bit wonders. The goal of the magazine is to create the excitement of computer magazines of the 80's and early 90's, both gaming and otherwise. A part of the excitement is holding a proper magazine in your hand unlike reading online where something is lost. We have a number of people involved in this kickstarter project and the plan is to get more on-board for future issues. We want to create a community of eight bit enthusiasts writing for the magazine coming up with articles we haven't even thought of yet. Sample of the articles in Issue 3: The Collectors Guide to the Amstrad CPC 464.The Apple Adventurer (Adventure games on the Apple II)Hacking for Infinite Lives.Retropie: Emulating the 8-bits.Pond Software Feature.Second part of Programming Sprites for the C64 and CPC.Upcoming games and hardware to be released in 2017.Many game reviews as well as interviews and technical articles.\u00a0 \u00a0 Why such a low Kickstarter goal?\u00a0 \u00a0After the success of issue 1 the low Kickstarter goal is all we need to guarantee at least another 12 issues of 8-bit.

  "\"WAKE\" is a short horror film surrounding Alan Young, a hotshot inventor whose just made history as he's invented the world's first intuitively immersive virtual reality machine, allowing it's users to see and experience their most inner desires and fantasies, from both the past and present. The break through brings Alan fame and fortune, but not without cost. An inexplicable and horrific \"glitch\" in the machine is causing a\u00a0malfunction, instead\u00a0trapping Alan inside his worst nightmares. The glitch has pushed the revolutionary machine's total completion back months--causing the pressure of finishing it to rise from his impatient investors, declining reputation and credibility, and most importantly...his crumbling marriage. With his back against the wall, Alan is forced to take the dangerous risk of attempting to fix the problem from the inside, and confront horrific projections of his inner most fears and failures...with the antagonizing, shape-shifting glitch lurking around every corner... The film was shot in March 2015, and we need your help to pay back the numerous costs of production, as well as post-production and festival submissions. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meet the Crew Erich Westfield (Director/Producer/Writer)-- Erich is a graduating senior Television-Radio major at Ithaca College with a minor in Theater Arts.

We want to enter as many horror film festivals as possible, and those costs can add up.\u00a0",
  "English below Jag har en vision om att starta och driva en verksamhet med fokus p\u00e5 h\u00e5llbarhet, m\u00e4nskliga m\u00f6ten och en levande f\u00f6rort.

English It all started when one of the other regulars at my favorite caf\u00e9 had an idea to open a coffice in the neighbourhood. We discussed the idea, and I was thrilled about it. Pretty soon, I got the blessing to take the idea and run with it. Through meetings and input from friends and enthusiasts, the whole thing grew into something bigger. I then found a fantastic place in Bandhagen, south of Stockholm. My vision is to continue to develop the original idea and together with other people make this a venue for creation, our contribution to make this an even more alive neighbourhood. In short, I would like to create something in between a caf\u00e9 and a coffice. A place that is calm and encourages you to be creative and a possibility to connect with people nearby.\u00a0 Who are we? \u00a0 I am Nina, the founder of this business. I love animals, prefer to eat fruits and I am studying knitting at a Folkh\u00f6gskola.\u00a0 Zaphira is a friend of mine and somewhere along the line she got involved. She is a colourful person with a lot of energy who loves cats and is passionate about equality.\u00a0Zaphira contributes with thoughts, ideas and a lot of positive energy and is now an important person for the startup.\u00a0 What do we want?\u00a0 Create a plant based caf\u00e9 with a peaceful atmosphere perfect for those who want to work outside the office but still want to leave the house. A place where you could make new contacts and find nice people to cooperate with. We will also offer breakfast, snacks and picnic baskets to take away for those of you who just pass by.\u00a0 Beyond the daily business with food and coffee we will also arrange events with focus on culture, creating and craftsmanship, both on our own and together with different organisations, all with the purpose to contribute to a living suburb. It's also possible to rent our conference room (during opening hours) or the whole place (when the cafe is closed).\u00a0 When and how?\u00a0 We will access the place on the first of August. There are renovations that has to be done, along with some cleaning and freshening things up before we can open the doors on the ninth of september (hopefully).\u00a0 The money?\u00a0 We need money to renovate the place. We need to buy refrigerators, freezers, dishwasher, an oven and a stove. We also need to hire a plumber and probably also an electrician.\u00a0 We believe in creating together\u00a0 This idea has grown and developed thanks to the ideas and creativity from people around us. We want this project to grow further and are looking forward to see it in action. \u00a0 The food\u00a0 We like a lot of different tastes from all over the world. We plan to cater lunch from our favourite vegan kitchen but will make breakfast, fika and snacks ourselves. We will adjust the food according to season and do our best to not let any food go to waste.\u00a0 We both eat plant based food and are passionate about animals and the environment so it all felt obvious. All of our food and drinks will be plant based but our customers are welcome regardless their own food preferences. \u00a0We like to experiment with taste and texture and to challenge the picture of what vegan food should be. Even guests on four legs is warmly welcome!\u00a0",
  "Hello, we are The Odd Folk, a quintet of ramshackle musicians from the far west of Cornwall (although our drummers a Grimsby man with Cornish adoption pending!) We play folk music and we have always been a little odd. We use ironing boards as keyboard stands, branches as mic stands and all pile into an old Renault 4 and drive around the country playing music and getting lost. We're been carrying our debut album, The Sweet Release, around with us for the last couple of years and as well as most of our friends and fans having a copy we're actually running very low on stock! We've long been scratching our heads on how on earth we were going to fund another 'baby' when we stumbled on this sweet medium! We're so pleased to be able to offer rewards to our fans as a way of saying thank you, and all of the prizes will be created with as much love as we can muster.We are really honoured to be able to work with Andy Bell, a sound engineer with a CV as long as your leg; who's worked with many greats from the folk circuit including Bellowhead, Eliza Carthy and Seasick Steve to namedrop but a few! Being a mobile sound engineer ables him to travel wherever we want him, and so we're choosing Belan Hall, an old shooting lodge in the middle of Wales, where we sometimes go to rehearse and have creative lockdown. We will also be working closely with our designer, Mae Voogd, to make the album cover and all the posters and T-Shirts to go with it. She's drawn the band\u00a0a number of times but one of the rewards is for you to join us on the launch poster as well as get your portrait drawn! All you'll have to do is submit a photo and you can hop onto the page with us. The T-Shirts will also be designed by Mae Voogd and for this reward you will need to submit your size preference and colour preference. The figure we are after is \u00a35000, which seems like a lot of money but in reality is just about scraping the barrel. And no, we're not going to do a runner to The Caribbean! The list below will give you an idea of what we need and what's involved in making an album. The Sound Man - this is the main component, this includes all tracking, editing, mixing and producing of the album! The Duplication - this is the where we get numbers, for instance 1000 copies to be released. The Design - this involves all the album artwork, storyboarding the sleeves and booklets, and drawing up the posters. T-Shirts - for your new frocks! Photographs - for your mantlepieces! Postage and Packaging - wherever you are the postman will come and deliver your rewards to you! We look forward to working with you!

  "Country music fans, meet The Justin Alan Black Band. Today, the band calls Nashville home, but these three life long friends from Georgia started writing and playing music together as teenagers. Currently in the studio recording their debut country album, the band says the new songs are inspired from a place they all know so well, home. \u201cNo matter where I go, Georgia\u2019s home to me.\u201d\n-from the song \u201cGeorgia\u201d, featured on the band\u2019s new album. After months of writing and focusing the band\u2019s sound, The Justin Alan Black Band entered Cherry Box Studios in Nashville to begin recording their debut in country music. \u201cThis has been a long time coming.\u201d, says Josh, who plays mandolin and banjo with the group. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard and are proud to see this all come together.\u201d\u00a0 The band is raising the funds needed to finish the record through a Kickstarter campaign and social media promotions this fall. \u201cOur families, friends, and our fans\n have always been so supportive.\u201d says Mic, guitarist. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making music together all our lives and they\u2019ve been there every step of the way.\u201d \u00a0With the release of their first album this fall and an extensive tour planned for the spring and summer of 2015, it\u2019s safe to say that \u201cHome\u201d is the one place the band won\u2019t be seeing very much of in the coming year. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy being away from your family.\u201d says Patrick, the band\u2019s lead singer. \u201cThey never leave my mind, they\u2019re in the songs, and they\u2019re the reason we do what we do.\u201d Patrick went on to say, \u201cThese guys are like my brothers, we\u2019re family.

  "If questions and curiosity prompted The Sun Flights to leave\non their nine month musical adventure around the country, then it\u2019s only to be\nassumed that greater questions and curiosity remain. We returned with no\nanswers whatsoever. But we did write House\nof Man, a nine song album. I don\u2019t think any of our songs pinpoint a specific experience\nor moment during our travels. In fact, many of the songs were written in a few\ndifferent places and over a period of a couple months. However, they are based\non emotions, imagery and stories from around this country.House\nof Man is a reflection of the time we live in, which is a reflection of the\ntimes we come from, all of which will determine where we are going. We, as\nmankind. There is critique in this album but it comes from a place of\nlove and hope. The generosity shown to us during our travels, the hardships and\nstrength of the people we met, the landscapes we encountered are so vast, so\nindescribable that we know House of Man\nis a small perspective. But it is what we have. We\u2019re looking forward to recording this album at The Spice\nHouse. A beautiful, recording studio in Fishtown, built out of wood from an old\nLancaster barn. We knew we would record there when we walked in to the smell of\nwood, the tall ceilings and a conversation about the very sound we\u2019ve spent\nfour years sculpting. We hope to have this album recorded and ready to share by\nearly 2015.",
  "Emma, a college student with a crippling fear of clowns, must come face to face with her worst fear when a clown that has been terrorizing the town promises to kill her. This clown gives a balloon to each his victims with the exact time and date he's going to kill them written on it. After\u00a0receiving one herself,\u00a0Emma realizes that she has two days left to live, and\u00a0must fight against the clock to find a way to survive. The film is based on a short film we did called The Clown Statue (based on my favorite urban legend!)\u00a0that has since gained a cult following online and has won awards at film festivals nationwide! For this movie, I've pulled inspiration from every corner of the horror genre, which I am a huge fan of! It would best be described as a haunted house/creature feature hybrid. I had someone describe it as an \"Americana nightmare\" and an \"electric circus\". Which I LOVE, and I think describes the film perfectly. I love\u00a0horror movies, and I LOVE\u00a0scary clowns! So you can imagine how upset I was to find out how few scary clown movies actually exist. So I wrote my own and set out on a crazy journey to bring the next great clown movie to life! After six months writing and perfecting the script, I left my Nashville home and met our crew out in Los Angeles to shoot the movie! The production was chugging along and we were getting amazing footage! Then, on the last day and a half of shooting, one of our key locations caught on fire just minutes before we arrived (thanks to the good ol' California drought). The best choice for our movie creatively, logistically, and safety-wise was to halt production. I returned home, we edited the film, and we figured out exactly what we needed to complete it (we have 90% of the film done!). In addition, we had the rare opportunity to be able to see our movie and write some\u00a0amazing new scenes to make it even better!\u00a0Now we need your help to finish it! We have the budget left over to shoot what we had originally intended. The trick is getting a new production up and running again, and paying to shoot the newly written scenes. Things like re-renting the camera equipment, paying the cast and crew, and paying location fees again cost a lot! All of this gets broken up into: So join the team, get your copy of the movie, and be a driving force in making the next great clown movie a reality! \u00a0Brittany Belland plays Emma - With over a dozen films under her belt, Ohio-born Brittany Belland was more than excited to tackle the role of Emma: the story's protagonist who must race against the clock after learning that she will be killed by her greatest fear in two days' time. With her incredible dramatic abilities and attention to detail and nuance, Belland breathes an extra dimension of life and character into the extremely intense and demanding character. Eric Corbin plays Ribcage the Clown - LA actor Eric Corbin blew everyone away during auditions, bringing a sense of athleticism and ferocity to the character that nobody expected. Pulling from movie monsters throughout the years, Corbin truly built this creature from the ground up. In the end, he delivers a performance quite unlike anything you've seen before. Strong, animalistic, and inhuman Corbin makes Ribcage the Clown something to truly be feared. Monica Baker plays Heather - Michigan-native Monica Baker works as an actress and voice actress in Los Angeles. Baker plays Heather, Emma's big-mouthed, sweet-as-sugar-but-tough-as-nails best friend. When things begin to go downhill and Emma locks up with fear, Heather pushes her to move forward whether it's for better or for worse. Sean Patrick Murray plays Jonah - Emma and Heather's other partner in crime, Jonah, is played by Sean Patrick Murray, a Los Angeles based actor and producer. Jonah is sarcastic but totally down to Earth. However, (without spoiling anything) Emma quickly realizes that if she doesn't come up with a plan, her life might not be the only one at risk. Burt Culver plays Mr. Randal - Seattle native Burt Culver has appeared in over 40 TV shows and movies since his move to LA in 2012 (including a guest role in Criminal Minds). Culver plays Mr. Randal, the father of the clown's first victim. Out for revenge, he latches onto Emma. Insisting that he protect her, for better or for worse. Tom Seidman plays Pops - Seidman is truly a Hollywood veteran, having worked as a producer and an assistant director for over thirty years on films such as Dead Poets Society, Reds,\u00a0and Ordinary People. Though he has always been an actor at heart. Seidman plays Pops, a local ice cream man who, while working with the police, starts to suspect there might be more than meets the eye with the case. Johnjay Fitih plays The Town Sheriff - British actor Johnjay Fitih plays the town Sheriff, who very quickly becomes the clown's favorite puppet. Caitlin Rigney plays Meghan - New York theatre actress Caitlin Rigney plays Meghan, Mr. Randal's daughter who haunts him in more ways than one after her gruesome death.",
  "Hello my name is James Carney, I am the writer and director of this short film. Being a person who enjoys video games but also an aspiring filmmaker I've always wanted to create fan films for my favorite games but those ideas never worked out. But with the recent launch of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 I decided to try again. The more specific reasoning behind this is I feel there aren't enough strong female characters represented in film and mainly want to focus on changing that and this game does fit with that sort of idea. For the story it\u2019s a vague scenario revolving around Claire and Moira, purely based around all the narrative information included in the trailers out of respect for people who may not have played the game yet.\n\n As for production cast(though at this point the leads have yet to be cast but there are a lot of interested volunteers so it's just a matter of choosing the right people) and crew are already on board with budget being all that\u2019s left. The cost adds up to $1400 for all the necessities including: equipment, props and costuming. Hopefully this goal can be reached within a soon enough time.\nThe overall scope aside from the focus is a creating a fun project that Resident Evil fans and others can enjoy and hopefully lead to enough interest that would allow me to work on other projects I\u2019m very interested in making in the near future as part of my initial goal of creating media that shows strong, realistic and unexploited female characters.",
  "We've been super busy baking up delicious, vegan cupcakes from scratch. \u00a0In fact we've outgrown our shared kitchen space. \u00a0We are forever grateful to our friends at LaBelle Aurore in Niantic, CT for helping our fledgling business get off the ground, but it's time to move into our very own store! \"Dutch's\" will be filled with fresh baked treats and we will continue our made to order custom creations. We were very successful with our local farmer's markets last season, selling out most days. When not at the market, we continue to fill special orders weekly. \u00a0All thanks to our loyal customers. But, the one question we get asked the most is...\u00a0 \"When are you opening a store? \". \u00a0We understand that our customers want to be able to stop in whenever they feel like a quick treat. \u00a0With a location of our own we will have a chance to meet and interact with you all year long. We will continue to make all of our cupcakes from scratch in small batches to provide consistent quality with every order. We're building an inviting, trendy cafe, perfect for meeting up with friends and hanging out. A bigger kitchen and better equipment will allow us to start whipping up new and delicious creations for you to enjoy and we can also roll out our newest menu item...vegan MILKSHAKES!! \u00a0Hand crafted vegan shakes, made with vegan soft serve, dairy free milk and homemade syrups, sauces and toppings. Our mission at Dutch's has always been to expand and offer even more delicious and convenient vegan food option to our community and fill a gap in the current landscape. Vegan food is on the rise and this is not \u00a0a trend. \u00a0While some businesses are beginning to stock vegan offerings, they usually have only 1 or 2 options. \u00a0Dutch's currently has over 20 cupcake flavors on our menu. \u00a0With more space we can continue to experiment and bring you more fun treats. Now that we've shown people cupcakes can be sinfully indulgent without the use of animal products, we want to add the convenience of our very own store front. We love our community and we want to be a part of the evolution of food while helping you rethink what options are available to you. \u00a0Meeting people, talking and answering questions is what we live for. \u00a0The love and support we've received so far has been mind blowing and we cant wait to do more. \u00a0One of the main reasons Dutch's chooses a vegan lifestyle is to protect animals and the planet we share with them. While building our shop we are keeping that same mind set and utilizing eco-concious products for packaging and design. We want to contribute to the beautification of our neighborhoods and local communities. \u00a0With a little help from a lot of people, we can expand our brand to reach further. \u00a0We want you to feel good about what you eat. \"Honestly I cannot explain how amazing these cupcakes are! \u00a0Tiffany made us a special cupcake for my daughter vanilla cupcake, \"nutella\" filling and banana frosting. \u00a0I dont like vanilla cupcakes and i don't like banana flavor. \u00a0But I LOVEDDD these cupcakes. \u00a0I had to stop myself from eating all of my daughter's cupcakes. \u00a0We also had the triple chocolate peanut butter which was also amazing. \u00a0Do yourself a favor and trust Dutch's with all of your cupcake needs in the future you won't be disappointed!\" -Breanna Haskins \"The most AMAZING cupcakes your taste buds will ever experience!! \u00a0FINALLY a VEGAN OPTION?!!!\" -Tina Brown",
  "Make Your Mark has the possibility to expose artists, bring connection, support self expression, empower oneself and experience joy and fun in a community! \u00a0Together, artists and non-artists, we will create 5 paintings. \u00a0It is my hope that by being a part of the process the viewer of art will start to feel connected to art on a different level and open up their own creative power. \u00a0 The event will be in a public space, a courtyard near downtown Denver (the Highlands), during the first friday on September 5th. \u00a0Five artists will participate, each with a different distinct mark: calligraphy, brush work, thin layering (drips), monotype, trowels. \u00a0There will be 5 canvases with an artist by each to guide and support the people making their mark. \u00a0Twenty-five to thirty participants will be invited (5 to each canvas) plus there will be observers walking by. \u00a0(A large paper will be laid out for the public to play around too!) \u00a0There will be a couple of musicians playing with different beats to help inspire rhythm and mark within the participants. \u00a0The canvases will be started that night and then be taken home by each artist to complete and bring back the next month (first friday) to display to the public with all the names printed by each piece.\u00a0 The funds being raised are for the supplies for the event: (5) Painting Canvases 36\"x36\" or 36\" x 40\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$150 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Brushes and Palette knives, Trowels \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $100 Student Grade Acrylics \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$200 Gels and Medium for Acrylics \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$ 50 This would be an unforgettable experience for everyone involved! \u00a0Thank you for checking out this project. \u00a0Please contact me with any questions. \u00a0",

  "Hi everyone! This project is about a trip we want to make in\u00a0February 2016 to island. \u00a0Our goal is to travel all around the island of Iceland to take pictures not only of the amazing landscape but mostly of the northern lights.\u00a0 Since the northern lights are our main goal, we chose to go there when the circumstance are best for northern lights photography. But to do this project we need your help! Our goal is to rent a save and good car that we are flexible to drive to the best spots at night. We have no chance with public transport; buses don't drive in winter and not even at night, and the spots we want to visit have never seen a bus before. This is why renting a car\u00a0is crucial for our project. We (Claudia Bischoff, Martin T\u00f6dtling and Matthias Urwyler)\u00a0are experienced photographers. We are passionate about the northern lights. We\u00a0already made a trip to Norway two years ago. \n\nThere we learned all we need to know for this job. We know how to capture the \n\nnorthern lights when they appear, we know how to hunt them and bring them home as breath \n\ntaking pictures.\u00a0 Since we are experienced, we know what it takes to be out all night long even when the temperature gets way below zero. It can be very hard, but we are definitely up for it. When the northern lights appear we forget the cold, we forget the wetness and we act as \n\nfast as we can, to get the perfect picture for you.\u00a0 For our trip we have all the necessary gear and knowledge. To get around the island, we need to hire a good and safe car, that is able to drive in the snowy cold. But with your support we can do it! Our goal is to come home with the most stunning pictures of the northern lights. We want to make a presentation about the trip around the island and present the best pictures of the northern lights of Iceland. Thank you all for your support and feel free to post and spread the word about our project! For any further questions don't hesitate to contact us, we are happy to get to know you and to answer all your questions! Yours Claudia, Martin and Matthias",
  "I've always been a big fan of multi page wall calendars... you know the ones that you turn over a page every new month and get a new image to look at for the next 30 days or so. I buy at least 3 every year for different rooms in my house.\u00a0 And while we\u2019re all pretty much forced to keep our schedules on our computers and phones, I like tangible objects, artifacts if you will. And I like that ritual turning of the page every month... and, of putting up the new calendars every year and taking down the old ones. And, I've always wanted to do a calendar of just my images. So I decided now's the time. I've designed the calendar: It's 12in X 12in square with a heavy cover, front and back. It will be saddle stitched, which just means it has staples in the fold (I've never really been a fan of the wire binding). I've found an awesome printer that will give me great turn around time. And I've selected twelve of my favorite fine art images from the last few years.\u00a0 I\u2019ve created what I feel is a very simple and elegant calendar that will showcase the images and be an art artifact for your wall. Four of these images have been awarded prestigious prizes in two of the premier photography competitions in the world\u2026 the PX3 in Paris\u2026 and the International Photography Awards in the US. If you even remotely like wall calendars and photography, or know someone who does, I think you'll love this one. I\"m very excited about this project, and will really appreciate your help in making it possible. Thanks so much for your time. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Gunnar",
  "I've always been into sci-fi and fantasy, but last year, largely thanks to Jeffro Johnson's Hugo nominated Appendix N Retrospective series, I found myself picking up a lot of the older, weirder and pulpier stuff. \u00a0I felt particularly inspired by authors like Leigh Brackett, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, and publications like Planet Stories. \u00a0 I decided to launch a semi-pro zine to showcase pulse-pounding Sword & Planet and Heroic Fantasy fiction in the tradition of those classic pulp magazines.\u00a0 Cirsova Magazine is for readers who want exciting tales of daring heroes up against impossible odds in exotic settings. It's also for authors of adventure SFF. \u00a0I want to create an enduring market for pulp adventure writers to sell their fiction for competitive semi-pro rates. \u00a0 All that's left to do for issue 1 is fill some of the limited advertising space and get it into your hands as soon as possible! No T-shirts, no secret forums, no skype calls, conventions or parties, just what I can without a doubt put in your hands: a high quality sci-fi magazine. Issue 1 will have nearly 100 pages of pulse pounding SFF action! The first issue of Cirsova features the following line-up: Short Stories Novelette Poetry Feature Column Cover Art Stretch Goal 1: $1,000 I'll be able to pay for about half of the second issue without having to dip into out-of-pocket funds. \u00a0Meeting this goal means that around 100 people will get their hands on this amazing anthology. \u00a0There MAY be enough interest and buzz generated from folks who get to see it that Cirsova MIGHT take off as a sleeper mag to watch out for by mid 2016. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Stretch Goal 2: $5,000 Begin work on a second issue sometime in 2016. Reaching $5,000 will mean that my expenses associated with issue 1's assemblage will be met.  Issue 1 has roughly $1k worth of already-paid-for top-notch content, and the rest of the cost is POD + S&H.  \n Seems silly that meeting my expenses would be a stretch goal, but I'd rather play it safe than bank on an explosive outpouring of pledges. \u00a0Because Cirsova Issue 1 is already paid for, I can put it out without needing to raise the extra funds to cover the costs. \u00a0\n Even if I don't meet this stretch goal, there's a good chance I'll try to scrape together enough money for a second issue this year, because I've already got some AMAZING stories from authors who have said \"I'll hold onto this until you can get the next issue together.\" \u00a0I want to tell you all about them and how great they are, but I can't until I actually get the ball rolling on issue 2 and pay for the rights to them. Stretch Goal 3: $10,000 Begin work on a second issue immediately. Now, $10,000 would be ideal, because that would mean that my poorly scrawled out calculations of content + mfg. + shipping costs turned out to be more or less right and I didn't completely screw up on calculating my per-issue price point (approx 1000 issues w $1 content cost per issue + approx $5 per issue pod allows for a per issue price comparable to the 'big' SFF mags).  Oh, it also means that I would be able to immediately begin soliciting stories for issue 2.\n\n\u00a0 Stretch Goal 4: $20,000 I think I'll have enough to pay off my car note; that means an almost extra $300 a month I'll be able to sock away to invest in future content! Issue 2 will have interior artwork, for one thing! Notes on Shipping:\nI want to make this magazine available both as cheaply and widely as possible.  To do so, I needed to add variable shipping costs to pledge levels with rewards that can be shipped outside of the US.  Reward levels that are marked \"Only Ships to: United States\" have shipping costs factored in already.\n\n\u00a0 Notes on Bulk Orders:\nUS Domestic Media Mail rates are the primary reason why these bulk orders can be pledged for so cheaply.  The downside is that these prices must be exclusive to US customers.  If you are outside of the US and interested in bulk rates, please contact me directly and I will arrange for the best deal I can make you.\n\n Notes on Advertisements:\nImage Advertisements will appear in soft-cover print and pdf copies.  Depending on how well we can get the eBook version formatted, they may appear there as well, however this should be considered a \"bonus\" beyond the pledge goal based on its technical feasibility. \u00a0Interior advertisements may be in true black & white or in gray-scale. \u00a0Color images should be converted to gray-scale before submitting. Be advised that the Rear Cover advertisement is sized to accommodated a barcode rather than fit the page. Advertisement images should be 300 dpi, with the following measurements: Please have both text and graphic ads prepared for submission no later than one week after the end of the Kickstarter!",
  "From it's inception in 1993, Gearhead\u00ae Magazine has been unique in the world of automotive journalism. Focusing on the lifestyle, stories and culture surrounding car enthusiasts, especially those in love with muscle cars and hot rods, the magazine became the world\u2019s go-to source on the combined influences of pop culture, music and clothing on car culture and vise versa. It is a celebration of the DIY spirit in all things hot rods and rock and roll. Now in it's 22nd year, Gearhead\u00ae Magazine is once again being published after a 5 year hiatus. Welcome to the relaunch of Gearhead! Pioneering a movement unheard of until the magazine bearing the name GEARHEAD was first published in May 1993, former editor Michael LaVella \u00a0masterminded and gave birth to a rebel child that would soon become the basis for a movement known as kustom kulture. Raising the banner of muscle cars and guitar crushing garage rock GEARHEAD MAGAZINE became infamous among those \u201cin the know\u201d as THEE tastemaker for all things hot rods and rock and roll. Kooks and weidos dug it, but so did the general public! Mention you read GEARHEAD, and you were instantly part of the cool kids' club!\u00a0 In 2000, the brand expanded to include the record label when Rev. Michelle became co-owner. Having met when both were writers for the critically acclaimed punk magazine Maximum Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll, the two worked together to release over eighty records as well as create a line of clothing and accessories. \u00a0The team continued publication of the magazine, publishing one issue a year, with a goal to make it quarterly.\u00a0 Internationally recognized, the distinct logo and products associated with the brand were sold to over 50 countries. But all that hard work took it's toll. The team split up in 2006 with Michelle taking over the record label, and Mike taking back the magazine.\u00a0 The magazine went dormant in 2009 when LaVella stepped away from publishing to pursue other interests, but demand never died. A whole new generation of rock and roll and hot rod enthusiasts grew up reading about the legendary magazine, but could only find back issues to whet their appetite.\u00a0 \u00a0In 2014 the magazine was once again returned to parent company Gearhead Productions, Inc., where owner Rev. Michelle Haunold now seeks to revive the much loved cooler than cool rag with the enthusiastic release of the long awaited issue Number Nineteen!\u00a0 When you pledge to support this project, you are funding the long-anticipated relaunch of Gearhead Magazine with issue #19. You are also helping to KEEP PRINT ALLIVE! Like the rest of the media world, physical products are going by the way side as it becomes cheaper to produce digitally. But nothing can replace the feel of a magazine in your hands, or the smell of a magazine as you flip through the pages.  That love of the actual product fueled the resurgence of vinyl in the music industry, and I\u2019m hoping to tap into a similar passion for people who love printed media. I do also plan to make Gearhead available digitally for the first time for those who favor this form of content with print on demand and digital download options! But honestly, holding an actual magazine in your hands feels great, so why not go old school?\u00a0 Once this project funds, (because I know it will!) and this first re-launch issue is published, my goal is to eventually get the magazine up to being printed 4 times a year. This has been a goal of mine since I first started working on the magazine back in 2000! I\u2019d also like to expand coverage to a wider variety of topics, and stories, because there's so many great stories out there! Maybe it could even evolve into a podcast or TV show, you know? There's so much cool stuff out there to discover and share! I\u2019d also love to be able to start paying writers, who right now submit projects voluntarily simply because they want to be part of GEARHEAD. The money being raised during this campaign will be used to print the physical magazine. It will cost about $3500 to cover the printing costs. Any extra money will be used to pay a professional design artist who will handle the lay out of the magazine and setting up the files for print. If there\u2019s extra money after all that, it will go into the redesign of the GEARHEAD website where customers can shop online, subscribe, stay current on what\u2019s going on with Gearhead and follow all our social media sites.  I don't want to reveal too much since I don't want to spoil the surprise! But the new issue will be packed with cool stories not seen anywhere else and exclusive photos! Running about 80 pages, the magazine will feature a full-color cover with black and white book stock insides. It gives the magazine that vintage feel, much like the old school Hot Rod and Car Craft Magazines that were the original inspiration. It will be a limited edition run of 2500 printed copies, as well as available for digital download and print on demand. Among the articles you'll get a \"from the pits\" look at the annual Yolo County Demolition Derby,  a behind the scenes look at the life of producer extraordinaire Kim Fowley, a short history of the custom car phenomenon from the '60s known as Zingers, and a chat with the creator of the wildly popular Lady Luck Tattoo Convention. Gearhead also sits down with Jake \"The Preacher\" Cavaliere, frontman for the long-running gear-grinding rock and roll band out of Los Angeles The Lords of Altamont. \u00a0And finally, the last known interview with Famous Monsters of Filmland creator, Forrest J. Ackerman.  There will also be lots of cool underground record reviews, movie and book reviews and lots more cool stuff for hep cats and kittens.\u00a0 Does any of this sound\u00a0interesting or fun? Got yer mouth watering for these and other cool pics and stories ? Then please help me get the scratch together to bring this baby to print!\u00a0",

  "Hello Friends, My name is JR Renusson and in 2019 I will be opening up West Michigan's first All Vegan Food Truck: Faux. \u00a0Our mission is to reduce the world's dependency on animal products. \u00a0We will play a role in this by creating food that both vegans and non-vegans equally enjoy. \u00a0Faux will offer burgers, chick'n and fish sandwiches, grilled cheese, appetizers, along with shakes, cookies and more. \u00a0The entire menu will also be available gluten-free to insure that everyone is welcome. Having been vegan for over 10 years, it can sometimes be exhausting trying to find food that my wife and children will enjoy while also being vegan. \u00a0I've been working on this concept for a few years and I believe now is the time to let it loose. \u00a0Veganism has also been growing among all demographics as people are looking to either improve animal welfare, reduce their impact on the environment, and improve their health. Our end goal is to have Brick-and-Mortar Fauxs dotting the map all over the midwest but we will be starting with the humble food truck. \u00a0We need to raise approximately $50k to open up and are launching this campaign to hopefully get close to half that amount. \u00a0The money from this campaign will be used to purchase a used truck. \u00a0Then with our own funds along with some additional investments, we will outfit the truck with the necessary equipment, attain the required licenses and have enough working capital to launch in the Spring of 2019. I will use my passion for veganism, plus the knowledge I've gained through owning two vegan food businesses over the last 5 years, along with help from a seasoned restaurateur and other trusted advisors to bring Faux to fruition. \u00a0I have a culinary degree from the Secchia Institute. \u00a0I've created vegan menus for multiple restaurants and have created vegan product lines for national companies. \u00a0I have been preparing my other two vegan businesses (Bit Baking Co. and Cheeyeah) over the last year to be able to operate with minimal involvement from me so I can focus all of my attention on Faux this year and for the years to follow.",

  "This project, a month of art making in New Mexico, is about painting and drawing development. I have had many influential teachers over the years, and one of them was Donna Bruton. She told me that the most important piece of advice she could give was to paint every day. I was unfortunately never able to tell her before she died how much impact her education had on me. \u00a0 This time will allow me to fully focus on creating paintings and drawings. The schedule that I have set has me completing one painting per day. I will be alternating between 3 different types of painting. \u00a0 1. Observational painting, where I look directly at real things like plants, and paint them. \u00a0\u00a0 2. Fusion painting, a technique where I take source material from a book of smaller drawings that I have done in the past, and combine them into one painting. 3.\u00a0Abstract painting, where I use techniques of painting like gradients, and then spontaneously improvise in a jazzy style.\u00a0\u00a0 I will also be completing drawings in colored pencil. These are the smaller and faster counterpart to the larger and slower paintings.\u00a0 With your support, I will be able to have a full month to focus on working on these paintings, and developing painting technique and theory.\u00a0 For a selection of my previous work, please visit my image site or play the video above.

  "Bio My name is Kevin Boylan. I first studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\u00a0(PAFA) in Philadelphia as a Painting Major for two years. I discovered the  Florence Academy of Art (FAA) in my second year at PAFA and decided to continue my education there. I took a year off to work and saved everything to cover my first year in Florence studying at FAA. The next two years were spent going to school off and on while working to pay for the tuition when scholarships weren't enough. It's been a long hard road but I'm currently finishing my third and final year of FAA's program and expect to be back home in the states this summer. \u00a0 The Hudson River School Fellowship For those of you not familiar with the Hudson River School Fellowship, it's an annual prize for young painters who pursue working from nature. It's modeled itself after the tradition of the Hudson River School (a 19th century romanticism American art movement). It's put together by The New York Grand Central Academy\u00a0and takes a chosen handful of artists to experience three weeks of painting, lectures and talks by other artists. I've been accepted for this year's Fellowship.\u00a0 Why I need Kickstarter With help from FAA (The Florence Academy of Art) I've been able to complete my education, but not without serious sacrifices. I've received an excellent education but I've had to take time off to work and poured all my savings into finishing school. The Hudson River School Fellowship is a great way to mark the end of my schooling, get involved with artists from my home country and give me enough work to have my first show.\u00a0 The Fellowship has a small participation fee of $100 and the students are responsible for their own supplies and food.  This is where Kickstarter comes in. If successful this project will allow me to attend The Hudson River School Fellowship, have the supplies to draw and paint everyday while there, help with transportation, buy groceries for meals, and put together a small show exhibiting work from school and the fellowship.\u00a0 Thank you for your interest and support in my aspirations. A lot of you have already supported me in my journey and education, even aside from this project, I just wanted to say thank you.\u00a0 Follow my progress at the Hudson River School Fellowship on my blog www.KevinBoylanArt.Blogspot.com\u00a0",
  "After a decade in the outdoor industry as a ranger, educator, guide, and retailer, I am ready to launch a portfolio of outdoor goods that address the accessibility and sustainability needs of the outdoor industry.\u00a0 Since I was kid in scouts, I lusted over the top of the line backpacks, mess kits, and pocket knives, but growing up as a first generation POC, I didn't always have access to the best gear. As I replaced my aging, simple gear for new technical gear, something was missing. Working for a large retailer informed me about the ethics of the large companies pumping out gear, and exposed me to the waste of the increasingly fast seasonal refresh. I saw the serious enthusiasts and crusty dirt bags who designed all of the classic gear, responsible for opening the out doors for most of us, be replaced with the fashion industry's approach to manufacturing and design.\u00a0 Accessibility is an after thought, a point I had to confront recently as I tried to update my bike components and was looking at a price tag more than the bike was worth. Support me in filling out the empty bottom end of the outdoor industry with quality, affordable goods made in Minnesota by hand!\u00a0 I know, birds are so pass\u00e9, but hear me out: icterids, or the blackbird family, are a great symbol of what I want my portfolio to represent: thoughtful tools built by and for those who exist on the fringes of the outdoor industry. I think of my operation as a form of brood parasitism: I am salvaging the excess material production of large companies to create gear for those looking for affordable gear.\u00a0 Let's face it, this is going to be a year of cutting back and looking for alternative solutions to daily problems, but don't let that keep you from using quality gear! Here's what I am doing and how you can help. I am setting out to create a line of simple and affordable backpacks and bags, among other experiments, that prioritize cost savings over bells and whistles. I will be using dead stock (material that is no longer wanted by the fashion/outdoor industry, sold at ~1/4 original cost) as the foundation of the line and sourcing quality notions ( hardware: buckles, thread, strapping, etc.) to incorporate serious functionality. The line will be made by hand in Duluth on my lovely Sailrite LSZ-1.\u00a0 Each design will prioritize functionality and relevance over flair and features, in other words just what you need and not what you don't.\u00a0 Current offerings: I'm weary of vapor ware, you should be too. This is why I am starting my funding request with small wallets and building the portfolio up slowly. One major aspect of preserving the value of my goal is keeping myself on track and producing rewards and designing the next offering in a timely fashion. I am a student of the lean, kanban, just-in-time models of production and will keep labor time down by streamlining specific runs of goods as they are funded.\u00a0 I have already made the initial investments in my business and have the materials and tools for the launch of this kickstarter, your contribution is funding the development of the next product in my line.\u00a0My funding goal of $250+ will buy the necessary yardage and appointments to design and produce my next line: storage cubes and two backpacks.\u00a0 The biggest challenge for me as a designer is building a logical portfolio to bring to production. I have been brainstorming ideas for years, but I probably shouldn't launch that tent for river guides just yet! If this campaign is funded, \u00a0I will be able to launch a small range of gear organization cubes and one or two backpacks. Beyond that, I'd like to have a line of bike bags (panniers, handlebar, and basket bags) and share my knowledge and designs with the DIY community, after all, we are all beta-testers and the best gear is customized to our individual needs.\u00a0 Thank you for checking out this project and contributing if you can, I hope to support your outdoor gear needs!\u00a0",

  "I am so very grateful for all of your support in reaching my first goal! I now have the funds to pay for the recording fees for the Nashville album. Now we are ON TO THE SECOND GOAL: $15,000!\n\n\u00a0 At $15,000 I will be able to pay the production (printing) and mastering costs of the album. This is a crucial part of fundraising for this album. If I don't have the funds to actually pay for copies in-hand, there isn't a physical album. So, I humbly and gratefully ask for your support to reach my second goal. This album will be a pinnacle in my career and I'm so very thankful that I have friends surrounding me who are willing to help me create it! Thank you. Thank you! THANK YOU!\n\n - Chad ORIGINAL MESSAGE: I have wanted to make a Nashville record since I began writing songs, but not just your typical \"let's go down to a Nashville studio and record some songs in recording factory\". I mean one backed with creative clout and steeped in roots/Americana sound alongside the best players in the business. Now, after 19 albums, I finally have that chance!\u00a0 I was contacted last year by producer/drummer Ken Coomer (Wilco, Uncle Tupelo) who offered to produce and play on my next album. Ken has been part of projects for Billy Joe Shaver, Steve Earle, Will Hoge and many others. \u00a0Needless to say, I was excited to get started! With the generosity of friends I have been able to record the first half of the album. It is going to be AMAZING! Guitarist Kenny Vaughan (Marty Stuart, Lucinda Williams, etc) joined the sessions along with bass player Dave Roe (Johnny Cash, Dwight Yoakum, John Mellencamp). John Lancaster (Gary Allan) also added some amazing keys and organ playing to my songs. Here's a snippet of the \"Matters of the Broken Heart\" rough cut from the new album: You get the idea, right? This album will be killer. But it won't happen if I don't come up with the funds to record the second half of the album. I sure would appreciate if you would help me make this album a reality! I'm seeking $10,000 to pay for the remainder of the recording fees. Please peruse the perks on the right hand column - there are some great things you can earn by being a donor - such as my extreme gratitude. I am so very thankful for any donation you can make! And also, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE share this with your friends and family. You can make a big difference in the success of this campaign! Again, thank you so very much! I look forward to sharing the new album with you in the future! - Chad",
  "STRETCH GOALS - Even though we've reached our goal of $3250, you can still be a part of supporting \"Fighting a War\".\u00a0\u00a0 Any additional funds will be used on finishing the recording process (my actual expenses will be a little over $4000 after everything is mixed, mastered, and duplicated) and are much appreciated.\u00a0 If we reach the stretch goal of $4000, ALL SUPPORTERS will receive:  All of the songs have been written and recording is just about complete.\u00a0 I'm so excited about how all of these tracks are sounding. It's more \"me\" than anything I've ever done, but to finish the job the right way, I'm going to need your help  There are a lot of costs that go into making an album.\u00a0 Although I'm self-producing this record, I'm certainly not doing everything by myself.\u00a0 I've lined up an incredible team of musicians and engineers to be a part of this project. That list includes: Quite a list! In addition to this, there are the costs involved with album design (I've commissioned an original painting from local artist Tony Sobota) and CD duplication. Here's the good news.\u00a0 I've been able to save up and pay for the recording of this project on my own.\u00a0 The record is about 95% recorded at this point.\u00a0\u00a0 All the money we\u2019re raising will go to pay for MIXING and MASTERING the record and also will go towards paying for CD duplication.\u00a0 Mixing and mastering will be handled by some of Nashville's best and will ensure that the record sounds fantastic.  I'm so excited to release another record. I really believed after my last record in 2006 that I was finished. For all intents and purposes, I was done.\u00a0 I quit writing and I quit playing shows... but for whatever reason, God wasn't finished with me quite yet.\u00a0 After an unexpected burst of songs came in 2013, I knew that I needed to get these out into the world.\u00a0 I am grateful for those of you who have supported my modest little music career over these last 10 years.\u00a0 Every kind word has been an encouragement and a blessing along the way.  I'm turning 40 on October 30th.\u00a0 My goal is that with your help, we can get this album released right around that time.\u00a0  With gratitude,  Greg",
  "I've been working on 2 bird-centric projects over the last 10 months which will both be a part of my MFA thesis exhibition.  One project Impact is composed of large scale (44x65\") photos representative of the moment when birds collide with built structures. Many of the birds were found while walking in downtown Minneapolis or St.Paul for the Audubon's BirdSafe program during migration season. Birds are photographed intact and turned over to the Audubon society for collection and data entry. The second project DIY Bird Populator is a participatory exercise in rewilding and considering the consequences of loss.  Both project, at their cores, are concerned with an interconnectedness of species and the ways in which space is shared. Your support of my project through Kickstarter will help to offset costs of printing and presenting on a large scale as well as for having large, professionally made, print runs for my participatory project, DIY Bird Populator.

  "Photography is what got me into guiding. On my tours I attempt to have my clients leave with not only life long experiences but photos they are proud to share. In 2018 it became obvious that the Valdez Glacier ice shelf was entering its end of life phase and I began to document its breakdown. What I thought would be an 6-10 year processes, quickly became a 2 year metamorphosis punctuated in a single cataclysm. On July 7, 2020, the over mile long Valdez Glacier ice shelf calved into thousands of pieces. This is the collection of photos from the first time I saw Valdez Glacier, through my years of guiding the ice shelf and glacier, to its demise. I would like to get this collection in print because there's something special about a piece of history you can hold on to. In the near future, even before my children finish high school, Valdez Glacier Lake will no longer have icebergs and these days will be just a stories of once when. I want to offer people the chance to see how beautiful it was. Your contributions help preserve and share that story. The book is 9\" X 12\", hard cover, 200 pages, and has over 250 photographs.",

  "Feminists have never hesitated to dissect and attack art whose misogyny offends and repulses us. But what happens when we fall in love with the work of a musician, writer, or painter we see as anti-female? Do we rationalize our cognitive dissonance away, turn our back on the offending artist, or find a way to embrace the film or story that moves us while acknowledging what disturbs us about it? How does our attraction to misogynist art complicate our relationship to both the artist and feminism itself? When we asked these questions earlier this year in our call for submissions for It's Complicated, we received an overwhelming response, both from contributors and those eager to see the project come to fruition. Although we originally intended to publish a single anthology of feminists' personal essays on loving misogynist art, it soon became clear that the potential subjects were endless and the range of approaches to them broad. Many writers told us they'd spent years thinking about their fraught relationship to a particular artist or work. In kicking off the project with a series of handmade, themed zines culled from the excellent submissions we received, we hope to start an ongoing cultural conversation about the uncomfortable yet influential role that misogynist art plays in our lives.\u00a0Over the next several months, our plan is to expand It's Complicated into a book and create a website where even more contributors can publish their writing and readers are invited to participate in discussions on the topic.\u00a0The money we raise from this Kickstarter will fund the creation of two limited-edition zines: Totally Crushed Out, themed around the writers' teenage love of a problematic artist, and Identity Crisis, focused on contributors whose appreciation for a certain artist leaves them torn between their feminist values and some other aspect of their identity. To design the zines, we are working together with Birds of Lace, a small feminist literary publisher.\u00a0After they are designed, the zines\u00a0will be printed by the DIY-minded printer\u00a01984\u00a0Printing\u00a0using\u00a0quality materials.  TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR IT'S COMPLICATED #1 and #2: It's Complicated Zine #1: Totally Crushed Out!

  "For my exam project, i have to make an horror movie. We have been focusing on this topic all throughout our classes. I am a big horror fan myself, and i have been watching almost all horror movies, and all i now need is YOU! I have the idea to make a danish version of a \"found footage\" film. In Denmark there has only been 1 \"found footage\" film ever. We have the perfect scenery. Creepy old forests, castles, mansions and other creepy areas. My idea is: A boy and his smaller sister is on a roadtrip with 2 girls. Their car gives up and the backpacking trip they were going on, starts sooner than expected. They have no GPS, NO cellphone signal and only each other. Lost in the huge forrest they encounter voodoo, old danish folklore and a creepy \"entity\" that just won't leave them alone. They end their journey by an abandoned hospital, hungry, confused and with amnesia. They are less people than when they began. But what did actually happen in that forrest? \u00a0 Only the tape reveals!",
  "Debbie and The Devil is an indie horror film which tells the\nstory of Debbie Jones, a five-year-old girl who makes a deal with the devil\nhimself after witnessing her entire family die in a freak accident. At\nseventeen, Debbie must meet her end of the bargain: A murderous task involving\na beach house and Debbie\u2019s classmates. The goal is to make a truly entertaining\nhorror film that plays with genre conventions and throws out tiresome clich\u00e9s\nwhile also having a darkly humorous, surrealist tone. We have all seen the\nmovie where a bunch of kids go to some secluded place and get picked off by\nsome evil person or thing, so instead of laboriously going through the motions,\nDebbie and The Devil approaches the story from an angle rarely seen in\nmainstream horror films: It is from the perspective of the slasher, that, and\nit\u2019s meant to be fun. The\nmajority of horror films are, quite frankly, cynical cash grabs. They are made\nby committee, and usually the end result is a lifeless and a bit depressing\nexercise in separating teenagers from their allowances. Debbie and The Devil is\nmeant to be a lively, fun,\u00a0 and\nshocking (in a fun way) experience. It is a movie made with midnight movie\nmadness in mind. Tailor made for the following audience groups: horror lovers,\ncinema lovers, lovers on dates and lovers of fresh, exciting cinema. Most\nhorror movies, and, lets face it, movies in general, are painted by the\nnumbers, Debbie and The Devil is a mad frenzy of a horror film, meant to make\nthe audience giddy with excitement and disbelief. While the list of films and\nfilmmakers that have inspired Debbie and The Devil could fill a large book,\naside from the obvious influences like Tarantino and Eli Roth and Scorsese and\nboth Anderson\u2019s, Debbie and The Devil is strongly influenced by slasher films\nand Italian Giallo movies like Argento\u2019s Suspiria and the works of Mario Bava\nand Lucio Fulci. If you took every horror film and put it in a blender and\nadded a dash of Dragon Ball Z and a pinch of Monty Python, you would get DEBBIE\nAND THE DEVIL! So please donate to see this wild piece of cinema come to life!",
  "A little bit about myself. My name is Krista and I am a documentary photographer whose work focuses on landscapes and social issues across the globe. In 2018 I attended Kingston School of Art in London and received a Bachelor's degree in Photography. My projects aim is to engage people within the beauty and reality of the natural environment that surrounds them.\u00a0 You can find more information about my previous projects on my website https://www.krista-gurcka.com/ or on Instagram www.instagram.com/krista.gurcka About the exhibition.\u00a0 This is a documentary project on the environment and how the impact of natural phenomena such as volcanic activity and pollution have changed the communities within Indonesia. This is not just about the beautiful country that Indonesia is and the amazing landscapes that it holds, it\u2019s about the communities that live there. Photographing their struggles, laughs and smiles as well as their hard work to earn a living in order to be able to take care of their families. \u00a0 The aim within this project is to educate people on issues that the locals have to live with each day due to the constant changes of the environment and geological impact the constant activity of the volcanos brings.\u00a0 With so many natural disasters happening all over the world, from tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic explosions, wildfires to sandstorms and flooding. I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge these global issues and find new ways for man made structures to work together within the landscape and improve the living of communities that are impacted by these factors.\u00a0 This project is very important to me because I set myself a task to launch my own personal first solo exhibition about something I am passionate about, with the hope to be able to positively influence everyone that comes to my exhibition about global issues and ways to overcome them.While enjoying the beauty of a two week long documentary project that explores the landscapes and communities of Indonesia.\u00a0 In order to make this happen, I need your help! As I am funding and running this project completely on my own, I kindly ask that you guys help me achieve my goal for this year, as I believe great things are done together. Furthermore, the big aim of this project is to come together, work as a community and make a difference for the better. Therefore with your help, my project can have a stepping stone to achieve more and impact people on a bigger scale towards the future.\u00a0 If you believe in my project and the aim behind it, please go and support. About the exhibition This exhibition will include roughly 10-20 pieces of A4 to A2 size prints, all covering a varied range of documentary images of the volcanic areas of 'Mount Bromo' and the 'Ijen Crater'.\u00a0 Following by a hard cover photo book, which will include research about the volcanos with further imagery and information gathered from the locals about their everyday lives in these conditions.\u00a0 Below I have included some of the photographs which will be displayed in the gallery and the photo-book so that you guys can see what to expect from the show.\u00a0 The Funding.\u00a0 The money raised from your donations will include the cost of the rental of the gallery space which is \u00a31,200 for the week and \u00a3500 for the costs of printing and framing the images on the finest quality paper.\u00a0 Lastly, I would like to thank anyone who's supporting my project and I hope you enjoy my images and the project itself and will be able to take back something new for yourself and a story to tell others.\u00a0 Kind regards,\u00a0 Krista",

Also, I wish to raise awareness of the risk of vanishing cultural heritages in the islands, like collecting bird eggs, raising faroe horses, agriculture and fishing traditions etc. Many people don\u2019t even know where the Faroe islands lies and the destination is still quite unknown for many travellers. As part of the project, I will hold photographic exhibitions at various locations around the world.\u00a0 I expect the first exhibition to be shown in Paris, France in early 2020 and further on in Copenhagen, Denmark as part of a campaign promoting tourism to the Faroe islands. Supporting the project My Kickstarter backers have the option of receiving a fine art quality print of one image in the book or, a limited edition Coffee Table Book.\u00a0 Another option for the Kickstarter backers is to choose among various pictures on my website martinjohansen.com/gallery and order a print of 35 euros, in order to support my work and book project. My Background My name\u2019s Martin N. Johansen, I\u2019m originally from Denmark. My passion for the great outdoors and wildlife led me to become a nature photographer. For the past 28 years, I have specialising in photographing landscapes and animals around the world, on every continent, from New Zealand to Antarctica, France to Yemen. My photographs have appeared in many publications and have also been exhibited both in Europe and in the United States. Beside exploring the wild areas of Greenland and Iceland, I have been travelling widely in the Faroe Islands since 2008. Over the years, I've been adding many images to my archive. Recently, I collaborated with both danish, german and french magazines and published my articles and photo stories about the Faroe islands. What will my project involve ? My project have already involved lots of time and energy - more than 10 years and numerous trips to the Faroe islands.\u00a0 I expect to finish the final pictures end of october. I will then start editing and work on the lay-out of the book in collaboration with a graphic designer. Additionally, I will be adding illustrations in the book and expect to complete the final lay-out and illustrations early or mid-novembre, 2019.",
  "Hi! My name is Sarah and I\u2019m a wife, mother and Disney fanatic living in the SE of England. In the past 18 months I\u2019ve got into the Disney pin scene, building up great relationships with traders and sellers alike.\u00a0 Last year, I decided to dabble with creating my very own pin and after a tentative start, it sold out within a matter of months leaving me chomping at the bit to release another. I enjoyed the entire process, from spending hours creating and tweaking the design to get it just right, (waiting for the physical product was excrutiating though as I\u2019m so impatient,) managing and setting up my own online shops, promoting and finally, packaging them up and sending them off to their new homes. I loved reading the positive feedback (all of which can be found on my Spookyloupins Etsy page) and seeing the tags on Instagram. Marie seemed like the perfect choice as the starter, for what I hope will become a mini series featuring several other Disney cats, because she is absolutely adorable (and sassy.) The addition of the daisies is a personal nod to my favourite film \u2019Alice in Wonderland.\u2019 I wanted something playful and fun. Thank you so much for even clicking on my project let alone potentially pledging. Any amount helps towards the goal and I am so thankful for all the help you can offer! \ud83d\udc9c",

  " As a little girl growing in Puerto Rico, I would to go to the market with my mom. First stop was produce.\nShe would get green peppers, onions, cilantro and quite a few other vegetables and herbs to make her sofrito.\nMy mother was the oldest daughter and third oldest of ten siblings. She had allot to do with the raising of the younger siblings. She grew up in Ponce Puerto Rico, the south side of the island. Her family, very poor. She learned at a very young age to cook utilizing local harvested ingredients as well as herbs from her mothers garden and had a passion for it.\nUpon returning from the market, she would place all her vegetables and herbs on the kitchen table and start separating them.  I remember as if it was yesterday the essence of the aroma of the fresh herbs. The table covered, I could not see the tabletop.\nYou see, her sofrito was so award winning with friends and family, she would make bulk amounts to share it with everyone.\nMy mother  passed away a few years back and my father passed a couple of years after her. When my brother and I went to their home to clean it out, The first thing  I new I wanted to find was mama\u2019s recipe box.  After reading some of her recipes i came across her \"SOFRITO\" recipe.  It was then that  after all these years of following what I thought was her recipe (she had three different recipes), I was missing a couple of key ingredients. So, I went to the market, bought all the things on her list (for all three different recipes). Came home, made the recipes and I was overwhelmed at the difference in taste. I now understand how she would use one of the three with different dishes she would prepare.\nI have partnered up with one of New York\u2019s finest executive chefs, Chef Jim Donahue, who is also my husband. Chef Jim was so impressed with my mother\u2019s sofrito; we began to come up with recipes for other products, So you will have to stay tuned in.\nWe are committed to providing only the freshest product.\u00a0\n Cheers,\u00a0 Sharon And Jim www.mamassofrito.com",

  "A bit about why I want to make this album... I've been writing and performing these songs for the past two years now, and after every performance, I get asked, \"Where can I download your music?\" And I never have a good answer. The songs are about telling stories and talking to the people listening. Shared experiences and personal relationships. I've tried to sit down and do simple recordings on my own, but I was never satisfied with the outcome, mostly because it lacked human connection and the songs seemed to pale in comparison to live performance. But. At the beginning of this year, I decided that I wanted to do something bigger with my music. Something more than one night at a bar or theater. Something that I could give to people, because ultimately that's what it is, a gift. A bit of myself that I want to share with anyone that's willing to listen, because I have a feeling that the listener will relate. So I needed to figure out how the music could translate from live performance to simply audio, because those are two very different things. One night at a dive bar in the east village, my friend Lorenzo Wolff convinced me to let him produce my album. (it didn't take a ton of convincing...) Through his studio, Restoration Sound, I'll have the opportunity to work with other musicians, who will help me create a fuller sound, and engineers, who will mix and blend the sounds so that there is balance. It will be my songs heard in a way that has only ever existed in my head, where they are always much bigger and more complicated, even though in reality they are just little things. It is going to take so much work. And time. And talent. Which is why I need to raise money. Work, time, and talent should be compensated. The money raised will go to pay the musicians that play on the album, and the engineers that put such meticulous work in finding that perfect mix. It will pay for studio time and for the time that Lorenzo puts into crafting other instrumentals and gorgeous harmonies to accompany me. It will pay the artist who creates the album cover and then the press that actually prints the album itself. The money you give will buy the meal I feed the musicians as we go into a twelve hour day of recording, because dear me, they need to eat. You see why I need your help? The amount that I am asking for is the bare minimum required. If we raise more than that, that means the album will be that much better. If a song desperately needs a harp, that extra money will pay for that harpist. So please empty your pockets into this kickstarter. And please tell your friends about it. I promise they'll want to hear the music. I don't know much, but I do know that it is good.",
  "Hooray and thanks so much! \u00a0We made our goal! \u00a0You can still get the great deals listed on the rewards page for two more days, and the money will still go to production of the cd. \u00a0The full cost will be around 12,000 if all \u00a0goes as usual, and if I can cover even more of the expense, I'll be very grateful and promise to put it to good use. \u00a0Moonshine, Lime and Sugar started with this song at Clifftop last year!

You also may have heard some of my original songs and tunes on past albums with the Avant Gardeners band and my own previous solo recordings, such as No Gravity. \u00a0Having just moved to Asheville, NC, and passed through unexpected life changes, i find that my songwriting has sprouted new wings and I'm so excited to be in the studio recording them with my favorite musical partners, the hyper talented guitarist, Bert Carlson, world class percussionist Loren Oppenheimer, and everyone's favorite bass player, Ralph Gordon, with guest appearances by Dave Bartley on mando and guitar and George Paul on keys. \u00a0This project swept me away at a time when funds are quite limited, so I'm asking friends and the dance and music community I'm lucky to be a part of, to help me out with this kickstarter campaign. By basically pre-ordering your copy of the CD, I'll be able to complete the project this summer and hopefully have a recording for you this fall. \u00a0There are also some other great rewards, so check it out.

  "Kickstarter asks to talk about our project as if to a friend. But my friends already know about this project. A bunch of us are behind this project.\u00a0 We love the cronicles of Amber, the books written by Roger Zelazny, from which also came a great Diceless Role Playing Game.\u00a0 In the past there has been a fanbased magazine about Amber. The Amberzine. And also fan made spinoffs like Trumpcall. \u00a0A while ago the idea started to brew among a group on facebook to start a new magazine.\u00a0 Nowadays it is so much easier to reach the fans, the writers of fanfiction, the artists and the rule creators. \u00a0So we want as a group of fans to start a new fanzine for the chronicles of Amber including \u00a0the Diceless Roleplaying system. We already have enough content to fill up the first issues. And there is more coming in.\u00a0 But we need some start up money for a decent editing tool and of course to have the issues printed and send out through the world.\u00a0 So fans of Amber, join in and spread the love for Amber and Chaos.",
  "\u201cThe term \u2018gig economy\u2019 refers to a general workforce environment in which short-term engagements, temporary contracts, and independent contracting is commonplace.

  "I wanted to make a short film that would at first lull audiences in with a sense of safety, and then slowly pull the curtain back to terrify audiences and ultimately leave them shocked and disturbed by the ending, which I believe to be quite chilling, and that will all be achieved without using any words. It's all in the visuals.  This film is\u00a0to be directed with grace, and simplicity. It's a quiet horror film, and only becomes bloody in its last moments. It's a pure example of a tension builder. I prefer scares that don't hammer you over the head.  Horror is my bread and butter. It's a genre I respect as much as anyone would respect their favorite genres. I specifically use homages to classic babysitter in peril films like, \"Halloween\" and \"When A Stranger Calls\" (the original).  People\u00a0will be afraid to walk home afterwards. I want them to be terrified to go home to their empty houses. I want them to think twice about answering their phone.  The film has already been cast, and we've done several table reads and will be starting with continual rehearsals, blocking, choreography, and effects tests right up until the start of shooting on August 9th.  Put simply, the things that I'm seeking by starting this Kickstarter are things that myself and my crew need to make this much more than a low budget short film. Costume rental,\u00a0better lights, better sound equipment, top of the line effects kits for some of the more visceral scenes\u00a0(we're going practical).

  "WHAT WE\u2019RE UP TO:\n   We\u2019re the Bread and Butter Band, and we need your help. We have a whole full-length album written, and have demos done of all the music. We\u2019ve recorded three of the tracks in the studio already, and we\u2019re ready to do the other 9! \u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019ve already put hundreds and hundreds of hours into creating this music, and recreating and practicing and recreating and performing it. We\u2019re now ready to share it with all of you.\u00a0 WHY WE NEED YOUR MONEY:  Did you know it costs more than $500 a day to record in a professional studio? During our first studio experience, we tracked three songs a day, and then took another day to do vocals on those three tracks. And then it costs the same amount to complete all of the post-production work with engineers to mix, and then subsequently master the album. When mixing for an album, it takes even longer than tracking. \n   This puts us at approximately $10,000 just to complete the recording process. It took us a year to save the $2000 we spent in the studio on round one, and we\u2019d like to complete our album sooner than 5 years from now. \u00a0WHAT TO EXPECT:\n   If our project gets funded, we plan on recording our album in the fall and winter of 2014. \u00a0We're not asking for you all to do it all by yourselves, we're planning on raising the other third of the total cost. That means you\u2019ll have a copy in your hand within a year from now if you make a donation. And that means we\u2019ll be able to use it to book festivals and tours that take us near your town next summer!

  "I am very excited to be having the chance to be in the studio while my song, 'Where Is The Love' is recorded. I have selected the very fast-rising and awesome singing duo, 'Tenasie' to do the vocals. Tenasie Bowe and Matt Kyler are two of the most talented young artists on the Nashville music scene today and are quickly being recognized as one of the next big things in Nashville!  The song, 'Where Is The Love' was inspired by the loss of one of my friends, Chuck Juba. Chuck was a high school friend with incredible musical abilities and I always thought he would go on to be a famous musician - his gift was just that great. Years go by like they do, and people lose track of old friends and as such I lost track of Chuck. In recent years the advent of social media has allowed many of us to re-connect with old friends and relatives we thought we'd never see again and so once I joined Facebook I set out to find all my old classmates of Arundel Sr. High School Class of 1980. I was shocked to learn eventually that Chuck has passed away after a decades long struggle with drug and alcohol addictions and long periods of homelessness in 2008. It took me a while to even comprehend the circumstances of his death and to this day I still can't understand it.... The song is an expression of my grief and I wrote it to make people more aware of the issues of addiction and homelessness that affects so many of our fellow citizens...

  "Hello friends, family, and friends of friends and family! I have been making music for over 25 years. Almost EVERY time I finish a performance, people come up to ask me: \"Do you have any CDs for sale?\" Sadly, the answer is NO. It takes quite a bit of money to produce a CD! Well, now is your chance, fans of David Bryan! If we are able to raise these funds together, then I will be able to\u2014for the first time\u2014capture a performance with a high quality PROFESSIONAL recording (which shall be made available on digital download). This will not only allow you to carry my voice around in your Ipod wherever you go, but also then allows me to submit for consideration to play in various venues\u2014as well as for music festivals all over the country. All money raised for this project will go entirely to help further my musical ambitions. Many people have told me over the course of my life that I have a beautiful voice. This praise is very gratifying, but often overshadowed in the face of the financial difficulties that this musician faces. (EVERY MUSICIAN has encountered such financial difficulties at one point or another!) That being said, after paying for the recording, every dollar contributed towards this project will in some way serve to create and sustain a path on which I can continue to share this wonderful gift which has been given to me: my voice. I am more excited about the possibilities for this particular concert than any other I have previously envisioned, as it is a tribute concert to my all-time favorite musician. Please help me to make this dream come true.  Thank you kindly for your consideration. DAVID BRYAN   Addendum: I know much of this campaign is rather VAGUE. This sounds very bizarre, but due to numerous circumstances out of my control, I can't give any more details here about this particular concert! If you want to choose the \"digital download\" reward, but want to first know what you're getting (or if you want any info about the project at all), please contact me here on kickstarter, or at davidbryan32@yahoo.com.

These two adorable borb fronds come as a pair - that's right, two enamel pins together!! \u00a0The demand for Pigeons to be added to the family has been insane and so I'm super happy that I'm now getting the chance to do so. ADOPT OF PIGEON PAL NOW!!! \u2022 You will be paying a lower price for pre-ordering the pins through Kickstarter! They will be \u00a37 in my shop and at conventions! \u2022 You will be getting extra Kickstarter-exclusive goodies such as the super cute stickers\u00a0 \u2022 Kickstarter is a very flexible platform - you commit now and pay later! This lets you manage your funds a lot better, and also gives you the ability to edit your pledge at any time, meaning you can increase, decrease or cancel it at any time until the campaign ends! \u00a0Once the initial \u00a3450 target is met and the campaign ends, the Pigeon designs will be able to go to print. Unlike my last Borb campaign, there are no other designs being added, as I am taking part in the Make100! The aim here is to get 100 Pairs of Pigeon Pals out to Backers! \u00a0Have you done this before? Yes! This is my second Enamel Pin Kickstarter and I have had a successful enamel pin Kickstarter campaign previously. Check out my previous Borbs Will the pins have custom backing cards? Yes! For this kickstarter it will be a large decorative backing card to accommodate both pigeon pals What clutch will they have? Because of the size it will be one clutch but hopefully with a rubber clutch When will I be charged? You will not be charged for your pledge until the campaign has been successfully funded. So you can pledge now and wont pay anything until the beginning of February. Will I receive both pins? Yes! this campaign is for a pair of pigeon pins What if I want more than one Pair of Pins? As I'm limiting this campaign to 100x Pairs to keep in line with the spirit of Make100, I have capped the tiers. Because of this there is only one option currently to add one pair. However, at the end of the campaign depending on availability, I might be able to do add ons. I will keep this in mind. How long will it take for me to receive my pins? As long as there are no delays with the manufacturing process, they should reach you sometime in April. I'm hoping earlier, but I'm giving myself a grace period for any delays. Once the pins are with me I'll be checking for any imperfections and then attaching the pins to backing cards and cutting stickers. I run my business on my own so you'll need to be patient with me once they arrive ^^;; Shipping times are estimated at UK: 2-4 days Europe: 7-14 days USA, Canada, Australia and the rest of the world: 14-21 days. N.B. These are estimates. I am based in the UK so please allow at least 21 days if you are outside of Europe What are the shipping charges? UK - \u00a32 for 1st Class Royal Mail Everywhere Else - \u00a34 for untracked international standard I've decided this time to keep the postage low as to not skew my goal total. It's difficult to gauge how much extra is needed for shipping for these campaigns and so this time I have kept them low at standard shipping. It's also more affordable for international backers - however, this means it will take longer for items to arrive. if you would like to upgrade to tracked be sure to add \u00a35 to your pledge Why Kickstarter? Why pre-orders? I've wanted to design and have produced enamel pins for a long time now but the up front costs are quite pricey. Funding through Kickstarter is easy, simple and allows flexibility for backers. Will your pins be available in your shop/cons? Yes, hopefully if I can get enough made, any left over will go into my shop and to sell at cons, but they will be at the higher price of \u00a37 a pin I have a question that wasn't answered here! Can I contact you? Sure! Feel free to DM me on here or over on my social medias :)",
  "Why Paint 100 Blue Face Paintings & Give them Away? Hi there. I'm Anna aka Bunny Glue. I'm an artist based in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Back in February I painted a blue face in acrylic on canvas. And then another. And just one more. Then I said to a friend, \"I'm going to paint one hundred of these.\" She shrugged and said, \"You're crazy.\" And so I painted until I dreamed blue faces. And it was amazing.\u00a0 By June 25th I had finished painting one hundred. Now I have 100 paintings that need homes. Couches to live over. Other people to admire them. And I need money to buy more paint and canvas. They need homes. So here's what I decided to do: 1. Give away 50 Paintings.  2. Swap 20 paintings for Karma. 3. Make a little pocket change (aka paint & canvas money) from choice. It's not as complicated as it sounds.\u00a0 Shipping to US/Canada included in basic shipping pricing. I'm happy to ship internationally, just contact me and I can figure out any additional cost based on your location. All of the money raised will go to art supplies, developing art projects and studio costs.\u00a0My funding goal of $600 covers the cost of canvas for the project which is about one quarter of the total project cost when you factor in the other supplies (paint, brushes, glassine, protective foam etc) and shipping for the art that is involved.\u00a0 What are the paintings like?  You can see the paintings and pick out your favorite here: http://www.bunnyglue.com/blue.html Each painting is a 12 inch square one inch thick canvas suitable for easy immediate hanging. The paintings are in acrylic and most of the paint used is Kroma artist grade (some of the early paintings were student grade paint) and all of the paint used is light fast. Each painting depicts a blue face. The sooner you back the project, the more likely you are to get the painting of your choice! Preferences will be prioritized based first on reward level and second based on when you backed the project. Other ways to help?\n\u2022\tLet your friends know about this project.\n\u2022\tLike me on Facebook.\n\u2022 \u00a0Follow me on Twitter. Thank you.\u00a0 You can see larger versions of the paintings at\u00a0http://www.bunnyglue.com/blue.html\u00a0but here is a quick preview",
  "Over the next year, I will be traveling across Michigan to hike more than 300 trails, all while documenting my travels through photographs. My goal is to share some of the most beautiful and remote places in Michigan, some of which can only be reached by foot on a hiking trail. Throughout my journey I also plan to inform and educate people across Michigan and beyond, about the importance of wildlife and nature conservation. To assist the Michigan Wildlife Conservancy in their efforts, I will be donating 10% of the proceeds from the photo book, after its published, to help ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy the outdoors.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, not only for me, but for all of us to experience Michigan in a way that so few have been able to thus far. Join me on my mission to bring this breathtaking photo book to life, so that those across the US, and the world, can appreciate the wonders of Michigan that I have been lucky enough to appreciate my entire life.  Michigan is one of the top trial states in the nation, with well over 650 hiking trails. Although I will only reach less than half of those trails over the course of a year, I hope to bring to life the remaining trails in the years to come.\u00a0",
  "DEMO. After the September 9th VZNBRAND launch, we have branched out and began working on and trying new things. VZNBRAND is entirely quality driven while maintaining superior design and concept, this is directly translated into the two part magazine that is \"DEMO\". DEMO is non-profit a summary of our love for everything. Initially, we wanted to do one magazine which focused on our own inspirations, creatives, and culture but as everything we do, it has snowballed into something else. It is with our pleasure to say that so far, nobody has turned down articles, interviews, and appearances in our magazine. This blessing is now allowing us to make this into a two-part publication, where we can focus on making this the best possible final product that can deliver all it is set out to.\u00a0 Both editions will release at the same time, and contain different artists, creatives, and cultural influencers. At this rate we have confirmed the artists and articles below, and have many others in the workings.\u00a0 DEMO Part One - Confirmed DEMO Part Two - Confirmed We are working on adding more people every day and we will provide the most balanced magazines that will surely shake up the journalism market. No alteration, no corporation. Pure content, pure culture.\u00a0",

  "Hi! I'm Audrey of Maintaining Mediocrity and together, we're going to take a tour across the great land of Ooo. Before we begin, please remember to keep your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the vehicle at all time. What's a Kickstarter? Kickstarter is a crowdfunding source where you help the creator bring their visions to life! In this case, a series of magical enamel pins. Think of it as a pre-order, but with extra benefits! Backers will receive frequent updates on the status of the pins during and after the campaign, a first look at the finished products, and most importantly, super super discounts!\u00a0 Why pledge? The prices listed for the Kickstarter are the cheapest I will ever be offering these pins. If you're fast enough to snag an Early Bird tier, you'll be getting a single pin for just $11- that's $4 cheaper than retail price! Standard tiers are still discounted at $13 per pin. All leftover pins will be sold in my shop for $15 each. Additionally, you will not be charged until the end of the Kickstarter. You can adjust your pledge higher or lower (or even cancel your pledge altogether) throughout the duration of the campaign. For more details on how to adjust your pledge, scroll down to Pledge Adjustment. All of the current Day and Night pins will be hard enamel, gold plated, with two back posts for double security. These will be heftyboy pins spanning 2.25\" across! As these are Day and Night sets, the pins are designed to be worn in pairs of 2 (as shown below). I've designed them to fit together in any combination, so you can wear a day and night set of one kingdom, or mix n match your own pairs! Now let\u2019s take a look at the designs! In addition to the Day and Night pins, I've also included my snail mini pins in the campaign. At 0.75\" across, these super tiny, kinda rude pins are the perfect size for discreet middle fingers (and they're great as board fillers, too)! For the Kickstarter only, these snails will be $5 each (retail price $7) and available in 6 colors: pink, blue, yellow, purple, green, and LICH (glow in the dark). Please add $5 per snail to your pledge and in the survey after the campaign, you'll be able to select which color(s) you'd like. At any time during the campaign, you can adjust your pledge higher or lower. Remember: you won't be charged until the Kickstarter ends on Sat 1/25 at 11:59 PST. For early bird backers: please manually add +$11 per pin to your current pledge. For standard tier backers (non-early bird): no math required! Simply select the new tier and Kickstarter will automatically adjust your pledge accordingly. To add a tiny snail pin: for both early bird and standard tier backers, please manually add +$5 per snail to your current pledge. To add a banana guard pin: for both early bird and standard tier backers, please manually add +$9 per banana guard to your current pledge. January 9 - January 25: Kickstarter campaign February - March: pin production! Please keep an eye out for updates which will contain the first look at these pins during and post production. March - April: if all goes smoothly, the products will be delivered to me and I can send them all out to you! Funding during this campaign will go towards: 10%: Kickstarter fees 30%: shipping supplies (mailers) and shipping rewards to backers 60%: pin production and backer cards",
  "\u00a0Who doesn't love pinnipeds?! These 4 pins represent some of our favorite mammals, whose survival all depend on the oceans we love. Okay, so they aren\u2019t ALL pinnipeds but, for puns sake we are rolling with it! We hope you wear/display our pins as talking points for these species! As always, wear something that means something. <3 If our project is successfully funded, we will send out reward surveys to our backers! The reward surveys will allow you to choose your pins! :) If our project is not funded to the $500 goal, you will not be charged and we will not receive funds for this project. This Kickstarter's initial funding goal is $500 USD. This will help us produce all 4 hard enamel pins as well as help to cover backing cards, Kickstarter fees, taxes, and shipping costs/supplies. Though $500 USD doesn't cover all the fees, it will help us off to a great start!\u00a0 Once the Kickstarter has ended and backer surveys are completed, all pins will go on to production! Production takes an estimated 5-8 weeks. Estimated timeline (if we reach our goal early, we will update this!): How do I pledge? Just click the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button on the campaign page or scroll down the page to select a reward tier! Do I get to choose my pins? \u00a0YES! If our project is successfully funded, meaning we reach our goal of $500 USD, we will send out surveys to all backers asking which pins you would like! \u00a0The reward surveys sent after the campaign ends will allow you to choose your pins! :) When are backers charged? If the project you\u2019re backing is successfully funded, your card will be charged when the project reaches its funding deadline. If the project does not reach its funding goal, your card is never charged. What forms of payment are accepted? You can use a debit or credit card associated with Visa, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, or American Express. Discover and JCB cards are currently only accepted for US-based projects. Kickstarter does not currently accept Maestro or Visa Electron cards. If using a pre-paid credit card, please make sure that the card has a value of at least $1 more than your pledge amount.

  "Gallows Bound would love to introduce themselves into the world of vinyl pressings, unfortunately the rising cost of this service versus the rising demand on the companies offering the service has created an unusually high cost transferred to the band wanting to release their music on the medium. It is no longer a secret that bands (local and national) rarely make enough money to provide them with the tools necessary to spread their music as far as they can and with being able to offer multiple mediums from today's contemporary download cards and CD's to yesteryear's cassette tapes and vinyl records, we as musicians are able to reach a broad variety of listeners and collectors who may never have heard our music simply because of the device they prefer to experience it with! Thank you for looking and for considering your donation to our project!",
  "Hello there! I'm Kirar, and I'm the tiny creator of K-Poppin' Pins. I've always loved doodling, and recently I've decided to take the leap to make my drawings into enamel pins! I've self-funded my first three pins to start my small shop out, but I'm hoping I can expand in the future. \u2665 You can check them out here on\u00a0my Instagram! Whether you are a certified Orbit or just love magic potion bottles, these pins are sure to give that starry-eyed feeling when you put them on! These potion-themed pins are inspired by the solo music videos of LOONA's Odd Eye Circle members: Kim Lip, JinSoul, and Choerry. Thank you for checking out my Kickstarter! Even if you're not planning on pledging, please share this on social media if you like the designs so that we can be closer to making them a reality together! \u2665 All pins are hard enamel and gold-plated. The back has 2 pin posts with black rubber clutches and a \"K-Poppin' Pins\" backstamp. \u201cThis is Eclipse, I can't keep my eyes off, so will you be with me continuously?\u201d\u00a0 An eclipse-themed elixir, featuring an eclipse with continuous love! (Or the squiggles off of Kim Lip's shirt, you decide!) A sweet little betta fish swimming through the stars in a jar? What's not to love? Go singing in the rain with this pin attached to your raincoat! Or not, I won't stop you. ;) A cherry love potion? A mirror portal in a potion? You can bet your buns that it's all that and more! Ah-ah-ah-imagine what would happen if you drank it! (Please do not drink your pin.) Funding for this project will go towards production, packaging, and delivery of the pins! If the project is fully funded, backer surveys will be sent after the project to confirm shipping addresses and which rewards you want. Please double check your shipping address to avoid shipping delays and reduce the risk of your package getting lost! All packages are shipped via the U.S. Postal Service. All USA orders will include tracked shipping. International orders will be shipped with tracking, but the tracking details may not update (usually after it reaches your country) depending on your country's postal service. Please note that you are responsible for any taxes, fees, or VAT associated with receiving your item if you are outside of the USA.",
  "Hello! My name is Stefanie and I'm a freelance cartoonist. I've been working in artist alleys on and off for the last few years, and I want to make the great leap into doing enamel pins. Recently I made my first pin, and it was a big success! I want to make another for the Make 100 here on kickstarter, and I knew exactly what i wanted to make. For a long time I've always enjoyed drawing animal skulls, and for this I wanted something related to where I currently live: California. BEAR SKULL AND POPPIES will be a 1.5\" gold hard enamel pin in creme, golden orange and accents of green and white. I will be doing a limited run of 100 for these pins.",
  "To start out 2020 I have a trio of unrelated cat designs. \u00a0I have several larger more cohesive 'collections' that I want to release this year, so solo pins like these either need to have very short KS campaigns or be grouped together like this. \u00a0(I have another unrelated design that will be getting the one to two week treatment.) I completely understand that these may have different audiences so don't feel bad if you are only interested in one of these designs! My kids love for me to tell bedtime stories. \u00a0These stories often star their stuffed animals. \u00a0They have this little set of kitties that they love dearly. \u00a0One multi-chapter story involved a ninja kitty who trained their kitties as ninja so that they could team up and help him defeat an evil sorcerer. I designed 5 separate Ninja Kitties, but have chosen to have Snowflake as a ninja made into a pin. \u00a0Who knows, if this one is well received I may try to do the others at a later date.\u00a0 If you have ever simultaneously owned a cat and a laptop this design likely speaks to you. \u00a0Kitties love warm cozy places to nap and as we all know, if kitty fits, kitty sits! There are two things that are certain in life, death and coffee. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Late in 2019 my kitty of 14 years passed away. \u00a0I actually thought she was going to pass in 2017, so I was glad to get the extra time with her. \u00a0I wanted to do something as a tribute to her passing but given her rough personality a kitty with wings and a halo just didn't work for me. \u00a0I ended up designing this Kitty Reaper. \u00a0As for the coffee cup, well I like coffee. \u00a0Maybe the reaper decided to take a little coffee break in 2017. \u00a0 Here's to you, Lily!\u00a0 \u00a0My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. I am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins. \u00a0Many of my previous designs are available for sale through my online shop, frostdragondesigns.com. All of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers. I love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives. Every pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!",
  "I plan on completing a 50+ piece series depicting the abundant wildlife of my home state of Montana. The animals selected will encompass the majority of Montana's mammals, birds, and fish. The stylistic manner in which I will approach these works, is a new, still developing technique that blends realism and cartooning. This strategy allows me to capture each animals personality, while accurately depicting its real life colors, markings, and textures. I find this style not only teaches the viewer about the biology of the animal, but also draws the viewer into a personal relationship with animal. My inspiration for this series came from my flagship painting attached to this project, the \"Bored\"-eal Owl. Budget Breakdown The first\u00a0expense of this project will be canvases. I intend to somewhat match the animals actual size to the canvas size, therefore canvases will range in size from 2x4 in. up to 4x6 ft. I\u00a0stretch my own canvases\u00a0that are over 16x20 in. in order to save money.\u00a0 $100 for wood for frames, $50 for \u00a0raw canvas, $50 for smaller canvases =$200 The final expenses for this project includes acrylic paint, spray paint and acrylic medium. Using large canvases and the vast number of pieces in this series will require a lot of paint. The acrylic medium allows me to capture more depth, while enhancing color. $40 for acrylic paint, $40 for acrylic medium, $20 spray paint (background texture) =$300.00 \u00a0If you have any questions feel free to contact me at a.grensten@gmail.com.

  "Well, hello there! \u00a0 Thanks for stopping by. \u00a0We're so glad you found us! \u00a0We're really hard to find, given that you can barely see our shop unless you're within 20 feet, standing in the middle of the street! \u00a0;) \u00a0 That's why we're doing this. \u00a0We sorely need signage that sticks out and grabs attention, but we're spending all our money to make chocolate - AMAZING VEGAN CHOCOLATE - which really solves all of the difficult problems in life! \u00a0 But, if nobody discovers our shop, then nobody buys our chocolate, then the world is one less vegan chocolate maker... which, we're hard to come by! \u00a0Please support our little fundraiser so we can get noticed so we can spread the message that vegan doesn't mean boring and gross. \u00a0 Here's what we're looking to do: - Install a perpendicular sign that sticks out so all the the cool folks on Elmwood can see our shop from the next block, and make it their next destination! \u00a0 - Fix up the big brick \"artwork\" wall outside our shop. \u00a0We already have landlord approval to paint over the present art and we want to put something up that is equally as awesome! \u00a0We're hoping to paint a very cool triquetra and install a small sign that our shop is just inside. \u00a0 - We also want to install new outdoor lights (those are way more expensive and BIGGER than you think!) so we can really command attention once the sun sets. \u00a0Currently only one of the outdoor lights work and they are both broken and dilapidated. \u00a0 - Lastly, we'd love to get some attention grabbing sail signs that we can put outside our shop for special events or bring with us to festivals and markets! \u00a0We want them to say \"vegan\" and \"chocolate\" so we can be noticed from way far away! \u00a0 THANK YOU. \u00a0Thank you for saving our planet. \u00a0Thank you for loving animals, and loving people, and sustaining the earth. \u00a0Thank you for enjoying our great chocolate. \u00a0",
  "Harnessing the amazing power of chia and hemp seeds (and a love of puns), Naked Hippie Snacks bars are made with the highest quality organic, gluten-free and vegan ingredients for a delicious and healthy snack on-the-go.\u00a0 \u00a0 Before now, it's been quite impossible to find a vegan protein bar that was free of soy and gluten and that tasted good. Naked Hippie Snacks is one of the first snack bars on the market that uses\u00a0hemp seeds as a plant-based protein source. And it's delicious! The High on Protein bar combines hemp seeds, peanuts, figs and a medley of seeds for a taste that is reminiscent of a PB & J sandwich. The 56g bar clocks in at 250 calories, 6g of fiber and 10g of protein. It really is the best tasting, most natural protein bar out there! In addition to our vegan protein bar, we make a line of vegan snack bars that are just as healthy, but not as high in protein. These bars come in the following flavors: Off The Walnut,\u00a0which tastes like an oatmeal raisin cookie; Fudge N' Coconut,\u00a0a titillating trio of fair-trade, vegan dark chocolate, tart cherries and tropical coconut; Apricot Zing,\u00a0a healthy remake of a cranberry orange muffin; and Banana Bliss,\u00a0our twist on a vegan banana cream pie. Each bar is made with 10 or fewer ingredients, which even your kids can pronounce and understand. The base of the snack bar features organic, gluten-free oats, organic chia and flax seeds, and organic maple syrup. Next, we add slightly toasted\u00a0nuts, organic and un-sulfured dried fruits, and maybe some vegan, fair-trade dark chocolate or organic coconut, depending on the flavor. And unlike other bars on the market, Naked Hippie bars contain absolutely no soy, no gums, and no ingredients labeled \u201cnatural flavors.\u201d\u00a0 Naked Hippie bars have gone through over two years of experimentation and taste-testing to ensure that they are not only more flavorful than any other bar, but also offer more balanced nutrition. Each ingredient is hand-picked for its health benefits, even our sweeteners. Here are our stats: each 52g bar has 250 calories or less, 6g of fiber, 6g of protein,\u00a0at least 1600mg of Omega-3, 12g of sugar from organic maple syrup and dried fruits.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"I absolutely loooove your bars! I tried one a couple of days ago at Romancing the Bean and I've been obsessed ever since! *heart eyes emoji*\"-Rebecca S. \"These bars are so good, I ate them all.\"-Jenna T. \"It\u2019s crazy! I\u2019ve come to realize I\u2019m addicted to these bars. If somehow I get too distracted and don\u2019t have one when I should\u2026I suddenly crave it and have to reorganize my priorities!!!! They taste good and ARE good.\"-Terry G. \"I LOVE these bars! I was given the opportunity to try the bars with the drizzled chocolate on them and felt my chocolate craving satiated. The fact there are no flour products whatsoever in any of the Naked Hippie Snacks makes them a perfect choice for those who need to be gluten-free in their lives. I\u2019m a chocolate lover with a massive sweet tooth and all the snacks take care of my cravings, yet are so much more healthy than a candy bar or cookie! Awesome job!\"-Kathy A. \"These are amazing for protein bars, The texture is good, and the flavor is perfect to me. So many protein bars have a heavy flavor or are sweet, this one avoids both. I never thought I would find a protein bar I liked.\"-Sheryl H. \u00a0 Chia seeds Containing a larger amount of omega-3 fatty acids than salmon, chia seeds are also very high in fiber (40% fiber by weight) and contain up to 14% protein by weight. They are high in antioxidants and studies have found that they may improve cardiovascular risk factors in Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0 Hemp seeds Considered the most nutritious seed in the world, hemp seeds are a complete protein with a highly concentrated balance of protein, essential Omega-3 and 6 fatty acids, and vitamins and minerals such as Magnesium, Vitamin E and Zinc. Flaxseeds A tablespoon of flaxseeds contains 1800 mg of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, an ingredient needed to carry out normal bodily functions. The daily consumption of flax may also play a role in preventing diabetes and lowering the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u00a0 Oats Organic, gluten-free oatmeal is unprocessed, high in fiber and rich in protein.  Among its benefits are the stabilization of blood sugar levels to gently pace your body\u2019s nutrition absorption rate and the removal of bad cholesterol.\u00a0 Almonds A single serving of almonds has nearly 50% of your daily recommended Vitamin E intake. This vitamin has been shown to reduce the risks of cancer.\u00a0 Maple syrup In addition to being incredibly delicious and vegan, organic maple syrup has recently been discovered as a super food, much like broccoli and blueberries. Research from the University of Rhode Island has found that maple syrup contains compounds that may help manage Type 2 diabetes, prevent cancer and reduce inflammation. The 54 compounds in maple syrup all work together to create a natural sweetener that inhibits enzymes from converting carbohydrates to sugar and provides the body with essential vitamins and minerals including zinc, manganese, B2, biotin, calcium, Vitamin A, and many more.\u00a0 \u00a0 According to the Harvard School of Public Health, Omega-3 and Omega-6 are essential fatty acids, meaning they are required by our bodies to carry out vital functions, like building cell membranes in the brain and keeping bones strong. The problem in the Western diet is two-fold: we don\u2019t get nearly enough Omega-3 fatty acids as we need and we consume way too much Omega-6 in the form of soybean and corn oils found in many fast food and overly processed foods. Human bodies require no more than 4 times as much Omega-6 as Omega-3 fatty acids, but our current diets are filled with over 40 times as much. \u00a0Naked Hippie bars contain a 1:2 ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6, that when paired with a more balanced daily diet, closes the gap between the two.\u00a0 \u00a0 For the past two years, Naked Hippie Snacks has been operating as a Cottage Food Kitchen business, meaning that we make the bars out of our home kitchen. Under the Cottage Food Act, we can only sell in Los Angeles County. We have been successful locally, selling out at coffee shops, grocery stores and artisan food fairs. Everyone who tastes these bars absolutely loves them.\u00a0 While producing these bars at home and selling them in LA has been a great way to start out and gauge people's interest, it has been difficult to earn the capital we need to expand to a commercial kitchen. We want to produce in a commercial kitchen so we can ship nationally and share our healthy and delicious snacks with everyone.\u00a0 The funds we receive through this campaign will go toward three aspects of the business. It will fund rent and staff at our own commercial kitchen, the purchase of specialty, medium-scale equipment for production and packaging, and promotional materials and efforts such as distribution, trade shows, marketing and sales staff. Rather than sharing a kitchen with other producers, we would like to produce out of our own commercial kitchen so we can control and prevent contaminants such as animal products, gluten, soy, etc. Start the year off right with healthy, vegan snacks! If your New Year Resolution is to eat healthy, our bars will help you stay on track. Some of our rewards include a custom-designed Naked Hippie Snacks T-shirt. JUST BECAUSE OUR SNACKS ARE NAKED DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD BE!\u00a0Cover up your naughty bits with our T-shirt that's fun, fresh and vintage-inspired. Here's a little peek at what it looks like: \u00a0",

  "We have embarked on an exciting project to record our debut album (12 songs in total) with past and present members of the band. Years of playing, writing, laughing and performing all coming together to create an unique and eclectic album. We have funded the project ourselves this far but we've hit a block in the road. These things are expensive!!! The money you pledge will be used for mixing, mastering, duplicating, distributing and marketing our songs. We have 12 musicians in total including guest vocalists all with a different tones and qualities. We are from different musical backgrounds and walks of life but have joined forces to make a transatlantic, ericana vibe with lots of off-beat quirky zaniness. Its a celebration of the life and times of Wookalily. It's been a great experience to make this music and we hope you all get to enjoy it as well. We are using Millbank Studios in Lisburn and the much sought after and talented sound engineer Michael Mormecha. \u00a0 A word from Michael...\"it's the first of it's kind to come out of Northern Ireland and it's been really fun to make\" www.millbankstudios.net www.facebook.com/wookalily www.wookalily.com",

  "Hi! Thank you for taking a minute to check out the official VURRITO\u2122 Kickstarter!\u00a0 VURRITO\u2122 is the first of its kind; a whole-food, plant-based, fast-casual restaurant. VURRITO\u2122 sources only fresh, local and 100% Vegan ingredients. We intend on opening the fist VURRITO\u2122 location in Providence, RI. Oh, and did we mention? We\u2019re going to change the world! So picture this - you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re tired, maybe you're on your lunch break and don\u2019t have much time. You want something quick but don\u2019t want to sacrifice quality. You want something good for you but don\u2019t want to sacrifice flavor. You want something that\u2019s going to taste great and make you feel good inside and out - you\u2019ve just walked into VURRITO\u2122. \u00a0 \u00a0 VURRITO\u2122 is going to change how the world eats. We understand that the best dining experience always starts with locally sourced, fresh ingredients. The food looks amazing and the aromas are captivating. There are flavor profiles throughout the dishes and you leave feeling good about yourself. Our focus is for every guest to have that experience - to have the opportunity to make a choice that is healthy, sustainable, familiar, delicious, cruelty-free, and environmentally friendly. \n\nEach dish on VURRITO\u2019s menu is made up entirely from whole-foods and vegetables. We\u2019re talking sweet potatoes, eggplant, portobello mushrooms, peppers, avocados, summer squash, black beans and corn. Even our salsa, rice and desserts are fresh and unique. \n\nThis is Mexican inspired cuisine - there are no limits.\u00a0 It's VURRITO\u2019s goal to exceed your expectations when you choose to visit us.\n\nThe current \u201cquick and easy\u201d options are not good for us and we know it. They leave us feeling sick and unsatisfied. The problem that exists here is that there are no alternatives to this fast, cheap, low-quality food that has saturated the market. With this \"quick and easy\" food comes artificial ingredients, harmful additives, and pesticides. Add in growth hormones, antibiotics, and the mass bred, mistreated animals and you have a recipe for disaster. Only now are we starting to realize that animal agriculture is one of the largest, if not THE largest contributor to global warming. It doesn\u2019t have to stay that way. People are waking up and realizing that it\u2019s time to fight back. It\u2019s time to take control of the food we produce and consume. We must move forward as human beings and we must focus on ourselves, generations to come, and on our planet. It\u2019s time to make a difference. It\u2019s time to eat what\u2019s right! We need your help. We know VURRITO\u2122 will be successful. The only thing left in question is WHERE do we start. We\u2019re asking for $28,000 to help get the doors open on the first VURRITO\u2122 location. Our end goal is to be everywhere. This is not just about us. It\u2019s about everyone. It\u2019s about you, it\u2019s about supporting the farmers we buy our produce from, it\u2019s about our local community, it\u2019s about our health, it\u2019s about the millions upon millions of mistreated animals. It\u2019s about our planet, it\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right. VURRITO\u2122 is the future. Will you help be a part of it? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "My name is Vladlena and I have decided to challenge myself and produce 30 Watercolor paintings during 30 days. I will try to do 1 painting per day. The paintings will be painted on A4 size 300GSM watercolor paper with high quality watercolors. Will be signed and dated in front and at the back. I've started painting in 2010, when I accidentally discovered the talent in me and my friends started telling me that I do paint well. I mainly concentrated on acrylic paints, but then I discovered watercolors and fell in love with them )) I am constantly experimenting with different styles, so that  get the feel of paints. I enjoy vibrant colors and bits of fantasy. Please have a look at some of my watercolor works: There are many more, you can find them on my DevianArt page: http://vladepas.deviantart.com/ You might have questions what is the \"Secret Collection\" that I mentioned in the Rewards Section. I will explain: The \"Secret Collection\" - is the collection of 15 watercolor paintings in A5 or A4 format. They feature the style that I have recently come up with and nobody has seen it yet. If you want to be the first one to see it - WELCOME!\u00a0\u00a0 )) That's my story! I am very excited about this project and want it to be completed very soon )) I will greatly appreciate your support. Keep an eye on the updates.  Also, if you have any ideas of what you want to see being painted, let me know ) Thanks!",
  "Baseball. Stories and poems have been written about it;\u00a0 Movies have been made\u00a0of it.\u00a0 And the one thing they all have in common is the baseball field. Even though the dimensions of every baseball field are specifically regulated and exactly the same, featuring a 90 foot infield square, every ball field is decidedly different. These old ballparks are like cathedrals in America. We don't have big old Gothic cathedrals like they do in Europe. But we got baseball parks.\u00a0 ~ Jimmy Buffett I, like so many Americans, have a deep love of baseball. It started when I was a kid and my parents took me to ball games and I have never been able to shake it. When I go to a game, it is like a spiritual experience\u2026.each ball park a unique church. I want to capture the individuality of the 30 major league ball fields on canvas \u2013 a painting of every field. \u201cBaseball, it is said, is only a game. True. And the Grand Canyon is only a hole in Arizona.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 ~ George F. Will  So far I have had the good fortune to see ball games at 16 of the 30 ball parks currently being used by the teams of Major League Baseball. And while I do have a few favorites, I like them all. I am pretty sure other baseball fans feel the same way I do about going to a ball park.\u00a0Baseball fans are passionate about baseball and have very definite ideas about any changes that are made to our fields.

Each painting will be at least 16\" x 20\" and most will be 18\" x 24\".\u00a0 Because of the way I paint I will probably produce some smaller baseball themed paintings based on other images I have of the parks and of some scenes at the park.\u00a0 I will document the entire process with information on each park as well as photos of the painting process in a catalog (book) featuring all the finished paintings.

  "Dear Community, at first of all, sorry for our bad english.  We are three young men from Germany and have a big dream, which we would like to imagine. First, a few words to us: We called Philipp, Axel and Dominic and come from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany. We are 20 and 21 years old. We are all three avid nature lovers and at the same time absolute sports car fans. Our dream is to hold special places and moments of our earth with photosensitive material and to share with the entire world through various social media sites. Specifically, we would like to make videos with a drone from most beautiful places on earth. Moreover, beautiful and high-resolution images of landscapes and said locations. As we mentioned above, we are even extremely large sports cars fans, we have created a blog or a Facebook page and post their daily new pictures of special cars, which we of course have photographed themselves.

  "I have three new paintings that I\u2019m really excited about and I want to create a run of prints of each of them.  The printer I\u2019d like to use is Joseph C Woodard. They\u2019re a family run \nbusiness- which employs local artists and the sons and the daughter of \nthe original founder. They have a large offset printer and they\u2019ll be \nable to make beautiful (18\" x 24\") poster size prints. The printer will use\n 80 pound acid-free paper that contains 10 percent post-consumer \ncontent- the paper is FSC certified and archival quality and the inks \nare vegetable based.  I'll ship your prints rolled in protective acid-free paper and placed in a sturdy cardboard tube. Other rewards include: These cards measure 4.25\" x 5.25\" each. I'll package all nine up together and ship you the bundle of them.  These large postcards measure (5\"x7\"). I'll sign the back, add a stamp, and mail it to you.  Both the greeting cards and postcards are made using offset printing. The paper comes from trees harvested under the Sustainable\n Forest Initiative. It is also FSC (Forestry Stewardship Council) \napproved, processed without environmentally harmful bleach and \nchlorine agents, and made from 100% post-consumer \nrecycled fiber. How do I specify which prints I want? Once the campaign is over and the prints are finished, I'll send you a quick survey via Kickstarter. You'll specify on the survey exactly which print(s) you want.  How do I give you more information for delivery?  On the same survey where you specify your reward- you'll also be able to fill out your shipping address, apartment number etc.  Thank You! Thank you taking the time to watch the video and read through this. And thank you for your support!",
  "I hope you find the prospect of this idea as exciting as I do. I love to draw, but I want you to push me onwards. Every \u00a31 donated gives me 1 more minute to work on my painting.  This is going to be a series, based on its popularity, and I'll be exploring a variety of media (this one being a painting). I'll be producing these pieces of art with your backing. The more you back, the longer I'll work on it. Keep me busy!  If you donate enough, you'll get to have some creative input. At the end, you'll all get a copy of the artwork - whether it's a printable digital copy, a life size print, or you may well be the owner!  The location for this piece will be in the hidden gem that is\u00a0Home Park, in Surrey, near Kingston Upon Thames, UK. Historical deer hunting grounds for Saxon Kings, the descendants of those deer still inhabit the parkland. I'll try and capture a couple in the painting (not in real life, you have to be royalty, and I'll end up in the tower of London or something). Get me started, you control the painting! Get interactive with your backing!",
  "\u00a0\u201cLluvia de Peces\u201d (Rain of Fish) is a phenomenon that is said to have taken place annually for more than a century in Yoro, Honduras.\u00a0It's believed to have started with Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel Subirana, a Spanish Catholic missionary who visited Honduras from 1856-1864. Upon seeing so many poor people, he prayed for three days and three nights asking God for a miracle to provide the people with food. It has been raining fish ever since. The fish are all about six-inches long and are completely blind. Even stranger is that these particular fish are not found in any of the surrounding bodies of water.  Each painting is a visual representation of a particular story with the colors, patterns, clothing, animals, people, and architecture from that region.\u2028\u2028 I begin each piece by researching the oral literature and imagery, and then creating a loose drawing of the key characters. I then draw the images in chalk onto a black canvas, building upon the colors in layers to add depth and vibrancy. The black background creates dramatic shadows that i really love.  Every story has a lesson, moral or societal mores for children and adults alike. Stories help us remember who we are, where we came from, and even what the future could hold if we repeat the same mistakes. Many of my paintings tell the story of poverty, power, greed, and love. The lessons are, I hope, timeless. Television and other cultural forces have diluted storytelling as a tool of communicating, learning, and healing, and I want to make people curious about the stories of Central and South America. I want people to become curious again about story, about culture, and about people. The funds raised during this campaign will go toward purchasing art supplies for all of the pieces, securing a gallery for the event, creating Kickstarter rewards, shipping, packaging, project management, media development, taxes, etc. Here are the reward images that will be offered in various sizes: Thank you so much for checking out the project! I hope that you'll partner with me in creating this exhibition and please spread the word! -Laura Blaker",
  "Hello! My name is Peggy Seymour and I'm from London. I am a self-employed jewellery designer/maker/seller by day and, unknown to most, a portrait artist by night.\u00a0 I hid my secret identity quite effectively for over a decade but have finally decided to take my painting seriously and pursue my life-long dream of making a living out of art. To cut a long story short, I had a traumatic art education which basically crushed my confidence and the desire to paint and draw right out of me. As a result I totally lost my way artistically and didn't pick up a paintbrush again for another ten years. During that time I found other ways of venting my creativity through design work of various kinds but it never truly felt like me and I never really stopped thinking about painting. It has always been my big \"what if?\".\u00a0 So, fast forward to now. I've conquered my fears, picked up my paintbrush and actually applied paint to canvas. Now I'm ready to show the world what I've got. This is where you, dear reader, come in. Juggling my art with trying to bring in a decent wage is super-difficult. As a self-employed person I am entirely responsible for my own income. Right now, when I'm painting, I'm not earning anything and with every painting taking upwards of 30 hours to complete, progress is slow and money is tight.\u00a0 On top of that I'm completely unknown. I have no fans, no following. I've never sold my oil paintings before. I'm a total rookie. Art with My Heart is a project designed to keep me painting, develop my skills as a portrait artist and share what I am learning whilst doing it.\u00a0 I believe the best way to improve my painting is to paint. Every time I create a new piece I learn something new and stretch myself further. I've already learnt so much since I started painting again but I desperately need your help to keep it going.\u00a0 With your support I want to create 12 brand new portraits of humans against black backdrops. I love painting people, especially against black. The light and dark contrast is extra intense and the skin colours really pop. There's a sort of silence about it. With no noisy distractions in the background you can just focus on the awesomeness of the human form and all the emotion it can convey. It's really very beautiful. But that's not all! I want to share my learning process with you. I'll be taking work in progress photographs of everything I do and writing notes on my painting technique discoveries as I go along. All this will be available through a backers only blog and in much more detail in a PDF\u00a0Method Book which will contain in-progress shots, close-ups showing every tiny brush stroke and, if I can work out how to make them, links to time-lapse videos of me actually painting.\u00a0 I'm completely self-taught and the process has been very frustrating and lonely but, if you'll allow me, I'd like to share everything I know with you. Every portrait I create as part of this project will be included in my Catalogue of Work PDF along with the ones I have already created. It will be like an exhibition in electronic form. The process of creating each portrait will also be documented for my backers only blog and PDF Method Book. The portraits from the \u00a3125 reward will be kept by me as a starter portfolio to approach galleries with. Portraits from the \u00a375, \u00a3250, \u00a3475 and \u00a3500 rewards will, of course, be shipped straight to their owners on completion. They will be shipped flat, just so you know. Your support will enable me to pay for: Rewards: I am offering the following super-special rewards in return for your pledge. Have a look to the right for full details and estimated delivery dates. Please note that the Catalogue of Work and the Method book will be emailed to you at the conclusion of the project so I can include all the portraits I create. I'm thinking this will be some time in December 2013. I am so happy to be painting again. It's a scary feeling to finally share my art with the world but it's also joyful and exhilarating.\u00a0 Portraiture is the very best thing I know how to do and the opportunity to create art full-time would be a dream come true for me and would allow me to find where I left my painting career, pick it up and run with it. Remember, that without your support I simply cannot do this. If my project does not reach its \u00a33,500 goal I will get nothing and I will be very, very sad. Do something amazing with your day. Become a patron of the British arts and help me realise my dream at the same time. This one will also be available as a choice for all postcard/print rewards. Thank you so much for taking the time to read about my Kickstarter project. Please help me spread the word by sharing it with others if you can.",
  "Cast Party Nightmare is a short \u00a070s-80s style slasher film, that follows a cast of high school grads. After their final theater performance, they decide to get a few motel rooms to hold their senior cast party before each going their separate ways.\u00a0Little do they know that they're being picked off one by one, while they're distracted by their interpersonal conflicts.\u00a0 \u00a0A screenwriter wrote our script and we're also currently working on some digitally drawn posters inspired by 1970s and 80s Horror Movie posters. Almost everyone working behind the scenes of this film is a college student, or recent high school graduate. \u00a0And we were fortunate enough to have a screenwriter write our script. \u00a0 Shooting for the film is set to take place in June 2021.\u00a0 This is an all-or-nothing fundraiser so if we don't reach our full goal, we will not be able to go through with our project \u2014 so we've got a lot of work to do. The funds of this film will be going towards:",

  "2020. A year where the unpredictable became the predictable. We all have woken up to shocking headlines week to week, sometimes day to day, and there was one news story that really caught my attention and imagination: Several prisons across the United States started releasing \"non-violent\" inmates in an effort to stop potential outbreaks of a virus that was spreading world-wide. According to many sources, some violent inmates slipped through the cracks and were released.\u00a0 I immediately knew I wanted to make a horror film based loosely on this development. \u00a0For decades, I've had my own unique and terrifying approach to a film I love dearly: John Carpenter's \"Halloween.\" All I needed was an original and very grounded angle to get into the story of the night HE came home.\u00a0 And now I have one. Michael Myers killed his older sister when he was six years old on Halloween night. No motive. No emotion. No remorse. Dr. Samuel Loomis was placed to help Michael and try to understand him. However, Dr. Loomis has an ability he is mostly unaware of: He can reach into other's minds and spirit. He can see things about people that they can't see for themselves. What he sees in young Michael's eyes is summed up as pure evil.\u00a0 Through the years as Michael has grown, he hasn't spoken a word. He hasn't caused any fights, has never had behavioral problems and just stares at the wall. Several attempts to move Michael into a psychiatric facility have been unsuccessful because of Dr. Loomis's insistence. This is the \"one success\" that Loomis claims when it comes to Michael.\u00a0 Suddenly, Loomis finds himself in a horrifying situation. The prison that Michael has been locked away in for nearly twenty years is releasing qualifying inmates. This action is to reduce prison population to avoid potential spread of a deadly virus that has been sweeping the globe. Based on his behavioral reputation, Michael Myers has been selected and set free as he is now considered to be a non-violent threat to society. A person with a troubled childhood but a clean seventeen year prison record.\u00a0 Feeling the crushing weight of guilt for preventing Michael from being relocated to a psychiatric facility -where he would have never been released- Dr. Samuel Loomis rushes to Michael's hometown of Haddonfield to warn the citizens that Myers is on his way. Most importantly, to locate a young woman named Laurie Strode and revealed who she really is and why Michael is coming for her. How does this doctor know the carnage Michael is seeking in Haddonfield? Dr. Loomis once saw into the mind and spirit of Michael Myers.\u00a0 A part of him never escaped. \"The Shape of Halloween\" is being filmed in and around Salt Lake City, Utah. This is where the theatrical sequels \"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers\" and \"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\" were filmed in the 1980's. Our production will be filming on the very streets of those two films, bringing a really special connection to our fan film and the actual \"Halloween\" film legacy. There will also be several building and other locations used in our film that appeared in those sequels.\u00a0 The script is terrifying. To say that we pulled out all the stops is to say you only read the first twenty pages. It is so much more than that. Beneath all the mayhem that unspools over the course of our story, we silently dig into the psychology of Samuel Loomis, Laurie Strode and the characters that populate Haddonfield. We reach deeply into the emotions of the characters as they navigate through the thrill ride that is \"The Shape of Halloween.\" \u00a0\u00a0 Production is scheduled to start mid-October for a release early next year. With the funds we raise from this campaign, we will be investing solely in new and updated film equipment so the film can be made and brought to life the best it can be. I'm Brett James Bishop, the writer and director of \"The Shape of Halloween.\" I have been a huge fan of John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" since I was a kid. In my teens, the game was upped by the \"Scream\" films and I have been making small horror films for friends and family since high school. Finally ready and excited to branch off on my own within the world of horror films for the world to experience, I want to kick it off with this personal vision of a story that I've had in my head for decades. A new perspective of the night HE came home.. The story of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode has always fascinated me. Not to mention the story of Dr. Samuel Loomis and Michael Myers. I'm a writer that loves to find and explore the WHY of the story and characters. \"The Shape of Halloween\" is far from a dumb slasher flick. There are story elements that might even surprise you that we present.\u00a0 I am also very excited to bring together a very diverse cast and crew that will represent equality across the board. My work previous to this project was a fan film in 2016 titled, \"Batman: Sins of the Past\" that broke out to global praise. I am also a published writer, producer and actor. I've been studying film for the past decade, primarily the past several years.\u00a0",

  "\u00a0 \u00a0Hello PlayStation 4 fans, thanks for taking a look at our project. Since its release a little over 3 years ago, the PlayStation 4 console has gone on to shift over 40 million units and captured the hearts of all PlayStation fans new, and old.\u00a0 At PlayStation4magazine.com\u00a0we take pride in serving this community with well researched and written news items, reviews and features. As a result our online PS4 magazine has continued to grow from strength to strength. The interest we have seen in the service we provide has led us to believe that our readers would be better served if they could access PS4 mag on their mobile devices. A PlayStation 4 Magazine app would make the content our readers love the most easily available to them at the tap of a button.\u00a0 As the site is currently run by volunteer contributors dedicating their time, we decided to turn to the kickstarter community for help. Please support our project and help us build the best PS4 news app anyone can find on the iOS and Android app stores. If achieved, our goal will be used to purchase the software and technical help required to create the PS4 Mag apps. Our promise to all our prospective backers is that the PS4 Mag app will always be free to download and use for those who wish to do so. The plan is that once the PS4 Mag app build is complete, we will either be partnering with a media company that can distribute the applications on iOS and Android app stores and platforms or using a 3rd party solution to create and manage the apps ourselves. The route that we take will depend on the pledges secured in this campaign. Going forwards, any revenues raised through advertising will be used to hire paid contributors and cover any operational costs. Sony is continually innovating and improving the PS4 gaming experience with hardware such as the upcoming PlayStation VR Virtual Reality system and many more titles lined up for the console. Our goal is to be able to share the journey with you all the way, on the favourite browsing device of your choice!",
  "Bitchtopia Magazine was started as a college project, looking to give feminist voices a platform to educate. We've shared important literature, interviewed inspiring women, published moving art, and offered up a feminist prospective that readers could relate to. You may be asking, why change it?\u00a0 Though Bitchtopia has seen immense success since its inception, it's time for us to graduate. Each of our contributors, editors, and social media mavens have worked extremely hard and have seen so much personal growth. It's only fair that our publication grow with them. Rose Water Magazine will still be feminist. We hope that our art and commentary through the feminist lens will trickle down and nurture and educate our readers. Rose Water will be intersectional, thought-provoking, and creative.\u00a0 With more funding, we will be able to hold workshops for our current and new contributors and also offer them compensation for their published work. \u00a0 Our funding will also be used to compensate our editors and social media team. We also hope to have more live events in our future, and have opportunities take this online community of smart feminist folks offline. Mostly, we're excited to continue our journey in harboring a positive place for people to create art through the feminist critique.\u00a0",

  "Vector Penguin would like to bring a new set of banner pins to life. With your help we would like to fund 4 new banners to add to our current selection of pins. The main goal is to cover most of the production on 4 main colors: yellow, red, green and blue. The individual pieces will be .6 inches tall, and linked together with 6mm rings to create a 4 inch long pin. With a post on each side, these pins make great collar accents or can be used to decorate your bag or jacket. Please find the Rainbow Banner Pin below for reference. Upon request, Book Blue will unlock at $700 with an alternative metal option for those that have read the books and know what I'm hinting at. :) Copper metal will be used in place of Bronze (which is not available). If you would like to help fund the project and snag a copy of either the Rainbow or Patriotic Banner Pin, add $15 for each of these banners. If you would like to grab an additional House/Team banner but do not wish to change your pledge amount, please add $14 to your pledge. Money will be allocated as follows: 60% for production, 30% for packaging and shipping and 10% for Kickstarter fees. $500 does not cover the complete cost of production, but will help a great deal.

  "Three nights ago I sat down and started rehearsing some songs I have been working on with a\u00a01950's Patrician Harmony\u00a0guitar that my father-in-law, Hank Mackie, gave me this past Christmas. \u00a0As each song lead in to the other I felt this connection in how the songs were relating to each other. \u00a0I began scribbling down the order of the songs I was singing and realized I had just sang 9 songs in a row, in an order I had not intended, but I was for certain it was the track list of what is going to be my new record..... I am about to record one of FOUR new albums set to release in 2014. \u00a0This one happens to be the GWM (Graham Wilkinson Music) SOLO/Acoustic record I described in the above paragraph and I would greatly appreciate you chipping in whatever you can to enable me to duplicate and print all the cd's i'll sell at shows and send to radio stations. I want to reiterate that the only use of these funds will go to the cost of actually printing up & packaging (duplicating) the cd. In 2014: #1. \u00a0I have plans to record a full on Country record, with local songsmith and best bud, Drew Smith, as the Producer. \u00a0(more details on that coming this Spring!) #2. \u00a0I also plan to release the album I recorded with my side project, Mother Teresa,\u00a0this past summer called - \u00a0\"God, The Devil, & Other Favorites. #3. \u00a0Finally, I am gearing up to record & produce another GWM album - FULL BAND!

If you have any questions please ask me.\u00a0 Ryan Dave Rhodes Things have been moving forward very fast, so much so that the initial 8 billboards CBS was going to give us for this project wasn't enough and I talked them into letting us artists have more. Which is amazing. More art spread around the city during Mardi Gras.  Right now we have an artist from Amsterdam, Ontario, Australia's \"Top 20 Photographers\", Art In America's \"Who's Who List\" from Florida, two from Brooklyn, Sante Fe, and more. Feedback and conversations over the phone with some of the artists reps have been more than positive and encouraging as I push along making this happen for everyone.  I've attached a letter of recommendation from the executive that I have been working with and developing this arts program with. I have about four billboards left and a dozen artists still interested. ",
  "Hey y'all! I'm starting a new underground, DIY publishing company based out of my van, which is also my home. \u00a0I've run underground presses before, and i LOVE helping artists, writers, graphic novelists, and other create types spread their work. \u00a0I'm interested in stories that go against the grain, stories that illuminate lives most people do not have access to. I'm going to create thematic zines, for example, one theme will be Weird Sex, and another will be What to do With your Labia: an Off Grid Guide to your P*ssy I'm also going to hold open submissions for artists who want their work published. Then I am going to construct the zines, print them, and distribute them. I think the best way to end ignorance and fear based living is through getting to know folks who are different from us, and the most enjoyable way to access other people's lives is through art. \u00a0 I want to publish poetry, prose, fiction, creative non fiction, comics, graphic art, rants, philosophy, memoir, photography, and other art by people whose voices are not dominant. \u00a0I want genderbending, queer, punk, anarchist, homeless, migrant, vagrant, oppressed, dissident, marginalized, countercultural, questioning, angry, celebratory, weird, intersectional feminist, immigrant, native, indigenous, otherised voices to have a platform to share their work. \u00a0I want to create a safe space for these stories to be told, for people to be seen.\u00a0 There are some wonderful things happening on the fringes of (and beyond) heteronormative society.\u00a0 Don't you want to know what those crusty kids with their dogs do for fun on a tuesday night, when they're not hanging out with a cardboard sign outside your liquor store? Aren't you curious about the tattooed waitress who scribbles drawings on a napkin while she's waiting for your onion rings to come out of the oil? There's a lot of bad sh*t going on in the world, and art is the vehicle to understanding. \u00a0Good art is revolutionary. \u00a0Good art compels us, makes us think, or feel, or see from a different set of eyes. \u00a0 I come across a lot of amazing misfits in my world wandering, and i want their voices to be heard.

  "Before I even get started, I want to instantly make this thing tangible to you. So before you read any farther, click here to open up the digital Preview Edition of Freelance Magazine. Pretty cool so far, huh? Now, how about a little of my background that lead me to this project (which can be HUGE with your help!). I am the former Publisher and Editor of three nationally distributed magazines -- Handmade Business, Smart Retailer, and Fired Arts & Crafts. So yes, I know magazine publishing inside and out. No novice here! With the proper funding, I can and WILL make Freelance Magazine explode! And for those of you that think magazine publishing is dead, take a look at the below excerpt from a recent\u00a0Harvard Business Review\u00a0article: It\u2019s true that magazines in the U.S. were more profitable in the pre-digital age because of the fragmented broadcasting market, but they do make money today. Magazine consultant Jay McGill estimates that profit margins in the industry have dropped off from a stellar 20\u201325% to a more earthly, but still healthy, range of 12\u201315%, which is pretty close to the average for the S&P 500. In fact, publishing giant Hearst recently reported record-breaking ad sales for its September issues.\n\nSamir Husni, Director of the Magazine Innovation Center, also points out that in recent years publishers have taken concepts from other media platforms, like All Recipes, HGTV, and Food Network, and turned them into successful print brands. You see, it's all about the niche, content, and marketing when it comes to producing a successful magazine. You build your subscription numbers by finding the right niche, producing high quality content, and strategically marketing it. Then make your real money from attracting advertisers who like your niche and distribution numbers. The great thing about the freelance market, is that it consists of over 53 million people in the United States. So that means, as a magazine that caters to the success of freelancers, our target market is over 53 million people! Yep, 1 in 3 Americans now work as freelancers in some capacity. Our market is HUGE! If we can only get this magazine in the hands of 1% of American freelancers, that will give us 530,000 subscribers! That, my friends, is a HUGE magazine that will pull in tens of thousands of dollars per single full page advertisement within it. Can you see where I'm going here? Even if we reach only .1% of the market, we're working with 53,000 subscribers which is a VERY successful niche magazine. But of course, I want this to be mainstream. And with your help, I can make it happen! Now beyond all of this, I have also launched a website called limelance.com\u00a0which is a marketplace for freelancers and employers to connect on available freelance jobs. Better check that out too! My business plan is to constantly cross-promote the magazine with the online marketplace, and watch them both explode in numbers. You may have noticed the full page ad for LimeLance in the magazine's Digital Preview you clicked on earlier. As the little boy in Sleepless in Seattle said, they are MFEO (made for each other!). So here's where you come in. To properly launch this thing to the freelance world, I need... well... funding. Producing, marketing, printing, and distributing a high-scale magazine isn't cheap. But I'm going to make is ridiculously easy for you. For contributing to this project, I will instantly make you a subscriber to the magazine. So basically, you're subscribing and funding the project all at the same time. For $25, you get 12 monthly issues. For $50, you get 36 monthly issues. For $100, you get monthly issues forever.\u00a0 My plan is to get the first issue out the door in January 2016. With your funding, I can make it happen! Maybe you're not even a freelancer. But guess what? After reading the magazine every month, you might just want to dive into the freelance world. You'll definitely learn how! So let's get this thing rocking. In a year or two you'll be able to brag that you were one of the founding partners of Freelance Magazine. :)\u00a0 Thank you so much for your time and consideration.",

We have also thought of a way to help provide tips, stories, and advice about love, sex, and relationships from experts as well as people with personal experience every month on your smartphone and tablet...for free!  This is Love 360: The Magazine!  Love 360: The Magazine will focus on three topics, and doing those very well.  Every month, we will publish an interactive publication for your smartphone and tablet about love, sex, and relationships.  The difference from Love 360: The Magazine and other publications is we will publish stories, tips, and advice from everyday people like ourselves as well as experts in the study of love, sex, and relationships.  How?  We will provide a crowdsourcing platform at Love360Mag.com in which you can ask and answer ANY question about love, sex, and relationships.  We will also provide a section in which you can submit your relationship stories that we may publish in Love 360: The Magazine (with your permission, of course.)  If you have something you want to get off your chest, you share it in True Confessions  that we may also publish (again, only with your permission.)  Including our interactive polls, topics from the internet, advice from experts, and so much more, our mission is to understand relationships and to answer the question \"What Is Love?\"  Love 360: The Magazine is run by two experienced individuals in both digital publishing and life who are dedicated on the subject of relationships.  H.D. Campbell is an accomplished editor and publisher whose credits include digital publications such as We, The Otaku: The Magazine and Untitled Track Magazine.  H.D. is one of the co-founders of Beryllium Media.  Reginald Belfort is top-tier programmer who holds both a BA in Visual Arts and a BS in Computer Science from the University of South Florida. With his perfect combination of art and technology, Reginald maintains the technical aspects of Love 360. He is also one of the co-founders of Beryllium Media.  And we cannot forget about you.  You are the primary factor of the Love 360 community that will help build the foundation of understanding relationships through your experiences and stories.  We need your help.  Our online crowdsourcing platform, Love360Mag.com only has a few questions asked and answered.  If you have a question to ask about relationships, love, and sex, as well as some advice to offer from your own experiences, visit Love360Mag.com to help the cause.   Also, sign up and join the community so you can follow your asked questions or your answers from others in the Love 360 community.    As for Love 360: The Magazine, we understand that this is going to be an uphill battle tackling the concept of love, sex, and relationships as well as publishing an interactive magazine which will include audio, video, html, and other mechanics that are still new to the publishing industry.  To help us with his cause, you can pledge anything -- from the cost of a music CD all the way up to a $2,500 sponsorship.  And for just $25, you can play a more integral part by joining our editorial board. We\u2019ll manage the board through Love360Mag.com in which you help select stories and articles that will appear in Love 360: The Magazine. Publishing has rarely been put in the hands of the readers in this manner, so you\u2019ll be joining an experiment that may revolutionize the industry as well as help others with love, sex, and relationships.   We\u2019d love it if you pledged. We\u2019d love it if you told your friends. We\u2019d love if it you join Love360mag.com and help us find the answer to the question \"What Is Love\".  Because we believe helping relationships is a just cause \u2014 and we hope you do too.   More questions? Leave a comment here or email us at Love360@berylliummedia.com.   For updates on the project, you can find us on Twitter @love360magazine or connect via our Facebook page. ",

  "I believe that I present flowers seeds and a collage of found objects in a way that is new and exciting and with stunning results! \u00a0My work looks like Renaissance art - it doesn't really look like plants at all it is mystical- I use borrowed equipment to photograph flowers seeds and plants to create stunning dark moody images the camera I currently borrow is only 5megapixels which means I am very limited to the size I can enlarge my work to - I believe these images need to be large scale wall art and wallpapers but to create this I need to photograph with a high megapixel camera and also a decent computer and Photoshop to edit my own work. I \u00a0studied horticulture last year and have a passion for studying plants up close especially Western Australian natives. \u00a0Through my photography I hope to enter competitions both here and internationally to show the world how amazing plants and flowers can be. The camera that I would buy if I could raise the money is the new Canon 5D series which has the largest megapixels and a computer and Photoshop to edit my work on I eventually would like to design wallpapers/cushions/scarves etc really I can do it all with the right equipment ! I have an 80year old shed that would love to restore so I can turn it into my studio - I grow the plants I photograph in my large native garden my 5 yr plan is to open my studio and the garden to the public so they can enjoy my art and the garden \"do what you love - and you'll never work a day in your life\" I absolutely love my art and my plants - I am passionate about Western Australian natives which are the best in the world ! And want to share my art and my garden - I just don't have any money to bring this dream to a reality - with the help of kickstarter I hope that I can progress with my vision. thank you\u00a0",
  "Multiple/Universal Curated by Christian Berman and Hans Baumann A group show in NYC THIS WON'T HAPPEN WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT! Featuring works by Lani Asuncion, Hans Baumann,\u00a0Christian Berman,\u00a0Jon Blank,\u00a0Ted Gahl,\u00a0Field Kallop,\u00a0Karl Larocca,\u00a0Kristen Schiele Please help us fund this group show in NYC. \u00a0 We need funds in order to cover the basic rent and staffing costs of an exhibition space in a well attended manhattan or brooklyn venue, as well as the food and drinks for the show. \u00a0This show will provide the beginning for possible future collaboration with the gallery, as well as an amazing opportunity for these emerging and productive artists to showcase their work.\u00a0 For you RISD folks, this is a great way to support several alumni. \u00a0 \u00a0 Thank you to everyone who has shown interest!!! The following is an abbreviated version of the prospectus for the exhibition: Mulitple/Universal This show deals with the role of art and abstraction as a universal engine for self-differentiation and also universal communication in the age of the internet. The work by this group of artists navigates the visual landscape by using material experimentation, simple geometries, color play, etc. in a way that vividly illuminates individual preference and experience.  Under another light, these works exhibit the connectedness of a universally vibrating network.  The underpinnings of this curatorial effort lie in the basic study of quantum physics, and especially in the idea that we live in a time where humanity is approaching a confluence between a tangible, electronic universal consciousness (the internet), and a still vague but growing understanding of the way that energy and consciousness might be drawn from a universal field. How are the constant easy access to information and the shifts away from a mechanical, linear view of the universe affecting abstraction?  From what I've seen, abstraction in painting has been moving towards a practice that combines both the modernist desire to define the universal and the expressionist urge to explore what moves us and defines us as individuals; contemporary painting is increasingly an unabashed celebration of color and chemistry which uses universal language to simultaneously engage with and escape the saturation of technological communication.\u00a0There is a clear sense that none of the works in this show could have been made at another point in history.  The works are not only constructed and influenced by digital technologies; they are created with the knowledge of instantaneous presence in the timeline of the universally accessible digital world.",
  "Im creating this kickstarter to fund my next short film. We plan to film up at bear lake in Rocky Mountain National Park. We are asking for $825 to be able to provide winter gear to our crew and actors. Things like hand warmers, and winter blankets. We also need money for a film permit, and gear that we can take into the freezing weather. \u00a0Our film will be shot with professional grade gear. Such as a Black Magic Cinema Camera, and our lovely Rode mics. As a filmmaker this is going to be one of the hardest films to pull off. Filming in the winter within a forest is a filmmaker dream for me. So Im super excited for the snow. From the moment I first call action.

  "\"Portraits of Promise\" - One Hundred Portraits of American Teenagers,\u00a0\u00a0is a series of oil portraits of teenagers painted from life. \u00a0The models each posed for 4 hours. \u00a0The paintings are done in a method known as \u201cAlla Prima\u201d, which is a direct, expressive painting style, and literally means \u201cat once\u201d in Italian.  Alla prima paintings are completed in a single session, during which the artist tries to capture the feeling and  psychology of the subject as well as an accurate likeness in a limited period of time. In these paintings, each completed \"wet-on-wet\" in a single session; the methods used are those I learned studying under Nelson Shanks at Studio Incamminati, the school he founded in Philadelphia. \u00a0This series had its genesis in my desire to to paint portraits from life, and to explore different ways to paint expressively. \u00a0I also to wanted do something different, something less formal than traditional portraiture, and to work with subjects who might not otherwise have their portraits painted. At a certain point, it became apparent that this project had become \u00a0a sort of \"historical document\" by which the viewer could experience today's teenagers, not only through how these young people look, but also through their thoughts, feelings, aspirations and dreams, which are incorporated into the project. \u00a0Each portrait is accompanied by quotes from a questionnaire the teenagers were asked to complete, in which they share their concerns and hopes for the future, as well as practical \u00a0advice to other teenagers. \u00a0The paintings, accompanied by the models' statements, will be exhbited under the title \"Portraits of Promise:\u00a0One Hundred Alla Prima Portraits of American Teenagers\". \u00a0I also plan to publish a book about my experience of this project, \u00a0which will include photographs of the paintings and the model's statements about life, as well as my own thoughts about painting this series. I began the paintings in September, 2010, a week after my youngest child left for college, and completed \u00a0118 paintings by June, 2012. Painting this series helped me to process my feelings about my shifting role as parent, mother and wife, entering the next phase of my life without my children at home. Embracing the young people who posed in this series was a wonderful way to ease though this transition. \u00a0They lifted my spirits, and sustained me through over 100 paintings. \u00a0The funds raised here will be used to purchase \u00a0frames in which the paintings will be exhibited. \u00a0Should additional funds be raised, that money will be used to underwrite the costs of publishing the book of this project. This series of portraits has been a true labor of love. \u00a0You can follow this project on my blog at www.natalieitaliano.blogspot.com. \"Portraits of Promise:\u00a0One Hundred Alla Prima Portraits of American Teenagers\", will be exhibited as part of a group show at Gloucester County College in Sewell, NJ., opening September 9, 2-4 pm, 2012. \u00a0The exhibition \u00a0will continue until October 17, and will be the first in a series of planned exhibitions of \"Portraits of Promise\".\u00a0",

  "\u00a0My name is Jessica Newton and I'm the New Zealand artist behind the brand Dust & Dandelions. This is my first ever Kickstarter campaign! I have wanted to do this for a really long time and it would be great if you could support this project. I recently had a single one of these pins made for my friend (see picture below) and it was so cool I thought everyone needed one of these in their life! \u00a0I have been wanting to get some badges made for a while and these eco-friendly wooden pins seemed like the perfect fit. They are sustainably resourced, use far less energy to manufacture than traditional enamel pins, and produce more detail in the printed design. There are 5 different designs available. If\u00a0you are one of those people who struggles to decide, don\u2019t worry. You can pledge now and choose a design later. I will be sending out a survey where you can pick which ones you want. During this campaign, I will be offering multiple pins at a cheaper price. You can also purchase an A5 print of the pin of your choice this will be limited to during this Kickstarter only. Example of a Previous Wooden Pin Design\u00a0 Timeline Shipping NZ Backers - Your pins will be sent out Standard Post around 3 days. Pledges over 5 pins will be sent out courier post. Backers outside of New Zealand - Your pins will be sent out Standard International Post. Being based in New Zealand the post can be a little bit dear the good thing is though there is flat rate so ordering 1 or 5 pins doesn't affect the postage cost. I always get proof of postage for everything I send out to minimise any issues :)",

  "Our product is unique in that we use no preservatives, fillers, gums or binding agents. No need to google our ingredient list. This simple fact sets our product above all other plant-based milks on the market. There is NO CARRAGEENAN in MALK! Carrageenan is used as a thickening or emulsifying agent in most almond milks currently available on the market. Carrageenan has no nutritional value and can harm your digestive system and is banned from food products in many countries. It's our mission to provide the cleanest, most nutritious and yet delicious milk alternative to everyone! We have come to a point where we need to ramp up our production in order\n to meet the demand for our products. We now have an opportunity to \nprovide MALK to multiple states starting in May and soon, globally.  This is where you guys come in! With your help, MALK can\n add new machines to the existing production line increasing our ability to fill \norders. MALK is the cleanest product available on shelves and we want\n everyone to have the opportunity to purchase it. We want MALK to be in a grocer near you by the end of 2016, no matter where you live! How we will use the money: One way that we can reduce the price for our customers is by taking the most expensive part of our process in-house.  We don't use any heat during our process. We use HPP to extend the shelf life of MALK. HPP stands \nfor High Pressure Processing. This ensures that you, the consumer, receive all of the vitamins and\n nutrients that mother nature intended. This is the most costly part of our production process, from distribution to the facility to paying for the processing, but it is necessary for us to provide you with a TRULY CLEAN plant-based beverage. As a stretch goal, any extra funding will go towards the goal of purchasing this very expensive yet highly important piece of equipment to keep the entire process in-house.  \u00a0REWARDS!! Enjoy a White Russian made with MALK! We call it a Christopher MALKen.",
  "Hi! We are Christine and Alexandria. Our dream is to open a bakery cafe specializing in Vegan, Paleo, and gluten free desserts where someone can come to a cozy, quaint environment and enjoy a homemade vegan brownie and\na cup of coffee, or a Paleo cupcake and a fresh juice. Our cafe will specialize in homemade specialty desserts that you wouldn't normally find in the average cafe, while still offering traditional desserts. All the baking will be done in the cafe and in small batches.\u00a0 More and more people are going out to socialize only to discover that it's really difficult to find somewhere to get specialty desserts like Vegan, Paleo, and gluten free.  The non-traditional\u00a0community, specifically Vegan, is one of the fastest growing communities in the food industry and the baking industry is not keeping up. Our cafe will help fill that gap. What will our caf\u00e9 look like?\n \u00a0We really like the idea of using re-purposed materials like wood pallets for walls, shelves and displays and Mason jar for drinking or filled with twinkling lights to create a magical mood. \n Imagine walking into a caf\u00e9 where people know your name and favorite dessert. Imagine sitting near a sunny window enjoying your favorite slice of pie and a cup of coffee. Imagine sitting at a cozy table sharing a warm vegan brownie with a loved one. Imagine the smell of warm chocolate, cinnamon, and apples filling the air as you surf the web or socialize with your best friends. \nImagine ordering a Paleo cupcake and being told it\u2019s already been paid for by our \u201cPay it Forward\u201d wall. A wall where a customer can pay for an item in advanced then pin a note on the wall that sets the rules for the recipient. Like \u201cthe next person wearing a flower in their hair gets a vegan chocolate chip cookie.\u201d At the Sweet Obsessions Caf\u00e9 you can experience all of this and much more.\n Whats the buzz? \"Your vegan desserts are the best in the Hudson Valley and even the city. Keep up the good work\" - Winston \"Since eating Paleo I didn't think I could have a dessert again. Your cupcakes are amazing. Thank You\" - Dave \"I can't believe these chocolate chip cookies are vegan and gluten free and the best part is they aren't rock hard\"- Sharon \"My daughter is gluten free and has never had a cream puff, now she can have a cream puff. Thank You\" -Barbara We've done our research, We've done our baking and now it's time to do this bakery cafe.This Kickstarter will allow us to equip and open a specialty bakery cafe in the best possible location to make for a successful business. We'll see you in the cafe!",
  "We are shooting to be the standard in the plastic food service\nindustry which has not made many strides to improve healthy alternatives to the\ncurrent offerings.\u00a0 That means that if\nyou are Vegan, Vegetarian, Kosher, Muslim or just plain heath conscious,\nchances are the food storage containers, utensils , wraps and so much more\ncould be causing you harm. Premier Group Intl. is dedicated to serving this\ncause by offering our 100% guaranteed harmful chemical free containers. Our\nintention is to market to the organic markets, i.e. Whole Foods, Sprouts,\nWegmans etc.\u00a0 While concurrently selling\nour product on our websites and through distributors to the general public and\ncertain religious groups. Our plan is two-fold: Gain the interest of food outlets that\nsell healthy and religious food products like those mentioned about while\nadding other prospects as well. Eventually when we can meet the needs of high\nend stores like Wal-Mart, Costco and BJ\u2019s with the kinds of quantities they\nrequire we will present the product.  PGI has invested over I million dollars to this cause and\nnow needs the funds to produce our food storage containers in larger\nquantities. We have produced sample sets in our manufacturing plant in\nConnecticut and are simply awaiting more funding to get production in high\ngear.\u00a0 We have our molds hung and are 100%\nready to hit the go button-all we need is funding! We also have a marketing plan to go into various newspapers\nand magazines, websites and Social media outlets to get the word out about the\ndangers of ingesting animal byproducts, BPA and GMO\u2019s. We have noted the rise\nin all kinds of diseases in the past 50 years to epidemic proportions and while\nwe have no scientific evidence as to the harm of these harmful chemicals, we\nfeel\u00a0 \u201cwhy take a chance\u201d!  Our challenge it to go to market quickly even though at this\ntime we have \u201cno competition\u201d and see none on the horizon. Our backup plan is\nto have the company continue operating even when competition sees the value in\nour products.\u00a0 There will be two other divisions\nof PGI: 1) ERC Corporation which will test other companies products to ensure\nthey are 100% free of harmful chemical to one part in billions and 2) offer \u00a0our brand of polymer called Pur-O-lyn to\ncompanies that want to produce 100% chemical free plastic. Alternatively, we plan to expand our offering to the\nhealthcare industry which will include items like blood bags, inspection\ndevices, medicine containers and anything made of plastic that should not come\nin contact with the human or animal body.",

  "Update: I'm funded! I will hold true to my promise to video the painting progress from blank canvas to finished book cover. I'll also update with photos of myself shopping for painting supplies, putting the book together, etc. Thank you for joining me on this adventure. I plan to have fun with the whole experience and I hope you will too!  The above painting is what I'm wrapping up now (not yet finished, but closer than it was when making the project video), for the \"Touched by War\" exhibit. It is not related to the COVERT COFFEE project, but is a painting sample for you to see my art. I will begin the COVERT COFFEE project after I receive my kickstarter funds and purchase the canvas, new paints, and new brushes (I am so destructive with brushes and have to buy them frequently!). As described in my project video, the subject of the COVERT COFFEE project is a coffee cup, blood, and a woman's head of hair (not the silly image of the \"horror coffee\" in the book trailer, that's just for comedy!). \"Hilarious & Revolting\" Book Trailer for COVERT COFFEE is in the Updates section (please click Updates tab and scroll down) - reminder, this is not how the painting will look, see above. COVERT COFFEE sampler is also in the Updates section. Read the first two chapters & get HOOKED! COVERT COFFEE is book #5 of the SWmysteries. More information: I expect this painting to be completed in July. So why did I put the estimated delivery date as \"September\" for all of the backer rewards? September is the public release date for COVERT COFFEE and the guarantee (as close as possible to a guarantee anyway) of having books in hand. However, I am likely to get my hands on pre-release copies before the public launch. I will keep all backers informed. Items like prints of the painting could be sent out as early as July because those rewards involve the painting itself and don't rely on the book being formatted for print and e-book. If I\u00a0exceed funding\u00a0I can use the funds to order more books, and/or hire a publicist to help me get my work out there (something I really wish I could do!). I will update frequently on the project to let everyone know what's going on. More rewards may be added if funding takes off in a delightfully surprising way.",
  "Hello Kickstarter Community!! My name is Nick Boettcher and I am from Peoria, IL. \u00a0I met the lovely Paige DeChausse in March of 2011 while she was putting together her blues-based rock band. \u00a0 Since then, our lives have been a quilt, woven together with the threads of songs. \u00a0With this collaboration, we do our best to warm those around us. \u00a0Some songs are playful, some can be painful. \u00a0Some are uplifting, and some bring us down, so that we may keep others company when they are in the depths of their hard times. In September of 2013 we moved from Chicago to Austin to be near my ailing father. \u00a0That process has inspired songs and driven us to write and record our first original EP. \u00a0Nick Boettcher and Paige DeChausse (lovingly known as Nick & Paige) We are working on our\u00a0Self-Produced\u00a0EP and are setting up our\u00a0Winter Tour from Austin, TX to Chicago, IL!!! We miss our friends, fans, and family in the Midwest, so we created this venture to make it possible for us to Finish the EP\u00a0come back and share our music and lives with all of you! We need YOU as backers to cover the production costs of the EP and Tour support! The funding will help support the production cost of the EP, travel expenses including fuel, food, and lodging, and performance production costs.  This is a big undertaking to travel across the country the second time in 4 months to reconnect with the community that supported us in our adventures to Texas.

  "*Visit my YouTube Channel\u00a0and SoundCloud page to hear songs! Hey Friends! Welcome to my Kickstarter page. I'm so excited to have the opportunity to join forces with you to make my very first EP. Let me just tell you a little bit about what led me here and how I plan on doing this with your help. I've been performing since before I could remember (I literally have no recollection of my first performance at age 2.5). I grew up in South Dakota playing anywhere they would have me, whether it was opening for grandstand acts with my guitar or singing at nursing homes for $20 and a Thanksgiving turkey. \u00a0Anyhow, I moved to Nashville when I was 19, which is when I started writing with the big kids and learning what it really meant to be an artist. \u00a0 Shortly after I moved, I found a great writing partner with whom I had an amazing creative connection. His name is Leland Grant, and we formed a duo called \"THE LiNE.\" We were fueled by a wonderful songwriter/friend/mentor who is still responsible for many of my songwriting choices today. For the next two years, I put every ounce of my creativity into writing songs for our project. Leland and I had the privilege of being on Team Xtina on season 2 of The Voice. It was full of challenges, and also some of the greatest moments of my life. No matter who you are, it's incredibly inspiring to have Christina Aguilera show you how to sing something while she's standing three feet from you.\u00a0 Though our time on The Voice didn't end how I wanted it to, it did lead me to a simple conclusion - I needed to go back to being Hailey Steele.\u00a0I started writing for myself again (it sorta felt like I was starting from scratch) and signed a publishing deal with BMG Chrysalis Nashville, and I've been writing like crazy ever since. I've always stood by the motto \"may the best song win,\" and have made my best effort to bring that to the table with my music.\u00a0So that's my story, and now here we are.\u00a0 The reason I'm doing a Kickstarter is because I want this project to be funded independently so that I own the master recordings...no label, no publishing company or anybody else owning anything. It's just me and the people who like my music deciding what to do with it.\u00a0 Every little bit helps. I'm asking for $10,000 as a goal, but every dollar I receive will count towards what it takes to make a quality 5-6 song EP. I am really focused on making these recordings sound great, and that's never cheap. Here's where your money will go: studio time, musicians, producer, mixing/mastering, marketing/promotion, printing/pressing of physical copies, video, design and photography associated with the EPK. What's in it for you: I've created a list of incentives that will make this fun for backers on every budget level. Knowing me and knowing my music are interchangeable, so I want to give you the full experience and keep you as involved as possible.\u00a0 I'm so excited to be able to share my music with you. Please spread the word about this project to your family, friends, co-workers, etc. I can't wait to see what we can do. THANK YOU! -Hailey",
  "Hey y'all,  \u00a0This is Dallas, and we really want you to be a part of, COME ON, our first studio recording! You heard \"Trouble\" and the song\u00a0\"Come on\", if you watched the video. These tunes are years in the making, and I actually wrote many of them while playing guitar/bass in Adam Hood's band. I have 10 additional\u00a0songs that we would like to record.  \u00a0We are planning on\u00a0making a record with Les Nuby (Vulture Whale) @ his studio\u00a0in Homewood, Alabama,\u00a0and we\u00a0are actively seeking the means to make this happen. Our expense is broken down into seven major areas: studio recording costs,\u00a0mastering, duplication, artwork, reward fulfillment, shipping, and\u00a0paying musicians (for horns, pedal steel, etc..).\u00a0 Please consider making this record with us, and thanks for checking us out! \u00a0",
  "In Amazonian Equador, deep in the rainforest on the banks of the rivers, live indigenous Huaorani people.  This authentic culture exists largely unchanged from their ancestral roots \u2013 dependent on the land and forest for survival.  I will be traveling by canoe deep into their jungle (via the Shiripuno and Cononaco Rivers) to meet, photograph and document three sustainable and cooperative tribes - the Noneno, Cononaco Chico and Bohanamo Huaorani. \u00a0I hope to not only create a photographic archive of their existence, but seek to understand the Western behaviors that threaten it. \u00a0 I am an award-winning photojournalist by trade.  My passion and talent is in expressing the human condition.  My goal is to capture the spirit of the Huaorani - to photograph their warriors, their children and everyday lives because the opportunity to experience them is sadly fleeting. \u00a0Acres\u00a0of sacred forest are lost every day to mining, oil drilling and deforestation.  Illegal poaching threatens the balance of the ecosystem.  Encroachment creeps closer and closer to protected borders with each setting sun. \u00a0They are, so to speak, an endangered species.\u00a0 I intend to raise awareness of these issues by publishing an illustrated book.\u00a0 I have personally financed the airfare, room and board in Quito. \u00a0I have also paid for all rural transportation including bus and primitive airplane transfers. \u00a0Additionally, I funded all expedition expenses, including necessary gear and a tribal guide, out-of-pocket. \u00a0Funds raised through Kickstarter will be used to purchase an upgraded and more rugged/weather-sealed Canon 1Dx and 24-70mm lens for the expedition.  When my goal is met, I will donate my Canon 5DMKII and 24-105mm lens to the local high school photography class.\u00a0",

  "I am wanting to start a Picture Blog and possible Video Blog of the rides and journeys i take around Nottinghamshire whilst out riding locally around where i live.Nottinghamshire is beautiful place, home of Robin Hood, The Lace industry, The oldest know pub in the world, the major oak, Lord Byron, Ada Lovelace, Nottingham Forest, a massive network of caves, acres and acres of woodlands and open countryside, various outdoor parks and a massive amount of wildlife and colourful plants.When out cycling i see many varied and wonderful things but due to budget restrictions i can only take a certain quality of picture, therefore i would like to propose opening a website of my own (this will come out my own pocket) and take pictures and videos of the many things i see around during my days out.I am classed as humourous so will try to add entertainment to the videos where possible without ruining the main essence of the video, the pictures will be all serious, quality pictures of everything Nottingham.These pics will also be uploaded to Faceboook, Twitter and Instagram under accounts i already use (@InfectedFred), i already get many comments about my eye for taking a good picture in a couple of nature groups and by friends but have also been told the quality of my image is my letdown.This is due to using my phone for the pictures, therefore i ask for pledges to help me buy a good camera (Canon DLSR or something alike) and a GoPro for filming the footage from my handlebars whilst out riding.I will be Geo-tagging all photos and adding map views of where the rides have taken place and where video footage was taken.",

  "Cisco is a local promoter in the underground club scene, but the party is about to end. As EDM music consumes the dance crowd at an illegal show, rave-girl Catrina desires the euphoric high of \"Molly\" that Cisco previously introduced to her. While dancing on stage, Catrina collapses from an overdose. Her older sister, Sophia, holds her in her arms, but Catrina succumbs to the dark veil of death, leaving Sophia and her friends to mourn a life cut tragically short.   Almost a year passes and Sophia honors Catrina's life on Dia De Los Muertos (The Day Of The Dead), hoping to connect with her spirit and find some closure. As tradition dictates on this sacred day, Sophia decides to build an ofrenda (a ritual altar) with the guidance of Victor, an elderly Brujo. He warns Sophia that under no circumstances can she allow the ofrenda to remain unfinished or the consequences for Catrina's soul could be dire.   Sophia invites Catrina's friends, including Cisco, to take part in building the ofrenda. As usual, Cisco turns it into a party. As everyone drinks and parties, an evil presence, the Lady of Dead, intervenes, allowing unholy entities to escape Purgatory so they can consume the souls of the living. Cisco is the first to be possessed and he dutifully leads Sophia and their friends into the spiritual abyss embodied in a dilapidated hospital rumored to be haunted. In order to escape their horrific imprisonment in the hospital, the tortured souls of Darkness crossover the threshold of the living and hunt down Catrina and her friends one by one.  With the doorway opened to the other side, Sophia learns that her sister was not who she thought she was\u2026 but can she save herself and her friends before they are possessed and their souls lost to dark dominion of the Lady of the Dead?  We want to bring a new horror character known as                                             \"The Lady Of The Dead -Catrina\" ! She is classy and she is deadly and she has been around for a very long time, you're just not paying attention! Well now you will! Classic scares and suspense is what we need to bring and we will with your help.  We want to entertain while creating jobs for people at the same time. We are a family of producers, friends and artists. This not just a one shot idea. If we succeed with this project, it will enable us to continue making the other great films in our creative collective. And that helps continue to empower independent film and create even more jobs. Big corporate studios are not the only way.  Alternatively, small independent micro-budget films do not mean they are cheesy or bad. Some of the most successful and iconic horror films came from the independent film community. If we got rid of the movies no one wanted to make, it would leave a giant hole in the horror genre landscape. Movies like \"Blair Witch Project\" and \"Paranormal Activity\" completely changed the game. But they would not have happened if left to the studios to decide.   We are not backed by a studio. We are not backed by a bank, or investment consortium. We are just a great group of film-making friends who want to scare the living crap out of you.  And through this amazing crowd funding resource, we have the incredible opportunity to directly connect with you -- the fans who love scary movies; the actual people who buy tickets at the box office; the ones that spread the word of mouth; and the ones that keep the genre alive in an increasingly formulaic, comic book-driven world. Did we mention SCARING THE CRAP OUT OF YOU!? Just making sure. All too often the box office pressures and insane costs of the Big Movie Industry service the corporate bottom line. Maybe that's why horror movies nowadays have abandoned their grass roots and their prime directive? Relying excessively on CGI (Computer-Generated Imaging aka digital special effects) to create screams of terror. We don't. We keep it real. A touch is OK, if needed, but that's only if needed. We call it \"practical scare authenticity\" - meaning we only want to use real world strategies to scare you. And we have Proof of Concept. Think about this, the Godfathers of horror movies, the iconic classics like George Romero's \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"The Exorcist\" all created fear with this incredibly effective practical approach. You do not need a computer to create great characters, good acting and a skin-crawling, cover your eyes environment. We are all about authentic, real fear.   Do we not love Halloween? Practical scare.  Do we not love Halloween Haunts and Mazes? All Practical scares Who doesn't love sneaking up and scaring a friend? Practical scare. My name is Alfonso Flores Jr.  I am a devoted single dad and an independent film maker. I am grateful for the unique opportunities in the movie world that I have been given. And I do not believe in wasting them. I did not go to a coveted film school. I do not have movie industry parents or a trust fund. I'm a regular, blue collar, hard working guy who learned movies by LOVING movies. Given my background, movies are, in so many ways, my salvation. I've lost count of how many movies I have watched. And my favorites have always been horror films. I will never forget watching             THE EXORCIST and THE HOWLING. Scared me witless! Couldn't sleep alone for a week. And, I loved it. Years later, imagine how incredible I felt getting to be an extra in a real Hollywood movie! Sounds corny but it's the honest to God truth. So even while supporting my family working 70 hours a week, I found a way to carve out a small slice of time to stay involved in movies -- wearing any hat I was asked to because no matter how insignificant the job, I believe the best way to learn is hands on. That's me. Roll up my sleeves. Sweat of my brow. Nothing wrong with it, but I'm just not a text book kinda guy. I just do it. And it took me a long time to work my way up. And finally, a few years ago, I was rewarded with the opportunity to be a Producer on an indie film entitled \"KILL KAPONE\" (currently out on DVD,out on REDBOX in the fall and VOD outlets!). So I've being doing my movie thing and along the way in life, as always, you meet some really cool people. You know, the kind of people who just \"get\" what you're into creatively and you become friends outside of working on set. And sooner or later, someone says \"We should\u2026\" and it all begins. That's pretty much how I met the people in our movie. Our collective team consists of veterans in film both in front and behind the lens spanning over 35 years, makeup professionals, effects makeup artists & writers all with the same mindset to bring Los Muertos.  We've got a bunch of years experience doing this but we're far from household names or \"connected Hollywood insiders\".  Now it is time for us to use our experience, our knowledge and our passion to make a kick-ass horror film.  Your support will not only make the film come to life, you also will have the unique opportunity of being part of the team itself. As a supporter, you will have a front row seat to the making of a real, \"old school\" horror film and the satisfaction of knowing you personally helped us make \"Los Muertos\" COME TO LIFE.  We have been extremely fortunate to cast the talented actor NOEL G. His career spans 20 years and has appeared in film and TV shows such as the mega-franchise hit FURIOUS 7, the incomparable THE WALKING DEAD, and the critically acclaimed TRAINING DAY and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.  We are also fortunate to have the talented Dyana Ortelli who's career spans as early as 1970 in television and film with such titles as La Bamba, American Me, NYPD Blue, CSI, & Curb Your Enthusiasm to name a few. Dyana's improvisational skill and timing were essential for her key role in Los Muertos.  Alongside Noel and Dyana, we have a great cast of talented, really enjoyable and skilled actors with tons of credits as well as some newcomers bringing raw talent!   All of them were handpicked to create an ensemble with the perfect chemistry and attitude to bring our vision to life.  Los Muertos is an American independent horror film laced with the legend, myths and folklore of Dia De Los Muertos and The Lady Of The Dead. All the traditional elements are uniquely integrated into a compelling modern story that we are confident will scare crap out of you.    Location: Our film began shooting in November of 2013 at the Linda Vista Hospital, formerly known as the Santa Fe Railroad Hospital. It was erected in 1904 and rebuilt in 1924 after a massive fire. Due to its high mortality rate throughout the years, Linda Vista was shut down in 1991. It was considered one of the most haunted locations in Los Angeles until it was completely remodeled by a real estate developer shortly after we finishing filming the hospital sequences. It now Senior Housing. We're very proud we were able to fund shooting at this location before this insanely terrifying location was lost for all time. Seriously, shootinghere was beyond creepy. We consider it a badge of honor we can count ourselves as one of the very last films ever filmed at this historic site. ADDITIONAL FILMING LOCATIONS: (SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA) throughout L.A., Orange County, Whittier and San Fernando Valley.  Los Muertos is a horror film hybridizing the real world locations of Oren Peli's films, the classic elements of the Gothic ghost story and the traditional motifs and characters of Dia de Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) and the legend of The Lady of the Dead. These ancient celebrations of life and death were observed during the time of the Aztecs, with rituals and offerings to connect our world with that of the dead. We delved deeply into the rich history of this celebrated holiday and added our own backstory to explain its \"true\" origins. We love that Dia de Los Muertos provides the inspiration for our title and we intend to fully exploit its connection to the far more familiar scary holiday called All Hallows Eve (Halloween). At the center of the Day of the Dead traditions is the Aztec goddess Mictecacihuatal, aka the Lady of the Dead. She is the template for the demon who hunts down our heroes. All these rich cultural and traditional elements provided an extremely solid foundation to build a unique contemporary story, a different story, a truly skin crawling story that makes you think and makes you scream! Catrina (above) played by newcomer Kari Shaw shows how ones life is more than meets the eye. One of the great hallways of Linda Vista Hospital that gave us the perfect filming location. No one will hear you scream! The authentic feel and look was given to us at every turn, including the Old Records Room which contained REAL old medical files dating back to the origins of Linda Vista Hospital \n\"Michelle\" played by newcomer Jaclyn Michelle Snoeberger a.k.a Playboy Live's model, \"Vikki McGuyver\" enters the point of no return Sierra Reyes (Kill Kapone , Haunted Maze) kept her composure during the many scenes wandering the creepy dark halls that lead to the hospitals morgue.",

  "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After surviving colon cancer in the summer of 2014, I came to realization that poor nutrition is a major contributor to development of cancer.\u00a0 After long and thorough research on cancer prevention, I eliminated chicken and beef from my diet, focusing on plant-based foods as one of my sources of protein.\u00a0 I noticed that many dishes lacked flavor and majority of protein sources were soy-based.\u00a0 Most people are aware that 99% of soy sold in the US is genetically modified.\u00a0 I couldn't take a chance by exposing my body to GMO products, so I decided to experiment with various organic plant-based protein sources and came out with currently patent-pending, delicious recipe for high-protein content, organic, plant-based sauce. This sauce can be added to any dish, vegan or otherwise, to increase the flavor and daily protein intake, without jeopardizing your health.\u00a0 It contains no artificial ingredients and has a high-nutritional value.\u00a0 It is 100% Non-GMO and vegan friendly.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The funds will be utilized for manufacturing and to ensure that our products stay true to the original recipe, which contain no artificial ingredients, no preservatives and is organic/Non-GMO.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe are creating healthy, natural food products for people that care about their health.\u00a0 Our products will be free of additives,\npreservatives, and common GI irritants like corn, soy, dairy, providing millions of people who have these sensitivities with healthier options. We also plan on donating a percentage of our profits to cancer prevention education.  We would like to raise $20,000 for:  Product development and testing for more delicious sauce flavors.

  "One lovely December morning, I woke up with an idea to buy a pair of thigh boots. That's right, yes! I live in Geneva and the winters here are very cold ! \u00a0 Now I'm addressing to you ladies: Have you ever tried to buy a pair of thigh boots ? After many and many trying, same observation:\u00a0 Personnaly measuring 1m81, the thigh boots just turn into knee boots. Our mission is to create a shoe's accessory that will fit to any woman's shoes and transform it into a beautiful pair of thigh boots. All this, with trendy collections, adapting to all budgets, all body shapes and above all, to each woman.\u00a0 In addition to the trendy collections, a web app will also be developed to allow customers to create their own accessories if their minds were to turn to creativity.\u00a0 Yes ! Pimp'up deeply believes that every woman is unique. Pimp'up expresses and believes in true values: A free and independent woman, strong and elegant. We have designed the collection that we would like to wear every day. This means that depending on the range, each woman will be able to find the accessory that suits her. Or create it! A Vegan range has even been designed, to be able to offer the same products to everyone, while respecting everyone's ethics. Size : 3 types of size: S, M, L and the custom-made. Because each woman deserves a special attention, our labels are composed of a secret pocket where a personalized word, signed by my hand, has been slipped, especially for her. \u00a0Because wearing Pimp'up is much more than dressing your leg or wanting to be trendy. Wearing a pair of Pimp'up is joining a community. A community of strong and independant women capable of moving mountains! You will never be alone again! And if you are a little down; this word will remind you of it. Because it will have been written especially for you and only for you. A web application will allow customers to create their own accessories thanks to a big database of materials, things to customize. Simple and effective, it has never been easier to create for express your personality.\u00a0 Our accessory is manufactured in a small but very famous Italian workshop of 20 craftsmen, in the region of Marches. Area known for shoe making.\u00a0 This world-renowned workshop also produces parts for major international brands. Our materials are finely selected and/or directly manufactured on site while respecting an eco-responsible production line. \u00a0We visit and study all our suppliers, to make sure that they correspond to our values. Because we sincerely believe that the use of the highest quality materials is the basis of an excellent accessory. We also have 100% Vegan materials, which will allow us to offer the same products to everyone, while respecting everyone's ethics. We believe in uncompromising quality. By eliminating intermediaries, not using resellers and by talking directly with you, we are able to offer an accessory of impeccable quality, at a price that can be adapted to all budgets, depending on the range. All accessories are finely inspected by us before each shipment. From the beginning, our objective was to offer a beautiful stylish feminine shoe's accessory, which fits all shoes, but above all, at a great price. The fact is that we don't have to buy the entire shoe, to adapt to any shoe allows us to do this. Indeed, the accessory adapts and re-invent your pair. The fact that we are also in direct contact with our customers without intermediaries or resellers also allows us to offer you a quality product, without costing you a fortune. Whether you go to work in a skirt or trousers suit, jeans or even a little black dress, the accessory is as versatile as it is functional. A dinner with your beloved? We remove the Pimp'up to let us see your legs. Reinvent your look as simply as a hello! Choosing your color:\u00a0We will send you a survey after the campaign ends where you can make your color selections.\u00a0 Reaching $50,000 in funding will allow us to create the entire collection but above all to make all the images, videos and whatever we need to create and develop our e-commerce site. Reaching $100,000 in funding will allow us to create and develop our web application. Because yes, Pimp'up will also be fully customizable. This will allow our customers to create their own unique accessory, just as they are eveyday. Reaching $150,000 in funding will allow us to make a big global launch, with wild fashion shows organized in 10 cities around the world. Scandalous, pioneering, innovative!\u00a0 If I reach 150,000, I will post prototype drawings for celebrities (which for me are the spirit of Pimp'up) saying that every 5000 more I make the prototypes and send them to the star and that it will then be on sale in September. 5000 also for packaging Fashion designer and always on the lookout for the latest trends, I love being feminine and stylish even in the freezing cold. What could be better than a beautiful pair of boots with a sweater dress for a trendy look? I've never been able to find a pair that can be beautiful, suitable, not vulgar, and without being horribly expensive! I created Pimp'up to solve this problem. With the fit and waterproofness of a shoe, Pimp'up adapts, keeps you warm and guarantees you a confident look, with a wide variety of choices to represent you. To each her own Pimp'up! Our mission is to dress your leg, dust off the shoe's world and allow you to reinvent your pairs without having to buy new ones. Over the past year, we have produced 8 prototypes. At each step of the process, we learned valuable information. We have refined, redesigned and are now delighted to use what we have learned to really launch Pimp'up with the help of the Kickstarter community. We spend a lot of time in our workshops, working with the staff and preparing our accessories to perfection. We have established a partnership with a workshop that manufactures items for some of the world's leading brands. We are only an hour away by plane, and when the accessories are finished and ready to go, we will pick them up directly. The possibilities of evolution for Pimp'up are endless! We could think about creating collections of hats, gloves, dresses and even shoes for our accessories in the future! Pimp'up will soon become the essential that every woman will have in her dressing room just like the little black dress or the eternal little pencil skirt. We expect the Pimp'up accessory to be ready for shipment, for Kickstarter orders, in November of this year. For the realization of the collection and the launch of the e-commerce site, we plan a launch in the beginning of december. We coordinated our different partners; from the workshop to the different suppliers, from photographers to web designers, to make this possible.",
  "Update: Book page sample Each page layout will be slightly different with \nrespect to the painting composition. The text is floating around the \ntree to create a perfect balance. A lot of time and attention will be \nspent in making these pages. We'll come back with updates here and on \nwww.onceuponapaper.net In nooks and corners  Cold remains:  Flowers of the plum Well, I need your help to gather all my paintings of trees and birds and create a Digital Book. I have a good forest here\u00a0onceuponapaper.etsy.com, and I want \u00a0to create a bunch more trees, to cover the broad range of the luxurious color combinations and shapes that nature and myself can produce. The Digital Book , a PDF file, will be viewable on your computer or mobile device. I will start working on it as soon as the the project reaches it's funding goal, and then keep adding the new paintings.\u00a0 What you get as rewards when you pledge is only original watercolor works. Plus of course, the PDF Book. Three sizes are available for the paintings: small ~8x10, medium ~12x17 and large ~18x24inch. They will be produced based on the pledging order, first come first served. \u00a0For the original paintings you are allowed to suggest a color your painting should be based on. \u00a0It will all be taken care with the survey sent at the end of project pledging \u00a0time.\u00a0 When I layout a tree, I am searching for a prototype and archetype, and for the most relevant and exciting to our human brains. Not an easy task, but so teasing to me.\u00a0My trees give joy, positive energy, color to the walls, oxygen to your brain, and make your friends jealous. I\u2019ll make trees and their inhabitants, \u00a0- birds. Two symbols of earth and flight, of rooted and freedom, of building and occupancy. It started a few years ago, out of my professional architectural design research. As an architect you always need to sketch your plans with a pencil, and many times, your spaces start looking like bubbles following some structure. From there, it all deviated into these paintings. I guess I always loved trees with their amazing crowns and structural forms. And who doesn\u2019t? Thanks for reading this, and for those willing to join,\u00a0please follow my\u00a0progress at\u00a0onceuponapaper.net\u00a0 Why not making an app: There are also compatibility issues. The odds of an application no longer running correctly are greater than that of there not being any option to load a specific kind of media file on future hardware. Also, it's easier for me to build this myself and more cost efficient.\u00a0 A $5 dollar for shipping costs would be very appreciated - thanks.",
  "Hi! We are THE SEA THE SEA, Chuck e. Costa & Mira Stanley,\u00a0a harmony-based, electro-acoustic, indie folk duo. During our just-over-two-years as a band we've been incredibly blessed not only to be able to make our living by touring and playing music, but to have had the opportunity to meet so many of you! We could not have accomplished what we have so far without you. Thank you. As some of you know, earlier this year we flew across the country to record our very first album together, LOVE WE ARE WE LOVE, with the incredible folks at\u00a0Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, CA, \u00a0produced by one of our favorite people/artists/producers, Todd Sickafoose, with additional fantastic musical contributions by:\u00a0Matthew Szemela,\u00a0Adam Levy, Jonny Rodgers, Theresa Wong, John Santos, & Jordan Glenn.\u00a0The album has been finished for a few months now, and we are SO PROUD of how it turned out. Not only does it sound great, but the incredible creative minds at The Made Shop made it look beautiful as well. Check it out: See how they made the artwork, here: We've been holding off on an OFFICIAL release so that we could take some time to assemble a knowledgeable, experienced promotional team, additional artist collaborators, create an informed, logistically sound release plan, as well as to save up some of our own funds to contribute. Those pieces are in place, ready for a February 25, 2014 release, so now we're ready to give our debut record a proper send-out into the world! But, first, we need your help... We've had some really incredible financial support from friends and family during this process, but for the most part we've covered the costs of recording our album, existing promotional materials, and a significant portion of what will be our promotional campaign on our own. We feel really good about that, but we also know that with your added help, we can do SO MUCH more! Plus, we're strong believers in the power of community, and we love the idea of this project belonging to all of us.\u00a0 The minimum amount we need (beyond the funds we've saved)\u00a0to cover the costs\u00a0of our official US Release which will include a\u00a0publicist to manage all publicity regarding the US release of LOVE WE ARE WE LOVE,\u00a0radio promoter who will send copies of and elicit interest in the album during it's release, high-quality photos for press/media consistent with album branding, video to coincide with album premiere, website updated to align with album branding/artwork, and manufacturing of 1500 CDs\u00a0is $6,500. Anything we're able to raise beyond $6,500 will go towards further creative content and merchandise.\u00a0 Total funds already in place = $13,500 of $20,000 total budget. The remaining costs of $6,500 break down like this: $1,500 (of $1,500) - CD manufacturing $1,000 (of $5,000) - videos $1,000 (of $1,000) - photos $1,000 (of $4,000) - radio $500 (of $500) - website $2500 (of $8,000) - publicist *Not included: 5% kickstarter fee + 3-5% amazon processing fee.

  "I've been working really hard for the last 4 years trying to finish these songs. A lot of them are ideas that I had sitting around the house for years that I kept kicking at until one day they smiled back and allowed me to write them. They were written all over the United States, from Alaska, to Oregon, to Colorado, to the Chihuahuan and  Sonora Desert to my front porch in Austin TX.  It takes me years to finish a song. I wish they came easier but that doesn't seem to be how it works for me. I'm really excited that I'm able to make a new record and I get to share it with you. I'm recording about fourteen songs and putting the ten that I feel make the album complete on the new record. Of these fourteen, about five of them I co-wrote with some of my long term friends and co-writing partners, Ron Scott, Gregory Alan Isakov, Marc Brenton and new to this  group of writing friends, Robby Hecht.  Making a record is extremely expensive, after studio time, printing CDs and t-shirts, musician fees,  mechanical royalties fees, radio promotion, artwork, mastering, the total comes out to about $ 8,000. I have a dream of being able to hire a company that does Press Promotions but that is another $2,500, So I'm just sticking with the $8,000 for now, but it would be amazing if I could get enough pledges to raise $10,500 for press promotions.\n",
  "The short film 'Skinner' will revolve around a psycho clown named Skinner that owns/works at a gas station off the turnpike in the middle of nowhere. Skinner doesn't take kindly to rude people and will SNAP... hard. 'Skinner' will be a dirty, gory, fucked up film made for horror lovers, my favorite people out there! The idea came from my binge watching of Rob Zombie films and I love how his movies are always dirty and messed up and I wanted to make something with that style; what's better than having a lunatic clown star in it?\u00a0 Rob Zombie, if you are reading this, you are a boss.\u00a0 Anyways, thank you so much for supporting me if you do, even a penny would be great. All proceeds will go to the making of the film that will start production in a few months. If you support, you will be thanked in the credits!",
  "Think \"Blair Witch Project\" type of film. My main characters have read the book \"They Cypress Hills Series\" and have become obsessed with this book. They realize that the book is actually based on a real place, and real people. They plan on doing a video shoot and interview people around the town to find out if the story in the book really happened.\u00a0 I have people already lined up and ready to do this project, I have locations searched out as well. I plan on using mostly raw video for most of this film. I need the extra funds for incidental purposes, as there may be some places that want to be paid for location use. As well as any legal issues that may arise during production.\u00a0 The book itself is real and yes, I based my story on a real place and real people, I thought it would be a fun and scary film to make and I have most of the characters that are in the actual book lined up and willing to shoot this film for free and share profits at a later date. How great is that?? Free actors free locations??? Possibly next Blair Witch Project in the making.\u00a0",
  "Thank you for pausing to read about my project!\u00a0 I am a 30 something female with a passion for cute, sweet things. I'm happily married to a fantastic guy that still makes my heart sing after many years together. Recently, we've fallen on hard times, and have been forced to pursue new options for supplemental income. I won't go into any sob stories - because negativity is never good! Wash away those bad vibes!\u00a0 Instead, let us focus on the positives and the fantastic reasons behind this project! These scrubs and body products come from ingredients right in my home - though with your help, I hope to expand to even more deliciously exciting ingredients! All of my scrubs are entirely edible (I'm not telling you to eat them, of course- because think of the sugar high!) and include animal and child (and adult!) friendly ingredients from Sugar to organic Extracts and some elements in between to give them some extra zing! I have been making these fun lip and body scrubs for some time, and have been known to give them as fabulous gifts to friends or family. The idea came to me that perhaps someone out there might enjoy them, also - so here we are! The goal is simple and reasonable, I know times can be tough for everyone and I do not wish to be greedy when there are so many other wonderful projects in addition to mine! I reach for enough to purchase more ingredients for the scrubs, as well as more to expand my offerings! Any and all supplies would be covered if my goal is met, from jars and packaging to ingredients and giving back to the community! What makes my project so special? \u00a0I would like to pledge to donate 20 jars of my sugar scrubs to local women's shelters for meeting my goal - with an additional amount to be donated in a stretch goal. There are many worthy places here that assist women in getting back on their feet, and I would love to offer some light to these women. Nothing makes me feel better on days that I am down than a good bath with some amazing bath and body supplies! You are amazing and I am blessed that you have read my story and considered my project! Thank you so much! http://kickingitforward.org",

  "With plenty of tie to spare we've reached our initial goal! \u00a0So as promised we're releasing a second single off the album. \u00a0Listen to the link above, but keep reading: there's plenty more we'd like to do for this album so we've added some stretch goals: \u00a0\u00a0 Stretch Goal #1: $7000\n\n\u00a0 If we reach $7000 we will attend the Folk Alliance International conference in Kansas City this February. This conference is an annual gathering of music industry professionals and musicians from all over the world and an amazing opportunity to expose our album to countless new fans and industry insiders at record labels, festivals, venues, and agencies. Added Rewards:\u00a0If we reach this stretch goal ALL donors of $20 or more will also receive a signed copy of our debut EP Risk Not Your Soul . ALL donors of $50 or more will receive Risk Not Your Soul plus a signed copy of our second EP Schemes.

We will then send you photos of your stuffed animal at all the sights! Imagine seeing Mikey the stuffed Monkey enjoy Stonehenge, The Cliffs of Moher, and the Brandenburg Gate!\n Once we received our first 20 contributions, we released this single \"Broken Things\" as a sneak peak off the new album. Thanks so far everyone for all your support! Tumbling Bones is an original and traditional folk group based in Portland, Maine. \u00a0They make their music with nothing but acoustic instruments, tap shoes, and most of all, their voices. Founding members Pete Winne and Jake Hoffman began playing together 10 years ago when they were randomly assigned each other as freshman year college roommates. As Tumbling Bones, they have toured the U.S. and Ireland meeting many of you good folks along the way -\u00a0but they are yet to make their own full-length album!\u00a0 An opportunity arose last spring when they joined forces with newest band member Kyle Morgan, a multi-talented songwriter, singer, and guitar player. Armed with three-part harmonies and Kyle's original songs, this September Tumbling Bones went to Great North Sound Society, a farmhouse-turned-recording studio in the woods of Maine. We, Tumbling Bones, think we produced something pretty great. \u00a0But we're going to need your help to finish the job.\u00a0While the songs have already been recorded, we still have $5000 in finishing costs ahead of us. \u00a0We still need to: - Mix the songs ($900) - Master the CD ($700) - Pay our side musicians ($900) - Manufacture the CDs ($1200) - Publicize the album ($1000) - Ship CDs overseas for European tours ($300) Please help us meet these costs so that we can make our first full-length album.\u00a0Also, as our campaign ends December 19th, you can choose the option to give your reward as a holiday gift to a friend. By December 25th we would email your friend a thank you card notifying him or her of your contribution. \u00a0Then, when the album's ready, your chosen reward (download, CD, dinner with the band, etc.) would be sent to your friend (at an address you provide). \u00a0 Thank you for supporting traditional acoustic music. We look forward to personally thanking you for your contribution.",
  "I would definitely say that I was born into a musical family. My dad is a musician who plays a lot of instruments; my mum sings; and my older sister and brother are both very musical. My grandfather's nickname was 'Singer' and my great-grandfather was a multi-instrumentalist too. I guess there\u2019s no escaping it. Music is in my blood. It should have been no surprise then when I quit my studies at Sixth Form and decided instead to pursue a career in music. But it did come as a surprise. Originally, I had intended to finish my A-Levels and then, do the music thing. But \u201cdestiny calls.\u201d And sometimes it calls at what you think is a really inconvenient time. However, with enough time passed to look back in retrospect, you can see that it was actually the perfect time. I was born to do this music thing! I\u2019ve been writing songs since I was 9 (let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve had mooore than enough time to get better at songwriting) \u2013 and after quitting my studies, I wrote a lot. I was in a sticky situation where I didn\u2019t know how to do the thing I most loved to do and, though it really hurt at times, I\u2019m glad for it or else I wouldn\u2019t have learned a valuable lesson in patience, faith and hope. \u00a0(\"Change\" - written last month using random words people gave me. Free download at soundcloud!) \u00a0(\"Usually, I Don't Listen To The News\" - Telephone box performance I did last month for K2.AV. Free download at soundcloud!) (\"Black Hole\" 2012 demo, which will be on the album.) (\"Stumbling Block\" 2012 demo, which will be on the album.) Two thirds of the 12 songs on this album weren\u2019t written during that particular time, but the reason I've put them all on the album is because they share a theme: passivity. The state of being passive. Sometimes it\u2019s a good thing to be passive, to deal with situations peacefully or to take a backseat; being inactive gives you some time to relax and reflect. And at other times it\u2019s not so good to be passive \u2013 sometimes you're letting people walk all over you, sometimes you\u2019re just being lazy, and sometimes you're lacking a lot of self-confidence and belief. I have experienced all of these things and so it's no surprise that they have found their way out of my system into songs of their own. That's the beauty of it! These songs have already helped me through some really difficult times; who knows whether they'll end up one day helping you through some of yours? If not, ah well. I hope it's nice to listen to. It really is not hard to make an independent album these days. Affordable technology makes it very doable. But it is hard to make a quality independent album these days for that very same reason. Lack of proper facilities, lack of inspiration, lack of direction and motivation have been obstacles that I\u2019ve been trying and failing to overcome in recent years. Well, I'm now full of inspiration, I now know the direction I'm going in, and you all have been my motivation throughout this time... so I'm thinking, actually, maybe the best way to get these songs out there is with your help. Just the fact that you like and believe in my music alone means the world to me, and whether you pledge, share the project or encourage, your support means the same. The funding will provide studio time and musicians to play on some of the tracks: there will be strings and a little harmonica! It will pay for the album artwork and design, some snaps, packaging, replication and distribution \u2013 the physical album comes with a nice booklet including the lyrics, \nartwork and photos as well as the credits, which will have all of your \nbeautiful names in it! When it\u2019s all done \u2013 you get the finished product. In order to do all of this, I need \u00a32,200 \u2013 that's \u00a3300 for studio time, \u00a3400 for the musicians, \u00a3250 for the artwork, design and photography, \u00a31000 for the packaging and replication of the CDs, and \u00a3250 for the other rewards. But from the overall budget, i.e. the \u00a32,500 or more that is raised, Kickstarter takes 5%, payment processing fees take from 3 to 5%, and then those deductions add VAT. So they'll take around \u00a3300 if we reach the funding goal, leaving me with just about the amount I need. If we don't reach the funding goal, you don't pay anything, which is great, but there also won't be an album... which isn't so great. I really hope and believe we will fund this thing! It will only take a few months to complete the project and that\u2019s exactly the reason I\u2019m getting my butt into gear and doing this now. I have no time for dilly-dallying \u2013 now is the time to do this. I\u2019m excited! I\u2019m aiming to have an album in your hands and ears by February 2014. Yes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m setting a release date for February 2014! As well as the album, there are other rewards too (as mentioned), such as access to the UK tour dates (yes, there will be a tour!), access to an online show (which I'll do before the album's release, in December or January), t-shirts with lyrics and artwork printed on them,  you can hire me to come to your house for an acoustic concert, I can use my hand and a pencil and draw a portrait of you\u2026 I\u2019m not that terrible an artist. And a few more. For all the rewards including CDs and things I'll be mailing to you, the mailing costs are included in the pledge amount, except for those outside the UK. There may be more pledges for some of the rewards, like the t-shirts and mugs, than I've anticipated and thus calculated into the budget, so if we raise more than the funding goal (which is absolutely possible) that will help to take care of those extra costs! Well, for one thing (as I just mentioned), I'll have more things listed in the rewards to create and fulfil, so the extra funding will take care of that. And if there's enough left over... Basically, I will plough it all into Passivity, in whatever way I can. What I've listed in the budget is just what's necessary to produce the album; there's so much more legwork to be done. I want to take this album further than I'm even able to imagine, so whether I end up playing a tonne of gigs in my hometown or doing a couple shows in another country, I'm going to be far from finished when the album is complete. That's the scary and exciting part. If you have any more suggestions for other rewards and things we could do for Passivity once it's done, I'd love to hear them! I'll be keeping you updated throughout the funding period and (if it's successfully funded!) all throughout the making of this album. Get ready for a lot of videos and a lot of blog posts. As much as I love to create music, and as much as I love to do that by myself, in my room, lost in my own little world inside my own head, I love to talk to people. Music is how I talk to people.\nIf you\u2019re interested at all in what I have to say musically, cool - I'm going to work my absolute hardest to get this music to you. It would be great if you could help me out by sharing this project and spreading the word. Let's do this! Take a look at the rewards to the right and pick whatever you fancy. With so much love, thank you.\n",
  "Hello from Magpie Sketches! I am super excited for my very first enamel pin Kickstarter! Who is Magpie Sketches? I'm a cute and spooky, queer Northern Arapaho artist that sells merchandise inspired by witch aesthetic and video games! Every sticker or fan art I create has bright colors, sparkles, and a hint of spookiness. I started in 2014 with my Etsy shop selling lolita head bows. I've had a comic published in Monsterpedia 7, an anthology made up for local Seattle artists last year. Since then I have been breaking on to the convention circuit with my unique designs and art! Why Kickstarter though? I decided to launch this cute, sparkly Illuminati inspired pin project in hopes to release even more pins in the future (and believe me when I say I have so many ideas). Kickstarter is a greatway for me to gauge interest in enamel pins, as well as a fantastic way to fund production costs. Enamel pins can add up very fast, so thank you in advance for your consideration to my campaign! There are 4 pin designs, 1 lanyard and 1 sticker sheet in this mini series! Product Details I have made one pin before, and the turn around was pretty fast. However, since I'm producing not only pins, but lanyards and stickers as well, I estimate that shipment will begin this December 2019! Timeline Shipping Shipping costs are a flat fee per area! $5.00 within the USA and $15.00 to the rest of the world, regardless of how many pins you order! Previous work My first pin, \"Horror Eau de Parfum\" is available on my Etsy. Kickstarter updates will be made through the Kickstarter platform, however I have tons of fun posts on all of my social media platform! Follow me on any or all of these for art, info, and more!",
  "Welcome to my Kickstarter campaign MYSTIC NATURE - my latest designs I've created in the last months. The designs combine my love for nature with a touch of fantasy and mystic. Isn't there anything in nature we will understand fully? It's just so many little pieces in there that work together at its perfection and we won't ever know how the biomechanic system works - there might be a sense of mystic in it. We all enjoying the magic animals and plants, there is always something magical & adventureous about nature. So why don't you support this campaign! Let me show what I can offer you, my friend and traveller. \u25cf Come, traveller! Nature is inviting you to stay for a moment. There is a natural mystic blowing through the air. If you listen carefully now, you will hear. \u25cf The initial goal of this campaign is to produce three hard enamel pin designs MASK, MUSHROOMS and MICE. The stickersheet will be unlocked in between and will be free for every backer as an extra for the support. For the stretch goals we will have four more designs and an illustrated postcard. You'll be able to pick the designs you want at the end of the campaign when the surveys are sent. If more designs become unlocked, they will become available for your choice! Each pin will come attached to a 9mm x13mm backing card with an exclusive design relating to the pins. The print color will be slightly shiny for a decent effect. You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time before the campaign is over.\u00a0 If you would like more pins, please add additional \u20ac11 per pin (for normal and early bird tiers) to the amount that you've already pledged OR change to a higher reward tier.\u00a0 If you would like to get postcard please add additional \u20ac4 to the amount that you've already pledged. To change your pledge amount, click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button. Then click the \u201cChange your pledge\" button and increase your pledge by the total of the add-ons you want to add. For example, if you've already pledged to the \"Six Pins\" tier and you'd like to add two extra pins, you need to add additional \u20ac22 to your pledge without changing your rewards tier.\u00a0 To change your pledge tier, click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button. Then click the \"Change your pledge\" button and select the \"New reward tier\".\u00a0 You'll be able to pick the designs you want at the end of the campaign when the surveys are sent.\u00a0 Help spread the word! This is my first campaign on Kickstarter, so I don't have any lovely supporters yet. That's why sharing means just as much as pledging! Share it for example with someone who might like the campaign. Thank you for your interest and support for this project! This really means a lot to me.\u00a0 If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me via email/messages or instagram/twitter @aglyra | Mail \u00a0(hello@aglyra.de) Find me on social media: \u00a0Instagram | Twitter \u00a0to stay updated in future.

Backers will be responsible for these costs, if there will appear any.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Funds will be received after about 7-14 days. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It will take about 1 to 2 weeks for the pins to be shipped to me For every pin the production of it will cost roughly 650 Euro to create. This includes manufacturing fees and shipping from the factory. All remaining funds raised will be used for the backing card production, shipping to backers, materials, and fees.\u00a0",
  "Hello friends, I'm Robbie of \u00a0Robbiekun Inc. I am currently running this Kickstarter due to the success of my first pin. Shortly after I sold the majority of the pins, people started asking \"When are you going to make more?\" Honestly, back then I didn't have an answer... But I do now! This is my first Kickstarter and I will feature 5 of my favorite One Piece waifus as enamel pin designs. Boa Hancock, Nami, Nico Robin, Perona and Shirahoshi. I hope we get to unlock them all!\u00a0 Pledging contributes to the production cost of these pins, and all additional stock left over after backer rewards are fulfilled, will go on my Etsy Shop after the Campaign is over. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By pledging, Backers get a discounted price and freebies.\u00a0 Thank you all for your time and consideration~\u2665 My pin designs is based off of my first pin which featured Nami being captured or sold in a slave auction. (Or, she probably sold herself for some extra Berries!)\u00a0 Reaching the initial goal of $550 would unlock the first pin in 2 variants. There will be 3 variants per pin design, Regular and Glitter Rare and GOLD Raw. If all designs are unlocked/funded, that would make a total of 15 pins available!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Disclaimer: I do not own the One Piece characters portrayed above, the rights to these characters belong to Funimation and Eiichiro Oda.\u00a0 *sticker art is currently under development* August: The campaign commences. September: The campaign ends on 9/14/19. Once it ends, all pledges are collected and cards are charged. Then, I will get the backer reward surveys set up and sent out.\u00a0 PRE-ORDERS: From Sunday, September 16th to Sunday, September 29th Pre-Orders will be available on my Shop. *These will be full price!* Why Pre-order? Because I do not plan to order stock specifically for the store. So if you want a pin(s) at the best price possible, Kickstarter is your safest bet. Then, Pre-orders are your last chance to guarantee a pin(s). October: It will take around 2 weeks for Kickstarter to release the funds raised to me. Once I get the funds, Manufacturer shall be contacted and production will commence. Production usually takes 2-3 weeks with about a week of transit time for the pins to arrive to me after being shipped.\u00a0 October/November: Pins arrive. I will inspect them and review everything to ensure quality, before packing up rewards and send them to their backers. Note: This is a preliminary timeline. Production errors or Delays (if any) will be addressed to you guys/taken care of Immediately. I shall update my backers throughout the whole process on Kickstarter and my Instagram.",

  "CLOSE ENOUGH EVERYONE! ALL PINS NOW UNLOCKED*! (*As long as we stay above $1000 till this Kickstarter ends in 20 hours.) If there were any 3-4-5-or 6 of these designs you wanted NOW is the time to bump up your bid to have all the designs of your choice! These rewards reflect some great savings as well- with the set of 6 pins averaging only $9ish per pin. With all the tricks we've pulled in these pieces you know that's a great deal. We should have samples shipping to us on Sept. 20th and we'll be able to post pics shortly after. This also moves up our delivery timeline if everything continues as it has been. THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE, and wish us luck in these last few hours. <3 - Kendra\u00a0 (Fade in from black- the scene - somewhere in Williamsburg, Virignia, where a purple haired girl waves to the seated audience.) Hello film, kitsch and monster fans! I'm Kendra, the gallery manager at Quirks and The Sideshow Gallery. With my bestie (and gallery owner Jenn) we've started designing our own range of pins and brooches and dubbed our brand \"Lipstick and Chrome\"! We have a passion for collecting enamel pins and acrylic brooches, so these are our focus. We know we need the support of like minded and passionate friends to help us on our journey and get the wheels turning. \u00a0I had the \"killer\" idea to design a pin collection based on vintage horror movies and pulp classics - you know, that campy stuff! (I'm actually a wimp, so this is as horror as I get.) I reached out to friend Kelly of Kitschy Delish and she helped us whip up these excellent designs. (She is stellar, please check her out on Etsy!)\u00a0 So without any further \"previews\" let's sit down and enjoy the feature presentation....\u00a0Lipstick and Chrome Presents STARS OF THE SILVER SCREAM!\u00a0 Once we hit our goal we'll be ready to produce our first two pins! The Vamp is lying in wait to pounce the next man who strays from his path. The coffin lid will swing open to expose this deadly vixen on our final design. Now Dracula is the king of horror movie camp and this collection would not be the same without him. The Kiss of Dracula is our enamel ode to him. One of my favorite things about this collection is we've designed the backing cards to feel like vintage movie posters completing the \"Silver Scream\" vibe. We have a few sparkly ideas for many of the pieces in this collection- we can't wait to show you the prototypes! Starting with your $20 donation you'll be able to add both The Vamp and Dracula pins to your collection.\u00a0 Have time for another flick? We hope so, because we'll unlock King Kong at $750 and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman at $1000. (Should we cross universes and make her \"snack\" wear a red shirt? Shout out to all you Trekkies.) We're also hoping to have enough capitol behind this project to upgrade our King Kong Monster to move up and down the skyscraper. TRICKS- we want to do allllll the TRICKS!\u00a0 The last two stars of this kitschy horror pin collection are Bride of Frankenstein (with glow in the dark hair) and Slasher (victim and knife chained piece). These pieces will unlock at $1250 and $1500 respectively. I might really have a thing for our Psycho inspired Slasher pin, so I hope you're all keen on the Midnight Matinee! \u00a0 So now you've seen them all- our first (I hope of many) Lipstick and Chrome enamel pin collections! If you want to see more of our gallery work behind the scene- where we've supported and presented the work of hundreds of artist over the years check us out on Instagram or online. We're a very VERY small team who have big ideas and we're thrilled to meet you. www.kinksandquirks.com On Instagram we're @Lipstickandchrome @kinksandquirks @shopthesideshow THANKS!\u00a0",
  "Vegans Deserve Convenience An estimate 2.5% of Canadians eat a vegan diet. A much larger percentage eat some form of vegetarian diet. Prominent animal rights activist Gary\u00a0Yourofsky says there are 4 main reasons people eat animal food products. One of those reasons is CONVENIENCE. And that's the main focus on this project. While we care a lot about food quality, and providing tasty, nutritious food, we don't aim to be the leader in these areas. Our main goal is simply to try to offset the advantage in convenience that animal-based food products currently have in the marketplace.\u00a0 Vegan Lunch Delivery Our goal is to use technology to make eating at least 1 vegan meal a day really simple, affordable and just plain easy. Our menu will be small but provide enough options that you could eat lunch 5-days a week from it without having the same combination of meals twice. We will provide an online ordering system and delivery within the downtown of Vancouver for maximum convenience. In addition to same-day ordering, we will also offer an order schedule. This will allow our customers for instance to preorder lunches 2-days per week for an entire month.\u00a0 Food Freedom Delivery Food Security VeganCafe.ca is partly about delivering food to vegans. It's also about helping non-vegans make the transition. One way we plan to help in that effort is through our Food Freedom Menu. This menu is a selection of affordable, simple vegan foods which we will distribute for free. A portion of all our sales will go to support this program, and we will also seek volunteers to minimize the costs to support it. We hope to deliver thousands of free vegan meals to people in need of food security throughout Vancouver and in doing that, help educate recipients about eating vegan.\u00a0",
  "It started when I was a little boy.. A love not soon to be forgotten. Once I had my first bite I knew that this was meant to be. Sweet, savory, greasy goodness. Pizza, as it is known worldwide, is a hot commodity. The ancients made pizzas out of grains and lamb. Since then it has evolved into something more edible. Many people have tried to create the most delicious pizza. Some have come close. Some have settled for less than average. However, few have achieved the perfection of a perfectly proportioned, thoroughly cooked, loaded pizza. This my friends, is my goal. To make THE perfect pizza. The fate of my hunger rests in your hands. We can do this.\u00a0",
  "I am a worship leader, a voice/piano instructor, singer and songwriter and have spent my life performing and preparing others to perform.\u00a0  I met Producer Brandon Bee several years ago when he was producing an album for my student Holly Starr.\u00a0 We have been friends since.\u00a0 Having the chance to work with him now is an incredible experience, a joy.\u00a0 We have spent 6 months so far working on the album in short bursts as I have had to travel to Utah where his studio has been to record.\u00a0  It is a labor of love.\u00a0 The songs we selected for the album come from my life.\u00a0 There is worship, of course, but there are songs of overcoming grief, illness and yes even anger, songs of nostalgia and songs of hope.\u00a0  3 times I made the decision to lay this down and stop working on the album.\u00a0 3 times God used people and circumstances to tell me ~ keep going. I know now that this is what I am supposed to do.\u00a0  We still have another recording session or two to complete, this time in Seattle WA so I will no longer have to leave my state and have the travel and lodging expenses so much.\u00a0 Phew!  Once the recording is completed it is out of my hands and goes to mixing, mastering and ~ I don't know what all!\u00a0 I know I still need to get the cd cover artwork &/or photography done and I plan to include a liner in the case to tell some stories for each song.\u00a0  Brandon says this is not the usual album.\u00a0 He says I am \"left of center\".\u00a0 He says this is a \"Concept\" album.\u00a0 It is life in song.\u00a0 My life.\u00a0 The human condition if you will.\u00a0 I do not write songs for the sake of songs.\u00a0 I write emotions for the sake of sanity.\u00a0 It just comes out in songs.

  "Welcome, people! I am making my first album after evolving as an artist for ten years. \u00a0I need your help to make it happen and I am excited to take this journey with you as listeners and friends. I've spent my life exploring the world of theatre, artists, education, and music. \u00a0In all my wanderings I come across people. People who stimulate each other to connect and to create. \u00a0Communities with a palpable desire to grow and revive. \u00a0I'm happy to say I've been swept up in it all and find myself surrounded by projects and dreams that truly bring people together through the arts... That said, I seem to have neglected my more solitary art in the process. \u00a0A songwriter never stops writing permanently. \u00a0Maybe a long dry spell, but the songs are there, lying dormant. \u00a0Fans have\u00a0encouraged\u00a0me to invest in my own music and make it known to the world, but I couldn't\u00a0wrap my mind around so much work to serve myself.\u00a0 Then, someone did it for me. \u00a0Lis and Lon Williamson of Gatorbone Records swept in and invited me onto their label. \u00a0This changed everything. Breathing life into those words reminded me that these songs exist for YOU, the listener. \u00a0Once I get it out, my need is met. \u00a0It is you, the audience, who then stands to gain from a possible connection with one of songs. \u00a0I was humbled and encouraged by my time spent in the studio and I can't wait to share the songs with you all. The album, maiden voyage, is sometimes abstract, sometimes narrative, sometimes soulful, but always autobiographical. \u00a0For better or worse, each song is directly inspired by different people in my life. One track, \"Elijah\" is about a people's experience which wove indelible threads in my foundation as a person. \u00a0\"Into One\" is spoken to a person with which many of us have had a dialogue. \u00a0Others are fictional portrayals of peoples' lives which provoked me to write. \u00a0There are love songs, too. \u00a0All of it, I suppose, paints a portrait of me as a person. \u00a0 I need $3000 to get the record on its feet. \u00a0Check out my incentives and see what you can do. \u00a0Thank you for your interest and faith in me! \u00a0I look forward to connecting with you through song.",
  "Disclaimer: The image on this project isn't directly tied to Duality. It is a representation of the artist Thea Magerand who will doing the cover art and other illustrations that will show up in the backer rewards. I do have her permission to use the posted image. Given my love for loops, we'll loop back around to Thea, a little further in. <end> Introductions: Hello there! I'm Jonathan but feel free to call me JT! Most of my friends do and we're to be friends right? I would like to -kickstart- things with a \u00a0thank you. Thank you for finding your way here. Regardless of your time or experience here, I appreciate you stopping by! Title: Duality Dissonance Genre: Psychological Fiction, Fantasy, Allegory Audience: Contemporary Adult Book Blurb: Duality Dissonance is something like a braid. You follow one strand of the braid which keeps pace with EV\u2019s (Envy\u2019s) adventure. He gets drawn into a conflict alongside the other sins and their aim is to save what\u2019s left of their world. As EV tries to understand what brought their world to its post-apocalyptic state, he begins to see another strand\u2013psychological trauma. When EV stops believing that their efforts are beneficial to the world, he finds himself standing in opposition to former friends. Now, the only way for EV\u2019s new beliefs to survive is to stop his former friends from accomplishing their goal. Will he be able to stop them or will he become just another casualty in a world that is beyond saving? Your Participation: I will be providing open access (Via Google Document) to the first chapter by June 3, 2022 so you can have a better idea if this project is something you are interested in supporting. As you will undoubtedly see elsewhere, I want your participation. I dabbled on Reddit for a time and I found a few really great people that made recommendations for my writing. That is where the collaboration side of this project comes from. I know the value of having varied viewpoints look at a thing. You will see things differently than I do because you are looking through a lens different from mine. Duality is a great story by itself but I know that it can be so much more if I allow you to be a part of it. \"Every man I meet is my superior in some way, in that I learn from him.\" Ralph Emerson I will be providing different levels of access to the story depending on your backing Tier. The majority of the tiers will give you access to a Google document where you can either read or comment on the story. I may have different documents for commenters but I would prefer to only get negative comments from my contributors, and by negative, I am referring to constructive criticism. While, I do enjoy positive remarks, that can't be used to improve the story because it's a reinforcement of what is already in place. I may have two different documents for this, allowing one to be for showing love and the other one to help shape the story by pointing out grammatical issues or helping me clarify things for you (the reader). Regardless of the level of input, I still plan to bring in an editor. I don't have plans for a Tier that will provide access to the entire story and I will need a professional set of eyes to verify continuity across the entirety of the novel. Sample: Here is a view only link to Chapter 1 so you can see if this is a story that you would be interested in. \u00a0While I will be updating the links that are a part of the Backer Rewards, I won't be editing this document. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZTpLpnzw1VUaUzQhhq8YdMGWu5-ZW98idnvWy9btM4s/edit?usp=sharing Funding Usage & Backer Rewards: This project will be running through late July (60 days). I plan to upload into KDP after editing. I anticipate sending to an editor in mid July. I realize that overlaps with the run of this project and may be sent in while backers are still commenting on the beta reading but I'm wanting to have a reasonable turn around on the physical rewards. When I upload to KDP, I understand that I will receive a proof copy and then I will suggest or approve that proof. From what I've read, it can take close to 3 weeks for me to receive the physical books that I send then send out as the backer rewards. Additionally, my artists doesn't start on my book cover and concepts until August. I suspect that the eBooks can be sent in late August but the physical things will likely be sent out in September. A large portion of the funding (approx. $4,000+) will go towards editing. Another significant portion will go into the concept art, producing the physical copies, and shipping. As it says in the Tier V reward, I really want to put more into that tier so additional funding will likely be channeled into that. Given that this project is of a collaborative nature, please feel free to make recommendations on the backer rewards. I will consider altering them but once backers have put money into a tier, I can only add to them at that point and won't be able to substitute anything. So if you have a suggestion, it's best to offer those early on. My Progress: This project is about Duality Dissonance and I am in the process of completing its rewrite. This story is capable of standing alone but I also have a continuing storyline that I plan to work on after this one. There are 2 subsequent novels planned, along with an additional story about a supporting character that spans the Duality books. That story is a prequel to Dissonance and is a bit of an origin for that supporting character. I started rewriting Dissonance in Dec of '21. I took a short break for March and I'm now approaching the concluding moments of the novel. This rough rewrite is sitting just over 75,000 words and I will be pushing it over 90,000 before I consider it to be approaching an adequate length. I'm going back and forth between revising, world building, and progressing the closing chapters. It should take me about 2 weeks to push above 90,000 when I'm focusing solely on progressing the late chapters. I know the details of those chapters from the draft so I just have to fill out the rewrite. My projection is based on my work during my last deliberate progression where I progressed 11,000 words over 4 days. I'm not concerned or stalling the progression, I'm just alternating my tasks each week. I progress the rewrite one week, revise early chapters the next, and then focus world building/map making on the 3rd week before revisiting chapter progression again. This is not a new story for me but it will be for you. I initially put this story concept together a few years ago. I stepped away from the draft because I was ill-equipped to convert my imagination into a novel that was approachable for others. I believe I have fixed that though and I'm here to invite you to participate in the finalizing of this project. I don't intend to do frequent progress updates on Kickstarter but I will be making regular ones on my blog. Feel free to check there if you want a more current update. I know that interacting on multiple platforms will bog down my story progress so I may implement a schedule for Kickstarter updates if they get too involved. Maybe once a week? Regardless of the interactions here and on the google documents (backer rewards), I will maintain a higher tempo of updates on the blog. Goals/Intent: This story will happen regardless of this projects performance but I have 2 goals here. Another part of my reasoning for stepping away from my draft was because I felt like this story belonged to more than just this would-be writer. It is my belief that this story will be important to a great many people out there and it is my hope to find some of them here. So my first and primary goal is to establish and reach some of the audience that will be passionate about this story/storyline. I want to find them and I want to include them during the finalizing of this novel. My secondary goal is to fund this project. The majority of the funding will go towards editorial work and the artwork that Thea Magerand will be completing for me.\u00a0 The recommended timeframe for Kickstarter projects is 30 days but I am running this for 60 days due to my primary goal and Thea's timeline. Thea is pretty popular so she won't be working on my project until August. This project will close at the end of July \u00a0which will lead into my artist getting to this project. Of course, that means that the art won't be completed when the project ends and I will have to find out a timeframe from Thea. The performance of this project will impact the amount of art that I need from Thea though so I will just have to provide updates as the project goes on. Interactions: There are the obvious interactions within the backer rewards and also your ability to recommend alterations to those rewards but I also have a blog that will facilitate further interaction. I started the blog in May 2022 with the intent of mapping the course of this story. \u00a0There, you can find an about me section, get regular updates on story activities and see things regarding my personality and strengths. \u00a0I mention the personality/strengths bit now because it is related to where this is all going. Both my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (INFP) and my Strengths Finder 2.0 paint me as something of a bridge builder...and -that- is what this is ultimately about. I'm building a bridge. I want to bridge the gap between Duality Dissonance and the people that it will be meaningful to. If you find meaning here, please feel free to get involved and be a part of it. I would be delighted to have your collaborative spirit! You will also find character bios on my blog and you are welcome to ask them questions. Their individual bio will give you more information and they will respond to you based on their knowledge within the first 3 chapters. Currently (6/4/22), only EV and Wrath are posted but I plan to post the remainder by 6/13 which is within a week of launch. Lust will be the last one posted and while you can read on him, I request that you don't try to talk to him. I realize that is only going to encourage more people to try but he can't speak so I really don't see that being very interactive! lol I'm going to try and disable comments for that post but I'm not sure if that's a feature. Thea Magerand This is the artist that will be working with me on some story art, including the novel cover. Here are a couple of links to some of her work. This will give you an idea on what to expect: https://www.artstation.com/ikaruna --Oh gosh...I just realized that she uploaded new things in here \ud83e\udd70 https://displate.com/ikaruna --My vision for the Duality art is a similar vibe to this collection: Norse Mythology Illustrated. We have talked about it and the plan is for Duality's art to have that similar haunting feeling. My personal favorite in this collection is \"Ragnarok is Coming\" It's Ba' Dass. *cough \ud83d\ude0f So yeah, I don't think there is any more to say about Thea other than showing what she can do. She's awesome and I think we have a lot of similar artistic tastes. She will undoubtedly bring a lot of value to this story.

  "I've got a new record and I'm this close (hold your thumb and forefinger about half an inch apart) to finishing it. Recording and mastering are done, and this project is to raise money for production and packaging. There Are No Secrets In This Town is 11 songs inspired by an oral history interview of a Terre Haute \"madam.\" The woman was in the business from before Prohibition to the '60s or '70s, and she spoke about so many fascinating characters she had met, as well as about politics, society and other matters. She talked about everything but sex, in fact. As I read it I thought, \"These people would make great songs.\" So I started writing. The songs about love and loss and lust and industrial accidents and vets coming home from the war and there is even a song about shoes. Fred Grittner produced and recorded the album and also performs and sings on it. He took a one-microphone, \"live\"-in-the-room approach and it turned out great. The record also features Karl Burke on bass, Lonnie Knight on guitar, Amy Brockman on harmony vocals, Bob Nordquist on harmonicaand Erik Brandt on accordion. Don Arney in Terre Haute did the mastering. I think we came up with a darn-fine record, and now I want others to hear it. If we make the goal, we'll be producing the record with a two-panel sleeve. Depending on how much over the goal we reach at the end of the 30 days, we may go with a four-panel sleeve, which would allow more room for art. A record sleeve should be arty. Speaking of which, I've already chosen the cover art. It is a great photo by the renown Chicago photographer Art Shay. He shot it while on assignment in Terre Haute for Life Magazine back in 1958. I saw the photo while doing some research for the record and thought it was perfect. I was able to track down Shay (he's 91 now) and his archivist and the three of us negotiated a deal for the use of the photo. I'm pretty excited about it. ",

Every contributor will be able to download \"Age\" in its entirety before its physical release date in April. Contributing more funds to the project will include unique gifts such as obtaining the album in Vinyl form, typed lyrics from Johnny Lewis, and also having the opportunity to receive limited prints of original oil paintings by Johnny (see examples below). At the $500 level, donors will receive all of these gifts, including an actual original painting (if they WANT it! ) Johnny Lewis' musical background is not that of the ordinary Folk Artist. Stemming from Minneapolis, MN, Johnny moved to Colorado in 2008 to pursue electronic production for a number of touring acts including The Larva Ink, Lizzo, Bokonon and many more. Accepted into the festival community, Lewis opened extensively for national acts such as The Flaming Lips and EOTO. After tirelessly working for his electronic acts, Lewis came to terms with his obsession for acoustic music, which in turn, drove him away from production and into his passion - writing songs. Lewis melds the timeless north-country sound of acoustic guitar with unique lyrics and electronic ambiance, replanting the poetic verse into a timeless songwriting style for a new generation of listeners. Johnny Lewis now resides in New York City where he studies Poetry at The New School.\u00a0 All contribution levels play a major roll in the creation of this record. This record will be built by friends and family and is here to give everyone the opportunity to show their support towards modern American acoustic music! Let's dance on these avenues.

  "Turner on\nWood: Blending Beauty & Ecology & Community UPDATE - This project was mercifully successfully funded some hours ago. However, if you were still considering donating to this campaign, please do so! The more funds available, the more money we have to work with - insofar as materials, unexpected expenses, etc.  In addition, we were hoping to incorporate more of the general county action in terms of video work, blogging and documenting more thoroughly IE incorporating what we do here with the larger artistic context.  We are still receiving donations here till about 10PM EST. Thanks!\n \u00a0INSPIRATION \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nmuch as any other painter, J.M.W. Turner inaugurates the modern use of color\nand composition. \u00a0He is arguably as\ninfluential as Vermeer was earlier. \u00a0His landscapes and seascapes mix montages of terror and\ndelight, pathos and transcendence into single canvases.\u00a0 Moreover, he has always stirred my\nsoul and fired my muse.\u00a0 Since\nrelocating to Appalachian North Carolina, the thought of doing something\nsimultaneously to honor and reconfigure Turner\u2019s brilliance has become\nsomething of an obsession.\u00a0  I carried my copy of Turner at the Tate with me everywhere,\nuntil finally my mother and my husband ganged up on me.\u00a0 Their challenge: \u201cDo something with\nthis; go to Kickstarter, and plead with the world for help in achieving your\nvision.\u201d\u00a0 So here I am. RATIONALE \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\none of the first Romantics, Turner quite clearly articulated a defense of\nnature against the depredations of humanity.\u00a0 He showed the power and fury that nature, especially the\nsea, might unleash at any moment.\u00a0\nHis canvases also depict the interconnections that bind people to each\nother and to the natural world. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All\nof these elements of Turner\u2019s approach, two hundred years old, seem apt today,\nas society\u2019s mastery of the cosmos seems almost complete at the same time that\nour lives hang on our ability to balance our own needs and pathways with what\nthe universe permits.\u00a0 Reimaging\nTurner\u2019s oeuvre thus seemed both aesthetically and philosophically sound. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\nwell, I had begun to collect beautiful pieces of driftwood, some of which\nseemed ideal for luscious oils and sweeping compositions.\u00a0 On my own, intrepid if uncertain, I\nbegan to reconfigure Turner at the Tate\npiece by piece. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three\nsuch panels into the breech, however, I ran out of Prussian Blue.\u00a0 I\u2019m nearly out of Liquen Lite, two\nshades of yellow, and several other tubes of paint.\u00a0 I\u2019m low on paint thinner, and I used my last gesso on the\nplanned fourth Turner panel.\u00a0 I\nhave obtained ten of the ninety three panels necessary for completion, yet each\nof these came at a cost of ten dollars or more. While I believe in what I\u2019m doing,\nand offer the work that I\u2019ve completed as evidence of its validity, I need\nsupport\u2014at a minimum what I\u2019ve requested here on KickStarter, to continue with\nthis.\u00a0 I am praying that others see\nsomething of the value in this that I do. PROCESS \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basically,\nthe funds that I seek will pay for all my supplies, all of the \u2018canvases\u2019, and\nthen let me hire someone to help with bringing the pieces to market.\u00a0 I am hopeful that such a consultant can\nalso help me to prepare to do a video about the project and a catalog, but that\nis after the completion of what I propose here. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basically,\nwhat will happen by the middle of February, after this drive for assistance is\nsuccessful, is that I will have purchased all of my paints and supplies.\u00a0 I will also have ordered all of the\nremaining wood pieces, sanded, finished, and prepped with gesso on one side.\u00a0 The money to pay for them will be\navailable too, praise be. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then,\nbeginning on February 15th, each day I will paint exactly one of the\nremaining ninety images, seven days a week.\u00a0 By May 15th(it\u2019s a leap year!), therefore, that\nphase of work will have finished. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At\nleast twice a week, on Sunday morning and Wednesday night\u2014and perhaps more\nfrequently\u2014I will blog about the whole project.\u00a0 Partially, this anticipates my desire to create a video and\ncatalog presentation later; in part, though, it also serves to keep my supporters\nin the loop about my progress, trials and triumphs, and so forth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\nalso intend to do at least one brief video while I\u2019m in the thick of\nthings.\u00a0 I can\u2019t promise this, but\nit is my intention; I\u2019m pretty good about keeping my word to myself.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally\nat the beginning of May, I will tap my Atlanta and WNC networks to find someone\nappropriate to help me with marketing and presentation. I already have several\nleads in this regard. For the most part, this will culminate the project.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\nexception is that I will only have delivered most of the \u2018gifts\u2019 attendant on\nmaking a donation here.\u00a0\nBenefactors who have made more substantial gifts will receive all they\nare due by two months after the completion of the final panel. FOLLOW-UP No society has long survived\nwithout an artistic potential, a cultural nexus.\u00a0 My hope is that this program permits me to participate in\nresuscitating a grassroots capacity for artistry.\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As\npart of my thankfulness at this privilege, I intend to make a video of what\nI\u2019ve done, as a kind of \u2018how-to\u2019 and primer about such a process.\u00a0 I also want to reach out to other\ncreators in the aftermath; the video will help me with this.\u00a0 Artists need to find a way to express\ntheir power in ways that go beyond craftiness and beauty, or at least, that\u2019s\nmy sense of things. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly,\nI will, as a result of my retaining a consultant, have at least the rudiments\nof a plan for taking the Turner Reproductions to town, so to speak, and to\nproduce a catalog of the work that both presents the images in another medium\nand acts as an additional outreach and engagement tool for reaching and\nnetworking with other artists. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\nany event, I vow this much.\u00a0 Anyone\nwho helps me to achieve my vision here will find my door and my heart always\nopen.\u00a0 One of my heroes is the\ngreat Paulo Freire.\u00a0 He said that\nthe essence of humanity was being willing to have an equitable and heartfelt\nconversation with another person.\u00a0\nSo, to all who respond here, thank you and don\u2019t be strangers.\u00a0 We should be talking about all of this\nand whatever else suits our purposes.",
  "Mexico is a diverse country that has been shaped and is being shaped by its mestizo culture (indigenous and Spanish European), its traditions, its Catholicism, its clash between urban and country, its poverty, its recent growth and many more factors.

  "I was working on my homework and I came across a quote from the prophet Jeremiah, and I was blown away! It made me think about life and what I was going through at the time.

  "The Scottish Mountain Wilderness Calendar 2015 will feature a set of images of some of Scotlands wildest and most beautiful natural landscapes captured by the artist on numerous trips into the country's remote corners. As the 'Natural Light Gallery' title implies, the artist never uses mood changing filters to alter the atmosphere of the scenes he photographs, and each view has thus been faithfully captured (often requiring reaching very remote and exposed areas at rather unsociable hours) and reflects the true feeling of the moments. The Scottish Mountain Wilderness Calendar 2015 is the culmination of the artists desire to relaunch his self-published calendar range. In 2011 he produced his first Scottish Mountain Wilderness calendar for distribution in the UK. With the difficulties of breaking into the established market for such products coupled with a turbulent financial period it proved to be non-cost-effective to continue the following year, despite numerous requests from individuals who had purchased the 2011 issue. This relaunch will dispense with the intermediaries, allowing the artist to offer the product for a reasonable price without needing to produce a large print-run. Printed to the highest standards using sustainable materials, the \ncalendar would make an excellent Christmas or birthday gift, not to \nmention a fine personal purchase for anyone who loves the wild \nspaces this beautiful country has to offer.

  "In the new supernatural thriller\u00a0Lazy Susan, a new horror icon will be born. Susan is an evil twin like no other. And we want you to be part of her cinematic legacy. But first: 1. Why am I qualified to make the next great horror film? This past year, I've had the pleasure of sharing past projects in a documentary called HEART ATTACK: The Early Pulse Pounding Cinema of Kelly Hughes. It played at film festivals in London and Portugal.\u00a0 But it was at a screening at the Thin Line Film Fest in Denton, TX where I met two of the future stars of Lazy Susan. Local filmmaker and actor Chad Withers introduced me to Rubber Gloves Rehearsal Studios. It's a bar/nightclub that features Denton's most cutting-edge bands. And that night he was filming a nu-millennial punk rock band called DEEP Throat. And their lead singer, Taylor Kimbrough, was so electrifying, I knew I had to come out of retirement and create a new project to showcase her intensity. 2. Why the obsession with evil twins? The idea for Lazy Susan came from my love of evil twins. And movies like David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers where one actor plays both twins. Years ago, I created a twins episode for my TV show Heart Attack Theatre. And the episode was called Sisters. It involved a psychic nun and her adulterous twin sister. And it was the first time I attempted to film an actress playing a scene with herself, using a stand-in to make it look like two distinct characters. I had such a good time with it. And have always wanted to do a similar effect on a bigger level. So this is my chance with Lazy Susan. 3. How did we get such a great cast? Fate! 4. I love horror movies. Will I get a copy of Lazy Susan when it's completed? Of course! Most of the donation options include a copy of the movie as a reward. So choose one of those, and you're good to go! 5. How will you spend my donation? We will put the money into audio and visual gear to give us the best production values possible. And will run a tight ship to make sure we finish on schedule, and create a special piece of cinema that everyone is proud to call their own! 6. How do I donate? Ready to give us a pledge, and call yourself a Movie Investor? All it take is a few clicks. We would love for you to join the team, and be part of the Lazy Susan experience.\u00a0 Just choose your donation amount in the column on the right, and it will walk you through the process ------> :) We really appreciate your support. And can't wait to share Susan with you when we're done. Let's create a new horror icon! Thanks. \u00a0http://www.kellywaynehughes.com P.S. I'll be promoting my upcoming book, as well as Lazy Susan, at Crypticon Seattle May 23-25. So if you're in the Seattle area, stop by my table. And I can give you more details about the project...",
  "Every time I fly into a reasonably large city at night I try to get a window seat. If it's a clear enough night I watch the view as we land. At first it looks like a nervous system. Clumps of lights connected by thin strands. As you get closer to the ground you start to see other shapes take form against an inky black backdrop. I have often thought about making paintings of this experience, and now I am.  I will be doing a series of paintings in all sizes based on this vision. In addition this will be my first series to have limited edition prints. I plan to have some sort of show of the paintings at some point, but before I can set that up I need to have some paintings to show. Right now I just have a few small ones, and the large two panel painting above that I made last year and have already sold. This is where the backers come in. I started out doing miniature paintings, which doesn't require a lot of space or a lot by the way of supplies. I have also recently decided to take on painting on a more full time basis, and have made the necessary adjustments to my day job hours to make this possible.  Part of the funding will be used for adequate lighting for my studio. Right now I can only paint by the window during the day. I am also in sore need of some new, larger, brushes, a larger portfolio to transport paintings, and if possible a better easel that will not fall over with a stiff breeze. There will be a significant outlay for scanning and printing service for the limited editions. Lastly part of the money raised will be used for basic business expenses such as establishing a website, accounting software, business cards, and promotional post cards.  What you should know as a backer: All limited edition prints will be cut to bleed (no white border), signed and numbered. The actual number of each edition will depend in part on the number of backers in each level. All original paintings will arrive on a gallery wrapped canvas, with matte varnish, and wired ready to hang on your wall. All backers, regardless of donation level, will receive one each of any promotional post cards that are produced for this series. As soon as I have any sort of show, open house, or reception lined up I will add an update with all pertinent information and invite each backer personally.\u00a0 Thanks for checking out my project! It can only succeed if other people know about it, so if you like what you see please share this page with your friends. ",

I'm looking for $1000 to help offset the cost of getting 200 of each of my new designs made! Please note that to cut down on packaging waste, unless you REQUEST backing cards via the survey, they will not be included. \u00a0 Backing cards are only really useful for presentation (ie if you intend on giving a pin as a present), so if you're going to open up your package and stick your pin directly on your jacket/board/etc, there's no point to having a backing card at all. \u00a0 When I receive the bulk order of pins, they are all individually bagged to prevent scratching - I will be leaving the pins in these bags unless you want the backing card! \u00a0 (Please see the picture below if you're not sure what a backing card is.) (Or if you don't want to wait until the kickstarter is over, you can always nab them on my storenvy site! )\u00a0 \u00a0All pins will be shipped in bubble wrap mailers. I'll be placing the order for the pins before the kickstarter even wraps up, so you'll be getting your pins very quickly! \u00a0They will start shipping in September. \n \u00a0\u00a0So! In conclusion: Buy some pins to wear and inflict your deep dark love of puns and other nerdly things on all who dare gaze upon your lapels!\u00a0",

  "Hi! We're Felix and Fancy and we're creating enamel pins.\u00a0 In the world of Pokemon, these creatures are more like pets than anything. The concept of Pokemon shaming came from imagining beloved Pokemon in the same position as your German Shepard, wearing a sign after crashing through a door after running at it at full speed. Now you can imagine what kinds of crazy situations your Pokemon might get into.\u00a0 The first two rewards include a long standing favorite, Pikachu, as well as new fan favorite Wooloo. We've created another set of Pokemon pins of Pichus wearing the various hats available in the Pokemon universe. This time, we have chosen to expand the amount of Pokemon as well as offer a load of pins to choose from should each goal be reached.\u00a0 Our Pin Tiers are as follows! Each pin from these tiers will measure 1.5\" or 38.1mm at its largest point. Initial: Pikachu and Wooloo Locked! Litwick and Rowlet Locked! Trubbish and Skiddo Locked! Inkay Locked! Zweilous Locked! Drifloon Locked! Biggest Shaming! 3\" or 76.2mm pins COMING SOON! \u00a0How to choose your pins: Kickstarter cost Breakdown!

  "Novel Horizons is a Texas based Publisher of Original English Light Novels dedicated to bringing high quality and enjoyable stories into your hands!\u00a0 Established September 2020, we've picked up multiple works and are working on continuing to expand our lineup with high quality stories. Twitter Discord Server Official Website Why Kickstarter?\u00a0 We find Kickstarter to be a very reliable and safe way to gather pre-orders and gauge interest in a series and/or project. The funds from this campaign will be used to print physical copies of Azure Wing Volume 1 along with merchandise. Funds will also go toward covering editing costs and formatting costs. Otherwise, Azure Wing Volume 1 is complete so we expect the wait time from campaign end to receiving the novel to be fairly short! Book details:\u00a0 Volume 1 of Azure Wing is estimated to be approximately 300 pages. Making it our beefiest book to date.\u00a0 There will be two versions of this novel released:\u00a0 A 5x7 softcover copy which is the standard edition with full color cover and a synopsis back. There will also be a 5x8 hardcover variation which will be the Limited Edition with alternate front/back artwork. Conceptualized in the early 2000's, Azure Wing started off as a young middle schooler's story that was written in the boredom of class.\u00a0 Starting with the creation of \"Fenix\" and \"Sylvia\" as his partner, the two characters went through many incarnations before ending up in what one may consider a story.\u00a0 But it wasn't until the year 2016 that \"Azure Wing\" , after countless rewrites and hundreds of tossed pages, became the epic, action tale it is.\u00a0 Following a successful campaign to become a visual novel, the project was eventually met with a series of unfortunate events that drove the developer under.\u00a0 Azure Wing has since been picked up to become a full fledged Light Novel in order to tell the story of Fenix and his journey due to the overwhelming support from the community to see it continue.\u00a0 Rewritten, upgraded, and revived, we are proud to present to you \"Azure Wing\" Volume One!\u00a0 Synopsis:\u00a0 Elves, Dwarves, Merfolk. Fenix Solari had seen all manner of enemies in his time as a Captain in the Mage Knight organization. Acting as the tip of the spear that thrust into the hearts of humanities enemies during the \"Great War\". Dauntless with his partner known as the \"Crimson Flame\", he left battlefields torn asunder until the day he was captured. Trapped in a prison of eternal ice, Fenix would disappear from the war and it wouldn't be until hundreds of years later that he would awaken once more. His \"world\" existing now only in ruins or the pages of a history books. Characters: \u00a0----------Sylvia Vaeros: Valkyrie Commander and partner to Mage Knight Captain Fenix Solari, Sylvia Vaeros is known by friend and foe as the \"Crimson Flame\". Her contributions in the \"Great War\" fighting for the Human side has earned her a place in history books across the world by all.\u00a0 Feared or respected, no one denies Sylvia her place as one of the strongest beings to participate in what would be known as the bloodiest conflict ever witnessed. ----------Faelan A female \"silver-back\" Okamean, Faelan is extremely important to her race simply due to being born with the rare genetic mutation that gives her physical capabilities many times higher then a normal Okamean while also having the ability to cast magic.\u00a0 This fact alone has caused her to live her life heavily protected and created a desire to be free in her which led to her unfortunate capture by Elf Slave traders. Luckily for her, they elected to travel through a \"Lost Zone\" and the Darkened Ones are not picky with prey. ---------Alea Terja A high elf princess, Alea Terja perceives herself to embody the elven ideals of beauty, fairness, and elegance. A powerful fighter in her own right with the ability to use powerful magics that many older elves cannot, she is an inexperienced commander with dreams of living up to the legend and reputation of her father who was famously known as \"Tempest\" during the great war. ----------Salvatore Deneva\u00a0 Legendary by title alone, the Salvatore known as Deneva would create her own mark on human history by developing powerful Etherite-based tools and revolutionizing navel warfare.\u00a0 With her contributions, the water constricted navy of the Denif were capable of traveling over land, eliminating the once crippling weakness of the grand Denif Navy. Many speak of her unparalleled mastery of the rapier but none can say they've experienced it. A testimony to her fearsome strength. Sample Illustrations \u00a0Promotional artwork/Merchandise(Survey will be sent out to verify orders. Simply add to your pledge the cost of the item(s) you'd like to also get.) ----------Winter \u00a0Season Postcard Series(Limited time)(5$ each)\u00a0 ----------Parallel Professions Postcard Series(5$ each) ----------Stretch Goals\u00a0 A few extra's that we want to aim for to add just a bit more to Volume 1's initial release!\u00a0 -----4.500$ If we can reach 4,500$ then we will be able to add more illustrations to the inside of the book! We will also be adding some extra story content to the end of the book(Side stories) for readers to enjoy! That will feature their own B/W illustration(s).\u00a0 -----6,000$ At 6,000$ we would have enough excess funding to be able to spend money on developing a mini-figure of one of the characters in Azure Wing!\u00a0 This mini-figure would be unpainted and probably stand at about 4.25 inches tall. The character will be determined using a popularity poll.\u00a0",
  "I wrote Dwarfhammer because I wanted to write a book that would inspire my daughters and give young men a chance to think about what respect means - without being told how to think. I work with offenders in prisons and I am challenged when I hear the same justifications that they use for their crimes against women being repeated by men, often otherwise good men, on the outside. We need stories to deal with men's violence because, as I discovered when one man offered to knock me out in a pub, just telling men that they are sexist doesn't work. Stories help us to understand other people and their struggles and to know what it means to be a victim. Stories also give us hope and the courage to push on against overwhelming odds. Now, more than ever, we need to change the stories we tell ourselves.\u00a0 So, want to know what the book is about? Three young dwarves are cast out of their village and must embark on an epic journey to reclaim the Dwarfhammer, stop an invading horde and somehow not carve each other to pieces along the way. Tolly is fierce and deadly, but can she discover the wild talent that is within her? Luki, her twin brother, creates chaos wherever he goes but will he survive to tell his story? Arnfel, the proud son of the murdered Chief, must recover the Dwarfhammer - the ancient relic of his clan - and unite the dwarves before it is too late. Old and young, male and female, outsiders and purebloods - all must find a way to overcome old prejudices or be crushed by the coming war. At last I have written the novel, the next step is to get it published and I feel that this might be the biggest challenge of all. I want to give the book the best chance it can get and for that I need to get the novel professionally edited, commission artwork and create a website. Dwarfhammer is to be edited in October, the artwork completed in November and the final pitch to publishers finalised in December. I have chosen good people to edit and illustrate and this costs money. The editing is $A780 and the artwork is $A500+. My Kickstarter budget is $A800 to get the project off the ground. You can join the campaign to have Dwarfhammer published by chipping in for the artwork. We need the images of Tolly, Luki and Arn to fill the front cover of the book and to inspire the website. What will these three feisty young dwarves look like?",

  "I'm a photographer from Salem, Oregon and I'm looking to expand my portfolio. What better way to expand my portfolio than taking beautiful pictures of earth from up above. I plan on sending a camera 100,000 feet above the earth to capture some amazing photos. I'm raising funds to help pay for the helium, weather balloon, and tracking device. I'll share my photos with everyone who can help make this possible.\u00a0",

Up to this point I have only had a camera on my phone.\u00a0 If I had a good DSLR Camera, I could really take some great pics! Even requests! Not out to really make money just to share my photos with the world! Who knows it just might turn into something more.\u00a0 I love taking photos. This is how I capture my life and the people I share it with. It's almost a history of my life. I just want to make sure the pics last though the ages!",
  "The one thing in my life that gives me joy and makes me forget everything else is my photography. I have no training and I've been told I have a natural eye. Im a single mother of a 10 year old boy. Im also disabled and have been for the last 25 years. Once upon a time I really didnt have alot to look forward to because I battled pain on a daily basis because of an allergy to pain meds I was really given no comfort. Then a few years ago I was given a nice camera and discovered I love photography. While I took pictures the pain I was always in didnt seem so bad. I also realized there is so much beauty seen through the lens of a camera and you can capture nature's emotions in such a startling way. My love and passion for photography ended in heartbreak when a passerby stole my camera bag from our luggage as we were distracted checking in to a hotel. Im looking to replace them hopefully before the summer is over so I can get back to picture taking. My Galleries for my photography are below.",
  "Ephie & Celia Risho invite you to join them on an epic journey with their first young-adult novel Phoenix Rising, book one of The Elementalists series. The father/daughter team have worked 2 1/2 years through numerous revisions to bring this adventure to life. With the critical eyes of writers\u2019 groups, editors, artists and a supportive family they are excited to welcome you on this journey. A strange creature attacks Amber\u2019s village and burns one of the fields. Amber bravely goes on a quest to find the creature and learn how to stop it. But the journey turns out to be far more important than she ever imagined.\u00a0 This book is not only a good story about heroism, it\u2019s a great way to support young authors and readers. This platform for releasing the book is our chance to get the book into your hands where the normal publishing world has so many roadblocks. We were able to work with the kinds of artists we wanted to, and bring exactly the right kind of story at the right time.\u00a0 And we are so grateful for your interest! With you, this story becomes a shared experience we can all appreciate. As we continue to bring future books in the series to you, we can all journey together!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It all started when Celia started reading voraciously and said to me one evening, \u201cDad, we should write a book together!\u201d It turned out she had lots of ideas, and they quickly took shape. At our bedtime routines she\u2019d say, \u201cDad! Did you write the next chapter yet?\u201d To which I would be thrilled if I\u2019d made the time the night before or in between things to eke it out. As I read to her she'd correct words or ideas. \u201cNot like that, Dad, like this!\u201d She made it funnier and the characters more colorful. I recently looked back at the notes from our first brainstorming session and laughed. The story has some of the core ideas from that time, but took a completely different arc in the end, with many layers, intrigue, and the potential for at least five books in the series. After sharing it out with numerous family and friends and seeing the story grow, we took it to a writer's group. Every step it became a better book. In the summer of 2019 we found our editor, Ann Castro. Little did we know, Ann would guide us in transforming our book from its simple form into a work of art! The editing process was tough for Celia, since she was less involved, so we focused on book two. Editing book one while simultaneously writing book two turned out to be a lot of work \u2014 late nights, early mornings, writing on an iPad on business trips 20,000 feet above the continent. Now, we're finally ready to release book one to all of you! This has been one of the most rewarding things I\u2019ve ever done in my life, and we haven\u2019t even published it yet! I\u2019m excited to share these books with all of you. I see them not just as good stories, but a glimpse into what\u2019s possible. As the characters have come to life, I've related to each one of them, and they've become like friends. I admit that there was a time or two when I used the characters\u2019 bravery as examples when parenting Celia. \u201cDo you really think that\u2019s a good choice? What do you think Amber would do in this situation?\u201d LOL. I feel guilty now writing this down \u2014 using a fictional character as an example. But that\u2019s the power of a good story, isn\u2019t it? It should change our lives. It\u2019s certainly changed ours. \ud83d\ude09\u00a0\u00a0 Ephie (dad) has been writing his whole life, inspired by his sixth grade teacher to write a story every week. He enrolled in the writing program at his undergrad Middlebury College and has been writing ever since. He loves the outdoors, music, community, his family and telling stories. He\u2019s lived in Vermont, British Columbia, Costa Rica, and at the time of writing this book, beautiful Bozeman, Montana where he works in software development. Celia (daughter) is an avid book lover, and packs a novel with her wherever she goes. She developed the book idea at age nine inspired by a writing assignment. She was born in Vancouver, Canada where her first two syllable word was \u201chockey\u201d! She and her brother are being raised in the mountains of Montana, where she enjoys sewing, 4H, performance art, and visiting hot springs. At the time of this writing, not only are five books in this series planned, a whole new series is partially formed in her mind!\u00a0 Choosing self-publishing has allowed us to work with the artists and editor who we\u2019ve selected, and to release our book in the way we want \u2014 straight to you! It also has with it our own share of taking on the costs. We\u2019re hoping this Kickstarter will take the edge off of some of what we\u2019ve put into it, as well as cover the costs of buying copies to autograph.\u00a0 In addition to printing costs and shipping, the other costs have totaled about $6,000, including: Thank you for supporting an amazing story about heroism, and the young authors and readers of this book. We are sincerely grateful for your interest! With you, this story becomes a shared experience we can all appreciate.\u00a0 We would be so grateful if you would share this with your friends. The only way we can continue writing sustainably is if these books are well-read.\u00a0 We invite you to join us on this journey! We\u2019ll be providing blog-style updates which you can sign up for at theelementalists.net. Until then...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And a little laugh ...",

(Follow the project on the website blog) www.aburningmanportraitproject.com  \u201cWelcome Home.\u201d These are the first words you here when you arrive at \nthe gates of Burning Man. It is a Home like no other, transporting it\u2019s \neager participants into a world unknown and incomprehensible to \noutsiders. Participants are released from the bonds of their daily \nlives. They are free to express themselves in all manner of ways \ncreative, bizarre and joyful.  \n\tThe experience of Burning Man can be life-changing for many people, and\n is at the very least, profound and extraordinary. It is almost \nunimaginable what is created out there in a temporary city of art and \nlavish experience, literally in the middle of nowhere, in the dust, wind\n and heat. However what truly creates this event is the people. Burning \nMan is at its core an event created by incredible people willing to \nbrave the harshest of environments to bring their particular form of \ncreation and expression to the community, to truly let their hair down, \nrecreate themselves and share an experience that can be had no where \nelse on the planet. It is these people that participate in this glorious\n act of communal creation that inspired me to create \"Welcome Home: a Burning Man \nPortrait Project*.\" A Burning Man Portrait Project* is an art project including a series of \nexhibited paintings and an art book, the creation of which will be \nchronicled by a blog and a short documentary video. This project will be\n funded by your generous donations. Follow the project from start to finish on the website blog. Thank you for supporting the Arts. Project Details: (a more detailed description can be read on the website) What is a Burning Man Portrait Project? A Burning Man Portrait Project is a multi-phase art project by professional fine artist Marie Vlasic consisting of an  \n\tArt Exhibit (paintings), \n\tBlog/Website, \n\tBook, & \n\tVideo    Art Exhibit (paintings)  \n\tThe Portrait Project is a series of paintings of the \u201cChildren of \nthe Dust\u201d, the people of the Burning Man community. The people at the \nevent are very unique, not just in their commonly outrageous dress (or \nundress) but their countenance, their demeanor, is unique to the event.\u00a0\n It is my intention to focus on the individual, to capture them by \nvisually separating them from the over-stimulating surroundings by a \nwhite backdrop. The \u201cmodels\u201d will be photographed on-site, and the \npaintings will be created from these photographs during the year \nfollowing the event. A solo show of the paintings has been scheduled at \nWalker Fine Art in Denver in September 2012. (more gallery exhibits TBA)\n The opening night of the exhibit will be an event in itself, giving \nvisitors a taste of Burning Man (see website for more details)   Blog/Website  \n\tThe entire process of a Burning Man Portrait Project, from beginning to end, \nwill be written about and photographed in a blog which will be part of \nthe website dedicated to the project. Portions of the blog will be \nprinted in the book\u00a0 \u201cWelcome Home, a Burning Man Portrait Project\u201d* (see \nbelow)  Book  \n\tI will create a quality art book of the project, which will include \nimages of the paintings, photos of the preparation and the event, as \nwell as excerpts from the project blog.

  "As a child I went on many boat trips around the world heritage site on the south coast of England, known as the Jurassic Coast. One eventful day the boat was brushed by a huge, slow beast of the ocean. Natural inclination to think \"great white\" were quickly removed when my uncle corrected me in announcing it was a basking shark. Clueless, and nervous, I got home and leafed through my children's encyclopaedia to discover more. 20 years on, I am still fascinated by this graceful, harmless dinosaur of the sea and have spent many a summer in search for more sightings (with many successful trips). Now in 2014 the species is on the conservation vulnerable list, I need to increase awareness of its plight and kick start a project that can help protect it. Your pledge will go towards diving and photographic equipment that will capture the glory of these magnificent creatures. Your reward will be personal satisfaction that you have played a part in increasing the awareness of the basking shark and it's future plight.\u00a0",
  "I am a trained and licensed EMT and Fire Fighter that has looked for ways to diversify myself from others in the field. One day I took a Discover Scuba Diving class to see if that would be a route that I would want to take in my career... and then it happened.. I fell in love with it! I have never been so relaxed and happy in my life till i was under the water in that class... but because money is tight after paying the bills, I can not afford to take the certification class. My other hobby evolved photography usually the nature kind. After working for the Walt Disney Co. in and around animals, I became a fan of nature photography and all the wonders that come with it. Not only would I be able to use the training to help show the wonders of nature in photos and contribute to everyones knowledge of this eco system that is slowly eroding away.. but I can use it in my Fire and EMS career to help others in need\u00a0 This KickStarter campaign is two fold.... First its to assist me in getting certified in SCUBA and secondly to buy photography equipment that I can use while under the waves looking at the beauty that. it holds.",
  "Mal has been training for almost a year to be a dream guardian, but even still he's ill-equipped to deal with what's coming. There is a new power in the Dreamscape, an ancient force tearing through the Cloud Runners and Whispers, without prejudice.\u00a0 He shouldn't get involved, but Mal and his friends have a habit of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The mystery in the Dreamscape is going to reveal a long lost secret and will set in motion events that will lead to a dream war. \u00a0Mal Winter and the Last Titan is the epic continuation of Mal's adventures, but even if he survives, he will be forever changed. When you sleep, your soul ascends to the Dreamscape and you experience dreams. But there are Nightmares in the 'Scape, demons hungering to devour your very essence.\u00a0 Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners is our introduction to the dream world. We meet Mal and learn about the Dreamscape, the Nightmares, the Cloud Runners, and his father's connection to it all.\u00a0 It's worth noting that any reward that includes Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners will be the revised edition of the book. Although there are no major changes in this edition, it has been proofed and edited for an improved reading experience.\u00a0 Mal Winter and the Last Titan is the second book in the Mal Winter saga, but not the last. The complete series includes a total of six books; the next one titled: Mal Winter and the Lucid Eye. \u00a0 Mal Winter and the Last Titan is Danny's second book, and he's excited to share the second adventure of Mal Winter. Danny has written numerous screenplays, including one that produced a feature film in rural Australia. He's won various writing competitions and been published in some literary magazines.\u00a0 You'll always find Danny writing...well when he's not reading or drawing or playing Xbox.\u00a0 This is Danny's first Kickstarter campaign.\n\u00a0 Please see a couple of the completed revised chapters of Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners.\u00a0 View Sample Chapters Here As Mal Winter and the Last Titan is still being edited I won't share those chapters yet. But, I hope to update this page with some chapters during the campaign so you can get a sense of the story and characters and writing! We've designed the rewards to be very simple, and you can use the following chart to ensure you get the right book. All print books will come signed by the author, and all backers will get their name in the print and ebook. Shipping is not included in the above prices. So please ensure your name is correct when ordering. *Any preorder with Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners will include an updated revised version of the book. Although the story and characters will remain the same, the book has been re-edited to read better. As I'm based in Australia, shipping is a bit prohibitive around the world. However, I have calculated shipping in most cases at cost, or less. If you're shipping costs are too much, following the Kickstarter, both Mal Winter and the Last Titan and the revised Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners will be available to be delivered around the world through Amazon, Book Depository, and anywhere good books are sold. For reaching 115%, all physical book orders will get a Charli themed bookmark, with a tassel, you can see the art below. Final bookmark artwork may vary. So, why Kickstarter? What a strange choice it might seem. Well, there are a few reasons.\u00a0 1) Flexible Preorder Tiers I wanted a simple platform that would help me take preorders for my new book Mal Winter and the Last Titan. And, there weren't many that would allow me the flexibility I needed to offer the combinations I have. Kickstarter's tiered pledging, allowed me to offer what I thought might be some great ways to get the book.\u00a0 2) Maximum Reach Kickstarter is a global platform, which could mean potentially reaching new readers. What Kickstarter does is offer a chance to be seen by not only friends, family, and existing readers, but the world.\u00a0 3) Better percentages Amazon has become one of the best channels for my book in recent months, but, in all honesty, they get over half the money. Which is fine, because they're a massive international network. But it also means I typically make less than a dollar a book. (Not complaining, I set the margin really low so it's affordable!) Kickstarter only take a small percentage, so it means I can sell the books for cheaper, and make hopefully more than $1 per book!",
  "Crownby started almost a year ago today with a conversation. My little sister was in middle school at the time and I had called her to ask about how school was going. She confided in me that she didn\u2019t like being herself \u2013jaw drop. I thought, \"Here is this fiery little, redhead/bookworm/future president of the United States and gosh dang it, she doesn't know how amazing she is!\"\u00a0 I needed something to show my little sis how amazing and worthy of her own love she was. I needed her to see what I saw when I looked at her, a Queen. And I also realized she had to be the one to come to that realization. That's when I started\u00a0developing Crownby. Look, we all struggle with self love. Gosh dang, wouldn't it be nice to have something and someone to guide and support us on one of the most important endeavors we can make? Wouldn't it be amazing to support the girls and women we love by sending them a gift this meaningful? I have absolutely loved creating Crownby. I have loved being part of something so meaningful and good. Creating this program has been and still is my self-love journey. It's changed the way I treat myself and helped me conquer some tough fears. Our mission as a company is to 1) help you 'Crown your inner Queen' and 2) for you to help others do the same. When you see yourself as a Queen, we want you to turn to the woman next to you and make sure she is wearing her crown too.\u00a0 We want to invite you to join us in our mission and be part of this Queen community. I\u2019m asking you to help fund our first bulk order of programs and get some Queens crowned. We appreciate all the support and love we have received so far. We're excited to ship our first programs out.\u00a0 -Queen Adley For four months I spent my time personally researching self-love. I compiled a preliminary four weeks' worth of self-love challenges and sent it into the world to have it reviewed by therapists, life coaches, and other women and teenage girls. I wanted this program to truly make a difference for women and girls on their self-love journeys. I sent out developmental programs to friends/volunteers. I collected feedback, adjusted, and sent it out again. Finally after nearly a year of adjusting and sourcing this is our Program. Our mission is to help you build a better relationship with yourself. We do that by challenging you in FOUR different areas of self-love.\u00a0 WEEK ONE\u00a0 CHALLENGES INCLUDE: WEEK TWO\u00a0 CHALLENGES INCLUDE: WEEK THREE CHALLENGES INCLUDE: WEEK FOUR CHALLENGES INCLUDE: Here's a detailed layout and description of what we include in our boxes. Why do we need your help here on Kickstarter? Our program consists of a combination of products, packaging materials, and printing. When ordered separately or in small quantities Crownby becomes quite expensive. By ordering in bulk we lower the cost of our program significantly for our Queens. \u00a0We need your help to fund our first bulk order. Products & Packaging: We need to fund\u00a0100 programs' worth of products and packaging supplies for our our first bulk orders. Workbook Publishing: We need funding to place an order for 100 printed Crownby Workbooks\u00a9.",
  "THE STORY In the distant future, the gods have judged humanity, stripping them of their sapience. With humanity's forbidden knowledge locked away, many of the earth's beasts have risen with their own cultures and myths. Far to the north, in the great Greentide Forest, rests the remote village of Dreymoot. The squirrels of Dreymoot have been story-keepers for centuries, content to live vicariously through the gathered lore of the great continent.\u00a0 Yet one squirrel longs to leave his cloistered existence. To experience the magic and mystery that lies beyond the safety of the forest. Join Hackberry as he journeys far from his home, driven to seek his long-lost father, and caught up in a struggle for power that will shape the future of his world.\u00a0 SOME BACKGROUND INFO I've written several books in the past: some nonfiction books on spirituality and politics as well as one children's book called A Wolf at the Gate that was critically well received (and a lot of fun to write).\u00a0 I wrote A Wolf at the Gate for my son, Jonas. Back in those years, he was a cuddly little tyke. At bedtime, he'd nestle into my shoulder as I'd tell him stories. Sometimes, I'd read them. But often, I'd share stories of my own devising.\u00a0 Many of those stories featured a bold squirrel named Hackberry. As Jonas aged, the stories developed and deepened. Soon, the stories would wander away from our bedtime ritual and haunt my waking thoughts. Often, I'd find myself lost in imagination, thinking of Hackberry's world and the numerous characters who inhabit it.\u00a0 Now that Jonas is nearly twelve, I've decided that now is the time to finish my first Hackberry novel. I'm writing it for Jonas and older children everywhere\u2014for those entering young adulthood in uncertain times.\u00a0 One might think that stories about talking animals would be geared towards little children. But anyone who has ever read Watership Down knows better. Over the years, the adventures of Hackberry have become more complex and dark. No longer quaint stories for a cuddly kindergartner, these are stories that speak to the challenges of our own world. The best of fantasy (especially young adult fantasy) not only helps us escape into an imaginary world, but equips us to be clever and brave in our own.\u00a0And that requires a level of honesty about the world that, ironically, can rarely be found outside of fiction.\u00a0 ANTICIPATED BOOK LENGTH This will end up around 250-300 pages long (55,000 to 67,000 words). If everything goes well with the book, it will be the first of a series of a minimum of four book.\u00a0 INFLUENCES In a review of A Wolf at the Gate, Kirkus said that I write with \"sharp, muscular prose.\" Stylistically, that would put me in the company of writers like Melville, McCarthy, and Hemingway. It is true: I try to use words economically. I want to to paint pictures with action and context rather than furnishing my books with long descriptions.\u00a0 As a writer, though, I focus more on story than craft. A good story adequately written sticks with me far longer than an adequate story written well. In this particular case, the tales of Hackberry are heavily influenced by Walter M. Miller Jr's A Canticle for Leibowitz, Richard Adams' Watership Down, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books, and Norse mythology. I am also influenced by Tolkien and Lewis, sometimes in spite of myself.\u00a0 WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?\u00a0 We did it! The project is funded. In the past 24 hours, I've been bombarded with support for this project. To keep the momentum going, I've added some stretch goals. This will give you a sense of what any money above and beyond the initial goal would go towards.\u00a0 What's a stretch goal? From Kickstarter's FAQ: \"A stretch goal is a funding target set by the project creator beyond the original Kickstarter goal. Stretch goals as a term and a practice emerged from the Kickstarter community as a way for creators to 'stretch' beyond the initial, official goal of the Kickstarter project and raise more money (and often make cooler stuff!). Funds are collected whether stretch goals are met or not, as long as the project has met its Kickstarter funding goal.\" More money means that I can get better design help, offer a higher-quality printing of the book, and offer cooler rewards to backers. So, if you'd like to make the book even better, here are some new stretch goals:",
  " Hello friend, I enjoy making art. Perhaps \"enjoy\" isn't a strong enough word, I love making art. My life's goal is to be able to support myself through artwork and as of right now I am closer to my life's goal than I have ever been before and it feels absolutely wonderful. I need a small bit of help, though. A tiny boost. This is why I come to you on Kickstarter.    I'm here to ask for a couple of months of time. Time to create and paint and live. In return for your generosity and leap of faith, you'll receive a one of a kind piece of art I've made. In short, you would be purchasing a piece of artwork in advance. I could use your favorite colors or subjects in the painting or make it a surprise, whatever you like.   The price of the postage is included in the pledge. Here is a link to my Tumblr account. I've posted hundreds of paintings and other artworks on there as to give you a better idea of my style. Acrylics are my strong point so I use them for most of my work.    On a side note, if successful, this campaign will also allow me the time to keep creating a series of art videos which I've titled \"Arting with Jim\" . The link goes to episode 1 which is about colorblindness. I hope to expand the series to include fun projects that people can do at home very inexpensively and sharing tips and tricks I've learned about working with different materials. I hope to make them funny as well. These videos don't cost money, they just take time. Precious precious time.   Thank you very much for reading about my Kickstarter campaign. Please feel free to message me with any questions or concerns you may have. Thank you again. Love, Jimmy",
  "This is the sequel to the wildly successful Kickstarter The Empress and the Archer: The Empress' Quest book 1. I am delighted to be here today sharing this with you. I have learned a lot since last year's venture. Almost all of the work needed to get published is accomplished, all that is left is to raise the money. I look forward to hearing from people who backed us last year, and to meeting many more.",
  "We think that... everyone should smell like meat! We firmly believe that the aroma of freshly cooked bacon should linger long after breakfast and that meaty and clean go hand in hand. That's how we arrived at Meat Soap. By using animal byproducts that are typically discarded as main ingredients in bars of soap, we are looking to change minds about what \"clean\" means. A variety of fats will be rendered by our crack team of fat melters to create a rainbow of colors, scents, and flavors (but don't eat Meat Soap, no matter how tempting!) Our plan is to design and fabricate a custom soap mold to produce our collection of butcher paper-wrapped soaps. We hope to spark a lively debate about personal hygiene and meat consumption, while resurrecting the tradition of using animal-based resources to their fullest potential. We think clean people should smell like bacon, not like mint or roses. We must raise enough money to pay to for a set of soap molds from a custom mold producer out of Portland, Oregon. Once we hit our funding target we'll procure the molds, melt some fat, and develop our bars of soap. Producing the custom molds will cost a minimum of $500, so the more bars of soap people request, the lower the cost of the soap! We'll order the raw materials for our soap (assorted meat fat to render and glycerin soap base) and we'll manufacture enough soap to keep you lathered in protein! Then we'll lovingly wrap each bar with butcher paper and send it to you! Don't mind the grease stains, they add character! FAQ Is it safe?\nEr... probably? Meat Soap has not been tested on animals but we've been washing our hands with our prototypes. Since Meat Soap contains no preservatives it won't last forever, and for the love of Mike DO NOT TRY TO EAT IT NO MATTER HOW DELICIOUS IT SMELLS. What's with the stickers?\nWe want you to stick our cute piggy logo on everything. We're looking at making them scratch n' sniff to smell like bacon if possible, but otherwise they'll be awesome vinyl stickers for you to treasure! What do these shirts look like, anyway?\nCheck out PROJECT UPDATE #3. Wait - if I pledge $400 you'll buy a PIG?\nYes. We'll buy a pig through Heifer International to help make someone's life better! What happens if you don't get funded?\nThen your pledge will not be charged and Meat Soap will fade into a tragic cloud of obscurity and darkness forever. What if I'm a Vegetarian?\nWell, some of us like plants a little more than others. But you can still get some Meat Soap! That way you'll smell like meat without needing to eat it!",
  "The first two editions were held with a limited budget raised through a Crowdfunding campaign and with the support given on a local level. Nevertheless, the result was very successful and of cultural relevance, mixing screenings, concerts, workshops, and exhibition.\u00a0 Once again this year we decided to rely on Kickstarter, since we are too small to apply for institutional funds at this stage and also we want to maintain the festival completely independent.\u00a0 We decided to increase the goal we want to reach since we are working on introducing new categories and new activities to the program, developing it on three days and giving more room to music.

  "I want to go to Vermont next spring and ART my heart out. This is my first opportunity to go to a residency like this. I will be free of distractions and get to focus my work on a big project. I will have an entire month to delve into myself in a place where others understand. I will attend artist lectures weekly, have studio visits, and access to a Life Drawing Model. This is a huge step for me as an artist. I am trying to become more self sufficient - to get out of the service industry struggle. The project I want to work on involves a series of drawings. I want to create a story that will be part of an installation I make after the residency. I will experiment with fabric, found materials, and my favorite of adhesives, Hot Glue. The money will be used for the remaining cost of the residency. I received an artist grant ($850), and will be doing dishes as a work exchange($600.) Any money donated above the funding amount will be used for art supplies and travel to Vermont. If you are interested in more than one reward - bid the combined amount in the higher reward category. I will make it work: example - for a t-shirt and an animal drawing bid $85 in the drawing category and send me a comment.

  "My name is Keely, and I'm an artist who specializes in the mediums of scratchboard, printmaking, and painting. I draw a great deal of my inspiration from dreams, the night sky, and long, brilliant winters. This winter, I have been accepted as an artist in residence in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, in Norway. Svalbard is an archipelago located midway between mainland Norway, and the North Pole. It is located between the 74\u00b0 to 81\u00b0 north latitude, making it one of the most northerly places one can live on this planet. My residency is for a period of approximately two months beginning in the height of winter so that I may fully experience the polar night, and make work inspired from the dreams that spring from it. The money donated to this project would be used to offset the cost of the plane tickets out to such a remote location from my current location of Seattle, WA. Donations would also be used for art supplies, food costs, rifle rental for safety as I hike outside of Longyearbyen (polar bears are common), fees, and other daily living expenses out and about in Svalbard. Donations would be happily compensated. Small donations would be compensated with personalized postcards from Longyearbyen or Ny-\u00c5lesund. Original drawings would be given for more substantial donations (subject matter is likely to include polar bears, northern lights, and glaciers), and I would deliver full original scratchboard pieces for the most generous of gifts. I can only give out a few of the full finished pieces, because I wish to have a full body of work when I return. Any gift would be gratefully received.",

  "The Boston Underground Film Festival (BUFF) labors year in and year out to bring exceptional films from all over the world to the Boston area each March. BUFF celebrates unconventional stories, idiosyncratic voices, fever dreams, nightmarish visions, and all manner of cinematic forms, in service of an audience ravenous for an annual sensory bacchanalia from beyond the mainstream. BUFF returns to Harvard Square's historic Brattle Theatre from March 21-25, 2018 for our 20th edition, with plans to make this year's program the most insane and provocative yet, but we need the support of our fans and community to make it happen! In the past, the festival has been able to survive on the generosity of sponsors. However, cash sponsorship has evaporated over the last few years, and we rely on the contributions of generous donors to help soften the blow of rental costs, printing and advertising, accommodating our attending feature filmmakers, and creating a vibrant, welcoming space for filmmakers to connect with one another and our fantastic audience. Unfortunately, this city is not getting any cheaper for struggling volunteer cineastes who just want to show some love to underappreciated and overlooked films and filmmakers. BUFF has a successful twenty-year history of bringing fantastic cinema to an audience ravenous for a moviegoing experience outside the mainstream. We have also helped to nurture homegrown talent by creating a space to celebrate and support New England horror, animation, and independent filmmakers. Over the years, we've hosted such guests as Suzanne Ciani, Gabriel Bartalos, Jeremy Saulnier, Don Coscarelli, Bill Plympton, George Romero, Lloyd Kaufman, Frank Henenlotter, Lucky McKee, Angela Bettis, the late George Kuchar, and Mink Stole.\u00a0\u00a0 BUFF has also managed to give Boston audiences face time with such visionary contemporary filmmakers as Jason Eisener, Douglas Buck, Simon Rumley, Zach Clark, Karim Hussain, Alex Ross Perry, Anna Biller, and Ann Marie Fleming. We want this year's BUFF to continue with our tradition of bringing filmmakers face-to-face with an appreciative audience. We are reaching out to our audience to help lend support by buying festival passes early through this Kickstarter campaign. Your support now gives us the cashflow we need to bring in as many guests as we can, plus it helps us to underwrite the legendary parties we put together in celebration of fantastic films, filmmakers, and you\u2013yes, you\u2013our unspeakably incredible audience. Any form of support, great or small, is always welcome; every penny raised helps us immensely! \u00a0\"BUFF is a terrific festival! Great audience! Great staff! Screening there was a delight. I can't wait to return!\" \u2013 Don Coscarelli, Director of Phantasm, John Dies at the End \"Multiple Academy Award-winning filmmaker Ang Lee once said, 'I try to please everyone.'

  "It's my belief that stay at home fathers are underrepresented in current film and television. So I decided to do something about it and wrote a feature length screenplay called SURPRISE DIVORCE. I'm raising funds to attend the Catalina Film Festival, September 27-October 1st. It's the ideal opportunity to network with industry executives and hopefully connect with and sell my screenplay. Festival attendance and networking are the next necessary steps to successfully sell this screenplay. Several years ago I was complaining to my late father that I was not able to attend a Festival for Acting. My dad recommended raising funds on Kickstarter, and I poo poo'd it. He believed I had plenty of friends who would help when and where I need it. So I'm finally taking his sage advice and reaching out. Surprise Divorce is a story of a stay at home father/husband (Kevin) caught off guard by his wife\u2019s (Anne) desire to end their lengthy marriage. Kevin is forced to confront divorce from the perspective of a traditional \u201chousewife\u201d. Having no job or preparation to step into \u201cthe real world\u201d the screenplay follows him as he gets back on his feet, works through his pain and comes out the other side. Using therapy, laughter, and tears he makes his way through the modern world\u2019s new sexual politics. Politics that still view a stay at home father\u2019s work as not a real job. Surprise Divorce examines love, family, and divorce in a modern world that is slow to adapt to its new realities. Surprise Divorce has been quite successful on the festival circuit. To date this is a listing of the screenplay\u2019s accomplishments: \n\n\u00a0 Wins:  \n\u00a0 Surprise Divorce is a Finalist in the following Film Festivals: Catalina Film Festival, Windy City Film Festival, Short Stop International Film Festival, The Golden Script Competition, and Peachtree Village International Film Festival. It is also an Official selection in these Film Festivals: Feel The Reel Film Festival, London Independent Film Awards, Finish Line Script Competition, Oaxaca FilmFest, The European Independent Film Awards, Filmmakers International Screenwriting Awards with award notifications pending.  Any funds above and beyond the original request will support my attendance at additional festivals as well as script submissions to new festivals.",
  "With the famous fossil hunter Roy Chapman Andrews as inspiration, I too have had several different jobs at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, from administration to diorama painter to janitor! For the past 3 years I have traveled to Marfa, Texas, where I have shown my paintings and drawings at Eugene Binder Gallery. My current jackrabbit paintings are collectively titled \"No Man\u2019s Land.\" This work is influenced by the Southwest and rooted in the natural history of animals that exist in large numbers, with consideration of the unknowable nature of the animals\u2019 instinctual motives within their environment. Throughout my time working on these paintings, I\u2019ve started to consider the prehistory of environment and organism and the awesome improbable questions of our unknown future. My diorama projects and a recent trip to the South African Bushveld (a similar environment to Southwest Texas) have inspired me to look back, and learn more about the geology of the Permian Basin area. The Concept: A Collage of Past and Present During the Permian period shallow seas covered much of what is dry land in present-day Southwest Texas millions of years ago. Referencing a 1960\u2019s diorama of the Permian Sea from the American Museum of Natural History along with a diorama from the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland, TX, an invented landscape will be fabricated in the back of a cargo trailer. This artwork installation will be what I call a \u201cportable landscape\u201d and the first in the series. My goal is to connect the ancient to the present environment with the people living in Marfa, Texas, and the surrounding area, and call forth the primordial sense one feels while traveling through this land. The Construction: The overall structure will be a standard 6ft x 10ft cargo trailer centered in the gallery. Like looking through the viewfinder of a camera, a window will be cut into the side exposing an intimate underwater scene diorama. A painted ultramarine blue-green background, a three-dimensional foreground with objects and a proscenium will be constructed inside the trailer creating an ancient oasis, and offer sun-drenched viewers refuge as well as a look into the past. The seabed landscape will be barren incorporating a variety of casted and real fossils including brachiopods collected in the area. Today, these fossils continue to lie buried underground waiting to be discovered and maybe even owned! The Catalogue: The deep Southwest is often associated with journey, distance and space, survival and dehydration, borders and ownership, roadside Americana, aliens, religion, fossil hunting, crude oil, cattle ranches, freedom and exploration. An artist catalogue titled \u201cField Companion\u201d will accompany the work and illustrate a behind-the-scenes look at the artist\u2019s \u201cidea-prospecting\u201d with the intent to arouse the nostalgic and sometimes possessive powers that these ideas can evoke in people. What Your Donations will cover: -The cost of a cargo trailer (used or new)\n-Lumber and construction supplies and lighting\n-Sculpture and painting supplies\n-Printing fees for the artist catalogue What the Artist has Up to Date: - A venue: Eugene Binder Gallery, Marfa, Texas, opening date: October 8, 2010.\n- Workshop and space to complete the project including tools.\n- Labor\n- Living accommodations\n- Fossils, molds, drawings, photos, research, books (etc)\n- Completed electronic copy of the catalogue\n- Transportation",

Any other eleven-year-old kid might flip past a hand-drawn picture if they found it in a textbook. But not Drew Daley. When he discovers a detailed drawing tucked away in his science book, his entire life changes. He finds himself seeing everything differently and caring about things in a way he never did before. Drew becomes determined to find the artist, but with the list of names inside the front cover of his book as his only clue, the search isn\u2019t an easy one. He encounters overbearing teachers and bullies, broken windows and promises, and even death and destruction.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u00a0 On top of all that, Drew has to navigate through fifth grade, where he\u2019s learning some important life lessons: Lies can be more common than the truth, people aren\u2019t always who they seem, and the most complex problems rarely have \u201cright\u201d answers. Through it all, the drawing gives Drew peace of mind and direction. But how far is he willing to go to uncover the identity of the artist? Who is the book for? In a market flooded with otherworldly elements and doomsday scenarios, Detours and Designs will appeal to readers who gravitate toward multi-dimensional characters in realistic situations. ",

My initial Kickstarter goal is larger than my previous campaigns as I hope to cover the cost of multiple pieces upfront \u2013 something that the majority of my Instagram followers also voted for! My funding goal of \u00a31500 will cover the cost of creating the Cinders castle necklace and key chain, the Beauty castle necklace and keychain, \u201cPainting the Roses Red\u201d stud earrings, Symbol of the Gods earrings and the Royal Suite jumbo keychain. This funding goal also includes the cost of Kickstarter fees and the costs of shipping products to you! All earrings will be nickel free in accordance with UK guidelines. Gold plated earrings will all be plated with 22k gold. After this initial funding goal is met, the following stretch goals are: As an incentive for pledging on this Kickstarter campaign, you will receive rewards at the discounted price of \u00a38 per item. After the campaign has finished and the remaining items are listed in the shop, they will range between \u00a310 and \u00a320. By pledging, you will receive your item at an exclusive discounted price! You will also receive your items before any of them make it onto my shop \u2013 at least two weeks before they will be available for general sale. Lastly, you will of course be helping to fund these items! Without active pledging I would not be able to fund the cost of this jewellery collection and your pledges will help to make a dream a reality! * Pledges are not collected from Kickstarter until after the campaign ends giving you opportunity to increase or decrease your pledge throughout the time the campaign is active! Pledge now to secure your items at discounted rates and pay at the end! You will only be charged after the 30th of June. If we don't reach our initial goal you will not be charged!! * After campaigning ends, you will be able to select whichever rewards you would like out of those that have been unlocked. Stretch goals can\u2019t be unlocked without active pledging so if there is a design you want \u2013 make sure you pledge! This will increase the likeliness that goals will be unlocked. To change your pledge tier OR pledge amount; click on \"Manage Your Pledge\". Then click \"Change your pledge\" - this will allow you to change the reward tier or pledge amount All pledges will be sent as standard mail (second class for UK customers, standard international mail for international customers). You will have the opportunity to choose to upgrade your shipping to first class / signed for / tracked during the reward surveys at the end of the campaign! 1. The campaign is due to end on Sunday the 30th of June. 2. After the campaign ends, Kickstarter takes around 14 days to process and send me the funds that have been raised. After receiving the funds I will be able to place an order with my manufacturer\u00a0 3. Manufacturing can take between 3-5 weeks. 4. Once the jewellery arrives to me (approx. mid-late August), I will have to inspect each piece individually for quality. Depending on the quantity funded this could take 3-5 days. 5. I will then add the jewellery to cards / in jewellery boxes and begin packaging! 6. I estimate that, depending on how many pledges are received, the packaging and sending of parcels could take between 1-2 weeks meaning all rewards will be shipped early-mid September I will always remain very transparent about the processes with my manufacturer and will keep anyone who pledges updated if there is changes in the timeline If you would like to check out my shop to see what my final products / style is like, head to:\nwww.alicevitrum.com\nwww.alicevitrum.etsy.com\nwww.facebook.com/alicevitrum \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@alicevitrumapparel on Instagram\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@alicevitrum on twitter\u00a0",
  "This August and September I plan to combine my love for painting, my obsession with bikes, and my affection for all things abandoned and unloved. The resulting contrivance? A two-thousand-mile bicycle-powered painting documentary of America's industrial leftovers, the Rust Belt. Upon completing the trip, I will compile my Rust Belt paintings and drawings into a limited edition of hand-bound books. The Rust Belt is the area in the Northeast U.S. centered around the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. Once America's industrial backbone, the Rust Belt now features deserted factories and depressed local economies. Beginning in the 1970s, this former manufacturing powerhouse experienced severe, and in some areas crippling, economic decline. Many jobs moved to lower-wage areas of the US, to Mexico, and overseas. The exodus left Rust Belt cities littered with empty factories. I will be painting and drawing every day as I ride my way from my hometown in Madison, WI, through the Rust Belt, to New York City. I am biking and camping my way through this area to keep my costs low\u2026and also because I like biking. Like many of the people in the areas I will be traveling through, I don\u2019t currently have many liquid assets, so I need some help to get this ball rolling. I will need to pay for painting and drawing supplies, the shipping costs for mailing my paintings as I finish them, the cost of the book-binding materials, and the occasional meal. In essence, by contributing to my project, you are pre-paying for a piece of art that I will complete in the course of my journey. By ordering a drawing or painting or book or another contribution incentive you can help make my Rust Belt art project possible. Thank you!

  "Hello everyone! My name is Ashley & I run Blk Magic Cat! Thank you for checking out my first kickstarter ever! I\u2019ve been making pins for over a year & have mostly self funded everything. It wouldn\u2019t be possible for me to self fund all of these babies at once & I don\u2019t want them to have to be made months apart.. So I\u2019m hoping with all of your help we can get them all made together!\u00a0 You can follow me on \u00a0Twitter \u00a0& @blkmagiccat in Instagram\u2728 I will fund Eevee myself if needed, consider him to be the first unlocked design! So the initial goal of $400 will be for Flareon, Vaporeon! I didn't want to add them all in case this flops.. $2,000 will need to be raised to fund all\u00a0eeveelutions! I will keep everyone updated when the next one gets unlocked! Shiny versions will be added when we get fully funded!! Shiny Eevee will be unlocked from the start though\u2728 Pledge now, pay later! You won\u2019t get charge until the campaign is over, so if you don\u2019t have the money now but you will then you can hold your spot! If the eeveelutions you want are not unlocked yet pledge anyway! I have high hopes they will all get funded so in the end youll be able to choose the one you want, & if not you can always back out before you are charged. I will keep everyone constantly updated on what designs are unlocked. You can also change your pledge at anytime before the champaign ends!",
  "\u00a0Hello Everyone! I'm Anashi the illustrator/designer and one-woman show behind \u00a0Eriu Studios and also \u00a0Battitude (the bat-themed etsy shop!) I'm an avid animal enthusiast with a fluffy gray cat and two crazy ferrets. I had an intense love of the aesthetically pleasing so couple that with my love of books, comics, anime, video games and basically all things nerdy and...well...how was I NOT supposed to make adorable enamel pins??? You can check out my instagrams for both my etsy shops below: \u2694 art of nashi\u00a0 \u2694 Battitude Shop\u00a0 There are 6 designs in total and there might be a few stretch goals such as vinyl stickers, and other surprise goodies, but these won't unlock until all the pins have!\u00a0 These pins will back at $9 USD and the price with rise to $10 USD each after the kickstarter if any are left! The pins will unlock at the following tiers The main goal is set at the Daenrys Pin and the other 5 designs will unlock as follows: \u2694 Design 1 (Danny)- $200 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 Design 2 (Jon)- $360 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 \u00a0Design 3 (Arya)- $520 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 \u00a0Design 4 (Tyrion)- $680 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 Design 5 (Jamie)- $840 **UNLOCKED** \u2694 Design 6 (Night King)-$1000 \u00a0**UNLOCKED** BOTH STRETCH GOALS REACHED!! Sansa will unlock at $1200 \u00a0**UNLOCKED**\u00a0 The Hound will unlock at $1360 **UNLOCKED** Cersie will unlock at $1520\u00a0 All of the pins feature: \u2694 Sizing that changes with each design (ex Tyrion is the smallest pin) \u2694 Silver/Gold plating \u2694 Hard Enamel finish \u2694 2-3 Pantone matched coloring \u2694 Double Rubber Clutch Fastening \u2694 Each character will have their own individual backing card with personal saying Although I've done my best to show true representation of the colors chosen, there may be slight differences in appearance depending on what monitor/screen you are using to view, and slight differences in how the colors translate from digital drawing to physical pin manufacture. You'll be able to select your pin choice via a survey that will be sent out if the project is fully backed within the time limit and if for any reason you'd like to change your selection before shipping feel free to message me!\u00a0 I came up with the initial idea while out to brunch with my boyfriend. We were having mimosas and discussing the Game of Thrones episodes we had just watched the night before. If you follow me on Instagram, you're aware of how popular my current ferret pins are. Well, because of that, we started discussing what Game of Thrones ferrets may look like. I started with Daenarys and one of the first things I decided was to give her mini ferret-dragons. I ended up doodling this design on a napkin and several weeks later I finalized 6 Game of Thrones Ferret designs!! Everything is ferreted over. The dragons are ferrets. Ghost is a ferret. The sword hilts are ferrets. Ferrets...everywhere... Here are some of my pins from BOTH my Battitude shop and also my Eriu Studios shop to give you an idea of what the final product may end up looking like. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2694 Late May- Kickstarter Launches\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Late June - Kickstarter Ends \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Late June/Early July- Surveys sent out\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Mid July - Kickstarter funds become available\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Mid July - Production order placed\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2694Late July - Pins arrive and we will begin packaging and shipping all orders out \u00a0\u00a0\u2694 Late July-Early August- Pins will be delivered to you!\u00a0 For international backers: International parcels are shipped using a Global Advantage Program. This postage method is untracked in order to keep costs low for international backers.\u00a0 Also, please be aware that International backers are responsible for any customs fees their country may ask for, so plan accordingly! \n\u00a0 Pledging towards the campaign is completely risk-free! Payment will not be taken from you until after the campaign is finished and only if it is successful. Pledging via kickstarter helps me raise funds for the manufacture of the pins, including cost of the pin itself as well as backing cards, packaging, shipping materials and kickstarter fees (10%!) \u00a0The reason I produce a little more that necessary in quantities acts as a safety net in case certain designs are more popular than others, and so the pins can also be made available after the kickstarter has ended to the general public! Thinking about changing your pledge? You can click the 'Manage Your Pledge' button on the campaign page, or by clicking your current reward tier and then 'Change Your Pledge'! Here you can change your reward tier to a different reward tier, or you can add on an amount to your tier! Because the pictures shown on the Kickstarter are mock-ups, colors may vary slightly and, If necessary, there may be slight changes in the design to prevent manufacturing problems, but the overall aesthetic and design will stay the same. During and after the Kickstarter, it is my goal to keep things running as smoothly as possible and to keep you regularly updated both here and on my social media. \u2694 If you have any additional questions, feel free to email me at anashi.sterling@gmail.com \u2694",
  "Hello! My name is Brandon Horvath and I am a freelance graphic designer. As an independent designer and fan of enamel pins I have designed a variety of work featuring my own original concepts, some of which have been shared here on Kickstarter! I am excited to once again share a unique collection of enamel pins that with your help, we will together be able to take from concept to reality!\u00a0 Allow me to introduce to you the \u201cFestival of Deities: Enamel Pin Collection\u201d.\u00a0 The world is full of legendary tales and mythical facts, stories of colossal deities and celestial beings are told to inspire as well as celebrate these respective guardians over humanity. This enamel pin collection is based off of one such tale of the Cardinal Animal Deities of ancient mythos, themed around a festival of which they are the guests of honor.\u00a0 The celestial beings known as Byakko the Tiger, Suzaku the Phoenix, Seiry\u016b the Azure Dragon, Genbu the Tortoise, and K\u014dry\u016b the Golden Dragon are the cardinal deities of whom this Kickstarter is about, a design for each cardinal deity has been created in the form of a festival kabuki mask, much like you would see worn by attendees and displayed in booths during said festivals celebrated in Japan, except these are no ordinary masks displayed for all to see. These masks have been created in the likeness of the cardinal deities so that those attending this cardinal festival can show their support for their own chosen guardian.\u00a0 If the Kickstarter reaches it's main goal the mask of the tiger Byakko will be unlocked! Each cardinal deity after Byakko has their own stretch goal and will be selectable as a backer reward upon reaching their respective goal's! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 1: Byakko Mask Enamel Pin (Fully Funded!)\u00a0\u00a0 Byakko the Tiger and Guardian of the West is the first design that has been unlocked through the funding of the base Kickstarter goal!\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 2: Suzaku Mask Enamel Pin (Unlocked at $200)\u00a0 Suzaku the Phoenix and Guardian of the South is the second design that will be unlocked upon reaching the first stretch goal. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 3: \u00a0Seiry\u016b Mask Enamel Pin (Unlocked at $300)\u00a0 Seiry\u016b the Azure Dragon and Guardian of the East is the third design that will be unlocked upon reaching the third stretch goal.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 4 Genbu Mask Enamel Pin (Unlocked at $400)\u00a0 \u00a0Genbu the Tortoise and Guardian of the North is the fourth design that will be unlocked upon reaching the fourth stretch goal.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goal 5: \u00a0K\u014dry\u016b Mask Enamel Pin (Unlocked at $500)\u00a0 K\u014dry\u016b the Golden Dragon and Guardian of the Center is the fifth design that will be unlocked upon reaching the fifth stretch goal.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Backer Card Design As for the production of the enamel pin's themselves I have already spoken with my manufacturer in order to get the steps towards production ready, things like, costs, shipping, final art decisions, are all things I have been in contact with them about.\u00a0 Once the Kickstarter is finished I will be able to place the order through them and let them do what they do best in creating the enamel pins of this Kickstarter. As this is not my first enamel pin collection I am confident I will be able to reach the goals set forth through this Kickstarter! My goal is to be as efficient as possible through the entirety of the Kickstarter and especially through the production process. Any updates that are shared will be about the final produced enamel pins, sending out backer surveys, and shipping them out to you! With the wonders of social media every little bit helps in getting the word out there about this Kickstarter! Even if you can't back the project sharing it with others is a great way to help this project succeed! Updates will be posted here on Kickstarter as well as on twitter!\u00a0",

  "Local Chicago rock band Kerosene Stars and filmmaker Eden Ames are teaming up to present Indie Tangle, a brand new arts fest seeking to support and expose emerging and independent artists from all across Chicago. The festival will feature the first public release of the official \"Talk Talk\" music video which is also being funded by this project. Saturday | July 23, 2016 | 7:30PM-11:30PM Fulton Street Collective | 1821 W Hubbard St. | Chicago, IL 60622 First and foremost, this is going to be a blast. There will be music, galleries, screenings, drinks, good company... all that jazz. But the cause is important too: we artists go through hell and back to make our visions come to life. And we don't do it for the money. In fact, it often costs a lot more than we make to create our masterpieces. What makes it worth it? You. Your support, recognition and appreciation helps us keep doing what we're doing. It started with a music video-- one that we put time, money and tireless effort into. And now, we\u00a0think it deserves an audience. But finding one is not as easy as you might think. \u00a0\u00a0 When Scott Schaafsma of the Kerosene Stars got in contact with Eden Ames, writer/director/co-producer of the \"Talk Talk\" music video, an ambitious vision was born. A strongly aesthetic storyline featuring a Jekyll/Hyde femme fatale preying on a suspicious detective snowballed into the live action/animated hybrid it is now-- but it didn't stop there. After all, making the video is only half the work. The rest is getting it seen.     This is where we recognized an opportunity to not only fund an expensive vision, but also to gain an audience for it. This is where the idea of an independent arts showcase began. We're not the only ones who deserve some exposure, though. There are so many artists, musicians and filmmakers out there who are putting their heart and soul into their work. These are talented people, people with passion and determination. But sometimes, even that isn't enough to earn recognition or even a paycheck in the highly competitive world of art.",
  "The Charlie Awards Film Festival was founded by Teacher, Wayne McNanny in 1972 and is possibly the oldest student film festival in Canada. The Charlie Awards is a film competition for high school students in the KW region that helps students to discover their creative potential, build their confidence, develop leadership skills, and work collaboratively in teams. Students film everywhere and anywhere, developing a variety of story lines and plots to create dynamic, innovative productions. At the school site the student's films are assessed by a panel of judges. Two films from each school are submitted, previewed by judges and premiered to the public. This year, the films will be presented on April 28, 2016, 7:00 p.m. at the Princess Theatre in Waterloo. The Charlies are judged by media professionals who donate their time to work with the best of the K-W region's young film makers. They help our students improve their filmmaking abilities; they provide editing and production advice and consult on solutions to problems. This year is the 45th Anniversary of The Charlies Awards Film Festival. This year we would like to make this opportunity more rewarding for our students. We would like to offer financial support for placing in the Charlie's. Financial Awards for young directors will help them further develop their projects, have access to more sophisticated equipment and contribute to their future goals in post secondary studies. \u00a0We would like to thank all our judges and volunteers in advance for all their dedication and expertise in coordinating and hosting The Charlies.

  "So hey there, fellow Internaughts.. As I said in my crammed 135 character description.. I'm an Amateur Astronomer from the UK, I have been imaging the stars & planets for 2 years now. I would absolutely love to be able to move up to the next level, which includes such equipment like CCD Astronomic Cameras, Solar Filters, H-Band Filters, an EQ3 Telescope Mount (A mount that tracks the sky, making long exposure images possible) and other general Photographic tools. As of yet it's impossible for me to fund this myself, so I turn to the internet to help me in my time of need. I hope this idea captures the publics interest, I will be sending my images out to pledgers who helped me on my mission. People who pledge larger amounts can instruct me on what to image.. and those who pledge even more will not only receive the images I take & process, but will receive framed photographs, to hang around your home, images you can choose, with frames you can choose.. Basically whatever I can do to make this worth your while, I really hope to hear from some of you guys soon.Thank you so much for reading.. ",
  "I love looking at the night sky. I am already doing this but I find myself very limited with the camera and telescope that I have. If everything goes well, I will get great equipment and provide pictures of the night sky. That would include nebula, planets, galaxies and of course all the UFO's. By UFO's I do and don't mean extraterrestrials but also any unidentified objects. I have 3 objects so far. I am studying so that I can make great un-bunking references so that my pictures are truthfully UFO's. All helpers will by added to my UFO Qu\u00e9bec facebook group page. J'aime regarder le ciel nocturne. Je fais d\u00e9j\u00e0 cela, mais je me trouve tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e avec l'appareil photo et le t\u00e9lescope que j'ai. Si tout va bien, je vais avoir un bon \u00e9quipement et fournir des images du ciel de nuit. Cela comprend n\u00e9buleuse, plan\u00e8tes, galaxies et bien s\u00fbr tous les OVNIS. En OVNI que je veux et ne veux pas dire, c'est des extraterrestres, mais aussi des objets non identifi\u00e9s. J'ai 3 objets jusqu'ici. J'\u00e9tudie donc pour que je puisse faire de grandes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de sorte que mes photos sont sinc\u00e8rement OVNI.\u00a0 Toutes les aides seront ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 ma page groupe facebook UFO Qu\u00e9bec.",

Join us for three days of movies, music, games, art, authors, vendors, and so much more! We're going big this year (much like ol' Wilbur Whateley himself) and attempting all new, original programming in addition to some of the finest Lovecraftian films the world has to offer.\u00a0 But crafting such a unique experience takes some effort, so please excuse the mess and mind the gaps as we set this event up.

  "The Windsor International Film Festival (WIFF) is a cultural, not-for-profit organization whose mission is to recognize and celebrate the art of cinema by showcasing Canadian and international films and filmmakers. Through its exhibition, education, and community development programs, WIFF builds audiences for Canadian content and talent, provides training opportunities for emerging filmmakers, and promotes the creative economy of Windsor and Southwestern Ontario. WIFF is 100% volunteer organized and run. Whether it's Jen and Dorthy in the box office, Min and Alan making sure our films screen on time, Mori programming films, or Martha keeping our books in order, we couldn't bring the festival to you each year without their tireless efforts.\u00a0 The Windsor International Film Festival was founded in 2005 to raise an awareness and appreciation of the art of the moving image by bringing films to Windsor which otherwise would not be seen. Since that time, the festival has grown and expanded from 16 films, 21 screenings, and 2,705 tickets sold in 2005 to 111 films, 182 screenings, and approximately 15,000 tickets sold in 2014. Festivals and Events Ontario has consistently named WIFF one of the top 100 festivals in Ontario.  \n As a cultural, not-for-profit organization, WIFF celebrates Canadian and international films and filmmakers through its exhibition, education, and community development programs. Its unique mandate to provide training opportunities for the local film scene sets it apart from other film festivals. Programs like 48-hour FlickFest, WIFF \u2018Local\u2019, and the Short Film Program convey the grit, passion, and determination of making films, but they also provide invaluable experience for emerging local filmmakers. We want to make your experience at the festival better. We want to bring in more guests, invest in better equipment, and make your experience more comfortable. We need more money to do this. All of the revenues we make go right back into funding the next festival. By backing our Kickstarter we will have the funds to improve your experience of the festival.

  "Here it is. Our website is up! www.cinemaontheedge.com Check out the full schedule, list of venues, list of films, and statement from the directors!\u00a0 Almost there. Here we go!\u00a0 -------- After just one week, you got us to our goal! Wow. Thank you! We are bowled over by your support for the films & filmmakers, your belief in this cause, and your faith in us. We cannot thank you enough.  Since the Kickstarter launch, respected programmers from LA, SF, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, and more, have reached out and asked, can we bring Cinema on the Edge to their cities? So, we're adding new rewards AND a new stretch goal of an additional $5000 (see update #3 for details). Can you help us make this happen? We did it already - let's keep working together to bring independent Chinese films & filmmakers to NYC & beyond! (All of the money that we raise will be spent exclusively to support the Cinema on the Edge screening series in New York City and soon-to-be-announced major cities around the US and Canada.) What Is Cinema on the Edge?\u00a0 We are celebrating the vibrancy, resilience, creativity and courage of the Beijing Independent Film Festival (BIFF) by organizing the first ever \"Cinema on the Edge\" film series.\u00a0 The 2014 edition of BIFF was not allowed to happen. Organizers were detained, screenings rooms were barricaded, filmmakers and festival-goers were harassed and intimidated. With the full cooperation of BIFF, we plan to bring a version of their festival to New York City this August and September. The films shown at BIFF consistently blow our minds - they inspire and challenge us. They've shaped us to be better filmmakers, critics, producers, distributors, curators, educators, even better human beings. Our hope is to introduce audiences to the films we love by showing them at some of NYC's best museums and cinemas.\u00a0 Films in the series include: Who are We?\u00a0 We are producer/distributor Karin Chien, critic/curator Shelly Kraicer, and filmmaker/anthropologist J.P. Sniadecki. We met and became friends in Beijing, while studying, programming, distributing, writing about, co-producing, or co-directing Chinese independent film. We connected over our love of cinema. And we might not be friends without BIFF. J.P. and Karin connected while sharing a long cab ride to the artist village of Songzhuang where BIFF is held. Shelly and Karin bonded over meals while evading harassment by authorities trying to shut down screenings at BIFF. Here is J.P. talking about how BIFF affected him:\u00a0 \u201cMy first time there, I felt\u00a0I had found my tribe: filmmakers, cinephiles, artists, scholars, and students gathering\u00a0together to dive into a week of screenings, discussions, dinners, parties, music performances\u00a0and, inevitably, various encounters with the authorities. Yet BIFF remains a grassroots affair:\u00a0everyone pitches in and interactions flow easily. Our series is trying to keep that ethos alive.\u201d Here is a picture of J.P. doing a Q&A at BIFF 2012, which screened several of his films in a special program. Here's Karin, Shelly, and Shelly's partner Lisa meeting with Xu Tong, director of Cut Out The Eyes. We're in Trainspotting Cafe, a pioneering venue for independent film in Beijing. Their screenings were shut down too. Combined, we have over 50 years of experience making and screening films. BIFF has played a significant role in shaping our professional destinies, and some of our work would not be possible without BIFF. For example, thanks in part to BIFF, Karin co-founded the only distribution company in North America dedicated to releasing independent cinema from mainland China. Also thanks in part to BIFF, Shelly has been a trailblazer bringing Chinese cinema to several Western film festivals, including Rotterdam, Dubai and Vancouver, and has been able to write extensively about Chinese independent cinema. And J.P started a screening series at Harvard to showcase Chinese independent cinema, as well as write his dissertation on Chinese documentary and direct several films in China, including People's Park and Yumen, both showing in this series. This festival has changed our lives, its films have inspired us, and its community has embraced us. This series is a small way for us to support them in turn. Why We Are Doing It Independent films are not allowed to be screened publicly in China. These films are made without approval of the censors and cannot be seen in regular movie theaters. Independent film festivals offer a singular space in China for unauthorized filmmakers to meet with their audiences, and to sustain a concrete, vibrant, alternative Chinese filmmaking community.\u00a0 China's break-neck pace of change has created a class of independent filmmakers who are inventing radical new film languages. It is one of the most exciting places for independent cinema in the world. It's not the same as being there, but here are a few photos to give you a sense of BIFF. Imagine the incredible camaraderie, tight sense of community, excitement around new work, nervous tension about authorities showing up unannounced and you'll have a sense of what it was like to attend BIFF.\u00a0 Since 2012, independent film festivals have been under siege. All have been confronted with government opposition and interference.\u00a0 All but one or two have ceased to exist. All this may be hard to imagine in North America, where you can find film festivals every day of the year showcasing thousands of independent films. Since 2004, the Beijing Independent Film Festival (BIFF) has been the most important venue for unauthorized films in China. Set in the artist village of Songzhuang, BIFF was a rare space where freedom of expression flourished. But in 2014, BIFF was forced to cancel its festival following aggressive police action and physical intimidation. The films in BIFF 2014 were never shown. But they must be seen. With the full cooperation of BIFF, we are organizing a version of the festival in North America. We call the series: Cinema on the Edge: the Best of the Beijing Independent Film Festival 2012-2015. How We Are Doing it After BIFF was shut down in August 2014, our friend/colleague Kevin Lee, while discussing the situation with Karin, mused out loud, \"I wish we could recreate the festival here somehow.\" A year later, we're making that happen. We called our friends and colleagues, those interested in showing risky and groundbreaking cinema. We asked if they wanted to premiere films that couldn't be screened in China. The bold programmers of Anthology Film Archives, Asia Society, Maysles Cinema, Museum of Chinese in America, and UnionDocs said YES. We've scheduled 18 programs of enthralling, provocative, and brilliant films at 5 of NYC's best museums and cinemas. We can't wait for you to see them. But wait. We still need your help! What YOU CAN DO This is a 100% volunteer effort. We need money to bring Chinese filmmakers to the screenings in NYC, and to publish a one-of-a-kind program booklet for the series. Without dialogue and discussing, the screenings are not complete.\u00a0 Your participation will go directly to these 2 much needed items:\u00a0 1. Travel for filmmakers and festival organizers to NYC. This is 80% of our budget. Flights, hotel, and ground transportation to NYC are not cheap! If you've attended a film festival in the past, you know that Q&As and filmmaker talks are what make the screenings special. If funded, we'll be able to fly directors in to attend their screenings. Creating dialogue between filmmakers and audience is a critical part of the festival experience, and one that these filmmakers are often denied in China. 2. Publishing a program booklet to accompany the screenings. We cannot bring every filmmaker to the U.S. A few aren't allowed to travel either. This booklet enables us to include their voices in Cinema on the Edge. We have original quotes from the filmmakers and original essays from scholars. The booklet will also include memorable images from the excitement, both\u00a0onscreen and off, of the past few years of BIFF. If you can contribute, keep in mind, not one penny of the funding will go towards paying us!   If you cannot contribute, you can help by getting the word out. The more times you share this link, the more folks will know about the courageous efforts of BIFF to create, and sustain, a truly independent cinema in China.\u00a0 Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, ie nearly all Western social media, are banned in China. BIFF's website was shut down years ago. Help promote BIFF and Cinema on the Edge on your social networks with these hashtag: #WeWantBIFF and #CinemaontheEdge Independent filmmakers in China are denied an audience. Let's bring an audience to these filmmakers, and celebrate the brilliancy and vibrancy of their work.",

  "I hope you have just watched my Introduction Video to the Creative Minds Program in Cannes, France. This video took a lot of hard work (I hate being in front of the camera) and helped get me admitted into the (highly selective) program which I hope to attend. Here's the whole story: On Wednesday, February 18th, 2015 I went to an info session about the Creative Minds Program based solely off a last minute email and a gut feeling. I figured my ambitious peers would be fighting for this opportunity \u00a0(as is usually the case), but instead I was the only person in the room, which could've been awkward, but it wasn't. I mainly attended the session to find out if there was an opportunity for Financial Aid, as I knew the program would be nearly impossible for me without it. The recruiter was wonderful and let me know that there was aid available. He introduced me to the Program in depth and answered all my questions. There was just over a week left to apply, so it was crunch time, but\u00a0I left the info session feeling like it was fate. I finished my application in time and waited nervously to hear back. When I was admitted, there was no sigh of relief, but an anticipation that was almost worse than not knowing if I got in: can I afford it? I knew that without aid, the answer to that question was no. I finally received a small amount of aid, which I am incredibly grateful for, but it is still an unreachable goal for me and my family alone. And that's where I need your help. My remaining fee for the program is $2,999. The fee covers everything (food, lodging, equipment, festival access) except for Airfare, which is another $1,500 (or more) for a round trip flight. The total cost of the program and transportation - $4,500 - is an amount that I am only familiar with because it is how much my family and I pay for an entire semester at USC, and we couldn't even do that without generous Financial Aid from both the University and the Federal Government.\u00a0 There have been several opportunities that I have not been able to pursue at all due to finances, and others (like college) that I have only been able to pursue with the help of others. This would usually fall into the former category, but I believe with the help of those around me, it will not. Whether you can spare $5 or more, every donation counts and I am beyond grateful for whatever you can offer to help me reach my goal of $4,000.\u00a0 For an idea of the product, please take a look at my visual sample. It is especially relevant to this project because I made it at the Emerging Filmmaker Program - a small town version of The Creative Minds Program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSntUd5eLN0",

A lot of\u00a0women want to \u00a0do these\u00a0kind of photos but fear of family, social or \u00a0workplace \u00a0reaction are\u00a0the reason most of them don't do it.

  "It's unusual for something to affect us all but lockdown did just that. However, we experienced it in different ways. \u00a0I wanted to record my experience photographically whilst making use of what I had. I had numerous Polaroid images that I had taken in the months beforehand- images that represented scenes from my everyday life. I chose to record my experience by placing these Polaroid images in cleaning solutions and removing a few of them each time a restriction was lifted. At this time, cleaning solutions held great significance as we aimed to protect ourselves by sanitising our hands and any goods that came into the house.\u00a0 Once removed, I discovered the images had changed, just as my life had- sometimes in unexpected and beautiful ways. I continued the project through the subsequent lockdowns. I am raising funds to produce a book of these images, which span all three UK lockdowns. Funding will allow me to have the book designed and printed.",

  "Hi, I\u2019m Dan, and I'd love your support in completing Tinker Kitchen, a new maker space for food hackers in San Francisco. It's a great time to be a chef. As an engineer who loves cooking, I\u2019m fascinated by all the new kitchen gadgets and cooking techniques that have become popular over the last few years. Sous vide machines, molecular gastronomy powders, liquid nitrogen ice cream, coffee roasters, fresh pasta extruders. Each time I walk into Sur La Table and Williams-Sonoma, or browse ChefSteps and Kenji Lopez-Alt\u2019s food blog, I find fresh ideas, cuisines, and recipes just waiting to be cooked up. I enjoy cooking in the comfort of my own kitchen. But sometimes I dream of having a fully stocked kitchen, with access to professional cooking equipment that's much larger and more expensive than the tools I own. It\u2019s fun to experiment on my own, but it's way more fun to geek out over recipes, gadgets, and stories with other people who share my love of cooking. So I was inspired to create Tinker Kitchen - a maker space for food hackers to learn and experiment with cooking. Think of Tinker Kitchen as the place where you go to create awesome food, discover new cooking techniques and tools, and train your intuition to come up with original food ideas. I also want it to be a space where you can hang out and share cooking experiences with like-minded food hackers. Tinker Kitchen will build communities of people who love connecting over food. While there are many places where you can learn to cook, they're primarily scheduled classes at fixed times. With Tinker Kitchen, we\u2019re taking a different approach, based on membership. As a member of Tinker Kitchen, you can come anytime you want and hang out, practice your techniques, develop your own projects, and connect with others. We\u2019re about following your curiosity and sharing that experience with others. I'm thrilled to announce that construction of Tinker Kitchen is nearly complete. It's a 1700 sq ft space in San Francisco's Mission District. All that's left to do is finish a few building inspections and put in some finishing touches like ordering more furniture, equipment, and supplies. Tinker Kitchen is open and spacious, giving food lovers the space they need to experiment together. The kitchen is very spacious and our huge skylight gives the space lots of natural lighting. We're also restoring boarded-up windows in the front of the space. Tinker Kitchen is designed to be as flexible as possible. The front of the space will have small tables and chairs, so big groups can put them together for a communal meal, while small groups can still sit separately. We'll have all the greatest equipment, from our ovens to specialty laboratory equipment, to the dishwasher. We'll have it all. More on that below. The kitchen work tables are large butcher-block tables, so you can craft dishes directly on them. They're on casters so they're easy to rearrange for different uses like a class/demo, or a group working independently. Multiple groups can work at the same time without bothering each other. I'm a little obsessed with kitchen equipment. I want Tinker Kitchen to be a \"kitchen playground\" where home cooks can have access to the commercial machines which restaurants and specialty food makers use. Our cook line will feature multiple ovens, including a German-made \"combi oven\" with built-in humidity/steam control, commercial deep-fryer, and even a real wok range. Tinker Kitchen will have a commercial pasta extruder, at least three ways of making ice cream (batch freezer, Pacojet, and even liquid nitrogen). We'll have chocolate-making tools\u2014for tempering and making bonbons, as well as for making it bean-to-bar. And coffee\u2014from a drum roaster to a dual-boiler espresso machine. Then there's the lab equipment for modernist cooking\u2014two centrifuges (a refrigerated one and a spinzall), dehydrator, freeze drier, chamber vacuum, and a selection of the powders and chemicals you need to make foams, gels, spherify, and more. As a thank-you to our backers and members, you can help us decide what we will get next. Should we get tools to make custom chocolate molds? Or a pizza oven? Maybe a rotary evaporator to distill flavor extracts? The options are endless... you can help us pick. Tinker Kitchen membership features: Membership pricing: Daily Passes Daily passes are perfect for trying out Tinker Kitchen, or for bringing in additional guests. Pass pricing: We'll also have several courses at Tinker Kitchen, so you can come learn to cook something new. At launch, we'll have classes on: We have many more classes planned: bean-to-bar chocolate making, custom protein bar development, butchering 101, bread making, various ethnic cuisines, and more. Maybe you'd like to teach a class? Contact us! :-) Pricing: variable depending on the class, with discounts for groups and members. The Tinker Kitchen community calendar will have all sorts of activities and events for cooking connoisseurs. Join a club to cook and make new friends. Watch live cooking demos from visiting chefs. Hear guest speakers, attend pop-ups, compete in cooking competitions, and more. Small events (up to ~15 people) can happen anytime the space is open. We'll occasionally also allow the whole space to be booked for celebrations and team-building off-sites. We've already made a significant investment in Tinker Kitchen. We've financed everything from architects and building contractors, to paying rent and buying some of the equipment. Kickstarter funds will go towards: The campaign will cover all of those, plus Kickstarter rewards, and other Kickstarter costs. I\u2019m Dan Mills, Founder of Tinker Kitchen. I love everything about food\u2014cooking, the science behind it, the kitchen equipment\u2014all of it. From my childhood in Venezuela through my career in the tech industry I\u2019ve slowly expanded my arsenal of tastes, techniques and equipment, always tinkering with something new. In 2015 I started Tinker Kitchen to build an awesome maker space for food where I can share this passion with others. The seed for this concept dates back to my college days, where I had the good fortune to take a very special biology course. Maker spaces weren\u2019t really a thing back then, but that\u2019s exactly what this was: a sculptor and a bio prof had a lab in the basement to explain real-world structures and processes by building physical models. We studied biological organisms, did research, and built models to explain them. I discovered that this learning style is not only great fun, but immensely effective: I can still remember the things I learned back then, even though it\u2019s been almost two decades. I approach cooking the same way. I am not only interested in the end product, but in learning the underlying principles. Earlier last year, I had the honor of spending a month working at Chez Panisse in Berkeley. Every day, I woke up at 4.30AM, drove north for an hour, and showed up with my knives at 6.30AM. It was an eye-opening experience. On any given day, I would do everything from peeling buckets of onions, to prepping whole farm boxes of strange new vegetables (cardoons!), to butchering whole legs of lamb. Despite the high pressure environment, I was impressed by how Chez Panisse has formed a learning community that values training each other to achieve excellence. But my deepest learning was not any specific recipe or cooking technique, but a work ethic. To be a cook at the top of your game requires dedication. I could be taught all the tricks to supreming an orange, but an experienced cook would still do the same thing three times as fast with no mistakes, because they have done it over and over for thousands of hours. All this has led me to believe that in order for us to grow as cooks, it is not enough to only learn cooking techniques. We need to have a place where we can practice and a community that is excited to share our cooking journey. That place, I hope, will be Tinker Kitchen. ",
  "My name is Andrew Hoagland, but I go by the penname Law Matheson. You may remember DOSCO from earlier in the year. I spent the beginning months of 2015 studying Kickstarter and other crowd-funding platforms, what to expect, how to avoid pitfalls, and much more. I intended to continue studying and writing throughout the summer and launching KickStarter in October. By early March, however, I grew a little impatient and was willing to give it a try.\nI am glad that I did. Not because I was happy to watch my project only reach 60%, but because it taught me a lot. In a difficult way, however it was not a failure, but a learning experience. Besides, I like the hard way, and first try would have been just too easy.\u00a0 Taking from what I learned in the first half of this year, as well as my studies of my previous Campaign, I hope that you will all enjoy the new approach.\u00a0 \u00a0D.O.S.C.O. stands for Department Of Supernatural Cooperation and Organization. They are the secret branch of government that operates to keep human\u2019s from learning of Supernatural\u2019s, and to ensure that they are kept away/safe from human\u2019s, or as they are known in the book, Civi\u2019s. \nThey remain secretive and in the shadows, but operate as a Post Office as a cover to their below ground establishment.\u00a0\n \n\n The book follows a young man named Neil Matheson as he arrives in New City, Maine a (fictional) town inland from the Atlantic, but surrounded on three sides by lakes or rivers. New City is a fairly populated city as it has a community college and a prestigious 150 year old private school.\u00a0 Situated in the middle of town, off to the far right, a mile from the river that cut off its eastern shores, is a forest that is known as Branwood Forrest. If you were to Map the area from online, it would appear a pretty basic 1 square mile of woods. However, those with Supernatural genetics can travel up to 3000 miles! Civi\u2019s are simply deterred by strong magic, and are forced to turn away, believing to have had a great hike.\nThis forest acts as a Beacon for any Supe\u2019 (Supernatural) that is on its own, cast out, runaway, or simply doesn\u2019t belong anywhere else.\u00a0 That\u2019s how I was able to write out werewolves (thank god right? We don\u2019t need anymore vampire/werewolf love stories). Vampires also don\u2019t make any appearances as they have been hunted to near extinction by Civi\u2019s, and Ghosts are a myth.\u00a0 \u00a0Neil enters NC not knowing any of this, he is as ignorant to it all, as to the fact that he is about to set into motion a series of events that may never stop. What he does know is how to survive on the streets while traveling alone. \nOnce the catalyst is sparked Neil enters into a new and bizarre world, one he may never be able to leave. He meets amazing and diverse friends; he is Initiated into DOSCO and they help him to finish his High School Diploma; he finally starts to settle down, make some money and establish himself. Everything seems to go perfectly, but perfect stories don\u2019t make for good tales, and Neil is far from perfect. \nThis is only the tip of the ice berg though, you\u2019ll have to dive in to uncover more.\u00a0 This book is not intended for children 18 or younger. There are many adult themes, drug references, language, and some violence better not read by young minds. \nThat being said, for those young adults and up that love anything \u2018Supernatural,\u2019 \u2018Secret Agent\u2019, \u2018Mystery,\u2019 or \u2018Thrillers,\u2019 this book is definitely for you. Plot twists and manipulated character development is something I thrive on. Many stories are unfortunately lacking this, but consumers want it so badly!\u00a0 It has been my goal since I started this series, DOSCO, three years ago to go all the way to publication. I didn\u2019t know at the creation of it all that I would later go on and try to self-publish. Having the background I do, the fact that I am doing it the hard way is not surprising. It is much more than that though, I can\u2019t stand the idea of selling my rights over to some publishing company that doesn\u2019t understand the Universe I\u2019ve molded or the characters and problems therein. I often feel like I am not creating these characters, but rather that I am discovering them. Therefore I would never want to see someone change my characters just to make it \u201cmore marketable.\u201d\n The series is meant for young adults and up, and it deals with a lot of controversial issues, but ones that are important to the story and the characters development. By changing the scenarios to make them less \u2018risqu\u00e9\u2019 and more \u2018palpable\u2019 you lose the true essence of how the characters became the way they are and under plays the situations they get into.\nThat being said, I saw no other option than to try to market and sell it myself. Not that I haven\u2019t had some awesome and encouraging folks to help me along the way, which simply wouldn\u2019t be true.  \nEvery time I travel, meet someone new, or learn something about history, I want to include it within my book. Induction was first finished August 2013. Then in October 2014 I chopped it down 90 pages and rewrote 90 pages. All of 2015 I have been further editing and tweaking small things. I have found that the hardest part for me is the editing! I am not on here to make loads of money, that is not my intention. My goal is to have a finished book that I can then give or sell cheaply to friends and people that have influenced or touched my series in anyway. Since I was a child I have always loved imagining new and splendid worlds, and reaching others with it through writing. For that little 5 year old me, I want to try and live up to those dreams.\n\nI have always been hesitant about talking about my stories, as many are wicked wacky, but as I fleshed out my characters more, and talked to my friends more, I realized that I had no choice but to try and create a concise story of how they all came to be. I believe in this story, and I hope that you will too.\n Everything has been budgeted and estimated to the best I could. There are variables (shipping; How far away; How many rewards included?), but I have rounded up the prices so that way I have a margin for \u2018hidden fees\u2019 and insurance on larger orders.\u00a0 The Book: \tDecent Paper Back book, about $6.25 a book, minimum order of 100 = $800\u00a0 Bumper Stickers:\t100 for $100\u00a0 T-Shirts:\t6 sm, 8 md, 5 lg, 1 xl at $11 a piece = $250\u00a0 Editing:\tI have a woman in mind, however editing is expensive, for around $300 I can have her consultation.

  "Hello, my name is Samuel Konkol. I am a 16-year-old high school student and I am asking if you would support me in my mission to reach and inspire middle school students throughout central Florida. \n\nI am excited to announce that I just published my first book\u202610 Steps to a Brighter Future\u2014A Middle School Guide.\n\n There are over 56,000 public middle school students in Orlando and my hope is to be able to speak to every one of them. \n\n I believe I have an important message to share with middle school students \u00a0and since I am only a few years removed from middle school, students relate well to me and my message about the steps they need to take to realize their brighter future. \n\n My fall speaking tour is quickly filling up and through Kickstarter, I will hopefully have the funds needed to supply each middle school student with a free copy of my new book. \n\n Recently I spoke to 300 middle school students at Maitland Middle School and at the end of my presentation, every single student raised their hand to request an autographed copy of my book. \n\nIn the next 30 days I need to raise $12,000 through Kickstarter to fund the printing of my next 10,000 books. This will give me the leverage I need to continue inspiring middle school students throughout central florida. \n\n Over the next 5 months I will seek and find a donor or an organization that is passionate about the future of middle school students to underwrite the cost of the other 46,000 books I intend to print and distribute. \n\n I could really use your support because Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing funding site, meaning that your credit card will only be charged if I meet my funding goal of $12,000.\u00a0If the project falls short of the funding goal, then no one is charged. Thank you for being a part of my mission.\u00a0",
  "(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+) Over the festival's 12 year history, more than 20,000 people have attended and\nenjoyed the Latin-American feature films, documentaries and short films with us. We want your help to celebrate this year our tenth edition, to celebrate the best of Latin-American cinema here in London. Help us take over London for one week, from the 27th of November to the 4th of December, with our screenings at Tate Modern and Odeon Covent Garden showcasing\u00a0the cultural diversity, originality and\nwealth of cinematic talent that characterizes Latin America through recent film\nproductions. \u00a0We have had incredible guests attending our screenings and answering Q&As with our audience in the past, like Diego Luna, Lucrecia Martel and Carlos Reygadas among others. This year we will have 5-6 special guests attending our Gala Nights and Q&As with the audience. We are a team of 20 volunteers (and growing) focused on delivering the best Latin-American film festival in London. We do it just out of passion for Latin American cinema, and because we believe in sharing the beauty and potential that Latin American culture offers to the world. With your help we will secure the funding for our venues this November. We already have the majority of the feature films and documentaries secured, as well as the logistics for our guests. We have created great rewards for your help, from UK premiere tickets for some of our screenings to dinners with the Directors/Actresses/Actors that will come to London during the festival, as well as our own Latin-American themed party in mid-October. DLAFF is organised by Discovering Latin America,\u00a0a UK\nnon-governmental organization (CIC register No. 1106705) formed in August\n2002, composed of 350 volunteers from 25 different countries, with formal\noperations in Brazil, Mexico, Spain and the UK.\u00a0Our mission is to\nshare the unique diversity, beauty and potential that Latin American culture\noffers to the world, whilst contributing to the less privileged sectors of the\npopulation (www.discoveringlatinamerica.org) We want to give special thanks to the volunteers that created the video animation and the music, as well as the voice over for our video.\u00a0 Thanks to Carlos Felipe Galvis for directing the video, and to Kosiaco for the animation. Thanks a lot to the group of musicians that created and played the music for the video.

  "I'm starting this kickstarter campaign because I want to see The Watercolor Oracle out in the world bringing hope to people. \u00a0For the past 3 years, I've been inspired to paint abstract watercolors...for me it was an exercise in letting go and taking chances. I also began to collect messages of intuitive guidance from meditations and journaling. When I had the idea to join them together into an oracle card deck I was SO excited! Although the wisdom in these cards was originally meant for me, it's also universal, and I trust it can help whoever wants to receive it. I really had no idea how to bring this idea to fruition. Once I had finished the paintings, and gathered enough wisdom to put on each of the 44 cards, I was kinda stumped on the process of making the deck real. Sure, I could laminate each of my original paintings, or scan them and print them. But as I looked at the oracle card decks I had purchased on my bookshelf, I wanted my deck to be just as available to others, and just as professionally made. And I'm not exactly there yet. It took a ton of searching on the internet to get where I am now with production. I did find 2 affordable companies that could print prototypes in a few different sizes, and one that could print a guidebook the size I wanted. From there, I made my decision which one could work for what I needed. This included the 3.5x5 cards along with the same size saddle-stitched guidebook. I solved the problem of packaging with a blue velvet pouch, but would love to create a sturdy box in the future. Since I've spent lots of time, and some money on figuring this all out, I really just need help in running a larger print of The Watercolor Oracle! The printer is currently having major delays in turning out product, so a larger run of cards will allow me to have them on hand to mail out right away. People won't have to wait the current lengthy time which is at least 6 weeks. I'd like to place an order for 250 decks, guidebooks, velvet packages, and bubble mailers. Thank you so much for reading about the evolution of the Watercolor Oracle! Customer feedback: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I just opened my Oracle card set - the watercolor designs are exquisite! I pulled a card and it was on target.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just got my oracle cards today! My daughter did a reading and 7 cards jumped out of the deck. Every single card was something we talked about this morning. Incredible!\"",
  "Hi, my name is Ruby Mountford and I am 16 years old. I have decided to set up a magazine because I want people to be more creative. Too many people lose touch with their creative side as they grow up but it doesn't have to be the case and I think that 1999 can help start this change. 1999 will inspire others to get in touch with their creative side again. It is also a great way to showcase people's work and build their confidence. I have also noticed a lack of options when it comes to choosing a magazine which includes creative topics such as art and photography.\u00a0 As I am under the age of eighteen, my Dad is helping me to set up my Kickstarter page and I am using his account. 1999 is a magazine that aims to celebrate and encourage creativity. I have teamed up with a variety of talented contributors. Each piece of work is unique and I hope that the differences in their work will show people that there are many ways to express your creative side. There will be 100 pages full of inspiring work, which include art, photography, recipes, articles and much more. It will be available as a printed copy and a digital copy and it will be a bi-annual magazine. Your money will be used to cover the cost of printing the magazine, postage and packaging. You will also help to inspire others to be more creative. Email us at - 1999magazine@gmail.com\u00a0 Tweet us at - @1999mag",
  "This is the second year of our film festival about improving the urban experience. We're calling it \"The New Urbanism Film Festival: City Stories on the Silver Screen\"\n\n\u00a0 Visualize a walkable neighborhood: a place close to work, school, cafes, theater, recreation,  etc., a place safe for kids, with good public parks, libraries and transportation.  \n\n\u00a0 We've curated a collection of movies about people just like you working to create better urban neighborhoods.  Whether they're about urban designers creating master plans, or private citizens building small scale projects, their stories are inspiring.\u00a0 For our festival's second year, we need your help to improve and expand the New Urbanism Film Festival to deliver the message of human scaled neighborhoods to even more people.\n\nWe had a great response to last year's event, inspiring many to return to their neighborhoods and try some of the ideas they could only see at NUFF. \u00a0Your help through kickstarter will allow us to expand our advertising budget. \u00a0We want to buy ads in local papers, reach out to community and student groups, and hire a public relations manager. Our second goal for this year is to make the event more interactive and bring more attention to the idea of human scaled urban design. To do this, we need to attract more speakers to present workshops, discussions, and activities that will further inspire our attendees, and take the virtual world of film and make it concrete. So, a portion of this kickstarter fund will be used for hospitality and stipends for our guest speakers.\u00a0 Our third goal for this kickstarter is to reward filmmakers. Last year, filmmakers were invited to a special dinner, and winners won plaques and prizes.  This year, we want to reward and encourage these forward-thinking filmmakers by offering cash prizes that will allow them to make even more ambitious projects in the future.\u00a0\n To recap, our three expansion goals for our second year are\u00a0 \u00a01. Bring in more experts in the field to host workshops\u00a0 \u00a02. Broaden our audience\u00a0 \u00a03. Reward filmmakers\u00a0 Stretch Goal 1: \u00a0If we can reach $13,000, we'll be able to add a full day to the festival.  We've already received more submissions than we did in our entire first year, and most are feature length. In order to take advantage of this bounty, we need another day that would allow us to show more features.\u00a0 Stretch Goal 2: If we reach $16,000, not only will we add another day to the annual festival, we'll host programming throughout the year.  This would help grow our audience base as well as spread the message of human scale urban design. \u00a0 The 2nd Annual New Urbanism Film Festival will take place Nov 6-9 in MidCity, Los Angeles CA 90036. Submissions are currently being accepted online! \u00a0We are dividing short films into five categories for screening purposes: Architecture, Bicycling, Healthy Cities, Tactical Urbanism, and Urban Design. However, short and feature films will be considered for all applicable award categories. For more info on what kinds of videos we're looking for and how to submit, visit our website! In addition to the short and feature films that we receive as contest submissions, we will screen major motion picture feature films with a theme of urban issues. \u00a0Which ones we screen, will depend on reaching or exceeding our funding goals. Last year we screened The Garden, GDOG, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The Garden was a nice complement to our short films because we did not receive a lot of submissions addressing the relationship between food and the city. \u00a0Which we believe is a critical issue. So we were excited to screen The Garden and have the director Scott Kennedy join us to discuss the intricacies of food, the city, and politics. Similarly, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, was a fun choice because it deals with LA History in a fun way. And again, we were able to invite an appropriate guest speaker. \u00a0Diego Cardoso, of the LA Planning Comission came to the festival and presented the true history (and future!) of rail in Los Angeles.\u00a0 We will select feature films for this year's festival in the same manner: Do they complement other workshops and presentations on the schedule? Do they address an issue not covered in the short films? How will we locate and attract speakers and presenters? \u00a0In June we are travelling to Buffalo NY for the 22nd Annual Congress for the New Urbanism. \u00a0We will be screening the best of last year's films. We are also involved in local advocacy groups here in Los Angeles. Between our national CNU connections and our local advocacy efforts, we are confident we can provide a roster of guests that will prove very inspiring.\u00a0 Check out our website for a complete list of all 16 speakers and presenters we hosted at the first annual New Urbanism Film Festival. If you are still asking, what is \"New Urbanism\" here is a brief video that explains the key concepts of the movement.\u00a0 \u00a0After watching that video, we hope you are inspired to make your city a better place. \u00a0How can you do that? There are plenty of people already doing it and they are excited to show you how. \u00a0See their stories (and make them your story) by joining us at the 2nd Annual New Urbanism Film Festival!",

More than a film festival, Rooftop brings a vibrant, memorable experience to rooftops and scenic spots all over the city.  Some say that our screenings are the best thing about summer in New York.  Just ask Rooftop fan Yujin M: \n\u201cNew York has plenty of fantastic events, but Rooftop Films is by far my favorite.  Spend an evening under the stars on a graffitied rooftop of a chartered school on the lower east side with an opening performance by a local band, an awesome selection of independent films, and free beer at the after-party at a bar nearby.  The very fact that they're offering all this in NYC for $13 makes you want to donate to the organization.\u201d\n Thanks Yujin! In addition to the kind words, Yujin makes a great point: Have you ever been to a Rooftop Films event and wondered, \u201cHow can they afford to create such unique and amazing events and still charge so little for admission?\u201d\n Well, the truth is we can\u2019t \u2014 not without your additional support. \n Ticket sales from our screenings account for less than 15% of our overall budget. Even if we sold our tickets for $100 we would still not be able to cover the cost of programming, planning and producing these events in 12 different locations across the city. One of the most vital sources of support is YOU. Without memberships and donations from our biggest fans, Rooftop can\u2019t survive, which is why we are asking for your help this winter. \n If you believe that Rooftop Films is important to you, your neighborhood, your city, and the independent film community, please make a donation or become a member today. Check out all the great rewards you can earn by making a donation, and help Rooftop Films in these cold winter months so that you can join us next summer for dozens of amazing events.\n More Than Just A Film Festival \n As a small non-profit organization, Rooftop accomplishes a great deal with a small, passionate staff. Every penny we earn goes back into the Rooftop community and towards providing a quality experience for our audience and members.  We want to help you discover new up-and-coming bands and unforgettable locations, show you films you might never have heard about otherwise, and give you the chance to mingle with your fellow audience members and filmmakers after the films. We believe everyone should have equal access to the arts and it is our mission to keep these shows and these experiences accessible to all. That is why each year we add more free shows and keep our admission prices as low as possible for our ticketed events. \n And Rooftop Films does more than simply exhibit films. By supporting Rooftop you also help independent filmmakers finish their new films.  One dollar from every ticket we sell goes into the Rooftop Filmmakers Fund, and we raise tens of thousands of additional dollars in cash and services to help our alumni filmmakers to produce their latest films. Over the years, Rooftop has helped more than 100 filmmakers complete their films, including Benh Zeitlin (Beasts of the Southern Wild), David Lowery (Ain\u2019t Them Bodies Saints), Lucy Walker (The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom), Shaka King (Newlyweeds), Sean Durkin (Martha Marcy May Marlene) and Gillian Robespierre (Obvious Child, coming very soon!). \n Support Rooftop Films this winter and you help to guarantee that we will be able to continue bringing daring new films to big screens all around New York City. The more you give, the more you get. Rewards! Rooftop Films is all about getting big things done with the resources available at hand, so we know the value of a dollar.

We are never content to simply show movies outdoors \u2014 we turn our screenings into unforgettably unique evenings. Last summer we didn\u2019t just screen a documentary about a brass band -- we hosted a whole brass band festival (Brasslands). It was not enough for us to simply show a moving portrait of modern strongman (Bending Steel) -- we presented that film on the beach at Coney Island preceded by an exhilarating live exhibition featuring horseshoe bending and crowbar twisting.\u00a0 Access to the Best Independent Films and Filmmakers in the World\u00a0 In 2013 Rooftop Members got to hang out with the filmmakers and actors at the premieres and sneak previews of such films as Noah Baumbach\u2019s Frances Ha (starring Greta Gerwig), Sebastian Silva\u2019s Crystal Fairy (starring Michael Cera and Gaby Hoffman), and David Lowery\u2019s Ain\u2019t Them Bodies Saints (starring Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara).\u00a0 First Access to Surprising Sites All Over the City\u00a0 Rooftop shows consistently sell out but Rooftop members get in free and have priority entry. Plus you\u2019ll receive VIP tickets to panels, and after parties too.  You and your friends also receive invitations to off season screenings and exclusive programs curated for members only, and all of this will take place in unconventional spaces and special locations that you might never have discovered without Rooftop Films.\u00a0 If you love Rooftop Films, and want to be part of the Rooftop community, take advantage of these offers. Together we will keep building something bigger, keep our program fresh and accessible year after year and in 2014, we\u2019ll be able to go further and do more, BUT we can only do it with your help.\u00a0",
  "This project arose as the need to reinvent myself through what I am passionate about: art and nature; and as a personal pursuit to understand both the environment and the conditions we live in as humanity. As an Art student and a yoga practitioner eager to learn and improve, I am convinced that colors and shapes have vibrational frequencies that impact our emotions and contribute to create a pleasant atmosphere in our home, something especially important nowadays while in lockdown. This first study is based on butterflies, which are associated with personal transformation due to the metamorphosis they go through; they are a symbol of rebirth, of the psyche, of freedom, and peace. I have chosen 7 different models that according to their colors they represent each of the body\u00b4s 7 chakras. The drawings can be regarded as scientific illustration because they will retain the unique and incomparable characteristics of each species. As a reward and as a way of thanking you for believing in my project you can choose between one, three, five or seven drawings. Este proyecto surgi\u00f3 como un inter\u00e9s personal de reencontrarme a trav\u00e9s de lo que me apasiona que es el arte y la naturaleza, as\u00ed mismo de una b\u00fasqueda del significado del entorno y de las circunstancias que mundialmente vivimos como humanidad. Como estudiosa del arte y practicante de yoga en constante b\u00fasqueda por aprender y mejorar, estoy convencida que los colores y las formas poseen frecuencias vibratorias que impactan a nuestras emociones y contribuyen a crear en nuestro hogar una atm\u00f3sfera agradable, tan importante sobre todo en tiempos de confinamiento. El primer estudio se basa en las mariposas, relacionadas con la transformaci\u00f3n personal a ra\u00edz de la metamorfosis por la que atraviesan en su vida, y ser consideradas un s\u00edmbolo del renacer y de la psique, de la libertad y de la paz. He elegido 7 modelos que, seg\u00fan sus colores representan a los chakras del cuerpo. As\u00ed mismo, es importante mencionar que los dibujos conservar\u00e1n las caracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas e incomparables de cada especie a modo de ilustraci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica. Como recompensa y a modo de agradecimiento por creer en mi proyecto, podr\u00e1s elegir entre uno, tres, cinco y /o siete modelos.

  "I am Phalguni Bhatt. I am an Early Childhood Educator, and I love creating educating and enriching material. I've recently created an art book, a paint by number in Sanskrit. Without financial support, I find it hard to pay for artists and other labor even if we consider minimum wages. I need to hire many services that need to be paid upfront. When there is a bit of financial support, it's motivating and helps create a good quality book.\u00a0 This project consists of creating Paint by Number and Connect the Dots art book in four languages; English, Hindi, Gujarati and Sanskrit. This book is intended for age group of 7 and above with images starting from simple to complex. Theme of the book will be spring.\u00a0 With the current Era of online learning, a physical thematic\u00a0coloring book can take a bit of time away from the screen and help bring mental peace with calming pictures and colors. Additionally, it can enhance multi-lingual development.",
  "Gravity. Interstellar. The Rosetta Comet Mission.\u00a0Right now there's a lot of buzz around realistic space exploration, but it's sorely missing from one place - the young adult section of your local bookstore. Let's fill that hole in the shelf.\u00a0My first novel began with that goal in mind -\u00a0\u00a0to refocus our collective attention on the amazing possibility of space travel. That vision continues with The Rathmore Chaos.\u00a0 READ A SAMPLE HERE. Tully Harper lost a good friend on his first trip into space -- a friend that he desperately wants to find. To do that, he must journey to a very real moon in our solar system. His friend's fate, and maybe humanity's, rests on his ability to locate the Rathmore Chaos. Once there, Tully explores an alien world, battles to bring home his friend, and discovers the origins of his powers, which don't always obey his commands.\u00a0He also learns the unexpected story of the Ascendant, a myth-infused tale that I will write in the years to come.\u00a0I researched everything from planetary sciences to orbital transfers to movement in low gravity to bring real science to bear upon the fiction. Also, the story is funny when it needs to be. Tully carries with him a pocket-sized Android who spouts definitions and advertisement at terribly inappropriate times. His name is Little Bacon, and bacon makes everything better. Here's a link to\u00a0The Conspiracy Game, my first novel. Read the reviews. What you'll see is the result of my first Kickstarter, which inspired me to pursue this trilogy. Unlike the first Kickstarter, this one includes a copy of the book! (see award levels for details).\u00a0 In the coming weeks, look for an update on the cover art and a launch party. All Kickstarters get an invite! Until then, get in your pledge to reserve a copy, and thanks for your support. A FEW CHARACTERS WORTH MENTIONING: The list is long and diverse. A sampling.\u00a0 Tully Harper - protagonist - an only child from a single parent home; life-threateningly curious; received unpredictable powers when he touched a strange object in space.\u00a0 Sunjay Chakravorty - Tully's best friend - son of a Space Alliance research engineer; martial arts afficianado, human question cannon, fierce friend, and megafanboy for the pop star Queen Envy. Tabitha Tirelli - Tully's friend/crush - lives down the street from Tully; instrumental in helping Tully avoid death in space; perceptive friend; doodler and straight A student; not a manic pixie dream girl. Gallant Trackman - Archspy of the Ascendant - power-hungry traitor who sold out Tully and the world to the Ascendant; lost his hand trying to stop Tully in the first book and not happy about it. \u00a0 Mike Harper, Tully's father - stoic Space Alliance commander; discovered the Harper Device on Mars; explorer, parent, widower, fighter.\u00a0 The Harper Device - also known as the Sacred - a source of power, inspiration, hope, mystery - I cannot define a thing that is many things all at once.\u00a0",

  "Celebrate your pride by wearing it on your sleeve (or coat, or blazer, or dress, or tie, or backpack, or...)! I've always thought that butterflies are the perfect symbol for the LGBTQ+ community: once we find and embrace our true selves, we grow wings and find freedom. We are beautiful, resilient, and able to fly high! (Plus: we're everywhere!) When coming up with this project, my aim was pretty simple: I wanted to make a set of pride pins that I would be proud to wear myself. I have experience working in wildlife conservation science, and my love for nature and passion for greater inclusivity in STEM careers influenced my design choice for this series. Additionally, I wanted to create a pin line that reflected the LGBTQ+ community's diversity, beauty, and perseverance! I've put a lot of thought, energy, time, and loving care into designing these pins - I wanted to make sure they were just right. I hope you love them as much as I do! If my project reaches its goal of $1250, five pride pins will be unlocked (rainbow/gay/LGBTQ+, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and nonbinary). With every additional $200 raised, one extra pin from the stretch goal selection will be unlocked! If my project reaches its initial funding goal, I will send out reward surveys to all backers allowing you to choose your pins from the unlocked designs. If my project does not reach $1250, \u00a0you will not be charged and I will not receive funds for this project. This Kickstarter's initial funding goal of $1250 is to produce the first five enamel pins, as well as cover backing cards, Kickstarter fees, taxes, and shipping costs/supplies.\u00a0 This is a non-exhaustive selection of pride flags. I recognize with respect the incredible diversity in the LGBTQ+ that extends far beyond what is shown in the flags represented here. Please note that the selection I made is NOT indicative of favouritism or perceived value, but rather of a) budget restrictions; b) design similarity (the same number of stripes, for example, makes pins cheaper and easier to manufacture); and c) demand according to requests from existing customers.\u00a0 If this project is backed successfully, I would love to do a second wave of pins including more flags! If you have suggestions or special requests, I'd love to hear them! A special note regarding the LESBIAN flag: I have chosen to include an alternate design of this flag in my campaign, due to controversy associated with the Pink Lesbian Flag that does not align with my values. The lesbian flag selected here made its debut on Tumblr and is seen by many as more inclusive to EVERYONE that identifies as lesbian. All pins that are funded by this campaign will be hard enamel pins with gold-coloured metal outlines. All pins in the series will be made according to the specs below: Pin Specs: Please Note: The final product may vary from the mockups shown, and colours may be slightly different from those pictured. Once the Kickstarter has ended, all unlocked designs will go to production. Reward surveys will be sent out so you can choose your pin designs. Production takes an estimated 4-6 weeks, though it could take longer if there is a backlog.\u00a0 I'm crossing my fingers that pins will be on their way to new homes in time for Pride Month, but I cannot promise that this deadline will be met as production time is out of my control. I promise I'll do my very best to get the pins out to you as soon as possible!\u00a0 Estimated timeline:\u00a0 *I'll update this as funding goals are met! Hello! My name is Alena, and I am the one-queer-woman show behind Owl & Bear Studio. I am an artist and a wildlife conservation scientist passionate about widening the space for diversity and inclusivity in STEM. I'm super excited about this Kickstarter, because it combines so many of my loves! I hope you love it as much as I do - let's unlock these beauties!!! How do I pledge? Just click the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button on the campaign page or scroll down the page to select a reward tier! Do I get to choose my pins? \u00a0YES! If this project is successfully funded, I will send you a survey asking which pin(s) you would like. The \"first five\" pins, as well as any \"stretch goal\" pins that were successfully unlocked will be available for you to choose from.\u00a0 When are backers charged? If the project you\u2019re backing is successfully funded, your card will be charged when the project reaches its funding deadline. If the project does not reach its funding goal, your card is never charged.\u00a0 Other Questions? Try Kickstarter's Support page!\u00a0 Interested in seeing more of my work and following along?

  "This is my second Kickstarter campaign! YAY!\u00a0 I\u2019m hoping to make a series of pins based on my love of TEA! I didn\u2019t want to exclude coffee drinkers either so also created a coffee pin I hope we can unlock.\u00a0 Each pin will be made using a hard enamel to give it a smooth and polished finish, the pins will be approx 30mm in height and all will be made with a polished silver enamel finish. This means that any grey areas you see in the example photos will be polished silver giving them a reflective look. (Below are the mock designs) The campaign will be running for 30 days and there are 3 main designs to unlock, with the 4th pin being a bonus unlock. The first pin to unlock is the Brew Crew Pin at \u00a3250! \u00a0Each Brew Crew Pin comes with a membership card welcoming you into the Brew Crew club. \u00a0 (Please be aware that the Brew Crew is a fictional club, I am far too awkward \u00a0socialise in an actual real life club setting.) Hah! (Below is a mock up of how the pin will look in its backing card.) The 2nd Pin to unlock will be the Skull Coffee Pin at \u00a3500! It\u2018s a black and silver enamel pin to celebrate the dark soul of coffee drinkers. It comes on a skull covered backing card. (Below is a mock up of how the pin will look in its backing card.) The 3rd pin to unlock is the pastel green Soya pin at \u00a3700.\u00a0 (Below is a mock up of how the pin will look in its backing card.) The 4th pin is a BONUS unlock pin which will unlock at \u00a3850! The Kettle Pin would look good with any of these pins, maybe on opposite collars? On it\u2019s own the pastel pink cuteness would stand out on any denim jacket. (Below is a mock up of how the pin will look in its backing card.) Once the campaign has ended, if the project was successful I will then have to wait for all the funds to clear from Kickstarter which can take a week or 2. \u00a0During this time you will receive a survey from me to see which pin(s) you would like from the unlocked designs. Once the funds have come from Kickstarter I can get the proofs sent off to the manufacturer and await their arrival back to me once they\u2019re complete. The while Kickstarter process from start to finish takes around 8-10 weeks. Depending on how fast funds clear etc. I\u2019d estimate postage to be in mid-late June. There are several tiers for pledges each of which has its own rewards, Some will include sticker packs and prints which will be unique items to this Kickstarter. Below is a photo of the Vinyl Coffee Pin stickers that come free with some of the pledges. Other sticker designs will be made once they unlock in the campaign. NO MONEY WILL BE TAKEN UNTIL THE CAMPAIGN ENDS and ONLY if it reaches its total. So don\u2019t worry, no money is taken straight away. Each pin will be securely pinned to its own backing card and wrapped in tissue paper. \u00a0Then it will be placed inside a cardboard mailer with any pledge goodies ready to post. \u00a0All of my packaging will be fully recyclable. \u00a0So please reuse or recycle any unwanted packaging. PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK \u00a0ADDRESS WHEN PLEDGING, by the time the campaign ends and the pins arrive it\u2019s around 8 weeks or so in total, so please have an up to date address when pledging. If you are moving in those 8 weeks please put an alternative address where you could receive the pins. All UK orders will be sent via 2nd class postage with Royal Mail, proof of postage will also be obtained. All international orders will be sent using standard international delivery, sometimes orders can be held up by your countries customs so please bare in mind that there may be some delays that are out of my control. \u00a0Proof of postage will also be obtained.",

  "a brand new film festival for venezuela.\u00a0 The current state of emergency in Venezuela will not stop venezuelan artists contributing to the culture with film.\u00a0A new festival is born 100% Independent. As a rebellion against censorship, the Caracas Film Festival will begin online, with the objective to hold the best venezuelan films under one streaming service, the first one to share revenue for the filmmakers.\u00a0 The best Venezuelan new films, documentaries, shorts, tv shows, hidden gems, the golden era of film in Venezuela and contemporary titles, forgotten classics and musicals will all compete for cash prizes and the PANALE\u00d3N Award! (sculpted statue commissioned to a venezuelan artist).

Help us raise the money to to buy the rights of these venezuelan films and build a beautiful \u00a0place for each piece to stand among its peers in a world gallery of national treasures.\u00a0 The festival plans to hold a physical event in the year 2020 in the city of Caracas, with the launch of social programs in schools we want to encourage and help young people produce films locally and integrate the community to participate in the events that promote unity. Submissions will be open for new titles to be recognized and awarded. Submit early and have a chance to stand next to the classics that made up our film history. As the country awakens to a new day, the Caracas Film Festival opens a new window.

The Caracas Film Festival will celebrate the art of storytelling by announcing official selections and winners in October at a ceremony in New York City, to launch the platform PANALE\u00d3N and promote it among film festival goers, we will participate in all major film festivals in the world as industry representatives. The jury is 50% voting members and 50% personalities related to the venezuelan film industry and streamed live in October, 2019.",
  "Last year I borrowed a Nikon D7100 Digital camera from my good friend and fellow photographer Ryuijie. After over 50 years of photographing with film in multiple formats I quickly learned what an incredible tool the new cameras are. No need to change film for different situations, the higher sensitivity allowing the use of available light (which has always been my preference), being able to make very large photographs without needing medium or large format cameras and film. But most of all, to see the final image quality the new 10 ink printers can now produce...it's like my early days in a darkroom all over again. It's no wonder so many of the top fine art photographers today made the move years ago to this medium. \u00a0In addition, the art community has accepted the new pigment photographs as seen in auction results in recent years. A few years back a Jock Sturges pigment print sold for $40,000.00 at auction. It's well documented that these newer archival pigment photographs have been tested to last 150-200 years, if not longer. \u00a0\u00a0 My main purpose of this Kickstarter project is to get my new photographs in your hands so you can see the beauty of this (new to me!) process. After the cost of printing the \"rewards\", I will use any additional funds to upgrade my system to a digital camera and to start scanning some sellect negatives from the last 50+ years to make new archival pigment photographs from them. \u00a0",
  "I love art + I love love-notes. This project combines both. Each of these watercolors was inspired by a natural space that is sacred + alive for me: a park near my house, the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, and a plot of land my family has tended for generations. These felt the perfect pieces to bring to life with greeting cards. I imagine them being used as blank canvases for love letters, notes of gratitude, congratulatory salutations, words of encouragement, creative doodles, and/or incantations of magic and blessing. Here's the art: Each card features one of these paintings + is blank on the inside. Cards measure 4.25\u201d x 5.5\u201d and are printed on sturdy 17 pt., 100% recycled textured paper.\u00a0 Envelopes are included.",
  "Synopsis\n\n A large meteor is headed straight for Earth and 13-year old Sean couldn\u2019t be more excited.  With his father Kevin, a lead scientist on the NASA team being sent to study the impact site, Sean is going to get to travel to central Russia and learn firsthand all the secrets that the rock from outer space may hold.  It\u2019s the chance of a lifetime.\u00a0 Soon after Sean and his father arrive in Moscow, the meteorite (nicknamed Elijah by the Russians) finally reaches the Earth\u2019s surface, but instead of exploding upon impact as was predicted, the huge space rock lands quietly \u2013 and largely intact.  Sean, Kevin and the team of scientists are even more surprised when they learn that, moments before the meteorite landed, six Russian Air Force men in the area of the crash site dropped dead instantly, with no identifiable cause of death.\u00a0 Sean is soon left alone and, as he struggles to escape the dying city, he discovers that somehow the meteorite\u2019s arrival has given him strange, almost magical, abilities. He must use these newfound powers to survive against roaming gangs and find out what happened to his world.\u00a0 Want to read a sample? Check out the first two chapters.\u00a0 About the project\u00a0 Elijah\u2019s Chariot is a dramatic and adventurous novel appropriate for middle school ages and up (my adult readers especially have loved it). In writing it, I really wanted to explore what it would be like for a young boy to be all on his own in a completely foreign environment and have to figure out how to survive. Although the book is very much about the adventure, I\u2019ve also included scientific elements throughout \u2013 on meteors and some ideas of how mental abilities like telekinesis could actually work. Also, I\u2019ve relied on my personal experience of living in St. Petersburg and Moscow to flesh out the world in which Sean finds himself stranded. So, there are some possible educational elements as well as all the fun.\u00a0 The funding is for copyediting, cover art design, rewards costs and Kickstarter and Amazon fees. I already have a shortlist of some very talented copyediting and design folks and am very excited to get started \u2013 with your help!",

  "The Blurb:\u00a0With the Light, came Magic, and the Witch. As mysterious as she was fearsome, and as powerful as she was merciless, the Witch almost succeeded in ending the world until she was vanquished by a hero and his comrades. This is the legend of the Witch and the Guardian. Centuries after the nigh calamity, this legend is as much as almost anyone knows of what truly happened back then and as much of an explanation anyone has of what ended an era in human civilization. The Guild of Recorders was formed to preserve the pieces of the past and the present from being forgotten. A young, curious new recruit decides she wants to direct her own investigation of the old legend in hopes of discovering who the Witch really was and the details of the events that led to the nigh calamity. Though the young recruit may never learn the whole story, you as the reader will follow the days that led up to how a young girl named Lily became immortalized as the Witch though her name, dream and life became forgotten.

  "In the history of birthdays, Nia's 15th was the worst. Homework-loving, plan-a-holic Nia hates change, but change is what she got. In the worst way. As if the new kid at school isn't enough for her to deal with, she gets unwanted powers-which she can't control, learns that she's actually an alien and that a giant vampire-lizard has it out for her specifically. Turns out, if\u00a0these crazy kids are right, the fate of her native world rests on their shoulders, hers included. When the Ruby Sage Stone goes missing, her new friends (and her parents) freak out. One by one, people start disappearing and soon the fate of the world is on her shoulders alone. Only: she's not sure she'll buy into this. I'm going to give it to you straight... I crave good books and good stories. My mind is bursting with new and exciting ideas. Every time I turn my head, a new story is born -but I'm getting off topic. I want good books, exciting books, for me and my kids to read. I like heart-pumping action, knee-buckling romance, and gut-busting comedy, but I despise obscene content. It throws off my groove. The more I search for good books with the quality of writing that I look for, the more I am disappointed.\u00a0 So, I wrote a book. It's a dang good book too! (My Mother said so.) But, don't take my word for it, you can read the prologue here.\u00a0 This is one project, a project that has been carefully planned and cautiously implemented. With help from my experienced friends\u00a0\u00a0and from you, we can get this book into your hands (and theirs). In the form of a paper back, a hard back, or an e-book. So... I'm a go-big-or-go-home type of girl. I have had professionals read the manuscript, but I haven't presented it to an agency or any publishing house because I have reviewed the pros and cons of going through big publishing houses and have come to my own conclusion. My decision: I have actually started a company called Wonder & Lights LLC through which I want to publish good books from a variety of talented authors. In other words: I am starting my own publishing house. I'll\u00a0eventually take over the world. (But that's for another day). Right now I am raising funds to get this book off the ground.\u00a0 You may ask yourselves: \"Wow, $3,500 is a good chunk of money, where is it all going?\"-Although I would love for it to go toward a castle in Europe, I have broken down EXACTLY where the money went or is going to go (yes, some work is undone and some work has already gone unpaid-for now) and put it together for you in a nice little chart. \u00a0I would like to mention that I have an editing team who have agreed-insisted to go underpaid for this project. I personally think that the editors should have a majority of the pie.\u00a0",
  "We have a dream! To open up downtown Savannah's only donut shop, serving up gourmet donuts, craft coffee from PERC Coffee, and even ice cream from Leopold's! Not enough for ya?!? How about tons of your favorite 80s arcade games! Best your Galaga high score while enjoying an expertly crafted latte. Reach a new level in Pac-Man while stuffing your face with fluffy, glazed donuts. Squash some Q*Bert baddies while gnoshing on an ice cream cookie sandwich. It's okay to cry. Happy tears, of course. 8-Bit Donuts will be located on the campus of The Guild Hall, Savannah's premier gaming destination. The Guild Hall already boasts a host of successful businesses, including The Chromatic Dragon, our gamerpub, The Guild Hall Arena, our 18+ gamerspace, and Jolly Goblin Games, our traditional friendly local game store. With plenty of space to play Magic, D&D, or any other tabletop game your heart desires, 8-Bit will offer more than just arcade games.\u00a0 DONUTS, OF COURSE!! We plan to offer from-scratch gourmet donuts. And we're not talking about your average run-of-the-mill flavors, either.  Clegg is a donutisseur (he just made that word up) and ran a successful bakery for several years.  His ambitions are fierce! His imagination is vast!  His belly is wide! Biscoff donuts?  Scotcharoo Crullers?!  PB&J Stuffed Donuts?!  Cap'n Crunch Special?!  Dude.  There is no stopping this man! But if arcade games are what brought you here, LOOK NO FURTHER! We plan to offer all your favorite 80s arcade classics, from Centipede to BurgerTime to Zaxxon to Galaga to Robotron! (We could seriously keep going pretty much forever...how long have you got?) Even more: we hope to offer them for free with the purchase of food and drink at 8-Bit! You buy a donut, we hand you some tokens! Is that cool, or what?! Throw in craft coffee from our good friends and local coffee roasters, PERC Coffee, and you can see why this feels like a culinary dream-come-true.\u00a0 But wait, there's more!  What Savannah eatery would be complete without ice cream? Kill the heat on a hot Savannah day (which we all know is most of the year) with one of our treats that features delicious ice cream from Leopold's. \u00a0Chocolate, vanilla, and most of your favorite Leopold's flavors will be available, either as add-ons to make your donut experience even more magical, or as part of a special creation by our team of donutisans (Clegg made that one up, too). Not only that, but we'll also be featuring a CUSTOM FLAVOR designed especially for 8-Bit Donuts by Leopold's super secret team of flavor scientists.\u00a0 What makes us think we can do this? Our amazing community helped us crowd-source The Chromatic Dragon back in February 2015. \u00a0Ever since it opened two months later, our gamerpub has been more successful in its space than any other restaurant in the building before us. The Dragon offers customers console gaming and board gaming while they enjoy up-scale pub food, craft beer, and cocktails. Not to brag, but it's been called \"The Disney World of Savannah\" and \"Oh my god I can't believe this is a real thing am I dreaming?\" \u00a0We couldn't have done it without our Kickstarter backers, and we hope that together we can achieve similar results with you folks on 8-Bit Donuts.\u00a0 Check out this little video to see what kind of fun we've been up to at The Chromatic Dragon. We have less than 30 days to meet our goal to get 8-Bit open in January 2017! \u00a0Read on to learn more about what we can offer and how you can help! 8-Bit Donuts is a team effort brought to you by the amazing people at The Guild Hall. \u00a0You can learn more about us at http://theguildhall.com/team Our team is led by entrepreneurs whose experience is exceeded only by their girth! \u00a0(Actually, Chef Bret is the outlier here, but his beard is pretty fat!) Clegg Ivey - Co-owner / Guildmaster / Donutissuer\u00a0 Clegg is the man with the plan. Having founded more than a dozen companies since the late 90s- everything from tech to telecom to energy drinks to local retail- Clegg is dedicating the rest of his career to creating opportunities for people to have fun and play games. Also, Clegg loves pugs. He has, like, 14 pugs.\u00a0  Jacob Heider -\u00a0Co-owner / Technocrat / Lead Borg Was there ever a piece of technology that didn't interest the man? Not since the mid-80s, at least. A talented programmer, network engineer, troubleshooter of ALL THE THINGS, and the driving force behind the technologies that make the Guild Hall's campus run, Jacob often thinks much like the computers he so admires. \u00a0Bret Gnat - Head Chef / Culinary Rockstar Chef Bret is the genius behind the incredible menu at The Chromatic Dragon. \u00a0With 20+ years of experience working in and running award-winning kitchens in the casual and fine dining industries, Bret is the craftsman behind the amazing desserts at The Chromatic Dragon: The Cake is a Fry (funnel cake fries), Jigglypuffs (tempura-fried cinnamon rolls), and Lakitu's Cloud (deep-fried Twinkies). \u00a0Well, guess what?!?! \u00a0Bret will be bringing those amazing recipes and flavors, plus a whole lot more, to our menu at 8-Bit Donuts! \u00a0Maximus the Pug - VP, Eatsies\u00a0/ Good Boy Maximus has been a donut lover for as long as he can remember, which, in most cases, is about five minutes. \u00a0He likes actual donuts, as well as donut-shaped toys. \u00a0Maximus is not as fond of coffee, but knows a thing or two about Leopold's Ice Cream: namely, that it is delicious and he would like some, thank you very much.\u00a0 \u00a0 Funding this project gives us a real boost toward getting the equipment and renovations we need to open our donut shop by January 2017.  Our needs fall into 3 categories: renovations, equipment, and arcade cabinets.  ---Renovation--- We've had the space at 530 MLK Jr. Blvd in downtown Savannah for almost a year now, but as many downtown buildings do, this location needs an almost complete overhaul to bring it up to code. \u00a0Of course, we've already invested in making this space look like the donutisserie (another word made up by Clegg!) of our dreams. But we need your help to finish it! Without these funds, we won't be able to get this project done. Storefront Windows ($1k-$5k) Again, the cost for these will all depend on what kind of glass we can afford and whether we happen to know any local contractors willing to give us a break!  Hint, hint! Savannah's Historic Review Board is psyched for us to replace the plywood-and-plexiglass facade with a real glass storefront. \u00a0But massive panes of storm-proof storefront glass are not cheaply bought or installed. \u00a0 Flooring ($1k - $5k) Half of the space is covered in some very old black and white checker laminate. And the floors are not exactly what you would call ... level. So, the cost here depends on whether we have enough to float the floor (making it level) and what sort of materials we can afford to cover the floor. (Did a vampire take this picture?!?) It may not look like much now, but this is where our coffee and donut bar will live! \u00a0 Ceiling Repair ($500-$3k) We can patch just the hole caused by a leak from the plumbing in the ceiling (you can see it in the pic below), or we can redo the entire ceiling. The latter is preferable, of course, but costs 6 times more. Lighting ($500 - $2k) The space has ugly ceiling fluorescents and ceiling fans from the 1980s (which is sort of ironic, if you think about it) and we could replace those with more modern and inexpensive fixtures of the same size or (and especially if we can repair the entire ceiling) we can switch to recessed cans or something a bit less ... institutional. With your help, we will turn this space into equal parts \"tasty donut shop\", \"comfy coffee shop hangout\" and \"nostalgic 80s arcade\". But we can't do it alone!\u00a0 ---Equipment--- We've got a hood installed already and we have our old oven, some mixers and glazing tables from Clegg's bakery. \u00a0But we still need a variety of donut and coffee related equipment. Donut Fryer ($500-$5k) - We need a donut fryer, and the better this Kickstarter performs, the better the machine we can afford. Proofing Cabinet ($500-$1k) - We need a proofing cabinet, which enables us to set the temperature and humidity necessary to create super fluffy donuts. \u00a0Again, if we raise more money, we can get a better proofer. All the Coffee Equipment!!! ($2k-$15k) We can make it all happen with as little as $2k or as much as $15k, when you factor in the espresso machine, coffee grinder, brewers, and assorted thingamabobs. --Arcade Cabinets-- This one just comes down to what we have left after getting the space ready. \u00a0If we had unlimited funds, there is room for 12-15 arcade cabinets and cocktail tables. \u00a0Generally, each of these cabinets costs $1,400-$2,000 to acquire. Examples:\u00a0 Galaga / Ms. Pac-Man / Pac-Man (Cocktail) - $1,400 Donkey Kong / Defender / Joust - $2,000 We will need about $50,000 to finish this space. Crazy, right? We are set our goal at $10,000 for a few reasons: (1) That's what we know we need to get the ball rolling on renovation of the space; (2) We wanted to start with an attainable goal and build from there; and (3) We've got some amazing stretch goals planned that will allow us to get to $50,000, if people really get behind what we're trying to accomplish in order to make this space come to life!  \u00a0We've got some great rewards for our Kickstarter backers! \u00a0Take a look! \u00a0Pledge $5 or more Big Money. Big Prizes. I love it! You'll get a special thank you video from Clegg. Plus we'll put your initials on the High Score List on our website and in the shop. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pledge $10 or more You'll get everything from the Smash TV, plus a free donut once our shop opens!

You know what? Let's make it a baker's dozen!

Say thank you in the best possible way: with donuts! This backer level comes with everything from the Gauntlet, plus we will deliver a dozen donuts to the Savannah area police station, fire station, hospital, or EMT crew of your choice. \u00a0 \u00a0 Pledge $125 or more Dan from accounting is right! You are one of the few, the proud, the epically generous backers willing to go the extra mile down what used to be called W. Broad St. Once we send you a fake beard exactly like the one Kevin Klinkenberg used in our video, you, too, can show up at our staff meetings pretending to be \"Dan from Accounting.\" Of course, you'll also get everything included in the Gauntlet. Plus, the fake beard. Did we mention the fake beard?!? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pledge $150 or more Fight like a robot!

  "Here we are, two years on from the creation of the first Providero Tea and Coffee House. It\u2019s been a wonderful ride to this point! We come to you now to ask you to join with us again in a new adventure! But first, here\u2019s a recap\u2026.. With the help and support of our amazing Kickstarter Community, our dreaming and hard work culminated in the opening of the Providero Tea and Coffee House in Llandudno Junction in January 2014.\u00a0 In two years we have served thousands of cups of the finest tea and coffee on the North Wales coast, alongside our famous home-made cakes and locally-baked bread.  We have continued to develop a wonderful customer base of regulars, many of whom have become friends with us, and with each other.  We have served visitors from all over the world and welcomed some fascinating characters through our door - it\u2019s been a privilege to offer this hospitality in our little corner of beautiful North Wales. \n Our team of 2 (Jon and Ellie!) has grown, to include James, Emma, Jake and Bronte - these fantastic people have joined their skills with ours, to make Providero what it is today; a thriving, bustling coffee house with a growing reputation for excellence and a warm welcome. Don\u2019t just take our word for it -\u00a0we have gained a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence (read some customer reviews here) and we have the great honour of being included as the only North Wales cafe in the next edition of the Northern\u00a0Independent Coffee Guide.\u00a0 Most days, Providero is bustling from the moment our doors open at 8am, to when we close at 6pm. There is an increasing number of occasions when customers can\u2019t find a seat, and there is a queue out of the door!\u00a0 We find more and more that we are feeling the limits of our little shop. Large groups can\u2019t find space to eat and drink together, freelance workers who want to set up office for the day in our cafe don\u2019t have the space to do so. We have to turn away requests to hire out our upstairs space for meetings, as we need it for customer turnover. It\u2019s a wonderful problem to have, but we want to be able to do more to meet and exceed our customer\u2019s high expectations and needs. Many people have asked when we are going to open somewhere else - somewhere bigger? As the demands on our small space have increased, we\u2019ve realised it\u2019s time to take the plunge and open Providero number 2! This won't mean losing our Junction home, but branching out and having a second place to welcome you to. We have come across a fantastic shop in the restaurant/cafe quarter of Llandudno, which has captured our imaginations. It already has A3 planning permission for use as a cafe (which is a real bonus!) There is also a lot more space! The premises has an outdoor pavement seating area, accessible toilet and babychange facilities, and scope for a food prep room meaning we could at last offer tempting light lunch options, alongside our range of teas, coffees and cakes.\u00a0 Huge bowls of healthy salads would await you, along with a hearty homemade soups of the day and local breads. \u00a0The emphasis on our lunches would be simple, tasty, healthy food that you could enjoy in or take away with you.\u00a0 We would incorporate more brew methods for our coffees, giving you more choice and showcasing how versatile and delicious all our coffees can be. We'll have more retail products - stuff you can buy to make the perfect brew at home, or perfect gifts for loved ones!\u00a0 We\u2019d love to stock craft beers and wines and be open late on Fridays and Saturdays for you to hang out and start your weekend properly! We\u2019d open too for sleepy Sundays - Come and read the weekend paper, play board games with your family and friends or sip a coffee before taking a Sunday afternoon stroll on the Orme.  We\u2019d have a separate room available that could be booked out for private events or meetings. Ample plug sockets for laptop users, more space for groups and somewhere safe to lock your bikes. We\u2019ll have the room to host events and are already planning a few of our own. Rest assured though, our welcome, quality and ethos won\u2019t change. We were humbled and blown away by the generosity and support of our Kickstarter backers 2 years ago. To be honest it was an uncomfortable experience to be vulnerable and ask for you to give to that project. It\u2019s still uncomfortable!\u00a0 Although the cafe in Junction is profitable, there is not a lot left over after we have paid the bills, wages and suppliers. It is sustainable, but due to its size, it is limited in what it can achieve. We see it as a good thing to give people the opportunity to sow into Providero again at this important point of growth. To allow our supporters, customers and community to contribute to opening a new space from which they will benefit and enjoy. To allow people to influence and shape who and what they find on their local high-street.\u00a0 We also acknowledge that crowdfunding was foundational in what we became. It meant that a thread of gratitude, generosity and a sense of always looking to \u201cpay it forward\u201d has run through all that we have done. It shared the influence and the power to create something bright and new amongst a whole bunch of folk, far and wide. It meant that you are all part of us, and we are part of you. This concept has been beautifully depicted in our \u201cWall of Thanks\u201d artwork by Jen Mickelborough, which is displayed in the cafe. \u00a0 We\u2019re hoping to raise at least \u00a330,000\u00a0through Kickstarter.  You may not have the means or desire to pledge financially. That is totally fine! There is no obligation to whatsoever. However, if this resonates with you at all; if you would like to see a second, bigger Providero Tea and Coffee house in Llandudno, and you have the means to do so, please pledge. We would love your support and your involvement.\u00a0 The shop presently is an empty shell, with no catering facilities, just some plastered stud walls and falling-down ceiling tiles. A fairly extensive building and shop fit-out is needed to transform it into a beautiful cafe space with all the coffee and catering equipment we would require. We get the keys (therefore start paying rent) in July, and so would be on a tight timeframe to get the shop open as soon as possible.\u00a0 The good news is, we know a lot more what we\u2019re doing this time around! We have a much more realistic idea of the cost of equipment, for example. Many of our customers are already bringing useful contacts and advice for the aspects of the project that are unfamiliar to us. We have strong design concepts and are confident we can keep things on-time and on-budget. We know the full renovation and kitting out of the shop will cost more than \u00a330k. It will be more in the region of \u00a3100k with all the building and engineering works, equipment, furniture and stock required. It would be AMAZING if the Kickstarter campaign smashed this target of \u00a330k so we could keep our borrowing down and keep more of the money in the local economy and delivering on our vision for this new venture! We would love you to be a part of this next chapter of the Providero story!\u00a0Even if you can\u2019t pledge financially, please spread the word, tweet about the project, post it on Facebook! As always, ask us your questions, come and talk to us, or drop us an email. We are super-excited to turn this project into reality and we\u2019re really looking forward to welcoming you once again to our new Providero Tea & Coffee House in Llandudno! \u00a0",

According to the ajq'ij Edgar Choguaj: \"they suppose the probability and the possibility of 260 different personalities, at the same time diverse intelligences and minds, complex and ordered among themselves, as it is the nature and the universe-pluriverso with its pluriforms\". the Oxlajuj number (13) is always present for example in the 13 months of 20 days of the Cholqi'j or Mayan lunar calendar, the 13 Baqtunes, the Mayan long count calendar that marks a solar age.\u00a0\u00a0There are also 13 main joints that give movement to our body.\nThe festival and its components:\u00a0 The FICMAYAB 'takes place from 2 to 16 October 2018 in Guatemala and will have as main headquarters Totonicap\u00e1n, Quetzaltenango, Santiago Atitl\u00e1n, Guatemala City, Antigua Guatemala, Cob\u00e1n and Chisec in Alta Verapaz and the Estor in Izabal.\u00a0 The main component of FICMAYAB 'is the Official Exhibition, where the 92 selected filmworks from different parts of the world will be exhibited. In addition, parallel and complementary activities will be held as: Special Sample: Program for the exhibition of audiovisual works in addition to the Official Show. X International Communication Meeting  of Indigenous / Native Peoples: Meeting of communicators and communicators involved with the media and Indigenous / Native Peoples, in which topics of interest will be discussed, experiences will be shared and articulated actions and strategies will be traced. Political Forum of Indigenous / Native Peoples: Space for discussion and proposals on aspects of interest for Indigenous Peoples; exchange with representatives of local movements, regional struggles and communicators. Festilab: Space for workshops and practical work for the exchange of ideas and knowledge, with the presence of filmmakers, producers and artists from different regions, cultures and experiences. Community visits: opportunity to approach and exchange with local communities with whom to learn successful examples of self-determined local development. Artistic activities: Dances, music, theater, photography and plastic arts, among others. CLACPI General Assembly: An Ordinary Assembly will be held to evaluate what has been done and draw up the work plan for the next period. The venue for the next Festival and the persons and organizations that will occupy the various positions and commissions in this organization will be chosen. What will the funds be used for?\nIn order to cover lodging, food and transportation for 100 indigenous communicators and communicators from Guatemala during the 15 days of the festival. For production expenses: production of music events, medical insurance, consumables, equipment rentals, artists' fees, among many other things.\u00a0 The International Festival of Cinema and Communication of the Indigenous  Peoples is one of main activities for CLACPI, we are people of diverse organizations of several countries of Latin America, that as a network, since 1985, we made a great variety of activities of collaboration, exchange and mutual support in communication from an integral perspective, as well as in the training, production, diffusion of indigenous film and video. The activity that most characterizes CLACPI, and the one that has remained constant throughout its life has been the celebration of the International Film and Video Festival of Indigenous Peoples. This event, held on a rotating basis in the different venues of the organizations that make up CLACPI, consists of the concentration of people and audiovisual productions, which in turn entail enormous knowledge, experience and especially important messages from indigenous peoples regarding their situation , rights, proposals and struggles.\u00a0 CLACPI has 12 Festivals celebrated in different parts of the territory of Abya Yala. The Anaconda Prize should also be mentioned as an international and pioneering initiative since 2000, of an itinerant nature and of indigenous and Afro-descendant community protagonism. With your contribution you are supporting the growing movement of indigenous filmmakers from Latin America.",
  "[English below] 1. Cos\u2019\u00e8 il Fantafestival? Un po\u2019 di storia\u2026 Il Fantafestival \u00e8 il pi\u00f9 longevo festival italiano dedicato al cinema fantastico in tutte le sue declinazioni: fantascienza, horror, fantasy, paranormale, gotico e altri generi affini, con alle spalle ben 37 edizioni! Probabilmente molti gi\u00e0 lo conosceranno, ma \u00e8 giusto raccontare un po\u2019 della sua storia, per tutti coloro che non hanno ancora avuto modo di sperimentarlo in prima persona. Il Fantafestival nasce a Roma nel 1981, come diretta derivazione delle rassegne di cinema di fantascienza organizzate per il circuito Italnoleggio negli anni \u201974-\u201977 e delle grandi kermesse di cinema fantastico con le quali il Cineclub Tevere di Roma connot\u00f2 la propria programmazione a partire dal \u201975. Iniziato al cinema Clodio nell\u2019ottobre del 1981 e poi passato, negli anni, come sede principale prima al complesso Capranica-Capranichetta, poi al Barberini, al Quattro Fontane e al Savoy, il festival si \u00e8 sempre caratterizzato per il taglio popolare, indirizzato al grande pubblico degli appassionati. Le ali del pipistrello del Fantafestival hanno volano negli anni nei cieli di altre citt\u00e0 italiane, come Milano, Ravenna, Napoli, Verona e Genova. Grazie alle numerose collaborazioni internazionali inoltre nel 1986 il Fantafestival, insieme ai Festival di Bruxelles, di Sitges (Spagna) e di Oporto (Portogallo) \u00e8 tra i soci fondatori della European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation (www.melies.org). Sul palco e sugli schermi del Fantafestival sono passati i nomi pi\u00f9 illustri del cinema fantastico italiano e internazionale: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, George A. Romero, Roger Corman, David Cronenberg, Sam Raimi, Peter Cushing, Malcolm McDowell, Peter Jackson, Alejandro Jodorowsky, John Phillip Law, Rutger Hauer, Tobe Hooper, Lloyd Kaufman, Brian Yuzna, Robert Englund, John Carpenter, Ursula Andress, Barbara Steele, Dario Argento, Carlo Rambaldi, Dino De Laurentiis, Dante Ferretti, Sergio Stivaletti, Lamberto Bava e molti altri ancora. 2. Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival? La raccolta fondi per l\u2019edizione 2018 Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival? Questa \u00e8 la domanda che ci siamo fatti e che vi facciamo quando abbiamo toccato con mano l\u2019impossibilit\u00e0 di organizzare la 38esima edizione del nostro festival. La causa \u00e8 dovuta alla riduzione, fino all\u2019annullamento, dei finanziamenti pubblici, grazie ai quali finora siamo riusciti a proporre con continuit\u00e0 e in crescita la manifestazione. Un calo al quale ci siamo rifiutati di cedere, rispondendo con investimenti personali e la forza della nostra passione, grazie all\u2019affetto che da sempre il pubblico ha dimostrato nei confronti della kermesse. Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival? Ma soprattutto, che mondo \u00e8 \u201ccon\u201d Il Fantafestival? La realt\u00e0 dei festival cinematografici \u00e8 profondamente cambiata nell\u2019arco dei 37 anni di vita del Fantafestival. Da diversi anni il festival ha focalizzato gran parte della sua attenzione alle produzioni di giovani autori italiani e internazionali. Registi e produttori indipendenti di corti e lungometraggi a cui il Fantafestival ha dato spazio nell\u2019ottica di promuovere idee nuove, giovani talenti, per riuscire a metterli in contatto con il destinatario ultimo delle loro opere: il pubblico. E sono stati diversi i casi in cui un giovane filmmaker esordiente, anche grazie alla visibilit\u00e0 ottenuta con il Fantafestival, abbia poi proseguito la sua carriera fino ad arrivare alla distribuzione nazionale in sala. Ci\u00f2 che unisce il Fantafestival, i filmmaker e gli spettatori \u00e8 proprio la passione verso il cinema fantastico. Una passione che di certo non pu\u00f2 scomparire per una mancanza di budget. Abbiamo pensato che un mondo senza Fantafestival non debba esistere e abbiamo deciso di chiedervi aiuto, proprio come molti filmmaker fanno per riuscire a portare a compimento la loro opera. Chiediamo aiuto a tutti coloro che, anno dopo anno, ci raccontano di come la loro passione per il cinema di genere fantastico sia nata proprio durante le nostre passate edizioni e ai pi\u00f9 giovani che vorranno entrare a far parte del nostro mondo! 3. La 38esima edizione Che mondo sarebbe senza il Fantafestival lo potete scoprire ironicamente all\u2019interno dello spot che vede protagonisti i nostri Luca Ruocco e Marcello Rossi, girato con il supporto del regista Paolo Gaudio (premiato proprio al Fantafestival per il suo lungometraggio d\u2019esordio Fantasticherie di un passeggiatore solitario). Nel mondo reale, l\u2019assenza del Fantafestival non porterebbe alla sparizione del fantastico dalla vita di tutti i suoi fan, ma di certo segnerebbe la scomparsa di una pagina importante nella storia della cultura italiana horror, fantasy e fantascientifica. Se vorrete darci una mano a salvare la 38esima edizione del Fantafestival avrete la nostra eterna gratitudine e ci aiuterete a coprire le spese organizzative di base di questa nuova avventura che si svolger\u00e0 negli spazi del Nuovo Cinema Aquila, a Roma a Dicembre 2018.

A brief history\u2026 Fantafestival is the oldest Italian festival dedicated to fantastic cinema, covering all its sub-genres: science fiction, horror, fantasy, paranormal, gothic and other similar genres, and it now counts 37 editions! Many of you probably have already heard of Fantafestival, but it\u2019s fair to tell some of his history, for all those who haven\u2019t experimented it in first person. Fantafestival was born in Rome in 1981, following the experiences of science fiction movies exhibitions made for distribution Italnoleggio during \u201974-\u201977, and following the successful science fiction programming of Cineclub Tevere in Rome, starting from \u201975. First held at Clodio theatre in October 1981, and then in several other locations, the Capranica-Capranichetta complex, the Barberini theatre, the Quattro Fontane theatre and finally at the Savoy theatre, the festival has always been addressed to the large audience of fans. During the years, Fantafestival\u2019s bat had flown in other Italian cities: Milan, Ravenna, Naples, Verona and Genoa. Thank to various international collaborations, in 1986 Fantafestival along with the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, the Festival Internacional de Cinema de Catalunya of Sitges (Spain), and the Fantasporto (Oporto, Portugal) is among the funding members of the European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation (www.melies.org). The stage and the screens of Fantafestival have seen all the most important names of fantastic cinema, both Italian and international: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, George A. Romero, Roger Corman, David Cronenberg, Sam Raimi, Peter Cushing, Malcolm McDowell, Peter Jackson, Alejandro Jodorowsky, John Phillip Law, Rutger Hauer, Tobe Hooper, Lloyd Kaufman, Brian Yuzna, Robert Englund, John Carpenter, Ursula Andress, Barbara Steele, Dario Argento, Carlo Rambaldi, Dino De Laurentiis, Dante Ferretti, Sergio Stivaletti, Lamberto Bava and many more. 2. What the world would be like without Fantafestival? The crowdfunding for 2018 What the world would be like without Fantafestival? This is the question we asked ourselves when we realized that it would not be possible to organize the 38th edition of our festival. The reason for this is the constant decrease, down to zero, of the state funding, which in the past allowed us to present an ever growing event. In these last years we decided not to surrender to the funding decrease, compensating it both with personal investments and with our passion, thanks to the affection of Fantafestival\u2019s audience. What the world would be like without Fantafestival? But more importantly, what is the world like \u201cwith\u201d Fantafestival? The world of film festival has deeply changed during the 37 years of life of Fantafestival. For several years now our festival is focusing on independent productions of Italian and foreign filmmakers. Independent directors and producers to whom Fantafestival gave space, in order to promote new ideas and young talents, to put them in contact with the ultimate recipients of their work: the audience. And more than once, thanks to the visibility they had in Fantafestival, young filmmakers went on with their career up to have national theatre distribution of their movies. What brings together Fantafestival, filmmakers and the audience is passion for fantastic cinema. A passion which does not disappear just for the lack of budget. So we decided that a world without Fantafestival should not exist, and we decided to ask for your help, just like many filmmakers do to complete their works. We ask for help from all those that, year after year, tell us how their passion was born in Fantafestival\u2019s past editions and to the younger fans who want to join this world! 3. The 38th edition You can ironically find out what the world would be like without Fantafestival in our spot, with the organizers Luca Ruocco and Marcello Rossi, directed by Paolo Gaudio (who was awarded by Fantafestival for his debut movie Reveries of a Solitary Walker). In the real world, the disappearance of Fantafestival certainly would not deprive all the fan of fantastic cinema, but it would mean to eradicate an important page from the history of Italian fantastic culture. If you\u2019ll help us to save the 38th edition of Fantafestival, you\u2019ll have our eternal gratitude, and you\u2019ll help us to cover the basis expenses for this new adventure that will be held at Nuovo Cinema Aquila in Rome on December 2018. But this is not all: to thank you for your small or big help, Fantafestival will have a gift for each one of you. Here you can find the gifts list. 4.

  "Expedition to the Arctic Circle\u00a0 I am embarking on a photographic expedition to the western shores of Greenland along the southern edge of the Arctic Circle. \u00a0My name is Emanuel Dimitri Volakis and I have been creating black and white photographs for over 27 years. My interest in photography began when I was eleven years old. My professional career as a fine artist commenced in my twenties. I have been working full time as an independent artist for almost three decades.\u00a0\u00a0 My past work has focused on the aesthetics and achievements of humanity from ancient times to the modern age. \u00a0I have photographed the ruins at Pompeii, created an extensive body of work on the Gardens at Versailles and completed additional series on baroque sculpture, architecture and the urban landscape throughout Western Europe and North America. My photographic travels have taken me to many unique regions across North America including Yosemite, Mineral King, \u00a0the Olympic Peninsula, the northern coast of California, Zion and Bryce Canyon in the South West. \u00a0My love of the natural world and the animals that inhabit these wild spaces have been an intrinsic part of my life as an environmentalist, naturalist and activist. The principles of my aesthetics rest on four major pillars. The exclusive use of available light, sharp contrast, bold compositional elements and lastly a sense of timelessness that transports the viewer to a moment beyond the present. I will apply these same core principles on this expedition in order to create images that will capture the mystery and intrigue of this magical land beyond time. This new series will focus exclusively on the natural world and the animals that live there. I will be staging from an icebreaker class expedition ship via zodiac watercraft and by sea kayak in order to fully immerse myself in this remote environment and get as close as possible to the various creatures of the region.\u00a0 I have three distinct photographic objectives for this trip. I will be creating a series of images of icebergs and glaciers treated as architectural studies, capturing the phenomena of the Aurora Borealis, and creating a series of black and white portraits of animals living within the Arctic Circle. I will be shooting primarily in black and white utilizing traditional film cameras including 35mm, medium format and 4x5. \u00a0I will also utilize digital cameras to capture the Aurora Borealis in full color. The expedition will last 16 days followed by several months of darkroom work, photo editing and printing. I am offering open edition and limited edition photographs (meticulously hand printed silver gelatin prints and archival pigment prints) to accommodate all levels of patronage. In addition, I will be offering non exclusive digital assets (film stills, videos and jpegs) as rewards for entry level patrons. I am also offering a few unique rewards for those patrons who want to support the campaign in a more substantial way.\u00a0 If you are inspired by this endeavor and want to support traditional analog photography as an art form, please back this project so that I may create a body of work of this ephemeral place and the majestic animals that live there. Thank you for considering this project.\u00a0 A short note on the timeline for rewards fulfillment. For those supporters who would rather receive a reward sooner than later (2019 vs 2020), you are welcome to choose from a selection of images of my past work. Images from this expedition will become available over time as I develop film, scan and tune negatives and make prints in the darkroom. The process can take months (after returning with 100+ rolls of film) so patience is a must when it comes to analog photography. I will be leaving in August of 2019 for the Arctic and returning in mid September. Rest assured that I will work diligently to process and proof all the negatives as quickly as possible. The more money I raise through this campaign, the more time I can devote to completing this project with no interruptions when I return.\u00a0It is my goal to have working proofs by December/January of this year and to begin to offer images for patrons to review by the Spring of 2020...or possibly sooner. All rewards should be fulfilled by Summer of 2020.\u00a0",
  "Hello, My name is Daryl and I run a small Etsy store where I sell enamel pins and other products of my designs. Typically, I try to focus on designing and selling original characters, but I recently played through the PS3 classic Ni No Kuni and was inspired to design my first keychain.\u00a0 Here are some specifics: Assurance: All pledge money received will go straight into the production and manufacturing of this keychain. The manufacturer that I work with does require 100 piece minimum, so I don't foresee having much money leftover. If there does happen to be some funds left over, all the remainder will go toward purchasing new backing cards and other such items for packaging."
