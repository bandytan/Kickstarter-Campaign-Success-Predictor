  "We understand the challenges that lie ahead of us. Some industry experts say that the market for protein bars is too crowded. These days companies decide to focus on one niche and cater to specific needs of their customers. Ademi\u2019s mission is not only to spread vegan lifestyle, but to innovate and bring out the best in nutrition technology. We sincerely believe that Ademi bars can survive with this Kickstarter campaign plus sales projections that we are planning to generate by adding more flavors and controlling our own supply chain along the way.",
  "Team Unicox Superfoods has taken significant steps to ensure this Kickstarter is as successful  as possible. \n\nWe're a startup and during our first production run things may get delayed. Ingredients can ship late, packaging can be incorrect and things can go wrong in our supply chain. Any of these things could cause us to ship our first products later than we expect. That said, we will keep our backers updated on any and all developments.\n\nIf we reach our funding goal during the preorder window, we will be able to produce our first run with our co-packer in April, May and begin shipping in June .\n\nGiven our capacity for production has limits, if the demand exceeds this capacity, we'll likely need to push out our delivery timeline. However, Unicox Superfoods would have to go truly \"viral\" for this to happen.",
  "With an experienced writing and production team, our production company is confident in achieving its goals and overcoming any challenges from concept, creation to distribution.",
  "With a full month and complete flexibility on my end, it's hard to imagine that anything would get in the way of this project. In some *insanely unlikely* event that I am unable to paint during my stay in Sparkill, a rescheduling of modeling sessions at a later date will occur as necessary and painting will continue once home in Kansas City, thereby completing the paintings and fulfilling the rewards. The schedule may be affected, but not the result.",
  "The challenge is assembling the people and equipment needed for this.  You need cameras for photos and videos. A studio is a must to be able to create the many different images I want. And finally, I need to hire models or bring in survivors from around the country to take part.",
  "My obstacle is Mentoring for new business, I would be my own boss, I'm new to running my own business, I have a passion for this to succeed, so with help (and funding) I will make this work.",
  "Risks once the film is funded successfully is the film location and crew.",
  "Aside from accidentally summoning a demon, there are many risks associated with making this film. Primarily, pushing the bounds of what our camera systems are technically capable of will be a challenge to say the least - but our months of testing and prep has us confident we can do something new and exciting, and fun to watch.",
  "A challenge we face is time. We plan on the film being complete and released by the week of halloween. All of the creators work fulltime jobs outside of their film jobs (which during filming can also be fulltime) so getting the film shot and edited and released in 60 days will be a challenge. \r\nOur short 'Meat' was shot edited and released in two days with a 100$ budget. So we are fully confident in our ability.",
  "I have made 40+ pins at this point and so I have a good idea of what I'm doing. There may be delays due to unforeseen circumstances (weather, holidays, imperfections in the pins, etc.), but I will do everything in my power to make sure these pins are in your hands by May.\n\n***NOTE: Backers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply. I'm not responsible for delays due to customs. Actual colors may vary slightly from proofs.***",
  "I'll need to hire a writer, make up artists and put together a film crew and editors/sfx, all for a relatively small amount.  This will be tough to come up with skilled people and basically this is the first time I've done anything like this, so this movie will probably suck. lol  So many people have tried something like this and failed, zombie movies are a dime a dozen, but there are so few good ones,  I want to create something that is action packed and for zombie film lovers which I am one of.",
  "To be honest without your support we wont get this done, in preparation we have been in contact with a location agency and well as freelance after effects people. our crew are a bunch of film buff and we are ready to go. casting the crew will take some time as we want the best for your money. to be honest our risk is very minimal but it all can't be possible without your support.",

  "I believe the risks and challenges are few. I did my best to tailor the expected delivery time on each the incentives according to what I've learned about the process of making records in the past.\r\nBarring an act of God, there is little that can prevent me from completing this project and honoring the incentives.\r\nThat said, scheduling of the studios and musicians, completion of cover art and issues with pressing can all contribute to delays in completion.\r\nI will keep you all abreast of process as events unfold.",
  "The main challenges involved with recording this record are preparing the material and making sure that we are all healthy both mentally and physically before we get into the studio.  We have a limited time to complete this project and we are on a tight budget.  But we feel confident that with the love and support of our friends, family and community, we can work through any obstacle that will arise.",

  "I have experience with kickstarter as well as been in the pin making business for a year now. I'm able to make the process a lot smoother but a full disclosure is always warranted. I have a designated manufacturer I work with but have expanded my interaction to multiple as a fall back plan. My pins come from overseas so that explains the time necessary to produce all the enamel pins. \nAll designs displayed so far are tentative designs until I can get a better idea of what is possible with the the mold to make these designs accurate. I will try my best to adhere to the original design as much as possible however.\nDue to the timing in the global problem of COVID 19, I've added a buffer month just in case something gets delayed or if the pins need more time to be made.\n\nSome manufacture errors are possible in mass production so if there are any B-grade enamel pins of greater than 15% in a batch, I will request a remake for quality which will have a bit of a longer wait time. I will be on top of quality check before and after receiving pins to the best of my capabilities. Please note that some slight color variation may occur from my original artwork due to each viewer's monitor settings and what colors can actually be generated in reality. \n\nI am the sole person designing, planning, ordering, packing and shipping out the packages. If any delay comes along, I will certainly let you backers know as soon as possible and keep you all updated. I will answer questions to the best of my ability.",
  "1. Delay of shipping the pins due to slow production because of local holidays/defects.\n2. Actual color of the design might not look exactly the same with the digital art design posted.\n3. If you have any problems or concerns with the shipping of your parcel, please contact me ASAP through email or message me directly on Instagram and i will help you with my best. But in the cased that you missed out on receiving your parcel it is your responsibility to contact the courier.",
  "We're transparent in communicating the physical and mental demands that come with running a restaurant. It's no secret that a bigger space means that the responsibilities, expenses and maintenance will double. One of the biggest risks is not having the right team to divide the responsibilities amongst. We've experienced this in the past. We've been working from within our current team to build a better structure for operations, prep and service.\n\nAnother risk in opening \"First Sunday by Sol Sips\" is the challenge that comes with running two locations. The structure and demands of our small cafe is being scaled down to accommodate a breakfast and brunch menu w/a fresh juices, coffee and tea in the early half of the day. Our full service location will be for lunch/dinner and nightlife service. Strategically having these locations open at different times will help with balancing out the managerial needs and maintenance of both spaces.",
  "The only possible risk is that i might ship your products with a little delay.",
  "Vegan food is hotter than ever and it is growing every day at the moment.\nWe hope to be one of the first vegan food trucks of our kind here in Sweden, and by being first together with serving amazing food we hope to become more and more popular and more and more known, so that we eventually can open up a 2nd and then a 3d truck, there is a dream about Vegan EVERYTHING being in both Denmark, Norway and Finland as well in the future.\nThere is risks and challenges with everything you decide to do, but if you never try then you will never know. Vegan food and healthy food is everywhere, but a vegan food truck serving the vegan food that we are going to serve is something we have not seen here and that is what we are so optimistic about!\nIf a problem would show up, we would just have to work our hardest to solve it.",
  "As anyone who's traveled knows, crazy can and does happen. All you can really do is plan for contingencies and adapt when they occur. I will be purchasing travel insurance best suited to cover the nature of this trip in case something major does happen. Should travel plans change backers will be updated. Also all artwork will be fully insured during shipping for full reimbursement to backers should it be lost or damaged and there is no possibility of replacement (ie. original artwork not prints). \r\n\r\nThough I've tried to plan my trip for the most suitable weather for outdoor painting, it is always possible that some days that might not be true. If the weather is not cooperating and I'm not able to paint outside I'll do my best to find a interior sheltered location in which to paint, or do an extra painting another day. But if I'm not able to complete all the plein air paintings purchased by backers while on the trip, then the remaining number of paintings will be completed in studio from photos once back home in the same style and size of their plein air counterparts and backers receiving these paintings will be notified of the change. \r\n\r\nLastly, though access to wireless internet is common place while traveling these days, we all know that sometimes it goes out. I'll do my best to update my blog at least once a day, but if there are internet problems it might be late.",
  "The biggest risk and challenges  associated with participation in Spectrum Miami is taking the time away from my students and finding the extra time while I'm teaching to keep my creative projects moving forward. The risk is spending the time and money to put on a good quality exhibit and not achieving the results I need to keep moving forward as an artist. If I get picked up by one gallery, or sell the pieces on the floor, I will consider it a success. But its long term growth as an artist and advocate for the arts which has led me to take this project on.",
  "There's no risk involved, especially if you liked issue 1 and 2. When the project reaches it funding goal it will be professionally printed and posted to each and every person who funded the project.\r\n\r\nThe magazine is guaranteed to be at least 68 pages in length, in full colour containing articles about eight bit computers written by enthusiasts of eight bit computers.\r\n\r\nIssue 1 and 2 was successfully funded and received positive feedback. Issue 3 aims to be even better.",

  "There is many risks and challenges ahead for us, most notably that we will fail to raise the required amount and the project fails. This is will be most unpleasant and will mean that all of the money raised thus far will be returned to it's lender as this is an all of nothing vehicle.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we might face is that Belan Hall is under such heavy snow that we will not be able to get there. If this is the case we will scratch our stubble and agree on an equally creative (though less remote) place to record.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we could face is that we don't receive any bookings for festivals, which although unlikely, could happen, as at this stage we only have it in 'word' and not 'writing'. If this is the case and we fail to agree on any festivals the THE FESTIVAL prise will be refunded to the sum of \u00a3300 and the THE VIP will be offered as a makeweight.\r\n\r\nThe final challenge will be staying fit and healthy and creative, if for any reason a release date is pushed back we will give you ample warning and communicate throughout.",
  "With your support we will have our project completed and ready to deliver by March 2015. We will keep you up to date with all progress and feel free to contact us for any reason at JustinAlanBlackBand@gmail.com.",
  "We are giving ourselves the month of November to fully realize the songs and ensure our confidence during the recording process. The most realistic challenge we think could happen would be the need for more recording time and in turn more money. An obvious risk is the potential inability to reach our goal of $1,500. This would be a set back to the creation of the album, the production of CD's and general saving for future tours/recording projects. We hope to release the album in the early new year.",
  "Filmmaking is always a complicated and involved process with room for many unforeseen problems (trust us). However, with our amazing team, I know we'll overcome any problems that arise in a creative and effective way.

You're part of the team now!\r\n\r\nAnd if another fire comes our way you can BET we'll fight it off with our BARE HANDS!!! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqw1gq-5UZY)",
  "Primarily everything is being planned by myself but there are some things that require speaking with and coordinating everyone involved will be a bit tough. This project is also a bit experimental as everything will be edited on tablets(i Pad) with a wide selection of interesting editing programs that create surprisingly great quality videos. Casting the actresses for Claire and Moira could also be challenging as they are iconic characters with a specific look but thankfully there are a few theatre student volunteers who are interested so it'll just be a matter of choosing the right people. Lastly there's finding the right location to film at that reasonably captures the look of the various environments within the game, but with enough research a place should be found.\r\nI personally believe with the right amount of effort put into all the variables there should not be any issues working on this project.",
  "Every great business venture involves some risk.  I feel I am very well prepared because of my years of experience in the food service industry.  Everything from waitressing to cooking to bookkeeping.  I have over 20 years under my belt to handle the hustle and bustle of preparing and serving food.  I've utilized many resources to properly guide me on my journey to entrepreneurship.  Most invaluable has been my business advisor Matt from the CT Small Business Development Center (SBDC).  He has successfully assisted in the opening of over 50 food based businesses and his tutelage and guidance has been my greatest gift.  I believe slow and steady wins the race.  So my goal is to expand Dutch's without going \"too big, too soon\".  A consistent quality product is always my first priority.  My focus for successful business will be proper financial management, well developed marketing strategies, building a strong team, superior customer service and continuously looking for opportunities to improve.  Our biggest challenge will be attracting non vegan customers.  To overcome that challenge we plan to have as much face to face contact as possible.  I believe that most people are open to listen and try something new once even a small amount of trust is established.  If we can be on hand to answer questions about ingredients or preparation it will help them gain a better understanding and be less fearful of eating something new.  It only takes one bite to be hooked.",
  "There are two major challenges: this being a collaborative project and being held outside.  The commitment from the artists is present, however, emergencies do arise at the most unexpected times.  The other is the weather, if the weather stops the event it will be rescheduled for a later date.",

  "Well, we could freeze to death... no just joking! There is the risk that no northern lights will appear or that the weather will be so cloudy or foggy that even if there are northern lights, we won't see them. But this is why we go for 3 weeks to get a good chance of clear nights with hopefully lots of northern lights. Otherwise there are no risks just fun in the cold winter nights ;-)",
  "The biggest challenge will be getting all the calendars out to backers in time for the holidays. The funding period closes on the 8th of November and the printer has assured me that I can get an eight day turnaround on printing. With an estimated seven days to ship at the most, I'm looking to have the calendars by the 23rd or 24th of November. It'll be hectic, but I believe I can get them all shipped within two weeks. That means they're out my door two and half weeks before Christmas. If the response is so large that I need to hire help to make that happen, then I'll do that.",
  "There's actually very little risk!  The first issue is more or less done and paid for.  The authors are paid and the artist is paid.  The only one who hasn't been paid is me!\r\n\r\nLet me explain.  I intend to put out this high quality science fiction magazine regardless of what happens on this Kickstarter.  So, why am I Kickstarting?  Because I intend to use Kickstarter as an investment platform. By supporting this first issue of Cirsova, you are investing in the future of the magazine.  Proceeds from the Kickstarter will be used to fulfill orders and profits will be used to purchase stories for a second issue.",
  "There are many challenges with completing a project of this size. The main one is being able to pay a professional lay out artist to set up the magazine for printing. This is a very specific skill set and it doesn't come cheap!\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is getting all the content together. It takes a tremendous amount of time and creative energy to write the stories, take the photos and put the whole thing together in a cohesive whole. While I've written and published many articles for other magazines, I've never put a whole magazine together myself. The previous editor had years to figure this out and I was part of the team, but I have never been responsible for a magazine from start to finish, so I'm learning as I go. \r\n\r\nThe final challenge; allowing enough time to actually create the content and production. I always think I'll be able to finish a project much faster than I actually do. As you can see from the above video, I originally expected to have this out by early summer. Here it is, late fall, and I'm finally done pulling all the articles and pictures together. I'm working with a lay out artist now to design the magazine, and by the time this campaign ends, I will finally be ready to go to print!\r\n\r\nEverything in this magazine has been done from scratch; there is no pre-made template where you just plug images in and voila, you have a magazine. I'm building it all from the ground up. Even finding a printer has been a challenge since so few places exist now that print in the style I want to print in! \r\n\r\nEvery step of this magazine has been tackled one piece at a time. If further delays come up, it will be handled in the exact same way; with transparency, honest communication and lots of elbow grease!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your pledge and support! Rock on! \r\n\r\nxo Rev. Michelle",
  "The largest risk involved after funding is complete is also the next challenge. After the Registrations are filled out, the Legalities Sorted, and the Teaser is shot, the Over-all Film Budget will be the next Kick Starter Project in order to complete this masterful film project and get it entered into the hands of the Film Festival Circuit and Possible Distribution.\r\n\r\nIf this project succeeds and the over-all budget fails, I will still strive in all manners possible to continue to raise the funds for the Full Feature Film Project.\r\n\r\nBackers who do fund this successful project will still receive all related rewards and promises made in this Project if it does reach its Goal. If the Full Budget Kickstarter Project reaches its goal, the Backers of this project will be automatically credited as promised from this Funding without further Backing necessary for the Full Budget Fund.\r\n\r\nAny amount of funding over this preliminary goal will be transferred to the Full Feature Length Budget Fund Project and bring that Project's Initial Goal lower.",
  "1. I understand that restaurants face their fare share of challenges.  That is one of the reasons we are starting with a food truck.  This will allow us to introduce West Michigan to an all vegan dining experience, while running a lean operation and making data-driven decisions to ensure our success and growth.  Having a seasoned veteran of the industry on our team will help us avoid some of the common pitfalls of a food startup.\n2. The timeline could be pushed back as purchasing, outfitting and licensing a truck can sometimes take longer than planned.\n3. NASA says that thousands of meteors hit the ground every year so the chance of one of them hitting our truck is something that keeps us up at night.\n\nThank you all so much for your continued support with my companies Bit Baking Co. and Cheeyeah and I look forward to sharing this amazing project (and food) with you! \n\nPeace & Love",

  "This is the second time that I and four friends stayed on my friend's land in New Mexico for a month of art creation. Last year was a great success. This year we have planned our schedule and meals, and have a good estimate of our costs. I would say generally the biggest challenge for me is planning. With this project, I have a clear schedule of work and a definite number of paintings to finish, which corresponds to the days of the month of July: 31. It is always good for me to be working on something that I know I will be giving to someone for them to enjoy.",
  "The risks and challenges are fairly minimal. I've already been accepted to the Fellowship and I have transportation. The only obstacle really standing in my way is money.

I will continue to monitor the situation and should any updates need to be made about shipping expectations, I will update accordingly.",
  "The production time of the pins is completely beyond my control, because a manufacturer makes the pins for me after I send them my design. Normally it takes about 4 weeks of production, if there is any delay I'll let all my backers know.\n\nThe colors may change slightly once the pins go into production. If something in my design changes, I'll notifiy all backers.\n\nThe cost for shipping are standard delivery, without any tracking code. This way I can keep the shipping costs low for you. I am not accountable for lost or damaged pins, but if the damage occurs under my accountability, I will gladly have a new pin send to you!",
  "While I am seeking $10,000 to fund the 2nd stage of this new album, in truth that only covers the recording fees. I actually need another $3,000 beyond this to print the album and another $5,000-7,000 for marketing and advertising costs. So, the completion of this project is contingent on gaining these extra funds at some point. I've set this Kickstarter campaign threshold at $10,000, but I sure would appreciate if I were able to achieve much more than that. My dream goal is to raise $20,000. The extra funds will be used wisely in the completion of an album that will be a pinnacle of my career!",

  "We truly believe No Planet B Festival will make an impact from the offset creating a positive energy for the future of our planet. \r\n\r\nBut of course all things have their challenges, and by highlighting them here we aim to to be fully transparent with you, so that we can all grow on this journey together! \r\n\r\nRisks: \r\n\r\n1) Ticket Quantity Sold: \r\n\r\n- Being a first year festival, despite our incredible line-up and fully rounded weekend of activities, we need to consider the possibility of not selling enough tickets to outweigh the expenditure involved in running this festival (which isn't cheap!)  \r\n-We have been planning for this outcome all year, and no pun intended have Plan B, Plan C and Plan D have been thought out. However, if we do not sell at least 750 tickets by May 26th we plan to discuss as team whether we look to temporary put the festival on hold until 2019. As a result Kickstarter will not charge ANY money from your accounts. \r\n\r\n2) Wet Weather: \r\n\r\n-As much as we want that Coachella festival weather, we need to face the facts that we are in the UK, and as well all know to well....festival 101 rule....bring your wellies! \r\n\r\n-We have a full wet weather contingency in place, however depending on the amount of rain (if it were to happen) we may need to cancel the festival.

This process takes time and might involve delays. However, I wish to have the book published in december 2019.\nPhoto books are expensive to print and a minimum of 500 copies are required to order. Otherwise, the unit price will become too expensive. \nIn other words, it is a 'Limited edition print' and my Kickstarter backers will have priority and a signed copy of the book.\n\nOther challenges with self-publishing will be marketing. Since I have no distributors, I will have to promote the book on the internet. Also, I will take personal contacts with selected book stores in order to have presentation. Additionally, I will of course present the book and do signing during my exhibitions.",

  "Our passion is food!. My husband and I have been in the hospitality business for 30 years.  There are other people selling their sofrito. What separates our product from other ones out there, is our commitment to using only 100% fresh product without preservatives and it is 100% vegan.  In the last couple of years we've been selling our sofrito from home, farmers markets and on ebay. \r\n  There is mainly one company that sells their sofrito at big name brand supermarkets. Since we make our sofrito without preservatives, we know that with an amazing sales and marketing team and plan, we will approach with confidence potential markets. A couple of the markets we will approach with our sofrito are, Wholefoods, Trader Joes (these stores do not sell sofrito). You see, sofrito is used mostly in the Caribbean, so we are here to educate folks on using it on a daily basis to season and marinade all foods. It's so healthy!.  I've researched the benefits of the ingredients in the sofrito and you'll be pleasantly surprised to find out how good it is for a good diet and health promotions. \r\n     We have also pledged to give back to the community. every month, we will choose a charity or family to lend a financial hand.\r\n \r\n      With your monetary pledge, we will :\r\n\r\n.mass production\r\n.All necessary licences \r\n.commercial kitchen rental\r\n.sales and marketing\r\n.distribution\r\n\r\n     We thank you in advance for taking the time to read our story and be a part of something amazing.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nSharon and Jim",
  "What we find challenging is getting 100% funded and finding that perfect spot in the metro.\r\n\r\nBetween us both we have 26 years of kitchen experience both in cooking and in assisting in the day-to-day operations. We have worked the past 5 years in perfecting our recipes and studying the vegan and gluten free lifestyle in order to provide quality products for our guests to enjoy.",
  "Starting any business can of course come with unique challenges. \r\n\r\nSome problems we can foresee are the following. \r\nDelay in getting license due to slow bureaucracy\r\nDifficulty in getting into a suitable kitchen\r\nGetting our product into big shops - supermarkets will be quite challenging to get into. The focus at first will be on smaller shops.  \r\n\r\nWhile we anticipate the bureaucratic problems. We believe that finding an appropriate premises will not be a problem. Also while it may take longer to get into bit supermarkets, we believe that due to the exploding demand for vegan products we will see great growth.",
  "The biggest challenge for me was finding the right producer. And I've already found the perfect guy.\r\n\r\nLorenzo and I did a practice run with my song, Crosby Street, and he nailed it. He wrote parts for a guitar, banjo, bass, keys, even back up harmonies for me to sing for myself. He heard the music I wrote and then he heard the possibility that lies within it. And the best part is that he then knew how to execute it. He knows the best people to work with. And my favorite part is that he knows me. He knows how to push and challenge me to stretch my talents to create something that's better than I could have imagined. \r\n\r\nWith that secure, I feel no fear of risk, only excitement for opportunity.\r\n\r\nOh. I forgot. It will be a challenge for me to stay in tempo, but that's not news to anyone that's seen me play. I promise I'll overcome it. Mostly.",
  "Once this project is successfully funded, I intend to proceed quickly through the tangled process of editing, mastering and recording the album.  Of course, there can be delays at any step, graphic design glitches, finding common time to get everyone together, but having gone through this process many times, I'm confident that I'll have a product for you by this fall - in time for holiday gifts!",

  "I'm a rookie.  I've never made a zine!  My projected costs are based on research, but who knows what I might not have thought of.  I think I have some great connections and leads on promoting it, but some of these put me under some pretty short deadlines.  I hope that those deadlines will be a great motivation to get things done in a timely manner!",
  "There are many risks and challenges with making a film.  One of the challenges we have come to face is equipment we are here to raise some money to overcome that.",
  "The risks for this project are minimal.  If I receive my minimum funding amount, I will finalize, professionally print, publish, and begin to advertise the screenplay.  The actual writing of the screenplay is not reliant on funding of this project.  I am certain I will have it completed by December of next year.  I intend to keep all contributors updated on my progress.  The only major challenge I face is taking this project to the next level.  I have no connections in any aspect of the film industry and would have to rely first on the quality of my final product, and secondly on advice on how to get my product known to those in the film industry.  Those who contribute at this base level of the project are guaranteed success.  Together, we will see where we can take it from there.",

  "Setbacks are almost a certainty, but with precision, focus and lots of rehearsals, we assure that hiccups and hurdles won't be happening. I've set up a very rigid pre-production, production, and post-production schedule and plan to adhere to this 100% of the way. Even in pre-production, we've encountered hurdles, losing a couple of actors, and re-writing things on the fly to keep on line to make a great film. \r\n\r\nI plan on screening this theatrically after it is complete, and then taking it to festival play to ensure that everyone will see what their money went to.",
  "We are going to get this album done, no matter what. If we have busk on the street of downtown Asheville barefoot every weekend for the next five years to pay for it, we will.

There will be many unforeseen hurdles and hiccups, but we will use our brains and our incredible resources and work through them. Thank you for believing in us.",

If I find I'm in need of a lot more pins than I have quoted my manufacturer, then obviously that will cause some delays.\n\n\u2022 Potential minor design changes - my manufacturer has already approved the borb designs so we should be good to go, so i'm being cautiously optimistic that there will be no issues - but you never know! I may have to tweak things during production.",
  "The paintings are completed so that isn't a risk. (This project will clear my art debts and let me buy supplies to create my next project.)\r\n\r\nRisks include damage/alterations to paintings while displayed for publicity or during shipping.

I am doing my best to make sure the paintings will be protected during shipping (glassine, water resistant wrapping and foam board) but damage might occur.",

Within the past year I have decided that I need to share my passion with others. Which is why I have become interested in photography and writing, because I feel they are the best routes to share my experiences with others.\r\n\r\nI am taking on an amazing endeavor. Because of the challenges I know that I will face, I have spent a lot of time researching everything I need to be successful. \r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I am not able to start this project without the help of all of you. Your pledges will pay for my hiking equipment, living expenses throughout 2018, and will allow me to publish my photo book once it is completed.",

I am also not responsible for any taxes, claims, or additional fees that your country may require.

  "This is our 6th Kickstarter and we are very familiar with enamel pin production and order fulfillment. Please visit our Etsy store if you'd like to see our customer reviews. :)\n\nMost of the anticipated potential risks occur in pin production or shipping delays. If a delay occurs during either phase, all backers will be notified. As with all Kickstarters, if this is not funded, there will be no charge to you.\n\nThank you for your support! :)",
  "There are very few risks associated with this type of project, however we understand things may and do arise especially at the worst possible time. Potentially the only real risk that could cause any delays would be in the mastering from digital to analog or from the company chosen to produce the 7\" being unable to complete the project in a timely manner. In which case we would still be able to offer all of our incentives, only at a later date.",
  "Colors & design changes:\nFinal products can have slight color variations from the provided images due to monitor/computer settings. I will work with my manufacturer to try to get the best match for the PMS colors that I have chosen for these designs!\nThere is a possibility that there will be minor design changes to the pins (ie:  line thickness) due limitations in production, but I will try to stay as true to the design as possible. If there are major changes needed, I will notify backers.\n\nDelays:\nSince the pins are manufactured overseas, there is a potential for delays in production and shipping. There is also a small possibility that if my manufacturer sends a high number of damaged/faulty pins, I will have to get them remade as soon as possible. I will keep backers notified if these situations occur!",
  "This will be my second time making a pin via Kickstarter, and my main concern is making sure the manufacturer can deliver by the time I'm asking, which will be somewhere between March and May, but I have previously gone to them for my first pin, and I trust them.",
  "I am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time. There could be production issues that are beyond my control that could impact the delivery date. Also minor changes in the design may occur to prevent manufacturing problems, but these will only be made if it is absolutely necessary and every effort will be made to preserve the original aesthetic.\n\nAdditionally, though shipping logistics could always potentially be a problem, I have reliably shipped thousands of pins via USPS.\n\nIf any issues arise I will be sure to notify backers.\n\nPlease note that everyone's monitors display images a little differently. The colors shown for the pins may vary slightly when compared to the pins in person.",
  "Time. Tackling a large series like this will take time. I plan on dedicating the months of June - October to this project. I will do a few other pieces within this time frame, but only as a quick break. This will be the largest series I've completed, but I have practiced on a 20 piece series of African animals in the same style. Those 20 pieces took about two months, which is how I calculated the time frame for this project.",

There are a LOT of rules about how we're allowed to display signage and we have read them all, as well as acquired all the permits.  We have a professional painter ready to do the renovations on the wall when the weather breaks as well as sources for all of our signage and lighting.  \r\n\r\nWe will be sending out rewards as soon as they are available (which we anticipate mid Feb) and we'll do our best to customize to your liking!",
  "Because we have been running this business for over two years, we already have much of the infrastructure in place and are prepared to meet and overcome any obstacles we face. \r\n\r\nThe designs for our packaging are complete and ready to be ordered as soon as funds become available. \r\n\r\nWe will need to find and secure a commercial kitchen and can pay rent once the project is successfully funded. To fulfill orders, we will need to hire two bakers. Our family has had many years of combined experience in the food production industry--Grigor as a restaurant owner, Christina as a coffee shop assistant manager and baker, and Tony as a professionally-trained pastry chef--which will enable us to start up and run a kitchen that meets all Health Department and FDA requirements.\r\n\r\nIf you have any concerns about our ability to deliver quality products in a timely manner, please ask away and we would be happy to answer any of your questions!",
  "The biggest challenge to getting the record out by September will be making sure the band can all be off for 3 days to make the record.\r\n\r\nThe other challenges that we can forsee we have found help to package envelopes, so that should be covered.\r\n\r\nThis will be 4 songs instead of the 8 we were looking to make in the prior kickstarter project. We have a new studio on board to help us make the project that will make this go quickly and save us some time and money!",
  "I have had a lot of help from friends going through the recording process. As you all know some of the money funding this project has to go fulfilling perks! which if all goes well everyone that becomes part of this EP or \"backs\" will be getting some pretty awesome stuff.

I have already lined up a team of friends that have been there helping me make this record from the start to also help ship your GOODS! Whether I have to drop it off at your house personally or if i have to ship it to the north pole. The idea here is you get what you put in plus more.",

  "There are Risks and Challenges associated with any restaurant startup. Here's why we think VURRITO's standards will mitigate those risks. For one, there is no one currently doing what we do. Our competitors are the non-healthy options that are not good for us. They contribute directly to obesity, heart disease, global warming and animal cruelty (just to name a few). VURRITO\u2122 is a sustainable, cruelty-free food option for everyone. \r\n\r\nOne of the of the most important aspects of a restaurant business is controlling food costs.  VURRITO\u2122 can lead the fast-casual industry in food cost percentage and at the same time, provide the highest quality ingredients!  All of our ingredients are used in multiple menu items, which reduces the cost and potential waste of each product. We also have very little chance of cross contamination, there are no animal by-products, which means no nasty salmonella.  \r\n\r\nWe believe there are multiple effective and profitable ways of bringing VURRITO\u2122 to the masses! VURRITO's model is exceptionally scalable and profitable: this includes catering, food trucks, farmers markets, food carts, as well as wholesale in stores or online. The sky is the limit!",
  "I am hoping for the best result, but of course I need to consider risks.\r\n\r\nThe main risk that arises is that the project will not be funded, so I am setting a goal of \u00a3100 for a start.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge for me is to find 30 different ideas in my head and get them painted onto the paper and to try not to use same elements in the painting. I think that it will be really interesting to see how my head copes with it ))",
  "The major challenge to the project that I see is getting good, usable photos that are adquate for painting references of the 14 fields that I have not personally seen.  While completing 30 large paintings in 30 weeks is a challenge I am totally confident that I can get it done.",
  "I want to make sure I raise money to fund other projects including helping local non profits. I also want to do this together with you so that we all win in being generous to our city whilst also getting art prints out of it!",
  "There are essentially no risks to this project",

Fuh-Ree-Zing!\r\n\r\nOther than that, I've done a successful mini project on Kickstarter already. So I've got a good idea about how it all works!\r\n\r\nThe only other risk is trying to safely get prints out to you. But I'll be really careful to pack them all proper!",

I have allowed for the extra work in my projected time scale and should still have everything completed by December 2013 in this most wonderful of eventualities.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am new to portraiture commissions, please rest assured that I have owned my own online business since 1998 and am very used to fulfilling orders in a timely manner on an international scale. I have also received many jewellery design commissions over the years so the concept of commissioned work is not new to me. \r\n\r\nI already have a printer lined up for the Giclee prints and another one for the postcards and stickers so I'm all ready to go. Yay!",
  "A large risk in our project would be Covid. We'll have to take into consideration how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our filming schedule as well as our cast and crew. To stay as safe as possible, we will be limiting the number of crew-members we have on set, sanitizing all equipment before and after use, and more. We will be taking the necessary steps to stay safe. And following the Texas Film guidelines for COVID safety. Our biggest priority is making sure our cast and crew healthy, comfortable, and taken care of.",

  "Risks and challenges\n- Your card will not be charged if the Dapper Cats Enamel Pin Kickstarter does not reach its goal.\n- There may be delays in production or shipping, due to time zones, and Holidays. However, I will do my very best to make sure that everyone receives their pins and goodies as quickly as possible.\n- Due to the hand-made nature of these enamel pins, there is a possibility of defective pins. (No backer should get a defective pin, so if a large portion of the batch is defective, I will communicate with the manufacturers to get this sorted as soon as possible. I have immense faith in my manufacturer as I've worked with them on three Kickstarters already. They have never let me down so far. \n- Inspections/grading will be another challenge. This will take time! I want to ensure that everyone gets perfect pins, so I usually take about 2 weeks to grade every single pin personally. \n- All US bound packages will include tracking. Some packages may be delayed due to inclement weather, post worker strikes, or other unforeseeable events. I appreciate your patience, and am happy to replace a package if it is marked as officially LOST by USPS on their tracking website. However, if your package is marked as delivered, I cannot replace it. Please make sure that your delivery address is a safe location to receive your rewards.\n- International packages are a bit tricky. These do not have tracking once they leave the US. I cannot replace missing packages due to being unable to determine with confidence whether your package was truly lost or not. To prevent loss of stock, these packages will not be sent twice. You will always be able to see when your package is sent out via the US tracking sent to your email, however, this will not show your package as it travels outside the US. Please make sure that you trust your postal system, and pledge with confidence! \n- I will keep backers posted via the updates tab, and through my social media outlets! Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you have anymore questions! (BraveLittleAvengers @ gmail. com) :)",

  "Common to Utah is the chance of winter hitting in October. To help avoid this potential issue, all scenes that take place outside are scheduled first, with many having the option of being moved to interior locations without hurting the storytelling. There is also the chance of the actual pandemic having a second wave hit around the time of production. This production will be using testing kits to make sure everyone on set is healthy as well as practicing CDC guidelines. Easier to pull off when you have a pandemic in your story and having a killer who is always wearing a mask. If there is a city or state stay-at-home order, the film will be rescheduled for next spring and will not be cancelled.",

  "As with any Kickstarter, this project runs the chance of not meeting  the funding goal. In such an event you will not be charged for your pledge.\nOther risk factors include: \n- Defective pins - which will cause a DELAY in shipment time. \n- Minimal design changes - sometimes certain details are better left  out. I will be sure to negotiate with the manufacturer to ensure that the pins will look as closely as possible to the default designs. I will  provide updates if there are further changes! \n- Lost packages - this risk will be minimized by double checking  your mailing information before sending them to me! Once an item is in  transit, it will depend on the post to handle the package. Any damages  can be negotiated with USPS office(s). \n- Health factors - these pins will be made with METAL. If you have any allergies to such, please be wary!",
  "The only thing that stands in my way of having the new album printed up is providing the upfront funds to purchase the materials & services needed to do so.  It is that simple.  There are no collaborators.  I am doing all the artwork and writing all the songs.  I am recording a SOLO record so no other musicians are involved.  There is only one guy, Patrick Herzfeld, who is recording, engineering & producing the record and we are best friends.  He has recorded three other records ( Graham Wilkinson & the Underground Township, Graham Wilkinson, and Spiritual Accessories EP ) of mine and has been my right hand drummer for over ten years.  \r\nIn the event that Patrick was unable to record this record, simply to address this section of the Kicstarter application process where we assess the \"Risks & Challenges\", I have over 10 other studios I am connected with where I could complete the process.\r\nI have three different companies lined up and ready to print up the record once it is done and have compared their prices (all of them are about the same)... and THAT is the only thing I am doing, printing up the cd's, with the Kickstarter money.\r\nIf I had to imagine the biggest challenge i will face in trying to complete this project, outside of actually raising the money, it would be finding the time in my family's busy schedule where my wife isn't working, or we have a babysitter and I'm not missing one of Zoe's soccer games so i can record - and that can be made possible all with a little communication & planning. :)",

  "The obstacles that come up are mainly financial; making copies of the final product once it is collaged.  Buying glue and scissors and tape and paper. Printing the submitted materials.  Mailing them out.  The financial burden is definitely the largest, but that will be taken care of if this campaign is successful.\r\n\r\nOther obstacles include:\r\nfinding a place that is indoors and warm to actually construct these zines.  There are always coffee shops and really sweet couchsurfing hosts, and i've got a large tarp and some rope, so worst comes to worst, i'll go to a national park and set up camp for a few days of uninterrupted zine construction.\r\nFinding a local print shop i want to give my business too, because i don't want to support any corporations who contribute to the suffering in this world.  That's easy enough, thanks to my pocket god (aka smart phone).\r\n\r\nThose are really the only challenges i can foresee, and their pretty easily solved.  I have a really wide social network and know of a lot of platforms to post calls for submissions and already have a blackbook full of amazing artists to solicit.  \r\n\r\nso, really, the only challenge is funding.",
  "The risk involved in this project is really quite minimal. The biggest challenge is getting advertisers into a very first issue of any magazine. Most advertisers want to see a bit of a track record before committing advertising dollars. So there is a good chance we will take a minimal loss on the first few issues of the magazine. Which is why we need to ensure we are properly funded to make the magazine viable long-term. Now don't get me wrong, there are many ways to get paying advertisers into a first issue, and that will be a huge point of focus. Giving advertisers an incredible looking preview of the magazine is by far the best way to do that.",

  "Because this is my first Kickstarter and I'm not sure how to gauge the reaction or the popularity.  I will be working my hardest to retain momentum and hype for the witch pins. \nIf the project is not able to fully funded, then any pledges made will not be charged! It's all or nothing! \n\n I'll be active with everyone, and for any question that you may have, I can be reached at MousieMagick@gmail.com. \n\nOnce the campaign has been funded my Manufacturer will be given the green light to proceed, Pins will be made, it will take approximately three-four weeks to get them back, and at that point, I will be grading all of the pins for quality.  Rest assured, I'm happy with my Manu, and they have always given me excellent quality. \n\n\nBest wishes x Lauren",

  "There are many risks and challenges associated with starting a food business. The demand for MALK has greatly exceeded our expectations. We just launched MALK in June at a Farmer's Market in Houston and now in February, you can find MALK in several big box grocers and numerous coffee shops and convenient stores throughout Houston, Austin and Dallas. \r\n\r\nOne challenge we now face is meeting the demand for MALK. We are doing our best as a family owned and operated business, but due to the need to produce in larger quantities we have had to hold off on expansion and fulfilling every request . The time has come for MALK to grow. Once funded, we will be able to use this money to purchase the proper equipment and fill any order that comes our way.",
  "There are a lot of variables and challenges opening a bakery/cafe. One of the biggest challenges is location. We have scouted out several locations and we have done our research. We have found several locations where both the community and the cafe will benefit from opening it's doors. Our choice location is Rhinebeck, NY. Time is of the essences. which is why we decided to use Kickstarter. Our target date for opening is ASAP (yesterday).",

Our backup plan is to have the company continue operating even when competition sees the value in our products.  There will be two other divisions of PGI: 1) ERC Corporation which will test other companies products to ensure they are 100% free of harmful chemical to one part in billions and 2) offer  our brand of polymer called Pur-Olyn to companies that want to produce 100% chemical free plastic.\r\nAlternatively, we plan to expand our offering to the healthcare industry which will include items like blood bags, inspection devices, medicine containers and anything made of plastic that should not come in contact with the human or animal body.",

The goal of this project is to get not only our creative works to you, but to get us to you.  \r\n\r\nOnce the project is backed, the hang-ups are pretty simple.  \r\n\r\nThere's always a chance our car could break down on the road, or we get stuck in a snowstorm somewhere on the way.   Regardless. . .we will find a way to make it!!!  \r\n\r\nThe EP is what runs a little more risk.  We are working feverishly to finish the audio portion of the EP production process.

If you come to see us, you can pick up your copy AT THE SHOW!!\r\n\r\nIf you're not in the area, that's ok!   We will mail the prizes right to your door.  This may take a little bit of time, but it will get to you.  Our goal is to have everybody with the EP in hand as soon as possible.  We thank you for your support and want you to be happy!\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a digital copy of the EP, we would be happy to send it to you over the internet!  That way you can get your copy much faster.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to ask us any questions about the project!",
  "While Kickstarter is a wonderful vehicle for creating my first EP, there are always risks involved when it comes to musical endeavors. I'm confident that the risks and challenges will be at a minimum, but they cannot be avoided altogether. The biggest risk we face is time, simply because of how many steps there are to the recording process. Since this project is independent, we are not operating under any major time constraints. Should the process experience delay, it will just take a little extra patience. However, I will do my best to get all of your rewards to you in a timely fashion!",

  "What We Need & What You Get-\r\n\r\nHere's the thing, we cant finish Los Muertos without your help ! We need your support to bring the Lady of the Dead to life! We started filming Los Muertos originally named ICU in the late fall of 2013 and have 1/3 of our film completed (which you can see in our teaser). We created that with minimal funding and have been gaining interest and followers around the world. If passion were money, we'd be fully funded. But art imitates life, and damn it, things cost money! So... we need some. Our $85,000 target is not a lot by Hollywood standards, but it's still going to require many helping hands supporting us with small amounts. We know how hard we all work to make ends meet, so we would never want someone to pledge anything exorbitant. Give whatever you can and if you can't pledge, show us some love on social media! Every little bit helps. Because we cannot finish this film without you, the horror fans, getting involved. \r\n\r\nSocial media has opened so much opportunity and outreach, but we cannot do this alone. If we were able to reach 21,250 people around the world in support and ask them to skip buying just one $4.00 cup of Starbucks to contribute to our film, we would hit our target ! Sounds simple right? It's not. So we have to rely on those of you that do contribute to spread the word and help us motivate others. Nothing is more important than the word of mouth from you, THE HORROR FAN!          \r\n                                 \r\nYou have a powerful voice so please share our movie campaign with others, LIKE our FACEBOOK page and FOLLOW us on TWITTER! \r\n\r\nIn appreciation for you help, we have put together some cool perks for your contributions and will work on adding new ones as we go along, but please check out the ones we are offering now.\r\nThe Impact\r\nBig Hollywood studios are not the only ones that can make great movies. Help us prove that independents like us have earned a seat at the table. Ultimately, the only thing that matters is what you, the fans, think. If it wasn't for you, every movie out there that succeeded wouldn't have. You are the architects of popular culture not Big Studios. Let's take back our movies by making the movies we all wish to see!            \r\n\r\nRisks & Challenges\r\n\r\nOur target goal is entirely for full production costs and solely for the purpose of completing this film. Your contributions and support will help to make a new horror classic come to life! Every little bit helps, even your support in sharing our campaign by visiting our web page and also LIKING and FOLLOWING us on our social media platforms. So please spread the word about Los Muertos to everyone! \r\n\r\nWe will work hard to raise our goal within the next 45 days. All funds will be will be thoughtfully utilized in the best way possible and stretched to its limits.\r\nHow will the money be used?\r\n\r\nWe cant make this movie without a budget, PERIOD! \r\n\r\nWe have 5 areas to cover !!\r\n\r\n1.  30% - Our biggest chunk is obviously crew. We can't get these guys to do anything without waving a little green in front of their eyes. Bringing a KICKASS HORROR will take the efforts of our crew to wear many hats, go without sleep (thank God for coffee!), and effortlessly do what it takes to make this film happen! Our effects, set dressing, makeup/art departments are also in this category and without them we have no magic!!\r\n\r\n2.  25% - Editing is the next expense we will encounter. Since we will shy away from an all CGI platform, we have to depend on the look, feel and sound that a good movie needs. Editing, color correcting, audio and processing is a definite must we cannot skimp on!! \r\n\r\n3.  20% - ACTORS. What will we do without them? Not a damn thing!  Apparently, it's customary to pay and feed these folks? The nerve of some people huh? We need them and we need to feed and buy them ice cream daily. No, but we do have to pay for their skill and talent which brings characters and the story to life. We tried monopoly money, guess it didn't work!\r\n\r\n4.  15% - Seems we cant film like we would like to without permits. Go figure!        But we do need them as well as liability insurance and clearances which falls into this category. The support from local owners of specific locations and businesses for our shoot has been EXTREMELY overwhelming and we've been thrilled that they opened their doors to our production. This all adds to production value and authenticity. Of course location is everything and some do come with a price. So this, too, can be a challenge to consume all our budget. Do I smell favors cooking?\r\n\r\n5.  10% - And last but not least we have PUBLICITY. This little area is what we need to shout out to the media and world that we have arrived damn it ! Yes even social media costs money to be done strategically. Not only social platforms, but shows, festivals and events to promote also need funds. Your continued support in spreading the word about LOS MUERTOS will intensify our efforts even further.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a tremendous POSITIVE NOTE, we have been contacted for distribution already just with our teaser clip and we only have 1/3 of our movie completed. WE ARE JAZZED! HELP US FINISH IT !\r\n\r\nThe bottom line.\r\n\r\nNO sugar coating, just the straight facts. No matter how big or how small the film production company is, obstacles and challenges will arise. The key is to carefully plan a strategy to cover as many possible pitfalls in order to avoid them or correct them. This is why having a production team and mentors behind us with years of experience is priceless. We've helped ourselves even further by hiring really talented actors that have sharpened their craft and bring a wealth of additional support to the table.\r\n\r\nOne of a film's biggest challenges, after financing of course, is production scheduling for both actors and locations. Our writer specifically designed our story with a smaller cast because it allows for greater mobility, less expense and more freedom to adapt our shooting schedules due to availability and other unforeseen issues. The best way to avoid a problem is not to make one. You know, measure twice and cut once!\r\n\r\nBut seriously, we can't finish Los Muertos without actual legal tender and your HELP! So please make it rain... or shower, drizzle, or sprinkle. Even a trickle is immensely appreciated. \r\n\r\nWe will work our hardest to overcome every obstacle, but one of our biggest challenges is immediate -- raising all the financing required to make this film a reality. And this is where you all come in. Your support and word of mouth can make this film fully materialize!\r\nOther Ways You Can Help\r\n\r\nIf contibuting funds is not possible at this moment, there are other very valuable ways to help us out. Help spread the word and awareness about Los Muertos as much as possible. Social media is an amazing asset and you, the horror genre fans, have the power to make a difference.",

The PALM is new, but a working publication, and the goal is equal to our fixed expenses.  \r\n\r\nSummer in South Florida is a time when many businesses simply don't advertise and hunker down for our \"Off-season\", so funding the July issue will not only give us the experience we need to create a Crowd Funding issue, but it will help us get through the financial drought of the South Florida Summer.",

Although I am advertising an expected delivery date of Oct 2015, I am hoping to be able to ship even earlier than that.  I expect to be able to finish shooting and editing images by the end of July.  This will allow me to finish the design phase of the book in August and hopefully have the final version ready to ship in late August or early September.

  "Beyond the inherent risks of the music industry, this is a very low risk project logistically as far as we can tell. We cannot predict how the record will be received overall, but it's a piece of art we very strongly believe in. If it's something you believe in too, we're confident these funds will, at the very least, allow us to help put this record into the world and reach much further than it ever could otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe album is already recorded and basically ready to be released. We've done our homework. We've spent the past few months building a knowledgeable team of people to facilitate this release, and to reduce any foreseeable risk of the funds not achieving their full potential. \r\n\r\nWe have a publicist in place who is ready to begin promotion of the release of the album, a radio promoter on board, and release tour booked. We have a finished album and artwork ready for manufacturing, photographer in place ready to take beautiful photos, and a video artist ready to film and create. We've allowed ample time for executing all of these things prior to our Feb. 25 release date. We have every reason to believe that all of these elements can be accomplished competently and by the deadline of our release date, once they're paid for.",
  "I'm already in the studio working on the songs, so I expect to have it out by February, but sometimes making music seems to take longer than scheduled.

I'm super thankful for all of you that have grabbed the CD's in the past, or came out to shows, or recorded one of my songs for your own record. It's means a lot to me.

I don't need much, but I want to have some good equipment so it makes it more pleasurable for my viewers/audience. I just need some help if there is anybody willing to do that. There have been plenty of challenges in my history of filmmaking and if I were to tell them all to you, we'd be here a while.",
  "Permits may be a challenge, however, If things should arise , then my crew will simply remove any obstacle from the project. Seeing as though I plan on having only a small handful of people in this project, I do not see any of these issues arising.

We are also committed to contributing our own labor - sending emails, licking stamps, stuffing envelopes - to ensure the success of our marketing campaign.",
  "There are a few challenges and problems that I could encounter after this project is successfully funded. Here's how, when within my power, I plan to tackle them:\r\n\r\n\u2013 I could become ill when scheduled to record (I reckon I'll need my voice for that!) - a musician could too. This might delay things about a week or two, depending on when a recording slot is/becomes available for reschedule. I will wrap up warm this winter and try to stay healthy.\r\n\r\n\u2013 As this isn't a do-it-ALL-yourself album and I'll be working with artists, photographers and other musicians, they will have their own schedules too, so, again, there could be slight delays and reschedules here and there. I intend to get everything done before their actual deadlines to minimize the effect of these possible inconveniences.\r\n\r\n\u2013 When recording, mixing and mastering are done, and the artwork is complete, I'll be sending the master off to be replicated and printed, and the packaging to be printed with the artwork. There could be some delays in me receiving these CDs before I release the album, which is out of my hands, and it shouldn't delay the release by too much, if at all. However, if it should happen to affect the release, all that means is the album will hopefully be out in March instead of February.\r\n\r\n\u2013 I am going to be working leading up to and during the Christmas period, so... needless to say, that could definitely throw a spanner in the works. Again, I aim to skirt around this by trying to complete things before their scheduled deadlines.\r\n\r\n\u2013 I already know how exceptionally busy I am going to be from the start of this funding period in November, right the way through to February. The portraits I may be drawing for some of you may take a while... but you will get them!\r\n\r\n\u2013 I am doing this all independent of a label (I actually think this is a perfect opportunity to start my own), which - though I'm really looking forward to it - means there's a lot of work! I'll be labouring diligently in order to fulfil all the necessary tasks, reach the deadlines and get this album out there. Please be patient with me. Thankfully, I've got a bunch of really talented and supportive friends and family to help me with every aspect of this project, give me great advice and encouragement, and... make sure I get enough sleep.\r\n\r\n\u2013 I also cannot overstate how greatly I will need you too. As much as I believe in myself and believe in this album (which is so very much), my belief simply isn't enough - I need yours too. During the funding period, I'll be promoting the campaign and hoping that you'll all jump on board to help spread the word too. But also throughout this whole journey, from here to the very day you get your copies, I'll need your prayers, support and for you to keep me as motivated as you have done in the past. Thank you.",
  "As with any Kickstarter campaign, there is always the chance for delays in production and shipping. I have planned well ahead to give myself plenty of breathing room in the event of delays of complications.\n\nIn addition to this pin campaign, I am working on a large Tarot project through my Patreon as well as a full time Bachelor student. I will be using BackerKit and fulfillment services in order to ensure that neither this campaign nor my Patreon and school work will be negatively affected by the other.",
  "I feel confident about the realisation of the product; I've done a research about the aspects of the project: I've also choosen a pin manifacture, printing studio and the post office.

I'll make updates of every step on the further way.\n\nThe colors on the final pin may appear different than the mock-up designs. The apperance can also influenced by your monitor display settings. I've choosen the Pantone Chart for the colors and in addition black and white. But anyway the colors won't change radically.\n\nThere's always a risk of delayed production times, printing errors and shipment delays. I'll will be sure to keep everyone informed of all changes, if any issues come up.\n\nPlease note: Backers will be responsible for any import taxes of their country or custom fees. Please beware of that, before backing the project. \nThank you for your time and understanding!",
  "Rest assured that I have already done more than one pin before, I have my connections and know which manufacturers to trust and which to avoid. Very common risks in this type of project consists of shipping or manufacturer errors/delays.

  "Our first challenge is to find a suitable commissary kitchen to work from. If we had more funding we'd start our own kitchen but as a stepping stone we plan to rent space in an existing kitchen. We have several leads on kitchens already but so far these are all kitchens that have non-vegan food prepared there. While this is an acceptable plan B for us at this time, we would definitely to find a fully vegan kitchen such as partnering with an existing vegan restaurant that does not offer lunch service or has extra space.\r\n\r\nOur second challenge is logistics, setting up our delivery system. We're still determining whether we will hire our own delivery drivers or use a contracted service. We've contacted several existing delivery services and the challenge is most will only deliver orders received through their websites, whereas we plan to take orders off our own website and need those processed for delivery. \r\n\r\nOn the technical side we face the challenge of making a simple, easy to use interface for ordering. Our website is a Wordpress site with Woocommerce and it will take some custom programming to enable pre-ordering and scheduled deliveries.",
  "The only real risk here is missing out on helping me make the best pizza I've ever had.",
  "This project has been challenging because working with a great producer has added much travel and schedule juggling resulting in greater expense and less income as time has been given to travel and record.  Once this project is completed I am unclear with how to proceed but I am talking with seasoned recording artists and learning so much about how this differs from my experience as a Live performer only.  I do hope to tour the Pacific Northwest when the album is done and share what I believe God has given me.  I don't know who else needs to hear that life is full of unwelcome events and moments ~ but it does not change who God is and what He has in store for you.  I know He has shown me this.  Suffering is what this world offers.  Thank God this isn't all there is.  That's my message.  You can cry.  Then be glad.  In weakness - He is strong.  In tears - comes joy.  Thank You Jesus.",
  "As with any, especially creative project, there are risks and challenges. I have a great crew working to help me accomplish my goal of releasing my debut solo album, Maiden Voyage. But their could be unforeseen obstacles. Perhaps it will take longer to get each song exactly the way we want it. We may be counting on a certain musician to add a fiddle or accordian track, and they could have an emergency that would keep them from keeping their recording date.  Would we move ahead, and just lose the musical vision we had for that artist's contribution?  No, probably not.  We would work them into our schedule, and it could cause the record to be released later than we thought.\r\n\r\nThere could be problems with the actual physical production of the cd.  It could be delivered with technical flaws, and we would have to send it back to fix the problem. \r\n\r\nWe are fully committed to this albums release, and I believe the biggest risk would be that it would be ready later than we hoped.\r\n\r\nAs far as our incentives go, it could be a challenge to schedule your house concert or party at a time that works well for us both.  But as I said before, I am committed and determined to fulfill every promise, and we will find that perfect date for me to perform at your home or wherever you would like.  I am very much looking forward to this aspect of rewarding and thanking my backers for their support. \r\n\r\nThe money raised will go toward the hard costs of making the CD, and paying my marvelous musicians and production crew. And if  we exceed our goal, these dollars will go towards funding a tour to support the record, and for publicity and promotion.",

I will just have to see what level of interaction is required but I can see it bogging me down if I'm giving updates on Kickstarter, the Google documents, and the blog. I will play this by ear and will likely set a schedule for these things. I will maintain the blog updates, which are practically daily, but that's not feasible across the blog, Google docs, and the Kickstarter page. The Kickstarter page and Google docs will become more regulated and will likely be updated once or twice per week.",
  "Risks and challenges are few. There are lots of places that do CD duplication and production and they do great work. I've priced some local and national businesses and have narrowed the choices. I've got a great designer working on the album jacket and I've secured the rights to use a photo by renown photographer Art Shay on the cover. My hope is to keep duplication and production local; I like to keep my money close to home. In short, everyone on the \"team\" knows what they are doing and they've done it before, so the risks are minimal. If we make the goal, we'll have a record.",

However, there are a lot of moving parts with importing. Unplanned or unforeseeable events may delay shipment from our suppliers and in effect delaly delivery of your Crownby Program. \n2) Quality Control. This risk exists anytime a product is outsourced.

However, these pins are being manufactured for me - therefore the production process is outside of my control. Potentially we could hit delays if the manufacturer experiences any issues. Other small issues could be slight changes in linework or color.

We are focusing this year on films in a digital format to reduce the logistical risks involved with a 35mm format. We have also moved forward our close of programme date by one month. (we currently have 80% of feature films confirmed)\r\n2)\tFunding gap: We have started our funding campaign earlier than in previous editions, and of course, Kickstarter should help us fund the festival in advance.\r\n3)\tKey volunteer risk: We have established teams of at least 3 individuals in each key area, allowing us to react quickly if for some rason any member of the team needs to take a break",

Availability of our guest speakers.  We are still scheduling the line up of speakers and have not made any promises as to appearances.  However, we believe our roster of speakers from last year proves our ability to produce an array of stimulating speakers.\r\n\r\nThe major challenge is expanding the audience.  Being in our second year allows us to capitalize on our first year's publicity. In addition to that we plan to purchase ads in local newspapers, online media, and industry trades, and reach out to community and student groups.

We opened The Chromatic Dragon in 2015, and that was 10 times more precarious because of the liquor license.

We've already invested over $50,000 in the project to get this far and one of the things a successful Kickstarter will do, in addition to providing additional funding, obviously, is demonstrate to our investors that there is a market here in Savannah for the type of business that we have planned.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have nearly the perfect team for overcoming this obstacle.  People said a gamer pub would never work.  Not just any people, but people who have made their careers in the Savannah food & beverage industry.  They told us gamers wouldn't come out to a pub.  And they told us the ones who did would not spend any money.  They told us we needed to have ESPN and girls with bikini tops and basically the same thing every other bar has.  But we proved them wrong with The Chromatic Dragon and we want your help to do it again with 8-Bit Donuts.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would be remiss if we didn't mention the very real possibility that Cthulhu, the Great Old One, will awaken from his aeons-long slumber and drive the world into a long, dark age of madness.  But we feel like our team is ready for that challenge, as well.  After all, insane Cthulhu cultists need gourmet donuts and craft coffee, right?  And, with so many tentacles, Cthulhu would probably enjoy playing all of our arcade games at the same time!",
  "The good news is, the landlords accepted our offer for the lease! They were aware of our reputation and keen for us to have the tenancy.

  "Any expedition to remote parts of the world holds an array of risks and challenges. The two largest potential risks for this expedition will be weather concerns and the scarcity of animals in the region. I hope to create shots of multiple wild animals but there is no guarantee that I will find all the subjects I am looking for (polar bears and arctic foxes being some of the more challenging animals to photograph in their natural habitat). The same goes for the Aurora Borealis, another natural phenomena which hopefully will manifest during my time there. With two solid weeks out in the field I feel confident I will be able to meet both of these goals.  Barring any major equipment failures, I should bring back thousands of exposures resulting in a large array of images to choose from.",

  "Challenges ... having a successful Kickstarter campaign! But we have faith that people will help us reach our goal so we can get this program started.  \r\n\r\nLocal community garden clubs that already do straw bale gardening are on board to lend their help and expertise. Students from area colleges and universities will be able to earn credits through internships and practicums, senior centers have agreed to post volunteer opportunities for those individuals that had to give up their gardens when they moved into senior living apartments but who still have a passion for \"playing in the dirt\", scouts can earn badges and so much more. So - we think hands on help won't be a problem.  \r\n\r\nWith the crazy weather that this area is experiencing, a drought and water restrictions are possible this season, but having learned from my Dziadziu (Grandfather in Polish) a garden can grow anywhere (Passaic, NJ) and water falls from the sky - you just have to grab it. So rain water barrels will be used to hydrate the garden as much as possible. Pests, maybe. Sustainable gardening practices will be used and critters like lady bugs will be released.  \r\n\r\nRisks are part of life ... handling them knowledgeably and with respect for all people, plants, animals, and the environment will be first and foremost in our approach. Oh - and the key to addressing risks and challenges is not being afraid to ask for help!",

  "Challenge 1  \r\n\r\nQ: How do you plan to secure a site [in which to host MOPH]?  \r\n\r\nA: We'll start seeking a site to host the event on February 1, 2017.  We're positive that we'll find a place.  Seattle's a big, diverse city with plenty of options.  If we can't secure an interior site, however, we'll consider hosting MOPH outside, which may require a permit [from the city].  Some of your pledges may be used to pay these rental and/or permit costs.  We should have confirmed site information to share with the public by June 30, 2017.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge 2  \r\n\r\nQ: If necessary, how do you plan to get more creatives to submit content?  \r\n\r\nA: Before December 2016, we plan to further promote MOPH outside Seattle by posting flyers and distributing brochures, encouraging creatives to submit their work.  In February 2017, if needed, we may use some of your pledges to target creatives via web, print and/or broadcast advertising.  We plan to accept content until May 1, 2017.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge 3  \r\n\r\nQ: What will you do if you can't run MOPH?  \r\n\r\nA: If, after raising the necessary funds and choosing the content to appear in our film fest, we can't, for whatever reason, host MOPH, all the remaining funds (or pledges) will be held to execute the following year's event.  These [remaining] pledges may be used to fund many of the same things funded in preceding years.   At no point will your pledges be used to fund processes, activities or businesses not related to My Own Private Hollywood.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSince MOPH is a product of 1613 Enterprises, my own company, I have complete control over its execution.",
  "The risks of publishing a photo book include delays in design, pre-press, and print production.

  "One of the biggest challenges prior to opening is getting the funding to open up The Oak House.  So far we have received tremendous support from friends and others interested in seeing the project come to fruition.  We are nearly fully funded and this campaign will provide the funds to get us to the finish line financially.  \r\n\r\nAnother challenge, currently being tackled, is recruiting an excellent team to keep The Oak House running on an ongoing basis. Many have come forward seeking to be involved, and our connections to the university and greater Elon community have helped lead talented, motivated individuals to us.  \r\n\r\nFor our opening just prior to the start of the academic year, our challenge will be pulling it all together for a successful opening.  Ryan's expertise and detail orientation, and Phil's connections and \"make it happen\" skills will be put to the test.  We are confident that those around us committed to our success will be invaluable resources during this time.  \r\n\r\nOnce up and running, we will challenge ourselves to remain committed to our mission and always listening to the Elon community to bring in relevant product based on the tastes of those who frequent The Oak House.",

  "The greatest risk to this project is if one of the negatives becomes damaged and therefore could not be printed. I take great care with my negatives and do everything I can to avoid damage. Otherwise, all of the images have been made and printed before, and the photographic and mounting materials are readily available. The risk is low. \r\n\r\nThe greatest challenge will be to work out all of the Kickstarter and fulfillment logistics the first time through. But I am committed to do this (with a little help from my friends!) and expect that we\u2019ll have happy supporters in the end. That is one of our major goals as there are several other photographic projects planned. \r\n\r\nLastly, all of the money raised for this project will go toward the costs of producing each print. The list includes: \r\n\u2022\tPhotographic paper\r\n\u2022\tDevelopment and processing chemicals\r\n\u2022\tDry mount tissue\r\n\u2022\tMat board \r\n\u2022\tProtective tissue and coverings\r\n\u2022\tPacking materials\r\n\u2022\tShipping & insurance, and\u2026\r\n\u2022\tLots of personal labor on each print\r\n\r\nThere is no expensive equipment to buy, no big non-recurring, one-time costs, and no process discovery of any sort.

  "Mylea is a new material that is still under development. We are aware that there is still room for improvement to reach the highest quality as well as to scale up the production efficiently that might reduce the cost of production in future.\n\nSince we grow the material in-house, it may take a bit more time to set up our to-scale production facility. However, our production facility is ready to grow the leather demand up to 1000 wallet/month.\n\nWhile, as with anything, there can be surprises, we feel confident we can deliver this product on schedule by Fall of 2019. Leading up to delivery date, we will do our absolute best to respond to all of your inquiries as promptly as possible, keep you up to date on our progress, and work as hard as we can to get you your Mylea product as soon as possible.\n\nWe are only responsible for mishandling of product when it is still in our hands & are not responsible for mishandling of item when it is in the hands of the shipping company. If you wish to return the item for a new one, we only accept returns within the one week after you received your product. \n\nThe images and videos of the products and Mylea leather are prototypes \u2014 therefore, slight details may change in actual production.",
  "Basically no risk. We've made pins through this manufacturer before, have confirmed this design to be doable, and have experience shipping out pins! Should be smooth sailing.",
  "I'll be using trusted manufacturers that i've worked with before, but occasionally, minor mistakes can be made, and delays in production can happen. \n\nI will always be upfront with backers along the way. I will disclose any setbacks, delays, and any other pertinent updates.\n\nIt's important to understand that this is a crowdfunded campaign. Crowdfunded campaigns are often subject to delays due to unforeseen circumstances. Please also understand that money pledged to a crowdfunded campaign is a donation or investment. This is not an online store and you will not immediately receive your rewards after pledging.\n\nPlease note that minor changes may occur in production, and that the images presented here are my mock up designs. There is a possibility of slight changes in color and size, but I don't foresee any major issues.\n\nPin Grades\nThe Snarky Company offers two grades of pins, First Grade, and Second Grade. First Grade pins are really the only pins I offer in my online stores, and they are the only ones available for Kickstarter campaigns. Second grade pins are only available through online stores, and currently we're not offering any. Our pins are handmade and they may have minor cosmetic imperfections. \nExamples of expected First Grade imperfections:\nSmall buff marks, scuffs, or scratches on metal/enamel\nSmall specks, pores, or bubbles anywhere on the pin\nSlightly low or uneven fills\nSlightly misaligned screenprinted details (for pins with screenprinting)\nSlight variations in the distribution of giltter\nSlight defects in text (this is usually only in pins with small text)\nWe want to make you aware that these First Grade pins may have small imperfections, but 99% of the time, these imperfections are non-existent or not noticeable. \nAn important note about color and size.\nIt is crucial to understand that while we have made pins before, the pins in this Kickstarter have not yet been manufactured. The designs you see on this page are only mockups, which means the final product may have slight changes in color and size. Taking your two dimensional design, sending it to a manufacturer, and receiving a three dimensional, physical object is difficult. From our experience, the majority of our pins turn out looking like the mockup design. \nThere are so many variables when you see a mockup that you are viewing on your computer or phone. Different computers, phones, or other devices have different screen settings which means we may not all be viewing the same coloration. We use a Pantone Solid Coated book to choose the colors for our designs. The manufacturers use those Pantone numbers to know which colors to mix and apply where, however, looking at a Pantone swatch on paper, is different than looking at a Pantone color in enamel. \nEach mockup has a rough estimate of what the size will be. Our sizes are either specifying the general height of the pin, or width of the pin, however, the actual size of the physical product may vary. \n\nGlitters\nWhen you view a mockup design that has components with glitter, it is crucial to understand how glitter overlays work in Adobe Illustrator. Glitter textures are artificially created in Adobe illustrator. We have glitter textures in various shades for each color, but they come no where near to the hundreds of different glitter colors that manufacturers offer.  The mockup design may show you a section of dark blue glitter, that has flecks of dark blue and silver, however, the physical glitter may contain specs of other shades of blue, green, or silver. When you see a mockup design with glitter, understand that the glitter overlay is to give you an idea of the general color of the glitter, and where it will be on the pin. When a pin has holographic glitter, it will be labeled as holographic glitter. Holographic is what you could call rainbow glitter, each spec of glitter can reflect various different colors. What you should know about holographic glitter is that it reflects different colors depending on the enamel it is placed in. When placed in white enamel, it reflects a shade of light blue, when placed in black enamel it reflects a shade of green. \nRefunds or Exchanges\nAfter the campaign has ended, you will have ample time to make your pin selections in your BackerKit survey. You will be notified before surveys are locked down and any add-ons are charged. Once your order is locked down, we have a no refunds or exchanges policy. The only time we will issue a refund or replacement, is in extenuating circumstances, or if your pin arrives damaged (please read the section on pin grades to determine if your pin is damaged). Examples of damaged pins are, posts that are bent and unusable, posts that may have fallen off, or whole chunks of enamel that are missing. We will also offer refunds or offer to reship an item if it is missing from your order. \nRubber Backs vs. Locking Backs\nEach pin from our campaign will come with rubber backs, but we highly recommend purchasing locking backs. If you choose to adhere your pin to a jacket, bag, or other item, with a rubber back, and it falls off, we will not replace the missing pin. We do offer locking backs through our add-ons section in your survey. \nShipping Policies\nPlease visit the shipping section to read about these policies. \nComments\nMental Illness can be a very intimate and personal topic. Any one who leaves a comment that I determine to be rude, defamatory, or ignorant, will be blocked with no explanation. \nThe Denim Jacket Pledge Level\nIf you pledge for this tier, after the campaign has ended, we provide a sizing chart where you can choose your size. We'll provide 1-3 different options for jackets. We prefer Levi's jackets, but we have other chosen brands that are also great quality. From the options we provide, you'll get to choose which jacket style, color (if that style has color options), and of course your size. For the collector's box you have three options for engraving. You can choose just our Logo, just your name, or you can choose to have the Logo and your name. You'll receive one of each pin, and if that pin has multiple color options, you'll receive one of each color (for example, the Pill pin comes in four colors, you'll get all four). All pins will come on backing cards, with locking backs, and arrive packed in the collector's box. Please be careful when choosing your jacket size, as we cannot provide an exchange or refund if it does not fit. Once your pledge level is locked down (you'll be notified before the lockdown) the pledge level is non-refundable. If any of your items are damaged in transit, we will replace them though. If you purchase this tier as an international backer, we properly fill out all customs forms, but we will not be held responsible if your country loses your package through their mailing service (this means once the package is no longer with the USPS), or if they hold your package and ask for additional VAT, taxes, or fees. You'll also receive any add-on stretch goals that are successfully unlocked. If any add-on stretch goal is not unlocked, it will not come with your order. If you have any questions about this tier, please feel free to reach out.",

Thanks so much for coming on this wild ride with us, y'all. It's going to be amazing!",

  "Risks and challenges would fall into failing to reach the financial goal. If I fail to reach the specified amount, I could attempt to find a cheaper publisher, though it is unlikely I will receive the same opportunities presented from the current publisher I am aiming for. Another issue is political correctness since Native Americans are in the original Peter Pan but are referred to as 'Indians' which is the main identifier for these characters in the original. To remain faithful, I have included the identifier 'Indians', however to avoid offense to anyone, this is merely the group's name and I am going to specify that the nationality of the 'Indians' are not Native American individuals. In relation to this terminology issue, I am open to suggestions on its inclusion and execution.",
  "I've previously successfully run a enamel kickstarter and know the ropes on how to manage things. Risks come mostly with timing and scheduling being pushed back due to manufactorering errors, having to remold pins, holidays that bring delays, or having a high amount of rejects that have to be remade. \n\nOther obstacles come with international shipping and delays that come with customs and passing through borders. International shippers need to make sure to provide all necessary information to get their packages to them.",

Thanks to our first successfull Kickstarter campaign we learned a lot and were able to optimize our processes:\r\n\r\n- We get the movements directly from Sellita\r\n- We receive all components from one supplier (next to the movements)\r\n- We have produced several prototypes and all of them have been\r\n   checked and approved by an independent party\r\n- A multi-stage quality control takes place:\r\n   AQL at the suppliers side\r\n   100% check of all parts when arriving for assembly\r\n   100% check after assembly\r\n   100% check before shipment \r\n\r\nNevertheless it remains a project and delays cannot be excluded.

  "The main challenges of this project are to ensure safe transit of the rewards to their respective address', to ensure the highest chance of success we will be sticking to the steps listed below:\r\n\r\nKickstarter may take up to 21 days after the project ends to transfer funds to Peter.\r\n\r\nOur choice of printers has recently changed to Pinksheep! their product Quality and level of customer service out stripes our previous choice, We plan for the posters to be delivered ready for signing within 7 days of the \"cool down\" period.\r\n\r\nThe delivery of Packaging will take up to 5 days which I would order at the same time as the Posters, meaning the packaging will be here before the posters, allowing us to package them safely once they are signed.\r\n\r\nPosters will be signed & numbered by Peter at a rate of around 10 per day due to Pete suffering from back pain, they will then be dispatched to their correct destinations by myself, Daniel Barber.\r\n\r\nAfter dispatch, most parcels will arrive at there final destinations within 7 days but some may take up to 12.\r\n\r\nThe expected delivery time would be within 46 days of the Project coming to an end, If you do not receive them within 52 days we can discuss the situation and resolve the issue in one of the following ways,\r\n1. Use the tracking info to see where it is exactly.\r\n2. If the parcel has not moved for a day or two we will Contact Royal Mail.\r\n3.

  "I've successfully recorded and released three full orchestral/choral albums in the past, including one that was fully funded by a Kickstarter campaign ('To Shiver the Sky'), so I have a wide range of resources and experience for recording and releasing this album. The album is already slated for release in 2022 via my new record deal with the legendary record label Decca Gold/Universal, so there's no way that this album doesn't get finished. The worst that will happen is that it gets delayed.\n\nOne potential challenge will be the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: at the moment the orchestral sessions are scheduled for February 2022, but that presupposes that the virus is contained well enough such that large recording sessions can take place, and I'm able to get a vaccine and fly to London. We'll keep everyone informed about the outlook, and if necessary, we'll reschedule the sessions and those who pledged to attend them will be given the option of a refund. This may cause delays to the album's release.\n\nI have a good track record with Kickstarter: my last album was the highest grossing classical music Kickstarter ever, and I gave a very thorough behind-the-scenes experience of the creation of the album, from pre-production, to composing, to release, to marketing.

  "There's a lot that goes into making a book happen besides typing on the computer and hitting the send button. The first two novels in the series were published  by two different publishers (in 2008 and 2011), and we are now attempting to get all three in one publishing house. Restoring the copyrights of the first two books to the author so that this transition can happen will, in our case, cost a bit in fees to smooth out the intellectual property wrinkles. In addition, the third book is ready to go to editors (to whom we need to pay a living wage), and the previous books will need an additional edit before republishing by our new publishing home, Hillside Education.\r\n\r\n    This Kickstarter will smooth out all publishing wrinkles with the stroke of a key on your keyboard, providing the needed funding. Your contribution will help us to transfer the rights of all books in the series to the author, and pay for editing necessary to get the third and final book in the series in print. Having full rights to all three novels will do more than just give all three books a common home; Hillside will be able to market and license the YCC brand (Who'd like a Gilbert action figure! C'mon, you know you want one!), and a host of other things. \u2026\r\n\r\n     Well, if you're tired of waiting, and would like a bit of swag and a personal visit from the author thrown in to boot, here's your chance!",

We will also need to pay for venues for our students and tutors to teach reliably within their living area across multiple cities. As well as get in contact with the surrounding schools and places of education in order to set up extra classes for students who require extra help from us.

  "It is difficult to record high-quality audio and video of a live opera without many microphones and cameras, but these tools are expensive.  The balance will be recording budget versus amount of equipment. Smart placement and operation of the cameras and mics will overcome this challenge.\nEditing and mixing these recordings will take time, but I expect to have a finished project within about three months.\nLastly, despite the passion of the small opera community, opera remains relatively unpopular, and often intimidating to outsiders.  I believe in the music and in the story of Role Playing Game, but it will take some creative and aggressive marketing to draw people to the show.  I will be pushing for press coverage, but it is tough to guarantee marketing success for a super-low budget self-produced opera.  Please spread the word about the project to show listeners that opera can be relevant and accessible in 2019!",

A dream of sharing my love of books with the world and putting whole new worlds in others fingertips and providing unique items to make some of the fiction be a real world experience. \r\n\r\nA lot of the risk is the fear, the all or nothing nature of trying to create something successful and the fact that the future is so unknown. \r\n\r\nWhat isn't a risk is my passion. The spinning wheels in my head yelling and screaming at me to go out there and do something to share the love I have in my heart. I know exactly what I want to do. I have done my research, I know what I need to create something incredible. If only because I am creating a service I have wanted to get for myself but never having the funds to afford it.  \r\n\r\nThis business is my beginning. The struggles make the rewards all the more worth it in the end.",
  "The story itself is well-received in terms of creativity with its setting and concept; you could easily look at any online store (amazon, barnes & noble, iTunes, etc.) and understand more of the issues that this story deals with. \r\n\r\nBecause of my commitment, I actually have less free time and resources to work on this story and get it to where it needs to be. While it is becoming easier for me to write a little more often, I still need to work with a professional editor who I met recently. This respective creditable editor has offered a full structural edit. And due to the amount of words counted, this is a big purposed editing project that I wish to do.\r\n\r\nI plan to work my ass hard and making sure that we achieve one goal: re-write this story in a way that doesn't distract the reader from the journey. \r\n\r\nIt's been extremely humbling being constantly reminded of my terrible writing skills distracting a reader from enjoying this story.\r\n\r\nThe $ goal that I placed is what my editor has requested, and I wish to get started as soon as possible. This story was published 5 years ago and the fact that I've struggled to improve/fix the writing, says a lot. I've wanted to do this sooner but I have to put my love ones first with what I earn.\r\n\r\nThus, I humbly ask you to please help me gain enough funds so that I could get this story back on track and bring joy to people. It's been emotionally stressful but I promise that I would take any advantage that I can to make sure that your money isn't wasted. I plan to redeem not just my story but myself, and re-create the start of something special for people to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAny donation that you could offer would help. Hell even just $1 would make me happy knowing that there are people who support and believe in me and my story's potential.\r\n\r\nI am going to be sent on deployment sometime this year and I would hate myself if one of my biggest regrets continued to distrub me while committing to my country. A clear mind helps a sailor, and helps a human being.\r\n\r\nI DO NOT intend to charge people for my E-book; even if I was getting perfect ratings, I refuse to charge the first story in a series that I believe will achieve something and impact the lives of many. It's seflish and egotistic in my opinion and I plan to keep my promise.\r\n\r\nThis editing project should last 6 months. It IS a long time but I agreed with my editor that this was important in order for us to give Rey de Noches a full-nothing held back editing job. All to make sure that I don't disapoint anyone with my writing again...or myself.\r\n\r\nThank you so much.",
  "The challenges of Dignity Music always include finding the *right* musicians for this project: friendly, nonjudgmental, talented and flexible! Some of the \"regulars\" include Ben Dean (violin), Philip Boulanger (cello) and Bethany Wilder (violin / viola); these are wonderful musicians, but also people who enjoy talking with people and connecting to others through music.\nAnother challenge is making sure we are in the right environment to present music. Most conversations are interesting and kind, but aggression and fights can break out and it is important to keep the musicians (and their instruments) feeling safe.",
  "We are eager to get in the studio and begin recording however projecting timelines is difficult. Aligning schedules can be a challenge but we are dedicated to beginning recording before the New Year. \n\nDepending on the amount we are able to raise we may or may not be able to complete the whole album. Many of our donor gifts depend on completing the whole album but we will work each one of you to find solutions in the event we fall short of our funding goals.\n\nWhile we have received overwhelmingly positive interest from record companies that is also a challenge when trying to project timelines. The release of the full album is temporarily marked for a fall 2019 release. Thank you for your patience, understanding and continued support.",
  "The project is straightforward honest, simple, and easy. The hard work is done. We are in execution phase so things are really mechanical at this point. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest risk is that the project is really driven by one person -me.

  "The risks and challenges associated with a project like this are not so much about whether or not we can pull it off - we can, and we have already begun preparing the gallery and framing the artwork - but whether or not we will be able to secure our fundraising target to safeguard the Hellenic Museum's mission to inspire a passion for Hellenic art, history and culture through a variety of exhibitions and education programs.   \r\n\r\nThe risk of not securing our fundraising target will propose the challenge of overcoming loss of funding from our overall Exhibitions and Education Budget, impacting the implementation (or not) of future programs at the Hellenic Museum.",

  "We've weathered the riskiest part of filmmaking: filming! Our talented cast and crew bested mother nature and all of the uncertainties of working on a film set. Now, our post-production is working on transforming our raw art into a professional and absorbing movie. The last challenge is to apply to film festivals. Luckily, your funds help us apply to those festivals and ensure that the film gets the widest possible audience it can.",
  "Shooting for ten days in sub-zero temperatures and sideways blizzards was certainly a challenge. But executing the trailer during the harshest time of year was a huge opportunity to prepare all of us for what it means to make a film in Iceland! We are collaborating with an Icelandic crew who knows exactly what they're up against, and now so do we.\r\n\r\nThe creative team is in place and the principal roles have been cast; the film has taken on a life of its own. Financing will kick the mechanism into gear, and the resources that we secure on Kickstarter are a key step towards making that happen.",
  "This is a double beneficial project. There is a dual purpose for the Test Kitchen. It will be used to conduct classes but also to produce products that are sold to the community, so it will always be put to use in some capacity.",
  "You may be asking, how do I make a profit on something that has an expiration date on the shelves?  I have mastered a shelf life recipe (without using additives or preservatives)!  My secret is that I immediately store my product in air tight plastic containers and I sell them in display freezers at my big box retailers.  My cupcakes can last 30 days this way, and I have little to no waste.  I have proven this theory already by selling them at the Big Box Retailer I currently have a partnership with!  My customers have an understanding that the cupcakes will take a little while to thaw out, or if my local customers want cupcakes they can order them special from me as long as we have it booked in our calendar.\r\n\r\nPatience: \r\n\r\nI have big dreams as Amanda Cupcake and I want to see them all happen (just as you do as my backers).  To grow in a healthy direction, you won't see everything happen overnight.  We must move forward in mini cupcake steps, with intention on building a healthy brand. \u2665  I have already proven through gaining love all over Wisconsin that this is a brand that can grow and make a difference in the world!\r\n\r\n With every growth and change you see happen, you can know that you are a part of it, but I ask for your patience in building Amanda Cupcake.",

I will be able to put my MBA to work as I work on a business plan, options for marketing and expansion plans as well.",

  "A big risk for this residency and my entire trip is working on the road and not being able to finish artwork/murals in time due to lack of materials and the length of my residency. Because I have travelled while working in the past I feel more comfortable to take on this challenge.",
  "The risks and challenges include creating a space in a market that has large and small businesses competing for shelf space in retail outlets. I have a business degree from Stetson University with marketing experience and have researched the industry as well as competitors. I know that my product and business model are original, and that there is a market for these products.\r\n\r\nEveryone needs something to hold that reminds them of a special event. Original art printed on cards and accessories are things that can find a home in an office space or on a cubicle wall. The moments that inspire us to move forward or contemplate an important event includes something that informs our decisions. I will provide a beautiful or poignant representation that will remind or evoke to help take that next step.\r\n\r\nThe commercial space nearby is reasonably priced and on a busy thoroughfare. I am in the process of creating the pricing structure and website that will route traffic to the products. Further, I am looking for an agent to help market and sell the lines commercially to retailers in the region, and for future expansion. Inquire within.\r\n\r\nI have a created the business model and have applied for a fictitious name and tax ID, so moving into a studio and engaging a commercial printer are actions immediately ready for the next step. The growth opportunity in this business is exponential. Future plans include opening boutique franchises in other states.\r\n\r\nRewards will be available within three (3) months of goal attainment for shipment to contributors at the respective reward levels.",
  "I work full time at the moment so the biggest challenge is finding the time to complete this project. I have been realistic about how much I can do and how quickly. I am currently waiting for approval of my application for a stall at the local art market but I can fulfil these obligations even if it is turned down.",
  "As a skilled artist and teacher I feel that I am fully prepared to take on this project with both the artistic skill and outgoing \"people skills\" to draw people into the project and create a following in addition to working with park rangers, ecologists, tourists, and locals.  There are challenges to be faced in traveling alone and camping my way through the 2 - 40 day road trips, but I am well-equipped and knowledgeable in travel and outdoor activities to feel confident in this area. I am already knowledgable in social media networking and website building with two other successful websites and a strong following for each.  The area I will need the most training in is when I get to the publishing portion of the project.",

  "I'm still finishing photoshoots and interviews with the muses that are partaking in this project but I will be done in the coming months.",
  "Working with a volunteer cast and crew means that we don't have as much time to complete this proof of concept short film. Meaning there might be delays caused by the continued need for all involved to work at other jobs. Another risk is that the Kickstarter project does not reach its goal, leaving 100% of the funding to personal income.",
  "The Accidental Beauty of Rural America by Keith May\r\n\r\nA 2001 assignment to photograph the changing face of rural America led me down a rabbit hole of dirt roads and lost highways East to West on a roaring silver Harley. \u201cGo where the wind blows you and let pictures tell the story,\u201d became more than an Editor\u2019s vague direction and the quietly provocative scenes included in \u201cThe Accidental Beauty of Rural America,\u201d prove that the more things change, the more they stay the same. And the best assignments never end.\r\n\r\nThe Carrollton Center for the Arts in beautiful downtown Carrollton, Georgia has asked me to exhibit photos from this endless adventure in their beautiful Galleria in May of 2019 and my Kickstarter will fund the production of approximately 30 new prints to fill 130 feet of wall space that will tell the story and hopefully become a traveling exhibition.\r\n\r\nPrints will be unconventional.

  "The process right from the beginning has been a challenge.  Convincing the \"higher power that be' that a concept of combining a cafe with a motorsports rental business, is not only possible, but profitable, and a huge tourist draw for the local community, has been difficult.  Choosing a location we thought would work, and finding one that was zoned properly were two different things. Every time we took one step ahead, it felt like we took 3 steps backwards. There were times we felt crushed and that his business was not going to be able to move forward. But we persevered!\r\nFast forward to today and here we are; mid-construction! The challenges are not over, but we feel we are moving in a forward direction now! \r\nRunning a profitable restuarant is not easy, especially as a start-up business. Combining a touring and rental company adds another dynamic, that while providing another revenue stream also requires expertise and knowledgeable personnel in this area.\r\nBudget challenges and cash flows are our biggest concerns getting started.  Cora Lea's experience in restaurant management and accounting will prove invaluable as we move forward. She has been working for over the past year on restaurant and cafe comparables, break-even analysis, budgets and cash-flow projections to keep us on track.\r\nJordans experience with people and as an apprentice chef, his motorbike touring, and connections in the motorsports world are all valuable assets. If you've ever visited, you know he makes a mean cup of coffee, and is affectionately known as a \"coffee snob\" around here!\r\nWe know our limitations, and as such we have hired an amazing caf\u00e9 consultant who has helped from the onset and has been integral in layout and flow in the caf\u00e9.  Our construction team has provided amazing insight as well.  We have no fear in asking those who know more than us, to share their knowledge and expertise.\r\n\r\nWe want to keep resources as local as possible. Locally sourced, locally made food, ethical coffee, members of the community working in our caf\u00e9 and touring business.  \r\nOur full-grown kids are fast learning the ways of POS systems and customer service in their individual jobs, and are looking forward to helping us with in the caf\u00e9 as well.

  "This is an extremely ambitious project that we plan to achieve with a bare minimum budget, but what may or may not be apparent is how meticulously \"I'll Be Damned\" has been planned out.  If you support \"I'll Be Damned\", you will be supporting a project that will go above and beyond and (fingers crossed) deliver something extra special.\n\nBut even with years of development, obstacles still get in your way daily on set (even by the minute) but it's our job as filmmakers to think 5 steps ahead and eliminate the problem before they happen.  So many variables had to come together perfectly to achieve our opening scene.  Some of those difficulties included --\n\n1) Convincing an overseas vender to not only rent expensive samurai armor to us on our limited budget, but to also trust the production to take care of it while filming and to ship it back when we were finished (getting armor through customs was no picnic either!)\n\n2) The design, blueprint, 3D modeling and 3D fabrication of an essential prop\n\n3) Period costuming\n\n4) All of the above had to be sized to an out of state actor, through carefully detailed correspondences and photos (and a bit of luck!)\n\n5) Finding and locking down the only 2 locations in state that were not only crucial to pulling off a convincing 17th century Japan, but also being able to work for our story.\n\n6) Period authentic set dressing\n\n7) Combat and ritual training\n\u200b\n8) stunt choreography\n\n9) Hair extensions\n\n10) Dialogue translation (along with actors learning and pronouncing Japanese correctly)\n\n11) Visual effects prep for a smoother running post production\n\n12) Filing down the blade of a sword duplicate to the right measurements to achieve a special effect\n\nI could go on!  But the point is we set out to accomplish our goals and we conquered.  Along with the support from my team.  A team who are all passionate about this project, but equally as important, believe in me as a filmmaker and I desire to give them- and our audience- the best experience and final product possible.\n\nPersonally, I will treat \"I'll Be Damned\"as if its my one and only chance to make a feature; I'm going to pour my soul into it.",

  "There is a possibility that this disc will be a bit controversial. A common refrain among early recording buffs is the wistful sigh, \"You could never get away with playing like that nowadays.\" While the Brahms circle's playing style is no longer in living memory, the oldest of our teachers and colleagues remember being forbidden to take the artistic liberties necessary to play in it. The vivid yet nuanced inflections of timing (rubato) and pitch (portamento) that had a sincere, speechlike quality in the 19th century became associated in the 20th century with flippancy and egotism at best - at worst, with a brazen disrespect for the composer's work. We feel that the 21st century has no need for this prejudice, and that putting the old artistic freedoms back in circulation can give Brahms' music the freshness and vitality that it deserves. Whether we will \"get away with\" it remains to be seen.",

I am asking for the amount that I am asking for because I think it gives me a better chance to accomplish my objectives, more than just trying to make a call here, or do a document there, over the space of many years (which is what a LOT of people try to do).\r\n\r\nYes, this is my first screenplay, but it has been in the works for a long time, and I know the stories about people who have been rejected time and time again before they finally were able to sell and MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY when they finally found someone who believed.\r\n\r\nI am hoping that you BELIEVE!!\r\n\r\nBecause I am going to dig in and \r\nDO IT, \r\nDO IT RIGHT, \r\nand \r\nDO IT RIGHT NOW!\r\n\r\nThank you!!",
  "This fundraiser is \u201call or nothing\u201d - meaning that if I don\u2019t reach my goal of $2500 by the end of the campaign, I don\u2019t receive any of the pledged funds. So please consider donating - no matter how small.  And share with friends, family, and neighbors - everyone loves cake! Thank you x a million \u2764\ufe0f",
  "We recognize that there are many risks and challenges associated with starting a business at any time, let alone during a pandemic. \nSince our renovations rely on permits from the City of Hamilton, we have no control over the timeline of our project completion. Once approved, we have our contractors in place to begin working on the space as soon as possible.\nWe may also face delays sourcing materials and fixtures for the shop, and plan to allow several months of lead time.",
  "There are no real risks in this project for me or the KICKSTARTER community. \r\n\r\nThe challenges would be in making enough paintings to meet the demands but I do have a good start and plenty of material to work with ... thanks to Hurricane Matthew, of course.\r\n\r\nIn my line of business, I have some extra time during the next couple of months.",
  "There are no real challenges to delivering the promised rewards on time as I have already completed all paintings that I have promised as rewards.  I also do not anticipate any problems with completing the postcards and the calendar on time.",
  "Keine Risiken.",
  "The main challenge of this project is knowing what will be produced in the time frame I have set out.  With the holidays quickly approaching, the time frame is a bit more pinched, but this is when I thrive.  I have already reached out to various galleries and creative opportunities, as well as been approached to showcase my work at various vending shows. \r\nThis campaign will allow me to quickly get supplies to set up, the larger quantity of prints to offer, and be able to focus on what I am good at, making that art.",
  "It's a book. With words. Not much risk, so it's definitely worth backing if that's what you're interested in!!",
  "Playing the Music: This would normally be the hard part, but we've put together an A-list lineup including Synergy Vocals. Finding a day when all our first-choice players were free at the same time was a struggle, but we did it. We've played this piece together so many times that Steve says we play it better than he does.\r\n\r\nRecording the Music: We're working with Sound Intermedia, who do the sound for our live shows. They know exactly what they're in for.\r\n\r\nReleasing the Music: We're in discussion with a number of companies to distribute the recording, but we're also completely prepared to self-publish it if that's what's best.",
  "While I've released many records as a founding member of Eighth Blackbird, this is the first time I've done everything myself, and so there are some inherent risks in that. As I mentioned above, I'm navigating numerous costs including mixing, mastering, PR costs, photography, album art, and album production. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, I am firmly committed to bringing this project to life, I have the help of many amazing people and New Amsterdam, and am confident this recording will come out into the world.",
  "We are currently trying to reserve the venue, and If that place we found in Hollywood is taken, we have to find another suitable venue to hold my concert at.",
  "We're hoping to complete this campaign and raise our target during just the month of March, when we celebrate our fourth birthday.  This will mean a campaign period of only 15 days.  However, we will be working consistently during this time to attract pledges from around Australia.",
  "I hope to have the book ready by November 2015 but please understand that life is unpredictable and things change. it could be for the better and be released early though too :)",
  "The only risk that we have projected so far is outgrowing our current location and not having enough computers available . We have partnered with a local computer repair store that will donate 7 desktop computers and 3 tablets once we get the program up and operational.",
  "It will be very difficult for me to create the standard of exhibition expected without your help, the exhibition may end up with quite a retrospective element as I may not be able to afford to by enough canvases and boards to create the work and what work I do create I will need to be precious about. \r\nAlso the exhibition at Python Gallery may not have the greatest impact if I can not pay for a private view. I hope that this exhibition may be a stepping stone to bigger and better exhibitions and projects, and so I am really pushing to make it the best I possibly can.\r\nIf I do not achieve my goal with this funding the exhibition will not happen at Brick lane Gallery, as this is fee based. \r\nThank you again.",
  "Challenges are about getting the timings for the last few states right, and getting it produced in time for August, however, the risks are relatively low as I have most of the images already and could publish with what I have if needed.",
  "This is my third book and second to be published so I am aware of the risks involved. Artwork, editing and interior formatting are all included in the goal as well as fulfillment costs for backer rewards. If the project is fully funded I have no worry about hitting project milestones or fulfilling promises.\r\nThe first book in the series is doing well and I'm excited to publish the second book for fans of the first.\r\nThanks for considering being part of this project!",
  "The risk and challenges of the project is itself time and funding. I planned on self publishing this when the work was complete. But due to unfortunate circumstance I have found plenty of time to work on this project but funding it would not be possible. This mite change but if funded will fully commit to finishing the book on time.",
  "The Manuscript is done; I'm currently working on book 2 because I just couldn't wait any longer. All that really needs to be done is some professional edits, proper formatting.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve done my research and I already have an Editor I want to work with. But there\u2019s always a chance, by the time I have my project funded that they will not be available to work on my book due to how awesome they are at what they do. \r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s all right. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure there are plenty of other awesome editors I could work with. It\u2019s just a matter of choosing which one is the best fit. I\u2019m a man of my word, at least I try to be, so when I say I\u2019m going to do something I always follow through on my end.

  "Small, independent businesses are inherently risky, and we know that. Since our inception in 2017, we've taken each step of our growth journey with caution (and excitement). This big step--opening our parlor--is no different! But our community has been behind us each step of the way and supported us during all of our challenging times, reminding us exactly WHY we do what we do. We are bringing a proper ice cream parlor to the East End because we love making ice cream and seeing your smiles when we hand over your scoop, but even more than that, we want to support a community that has been so supportive of us.",

  "There is always a risk that people say \u201cnah, I love the fake, shallow environment of online dating sooooo much I plan on swiping forever\u201d and we fail to reach enough backers to meet our goal and deliver the wristbands. Aside from that, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re building a rocket propulsion system. We\u2019re confident in our ability to produce the wristbands and have taken all necessary measures to create a realistic timeline. As long as the dating app CEO\u2019s don\u2019t form a secret cartel and hire mercenaries to stomp-out the \u201cGreenlight Movement\u201d then the risk of complications in the project are pretty low. We have a manufacturer ready to ship, a warehouse ready to pick & pack and just need your help to build initial inventory.

  "I am confident the Angel Numbers Jewelry brand will be a success with minimal risk. The most prominent risk would be protecting the brand while simultaneously building it so the vision does not die on the vine! I'm having conversations with the best brand protectors and I predict success. The rewards are on schedule for a timely production and will be received by mid September.",
  "We understand that we risk being compared to other online clothing stores that sell apparel. We also understand that we have to take risks in order to become successful.

  "Like military missions and any big project, there are always potential problems and obstacles.  I will address possible roadblocks and their solutions: \r\n\r\nLate printers, editors, proofreaders or artists      \r\nSolution: Specific deadlines in contracts.  Frequent follow up.\r\nFirst draft of book is complete and has been proofed and edited by  another author, (Caroll Wolverton).  This is my 6th book authored and I have a reliable network of printers (lulu.com, LSI, Createspace), editors, proofreaders and artists. \r\n\r\n\r\nFulfillment slow at shipping out autographed copies world wide.  Solution: Hire an assistant.  Do it myself. Work weekends.\r\n  \r\nDelayed publishing.   \r\nSolution: Final draft is already completed.  Four different Print on Demand companies have been tried and tested from previous experiences and are ready to go. \r\n\r\nComputer break down\r\nSolution: I own a back up desktop and have access to several other computers.\r\n\r\nLack of funding\r\nSolution: Work, save, borrow, persist.",

The logistics and funds required to pull this off are daunting, but we feel it is an appropriate and reachable challenge for us in our tenth year\u2014a fitting tribute to our past decade, and a sign of our ambitions for the next ten. \r\n\r\nOur connections to our communities in Rochester and Lyndon are deep-rooted, and we have confidence in our combined management and performance abilities to create a memorable and rewarding experience for all who participate in the project, whether as performers, audience or community members.",

  "The greatest risks that I expect to encounter is a lack of grant support and exhibition scheduling. If grant support from fine arts organizations isn't obtainable, then I will have to look outward again for individual donations. At that point, I will have an exhibition plan and can provide an itemized budget to see it through. Exhibition scheduling varies from gallery to gallery. Some galleries are booked years in advance. For this reason, I may have to get creative about the space I used for early presentations of the work.  I am prepared to take it one step at a time and be flexible with the options available.",
  "No foreseen risks. And the only challenge would be reaching my funding goal. Producing tintypes is a time honored process. The only innovation I am introducing is a digital projector.",

If the album is picked up and sponsored by a label, we will re-appropriate those funds and put them towards more touring and community engagement.

  "This is a very low risk project, the product is already developed and selling, it's just a matter of scaling up a bit!",
  "I am the sole creator of this project so if I was incapacitated in some way, the project wouldn't get done.",
  "The risk involved would be not raising enough funds within the 30 day funding campaign to fulfill the obligation of associated start-up costs and reproduction of booklets.\r\n     The challenge would be in sending out enough notifications to friends, family and business community in order to reach the funding goal.",
  "There is always the possibility the book will take longer to complete than I anticipated, or I could become injured and not be able to complete it, but this is not likely. \r\n\r\nThere is also the miniscual chance I can not get it published by one of the major companies, but based on current reception this is extremely unlikely.",
  "All the writing is done. The only tricky points I anticipate will be if there is a delay in illustration or printing or shipping, to which I will say, I'll push things forward the best I can.",

  "re risks and challenges. BREAKING THE LIGHT is a challenge to the past history of traditional photography. Our goal is to make this new work known and branded in order for it to be widely exhibited in galleries and museums. See: www.harveylloyd.com. The risks are the difficulties in getting the new art accepted at any time, as happened with modern  painters around the turn of the las century. We must use our funding to brand the work for the art world to accept what is a challenge to the past. With half a century of adventure and journalistic photography around the entire world, I have overcome all challenges. Ivana Lovincic is a lovely, brilliant intuitive artist and photographer who lives in NYC, coined the title BREAKING THE LIGHT, and will make social and art world contacts to aid our branding for collectors, museums and galleries. The work is already at the leading edge of the new art of photography and we will succeed.",

  "Operating a small business, especially in the midst of a global pandemic has been challenging to say the least. \n\nMyself and the small businesses and creatives I work closely with have had to get extremely creative and work twice as hard to survive these last 9 months.\n\nThis project is about collaborating with businesses who deserve to thrive most: those often overlooked, those who face challenges such as racism, homo and transphobia, and other obstacles that stand in the way of our success as entrepreneurs and creatives.\n\nWith better tools and production for Dayum Jam and a space to share our wares with the community and work with other like us to do the same, we can ensure RVA (and beyond!) has access to amazing, creative, locally-made goods!",
  "With every project and every dream, comes obstacles and challenges. The key is perseverance. The time we are living now has added risks. If there is one thing we have learned is how much we need connection and being around family and friends. We would like to take some time to talk about those risks and how we plan to overcome them. \n\n1. COVID-19- is a huge threat to so many different businesses and we understand our situation will be no different. Caf\u00e9 TISTA has a unique opportunity to be set up for success during this global pandemic, as our grounds stretch over a 6-acre farm. Caf\u00e9 TISTA will be able to take the correct preventative COVID-19 protocols. These will help keep staff and customers safe. Caf\u00e9 TISTA will have plenty of outdoor sitting areas and appropriately distanced seating arrangements so that when our customers visit and spend time in our space they will be safe. \n\n2. Timeline: We are planning on opening doors in summer 2021. There are always unforeseen delays when renovating a space. But we are supported by a community of friends and family who will volunteer their time to assist us at every step so that we are ready for opening day. \n\n3. Marketing Risks: We want to make sure that people hear about Caf\u00e9 TISTA. Our dedicated TISTA team in Colombia and the United States will implement marketing strategies to promote our Caf\u00e9 TISTA brand and coffee shop. Our pre-launch sale and our Kickstarter campaign will help us to continue to spread the good word about this unique opportunity for connecting beyond borders, despite a pandemic, all the while enjoying our unique farm-to-cup experience. \n\nThank you for going the extra mile with us. We are so excited to connect with you and have you join our extended Caf\u00e9 TISTA community!",
  "This darn global pandemic has effected almost every aspect of life. Try starting a business with all the uncertainty and changing landscape. Everything takes longer, and normal processes are being reinvented daily. There is ample doubt and uncertainty that any new venture will succeed as small business around the US close their doors. This would deter the weak or faint of heart, but we're committed to press on and deliver all we promise. \n\nWhere many view change with doubt and fear, we at Model Citizen Coffee see opportunity to thrive and succeed. Yes, we are new to small business and the coffee game, but we're excited to engage in this challenge and join the other fearless ones.",
  "We have set an ambitious goal of making a very competitive bid on the dough sheeter on December 14th. Even with the best laid plans, sometimes the unexpected happens. Please bear with us in the event of any delays! Even if we don't get this dough sheeter, the money we raise will be put towards finding the best deal possible on a commercial sheeter! We love Springfield, and are so excited to expand our offerings to our community.",
  "Risks\r\n- Technical quality issues with printing of the book\r\n- Price Increase in book production\r\n- Not enough books to send out as rewards\r\n\r\nI would insure the above risks and challenges are avoided by printing out a single copy of the book from the chosen printing and publishing outlet before bulk producing the product in its entirety.",

  "I don't believe there will be any complications, I love to paint. It might be time consuming, but I have extra time I can spend on this project.\r\nI don't see any challenges coming up after the project is successfully funded, and I hope everything will go smoothly.\r\nThis is my first time creating a project on Kickstarter, and I'm excited to see how it goes.",
  "I hope this campaign has an enthusiastic reception and raises the funds to purchase both the screen printing exposure table AND the much more expensive etching press. But because Kickstarter is an all or nothing model, I've set a low minimum goal to meet at least the cost of the exposure table.\r\n\r\nI'm aware most dreams aren't realized as smoothly as we'd like. In the event Casa X\u00e1tiva doesn't benefit from your invaluable support, don't fear.

  "BevShots has been producing micro-photographs of popular beverages for several years based on the pioneering work of scientist Michael W. Davidson.  We have access to the laboratory and print-house capability to fulfill the project.  \r\n\r\nOnce funded, the most significant risk is that a particular drink might not be amenable to crystallization despite best efforts in the lab.  After all, it is an empirical process subject to the whims of nature.  Further, the chemical complexity of beer makes it relatively more difficult to crystallize properly.  That said, we have been successful with many custom shoots and are confident in the success of the project and that our backers will be pleased with the stunning new images of their favorite micro-brewed beers.",

  "There are no risks. The production of Falling Man (paired with Jeremy Beck\u2019s Blackwater) is scheduled to take place at Symphony Space in New York City on April 29, 2016. The Center for Contemporary Opera has already engaged performers and artisans to create the production.",
  "The only risks are production delays due to error in creation, shipping delays, or misprints. I've worked with this company before for many Kickstarters and I'm satisfied that I'll get frequent updates and a solid product. However there is no risk you won't get the pins you've chosen.\n\nAlso small delays in shipping may happen if we get a huge number of backers, as there are only 2 of us to work on this project.",
  "It's always important to remember that every project involving nature and its ecosystems comes with a multitude of risks and challenges.\n\nJust to remember that it takes the entire lifetime of 12 worker bees to produce a single teaspoon of BlackBee Honey.. Taking that further, to produce 0.5lb (227gr) of Black Bee honey it takes about 30,000 bees travelling 27,500 miles and visiting more than a million flowers just to gather the nectar required.\n\nThat is why any products or results are always a given gift when working with nature.. Every honey jar that we manage to fill is a precious prize to us.\n\nThe main risk involved, would be having a bad season and end up with low honey production... That wont allow us to sell much honey after fulfilled the rewards. This is basically the bigger risk we could face.\n\nAlso another little risk could be to receive a damaged parcel, even if its been carefully wrapped by us, that is why we firmly remind to all backers to write down \"accept with reserve\" on the receipt or tick the relevant box \"with reserve\" when signing.\nOnly like this we can claim against the Courier and try refund any damage that may occurs.\n\nOur big challenge is meet the target and get enough fund to keep on producing our honey and perhaps be able to grow in number our hives.\n\nWe'd like to specify once more time that, when working with bees and with nature in general, there are no real certity of the outcome, and with this pandemic still spreading and devastating, the results of this season's honey production will be even more uncertain. Have said that, we are very confident on a good outcome, but it's always better to prepare for the worst while hope for the best!\n\nThank you.",
  "For the purpose of the Kickstarter campaign I am offering some fine art prints from the development phase of this body of work as a reward to fund the ongoing work with an expected conclusion date of the summer of 2016. Once it is photographed and produced it will be presented to galleries along the West Coast at first, to gain some wider art market exposure with the project and forward my life long career as a photographer. \r\n\r\nSince it will be a time consuming effort to shoot and print the ongoing project, I find it better to offer you some existing fine art print work for your support. Please leave an email if you wish to sign on to the email newsletter/dairy of the ongoing art project and to preview new work as it is in progress. Please make a note of heinzdanzberger.com and the blog will offer you insights in the project as it progress.\r\n\r\nHopefully this offer will take any risk out of the fulfillment for any of your commitments and help to increase the projects appeal to backers and supporters.",
  "Our hope is that we have too many backers and that it may take us a bit longer to fulfill the reward orders.  In all seriousness, this is our first try at crowd funding, but we feel that there is a need in our area for a community darkroom, and with support we will be open for a long time.",

  "We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll overcome any challenge we face, and we\u2019ve already experienced our share of downfalls \u2013 everything from faulty equipment, having to reshoot, or rethinking the overall concept of a photograph; we\u2019ve met every glitch head-on. We also realized that every time something didn\u2019t work out quite the way we expected it to, we took a moment to rethink and recalibrate our ideas to combat the challenges in a way that produced a stronger image and a better result. It\u2019s all about adjusting to the process. In Peru, flexibility is key.\r\n\r\nHaving spent so much time in Lima working on the project already, we know what to expect and what we need to plan ahead before we travel. The availability of certain artist\u2019s materials and some types of photography equipment can be difficult to access in Lima, so we\u2019re partnered with some amazing colleagues and fellow artists here in the U.S. who have let us borrow what we needed ahead of time, providing us the opportunity to bring more things with us. And, if all else fails, FedEx is God!",
  "Every donation helps, as I had mentioned.  While I plan on using the donations for equipment such as lenses, flashes, various camera accessories, etc, your donation helps.  Photographic equipment, such as lenses can be costly.  I plan on using the funds to put towards the equipment, and if I am fortunate enough, purchase equipment with no additional costs besides donations.  \r\n\r\nI will use the donations for my photography journey, and nothing else.",

  "Our goal with this project is to collect 5000 SEK that will help us do the journey. That is about half of the cost for the travel. The rest will be funded by our own private money - as we are pasionated to do this.\r\nIf this project raise more money - we are only grateful.",
  "Other than band member/engineer illness or travel difficulties, we do not foresee any risks involved with this project. Should any of these come to fruition we would move the recording session to early June and still make the delivery deadlines.",
  "You will have to be patient. It may take a few weeks to ship your rewards.",
  "Building a community-run business will be hard, but we can overcome our challenges and it will bring us together. We've already made and canned one batch of our salsa so we know that we can do this.",
  "The risks and challenges we need to overcome include purchasing some much needed equipment, electrical work, and freezers that ranged outside of our initial planned budget.\n\nWe are still in the licensing process with our fabulous city so the only possible hold up would be waiting for the finalization of that licensing in which case we would just move back some of the rewards by a month or two but no later than 2020.  \n\nWe are asking for the bare bones needed amount but any donations past our goal will only help us more with getting our wish list of items as well.",
  "This is a brand new initiative and - as far as we know - has never been been attempted in this way before. \r\n\r\nOne risk we're taking in particular is that we're challenging the very idea of what a classical concert can be and this could alienate as many as it draws. Still, we feel this is a risk worth taking.\r\n\r\nFinally, while many of us have produced, directed or played in an orchestra before, it's our first time Kickstarting and doing something so unorthodox. It's an exciting and scary place to be in at the same time.",
  "The only risk involved may be the occasional trespassing fine and the only challenge will be deciding which city I should explore and document next.",
  "This is a risky project as I don't like to \"ruffle feathers\" it's a hot button subject and I am afraid people will view me in a bad light or do things to make my life more challenging if they don't like my art.  I am also not sure I will find a venue for the art as I have in the past  simply because of the nature of the subject matter.  However I think I can overcome this as well perhaps a gun club or perhaps a show online?  I will have to work out this detail.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of painting the subject to communicate the need for awareness on this subject is of course a challenge as I hope to communicate well so the viewer needs no further explanation then the images.  What images must I create? \r\n\r\n I have been painting for over twenty years; I have shown my art in local arts and crafts shows. I believe I can do this.\r\n\r\nAfter I have created the images and had a show I will distribute the rewards.",
  "The shipping is out my control; however I have not had any major risks as such. I will track the orders till it reaches the rite hands.",
  "Of course, there is the challenge/risk of \"How many copies will I sell?\" As I say in my video about my dream, my Pastor once said, \"If you have a dream that you can accomplish on your own, that dream is not of God.\" God has told me to aim to sell a certain amount of books in a certain time period. It requires a lot of faith. I am believing it WILL happen.\r\n\r\nThe other challenge is dealing with the returned edited manuscript. But that's just perseverance! I wrote 15K words in a single day to finish book one! I can handle pushing through to the end to finish something.\r\n\r\nThe last challenge is finding the right person to pay for illustrations/a cover. I have a last resort through Create Space, but I would rather pay a friend to do it and put their name as the illustrator on my book to advertise their skill as well.",
  "With the majority of this new book already written the risks and challenges are quite minimal.\r\n\r\nA professional editor (www.indiegopublishing.com) has already been selected to edit the book and a professional illustrator (www.danlambertart.com) has been commissioned to create the cover artwork.  Once the project is fully funded the book will be sent to the editor and I expect to publish it some time in November 2014.  That means that the books should be out and in the hands of backers before Christmas.\r\n\r\nWith the experience of five previously self-published novels successfully under my belt I can confidently say that I don't expect there to be any problems or major delays, but of course I will keep everyone up-to-date should anything unexpected occur.",
  "There are abundant risks with any startup company bringing a product to market. Thankfully, we have already gone through a good portion of them. We completed a market test over the last 4 months, selling online on quevos.com and in ten stores around Chicago. The reception Quevos received was fantastic, which is why we are scaling up our manufacturing facility and launching in earnest now. We need your help fronting the costs of a large production run we want to do in May.  If all goes according to plan and we hit our goal in this Kickstarter, we will ship out your rewards in June!\n\nSince we need to buy new packaging equipment and that has a lead time between 3-6 weeks, there could be delays which cause our shipments to arrive at your door in July. But rest assured, if we hit our funding goal we'll go straight into squaring everything away for production and then start manufacturing bags of Quevos by the thousands!",
  "The most essential work is done.  I have 60 minutes worth of first-rate, polished audio.  So we're starting from excellent material.\r\n\r\nDelays sometimes happen in the process of creating a recording.  Even the strongest performances may present difficulties when you try to translate them to a variety of audio formats that will be played on an even wider variety of listening devices.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this is the sixth album that I've been involved in producing.  (It is my first full-length solo album, though!)  I know the potential pitfalls.  This time, I've tried to sidestep them by attending carefully to every step of the process.  I'm also working with seasoned professionals who are way more experienced than I am.\r\n\r\nSo delays may occur, but the final product will be excellent!",
  "Yes, Every Project has it's obstacles, but we also have a Motto: Never Quit, Never Give Up....

  "While programming and performing this sort of concert is a familiar activity (after 50 years, I hope we've learned a thing or two about it!), we've never before attempted to self-present an orchestra concert in New York. There are a host of challenges associated with this, ranging from making sure there are enough stands and chairs onstage to getting enough busy New Yorkers to commit to taking the time from their busy schedules to actually fill the house.\r\n\r\nWe have an excellent team ready to take on these challenges, however, who combine years of experience with presenting and publicizing classical concerts in New York, so we're confident that we can meet the production challenges. And, of course, if you buy tickets pre-sale through this campaign, you're already helping us guarantee a good house, and we're confident that if we can raise the money, 50 years of experience will be put to good use in creating a successful concert.",
  "We managed to mitigate almost all the risks by testing the products before shipping.\nThe Taps have been tested and are in production.",
  "Like other crowdfunding projects, there are some inherent risks that can occur. However, we have prepared carefully and we are confident that our reliable suppliers and manufacturer can help minimize unforeseen problems in the production process.\nOf course, with any new product, there are going to be surprises along the way. One of the beauties of Kickstarter is that we\u2019re inviting you into the process with us, so you\u2019ll get to see how it all works. We\u2019ll be posting lots of updates during the final phases of development and manufacturing and we\u2019re excited to share the journey with you. Thank you for your support and understanding.",

All due diligence will be taken to plan for the foreseeable future and I will have alternate sleeping arrangements as well as equipment to forge ahead in any weather condition. Publishing a book can also be a difficult process, but I have a team of knowledgable people to help me with design and logistics.",
  "Our biggest challenge will be timing. We want to make this Comedy and tell this story as soon as we possibly can, but there may be production delays along the way because of casting and filming permits. \n\n\n\nThis will in turn delay the expected delivery for rewards associated with the film itself. If this does happen, we will be sure to update our backers and be completely transparent. \n\n\nThat all said, based on years of experience with film, television, and documentary production, we are confident we will overcome any obstacles we face.\n\nOur intention is that this film would coincide with the upcoming pilot season 2023.",
  "There are risks to any challenge that you undertake in life.  One of the those that we face in today's climate includes the weather - specifically, floods, whether our location is in Brisbane or in Maryborough.\nAnother big challenge that we face is that most of us are students - we are still learning and mistakes happen while learning, and although we will plan for as many contingencies as possible, we can only do our best.",
  "Como buenos Productores, tenemos el tiempo sobre nosotros, menos cabello y m\u00e1s ojeras.\nEn este hermoso camino vamos a tener posibles desaf\u00edos y retos que sabemos lidiar, c\u00f3mo; que en \u00faltimo minuto nuestros actores nos cambien por un comercial del gobierno, que el equipo de Sonido Directo decida dedicarse a otra cosa o que nuestra comida del rodaje se convierta en Sopa Maruchan. \nTodo esto lo podemos sacar adelante, solo te necesitamos a ti para apoyarnos y darte el riesgo de disfrutar la serie y no moverte de tu asiento",

  "We constantly learn from our previous projects and will always design a Plan B to deal with unexpected changes or situations. However, we understand that there are some circumstances that may be out of our control, such as international issues, pandemics, natural disasters, and so on. We promise that we will communicate with our backers to solve the issues at our most if we encounter such unexpected incidents.\n\nShipment: The estimated delivery time varies from region and cities, especially when rural regions are included. Different national customs regulations may also impact shipping. We will make all of what we can do to seek and select safe and fast logistics lines, but please kindly understand that we have little control over the customs clearance and shipping when the parcel is held by the courier companies. Delay may also happen when the customs officials/couriers couldn't manage to reach out to the recipients.\n\nTax or handling fees: WG will not collect taxes or extra fees from our supporters. We will take precautions in ensuring the shipping items meet the targeted local policies, but the backer is responsible for any duties, handling fees, and/or VAT/GST/Sales tax. As the regulations vary from country to country, we advise customers to reach out to their local customs office for information about the duties and fees to be expected.",

  "Writing a show like \"Grey Area\" can be tricky. With the content we are tackling there is a very fine line between funny and offensive, we are trying to approach every episode with care because even though our show is a comedy we are often talking about very serious subjects. \nOur goal is to address issues that may come up in your thoughts or conversations daily, but you're too nervous to talk about to your friends and family. Our goal is to make Grey Area a safe space to unpack those hard questions, hopefully whilst making you laugh!",

Another challenge is filling all 200 openings. This is the crucial start to a mission that I feel will be a major success. A mission that is immediately scaleable.",
  "I think the biggest challenge is what every one has to face.  Make a recipe for a single serve, have it taste  good and pair it with other items so it is healthy and reasonably priced.",
  "We feel that this is an important project that contributes to the joy people can experience in this extended moment of ... joylessness. Our biggest risk is that we do not receive the funding that we understand as necessary to compensate ourselves for the time spent on this project. That being said, we have had an amazing time together, and our contingency plan is to get these postcards to the people who want them by any means necessary. \n\nShould the kickstarter not be fully funded, our timeline for our larger rewards, the prints, recipe boxes, and custom YCCLA postcards cannot be fulfilled within a close timeframe.",
  "The main risks and challenges are getting the books to print and distributed.  Both books are written, edited, and ready to publish, so that there are minimal risks involved.  I have done careful analysis of costs, and I am confident that the budget will provide for ISBN numbers, publication, e-book submission, and shipping.",

  "My book is more of an educational story which encourages young children to take their Asthma medication, I know this book is not for everyone and my first priority is to get this book out to pediatric clinics and hopefully the American Lung association. With Asthma on the rise I believe my book will provide a fun way for parents to communicate with their children about using their medication. This book would be great in the classroom for understanding inhalers used by someone in their class.",
  "Since this is a digital project, which therefore will not need printing or distribution, and since I am the only artist involved, I don't need a big budget and I can guarantee that every step of the realization is already organized and follows all its course as planned.

  "Logistics & Budgeting:\nEach spice blend recipe requires its own testing and photography, and then another round for the dish that uses the spice blend. The funding structure is a projected estimate to produce a 6\u201d X 9\u201d color soft-bound cookbook. The skinniest version of this book will likely be 0.75\u201d thick and weigh about 1 lb.\n\nI do all my own writing, food photography, graphic design, and indexing, while my husband edits and converts each book into an eBook in exchange for the picture-plate dishes. If delegated to a third-party entity like a book-designer, eBook producer etc, each would cost the project several thousand dollars. For instance, a indexing a single cookbook costs on average $4000+ (after doing it all for six cookbooks, I am not looking to outsource anything). \n\nBy doing it all in-house, I pass on the savings to you, the backer.\n\nBut I can\u2019t do everything. As a small business myself, I am a big proponent of supporting small businesses, and rely on a long-time local vendor to print the book. They have worked with me on all previous books and respect my expectations.\n\nI also use the local USPS postal services for shipping. USPS has further increased prices for 2022, and even a Priority Mail envelope, domestic, will now cost more.\n\nBesides USPS, our printer has also mentioned higher printing costs since early 2021. In general, costs have increased across the board. I can only use my best guess to determine how much this project will cost. \n\nLimitations:\nThis is my 8th Kickstarter campaign. Of prior campaigns, only two were relaunched for the same project (same project, smaller product, trim funding goals). Eventually, all projects were successful. To the best of my knowledge, 99.9% of the backers were happy.\n\nIf we meet or exceed our campaign goal, Masaleydaar would be my SEVENTH cookbook produced entirely through crowdfunding. I am familiar with the pieces of it: the good and bad of a crowdfunding campaign. While 95% of my crowdfunding and production experience has been positive and without hiccups, I know to leave a margin of 5% for unplanned events.  \n\nThings you should know:\nGeneralized Delay: \nWhile I have written, photographed, designed, and shipped cookbooks in as little as 8 months (Crack the Code), as the only person who does the bulk of the work, it is hard on the production quality and is not feasible overall. Additionally, the pandemic has made most schedules moot. I can only project a timeline and do my best to adhere to it. \n\nMissed Communications: \nPlease use a personal email on your Kickstarter account because work-based email addresses are not reliable in the long term. Please adjust your messaging settings (I cannot do it for your account) if you wish to receive fewer project updates. Long-time backers know that I use the project updates to routinely communicate with campaign backers. Some may be pledge-level-specific, others may be public or for all campaign backers. Project updates are typically once a month after the project is funded, and once every two weeks when the book is nearing completion and about to be shipped/e-delivered.\n\nDigital Rewards: \nDue to copyright restrictions, I am unable to provide pdf\u2019s of the book to any backer at any time. Only two versions of eBooks are available \u2013 iBook (Apple devices) and GooglePlay (Android devices). GooglePlay books REQUIRE a _____@gmail.com address. Please update your profile while pledging. Also, please confirm your device compatibility and regional permissions compatibility before pledging. Kindle books are not available. eBooks are not available to backers in China. Project updates will provide a timeline for a one-time use, digital redemption, with an expiry date.  Digital rewards once distributed will not be re-assigned. \n\nDomestic Shipping: \nAs I only ship using USPS through Priority Mail, the tracking numbers are provided if the books are not received within 2 weeks of the shipping-specific project update. \n\nInternational Shipping: \nWhile I cannot offer guarantees on international delivery times as the tracking is not applicable after it leaves US soil, I send out the Customs\u2019 Slip to international backers so that they too can keep a lookout for it. Across six campaigns and 30+ countries, the postal service has lost two books, one was never delivered in China, and another because the Australian backer moved and missed giving a forwarding address.\n\nAdd-ons: \nSpice-kits (advents, samplers) are only available to backers in the domestic USA. Due to customs restrictions these are not available to international backers. My apologies \u2013 I wish I had a better solution to this.\n\nThird-Party Service: \nFor what it is worth, I do not, and have never used a third-party service to fulfill rewards. I don't intend to do that for this campaign either. While third-party services would free up my time, it would also require me to inflate the funding goals over and above budgeting for Kickstarter and shipping. A third-party service also makes room for errors. As there isn\u2019t a production facility or a staff that will handle all the pieces, I hope backers extend their patience during production and later during fulfillment. \n\nSolicitation: \nPlease do not contact me to offer services. In the past I have reported the individual or company that solicits.\n\nI hope that backers recognize that overall success requires a fair measure of being pragmatic and respectful about roles and expectations. \n\nPlease reach out for any clarifications.",
  "The risk is taking too long making the book (especially with the still ongoing pandemic) and my challenge will be to have it ready and published by May or June.\n\nEl riesgo ser\u00e1 tardar mucho haciendo el libro (especialmente con la pandemia) y el desaf\u00edo ser\u00e1 tenerlo listo y publicado para Junio.",
  "We've already shouldered most of the risk: the writing, photos, illustrations and design are all complete, and we've already consulted with the printers and received a prototype copy of the book. It looks really great! All the recipes have been tried, tasted and given an enthusiastic thumbs up. \n\nAll that remains is a final review and the actual print job. We're working with one of Europe's top printers to ensure a truly professional result. \n\nWith the current crisis, the availability and pricing of the quality and environmentally-friendly paper we want to use may cause a minor delay, but we'll do our best to get this beautiful book in your hands as soon as possible and keep you posted of its progress.",
  "With any project, comes the risk that it might fail. I already have a bank of delicious recipes to fill this book, and over the coming months I'll be testing and tweaking them all to perfection.\n\nThe challenge won't be in the cooking or the writing, but in the actual putting together of this book. That's why I'm here asking for your pledges, to pay for professionals to oversee the design of the book.\n\nIf this Kickstarter fails, I'm still committed to producing this recipe book, but it may take a much longer time to fund the project myself and deliver it to the public.",

If you're forcing me to mail this kicking and screaming, it still won't be long after. \n\nYou're not buying a thing on Kickstarter, you're supporting an idea.

  "Covid-19: Though the case numbers for Covid have been brought down significantly in Ontario; we still have to stay on our toes in case there is a last minute change in Government safety guidelines. Until then, we will follow the safety procedures as put in place at Sheridan College as well as the Ontario Government in order to ensure safety and security on-set. \n\nVisual Effects: Given the high-concept nature of this film, it of course, requires a great deal of special effects. We have literal months to spend time realizing the exact image designed for our film, but we are planning on pushing what we have learnt up until this point to create elements that will blow audience members away. \n\nWeather: The story takes place 20 years ago on January 1st. Winter 20 years ago looks a lot different from what Winter looks like now in Ontario unfortunately. We have back-up plans to ensure that we can have a snowy look to our exterior shots, but there is always the possibility that nature will not be on our side. \n\nDog Handling: Though the story is about finding dogs, we have kept their screen-time to a minimum to ensure a healthy work environment for our non-human co-stars. We will have to work hard to get exactly what we want, but we have planned to make sure that what we need is not too demanding from our furry friends.",
  "The challenges we might find with this production will be honestly location related. We have the most idea spot in mind but it does come at a price- a very costly price for us and we truly hope through your support and help that we will  be able to accomplish that goal. \n\nThe second challenge will be covid related. I personally want for the safety of my crew and cast the very best care in terms of covid care. So cleaning products do not come cheap.",

However preliminary inspections support the conclusion that the scan will work.  \r\n\r\nOnce complete the scans and video link will be provided to the backers.

Although we have tried our best to think about and plan for any production that might arise there is always the potential for unforeseen circumstances or for Covid-related issues to hold things up. All that being said, we are fairly confident in our ability to fulfill large orders on time. \n\nTo ensure our timelines is as accurate as possible we are in communication with everyone involved with every step of the jump rope production, that way any issues can be resolved quickly and directly.",
  "we have done everything we can to eliminate all the risks. That is why we have already produced a working prototype that we have been testing the last 8 months.  Working in a time of covid things can sometime be unpredictable. Especially working with factories in other contries and doing shipping. We have tried to find the best and most reliable partners to minimice these challenges.The estimated shipping time starts in September and we will make sure the sequence of shipping will be followed by backer numbers.",

  "Every project has its risks but our funky alien friends are going to do their part to help minimize that, like actually checking the rear-view mirror this time. One of the major possible hurdles is publication delay, especially with the ongoing pandemic. We will do our best to keep our backers up-to-date with our social media and with backer updates. If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to reach us through Kickstarter, email, or social media. Also, want to mention that all our designs here are subject to change and are not final.

  "The smoothness of the light at all angle: difficult to produce them smoothly. Huge challenge on tooling quality and LED Light positioning in the interior.\n\nSpeaker quality: enough space for air to bounce when the speaker vibrate; balance between light spacing and speaker spacing to create the optimum experience for both context in combination.\n\nCarabiner hook: product needs to be light enough to be hanged on the top of your tents, yet still strong enough to hold it still when you want to blast some nice tunes.",
  "We've been developing the SB01 over the last two years through six major prototypes, with a commitment to quality and reliability. With the design and prototyping stages completed, the summer was spent honing production and we are finally ready to begin pre-orders and manufacturing.\n\nThe SB01 is an instrument with a number of custom components, and we have outlined a typical production schedule that allows for any minor challenges that may occur. We are confident our synthesizer can be manufactured to the highest standards and begin shipping to our backers early next Summer.",
  "All our previous projects which were funded were all delivered on time.\n\nFor this project , the final production prototype has been completed and only software improvements are remaining.  We will continue to improve the software as upgrades even after the rewards has been shipped.\n\nPossible risks of delay:\n- Unexpected manufacturing problems during initial production for the 3D case but it have rarely happened. We will ensure that they are found as early as possible to minimize delays",
  "We have meticulously planned out production, manufacturing, and fulfillment. We have sourced materials, identified a manufacturer, and confirmed pricing. The only item that remains is funding.\n\nThere is a possibility that the final product differs slightly from the prototypes and first batch pictures shown in the campaign, but we promise to implement minor changes only if it makes Console Sling objectively better!",
  "The biggest challenge for us has been funding. We've researched the manufacturing processes available as applicable and practical to this product and are confident that the injection molding process will provide the quality, accuracy, and volume necessary for success.  The upfront cost to create the mold is $35,000, but once the mold is made it can produce upwards of 500,000 units before it will need to be replaced.",
  "Risks include retaliation from certain types police officers.",
  "Finding a reasonable printer would be a risk but I have done my research",
  "Compared to our previous Kickstarter projects, this project is the least risky and least challenging (although we are often challenged by being a small staff). We at KVML have put on incredible programs that benefit our attendees, and we know what we are doing when it comes to what our audience wants. We know this because we ask our audience... at the end of programs and in occasional member surveys... we ask you what you like and don't like, and we incorporate your recommendations into our future programs.\n\nKVML has enlisted some of the best and brightest minds locally and nationally to help us put together an incredible year of programming that can be accessed virtually. In some cases, we have worked with these community partners before, and we know what to expect. In other cases, partners are brand new, and we will learn how each other operates. We know that being a good partner means showing common decency.\n\nThere really is no risk to supporting this wonderful year of programming because KVML has already done a great job of planning our programs and putting time into the logistics required to make each event great. We want to touch as many lives as possible with The Good Earth: Vonnegut and the Environment so that many people will learn about caring for our good earth.",
  "All comic content for Love Not Found volume 2 is already completed! The printer has already been lined up and we have worked with them in the past, so we are confident that we will receive good work in return. I have successfully run eight Kickstarter projects, all of which have fulfilled. Two of the book projects were large anthologies that required organizing 20+ creators each. \n\nI always keep my Kickstarter backers up to date on how the project is going, opting for full transparency. If there is anything that will delay the book getting to your hands I will definitely let you know and have the experience to deal with it quickly.",
  "The biggest risk has been done! That was: will we be able to make the book?! And we did! The biggest challenge now is to get enough money together for making a beautiful high quality print. We know the recipes are delicious and correct. We know the pictures are great. The biggest work now is to fine tune the print. This is our first time printing a book, but we are collaborating with a professional book print company to make it as professional and good quality as we can.

  "\"Wait, weren\u2019t you involved with the KickStarter for NeverEnding? Where\u2019s the rewards for THAT campaign?!\"\n\nYes, I\u2019m still involved with NeverEnding. And yes, we\u2019re still fulfilling rewards for that campaign. But that\u2019s separate from THIS campaign, which is being run under my own company, Fantasyville Productions, LLC. NeverEnding is a separate company, who has a team of artists whom I\u2019m leading to fulfill rewards. Those rewards will get fulfilled as quickly as possible.\n\nWith that said, I feel that the rewards for this campaign are distinct enough from NeverEnding\u2019s offerings. I\u2019m comfortable asking you to get The Legend of Jamie Roberts, volume 1 to print because of that.\n\nAlso, since this specific campaign is narrower in scope, the rewards can get fulfilled faster. As I\u2019ve mentioned above, I\u2019ve run successful campaigns for the last 8 years on this platform, and all of those previous projects have been fulfilled.\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s an option to back this campaign and donate copies of this book to my local library. How are you going to make that happen?\"\n\nI\u2019ll admit - this is the first time I\u2019ve made this an option in a campaign. That said, the information I\u2019ll need from you (if you choose this reward option) is the name, address, and/or website of your library. If you have the contact information of the folks who work at your library, that would be even better. If you know who\u2019s in charge of acquiring new books at your library, that\u2019s *chef\u2019s kiss*.\n\nSo why am I charging for copies donated to the library? Because printing is expensive. All I\u2019m asking at this reward level is to offset the cost of printing and shipping these books.\n\n\n\n\u201cOk but WHY is the reward donating two copies of a book? Can\u2019t I just give one?\u201d\n\nSpeaking as a former librarian, libraries would REALLY rather have duplicates, because books can get lost, damaged, stolen, or otherwise unreturned. If a library only has one copy of a book? That sucks. But multiple copies? Yes, please.\n\n\n\n\"But Covid-19 is affecting the post office and the delivery of packages in general. \"\n\nI know.

Another risk is that the manufacturer may be delayed for any number of reasons, as we are still going through a pandemic at this time. This is all a learning process for me, as I am new at selling a product; but I poured many hours into researching how to do so. I hope it all goes smoothly, but these are the risks associated with this project. As a point of reference, I would need 50 backers of the single plush in order to fund the project. If I wanted to fund Kazuya without going out of pocket, I would need around 100 backers.",
  "Making an album can be a slow moving and expensive task.  I began recording this album in May and have been back several times to Mighty Fine Studios in Denver, Colorado. The challenge of finding studio time, working with schedules of musicians and engineers has made this projects timeline expand beyond what I had originally planned.  The plus side of this is I have had time to really workshop the songs and be sure that they are presented in the best and most clear way. But, as studio time extends, expenses extend. Fortunately I have already had plenty of experience in creating, promoting and delivering a quality album, having co-written, produced and promoted every album \"The Burroughs\" have released.

All that's left now is to raise some funds and move ahead with the manufacturing and distribution.\r\n\r\nIf this Kickstarter is successful, we hope to put in our order and begin manufacturing as soon as possible.  Hopefully this means our expected shipping date of June 2019 is ample time to meet the deadline.",
  "\u203bWe do not accept returns or refunds.\n\u203bThere is a chance the design and specifications of the product may change while under development.\n\u203bIf the number of backers exceeds more than expected, the shipping time may be delayed due to the manufacturing process.\n\u203bIn the chance we get more support than expected and the mass production system goes as planned, the sales price might be lowered.\n\u203bSince natural materials are used to make this product, the appearance of the wood grain is different in each piece. Please note that it may slightly differ from the photo.\n\u203bSince this is a crowdfunding product, we ask for your understanding in regards to the information and precautions above before supporting us.

  "- Let's get rid of our skeletons in the closet! - \n\nWe want to achieve maximum precision and quality on the details to make the skeleton \"OSSEUS\" realistic and with perfect posability, with the outmost attention to detail!  \n\nAs with all Kickstarter campaigns, any unplanned issues will be promptly addressed and resolved. \n\nFattel learning curve in design and production has been long and steep, but allowed us to gaing years of experience in this field so we are confident and ready for this new and exciting project. \n\nWe will do our best to reduce production time of the parts/bones, our production is completely from scratch therefore the process may be subject to changes due to unexpected injection molding factory related issues.\n\nThe individual skeleton pieces in ABS-PVC, and other steel structural parts will be produced in China, then assembled in Italy by hand.\n\nNext step is hand painting.  \n\nEventually they are checked one by one and then shipped worldwide.  \n\nWe want to make the production process as transparent as possible and keep you regularly informed on all the steps taken once the production has started, by providing  monthly updates and of course answering your questions.  \n\nOur challenge is to activate a new production line allowing us to distribute our product worldwide while also reducing costs for our customers.  \n\nIf the campaign should exceeds our expectations, we will have the opportunity to undertake our future projects.  \n\n- Female skeleton  \n\n- Horse skeleton  \n\n- Custom dioramas  \n\n- Custom vehicles  \n\n- Creation of custom skeletons related to of movies / comics and video games.  \n\n- Create a comic book about the epic skeleton wars.  \n\nIt all depends on your support for our project, and bond us all by the passion for functional and collectible action figures!",
  "Is there any chance I won\u2019t get my planner in a timely manner?\nNot at all! We signed the agreement with a TOP printer who is ready to print a notebook as soon as the campaign will be finished. The production will take 10-14 days. The terms of delivery depend on how far you are located from Ukraine. We will use the service of UKRPOSHTA to deliver the notebook as much as possible.\n\nHow will you know my shipping information and the quantity Notebook to order?\nOnce the campaign is over, we'll send you a survey so that you can give us your shipping information and amount of Notebook in order (if we reach our stretch goal sum).",

  "The biggest risk of completing our project is failure to secure enough funding. I am starting with a budget that is lower than I would like to secure to make this project all that it can be, but have insured that it is enough to keep us going through January 1, 2015. A lack of funding will have disadvantages and will limit the travel portion of our project and related site visits. However, if we meet our initial goal it will be an amazing experience that is sure to spread Christmas Magic and urge others to do the same with small acts of kindness and little challenges that our blog will share. I have freed up my calendar and I am committed to give this project my full attention.",
  "This Kickstarter Campaign is 30 days and an all-or-nothing platform.

  "As a start-up, we are fully aware of the risks we are facing and have taken pro-active steps to manage and reduce them. Having identified our own strengths and weaknesses, we have teamed up with best-in-class partners wherever we can, in order to have access to appropriate expertise wherever we need it.\r\n\r\nWe have identified the below as our main risk factors, and taken the following steps to eliminate and reduce risk where we can:\r\n\r\nProduction\r\n\r\nThe main concept of our speaker is to deliver superior quality at an unbeatable price. We have chosen to outsource production to a Chinese factory with a long and strong track record of delivering speakers to European markets. The factory was chosen after careful vetting, and we are confident we have made the right selection. Our research revealed that this factory has delivered with error margins down as low as 0,3% (i.e. 3 of 1,000 speakers returned after sales due to errors (this is very good in electronics, where retailers usually accept up to 2%). \r\n\r\nWe intend to keep personnel regularly at the factory once production is up and running to monitor the process and ensure our quality requirements are strictly followed. Sodapop intends to start of production in small batches to ensure we are able to monitor and adjust the production to any unforeseen issues. \r\n\r\nFor larger quantities, we run typical supply chain risk. We've done mass production before and we have existing relationship with the manufacturer, who has years of experience with large volumes and has well established connections with subcontractors for the parts needed in this product. Our factory partner can deliver well in excess of 4 million speakers per year and hence factory capacity is unlikely to become an issue in the near future.\r\n\r\nConcept quality\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure maximum sound performance, we partnered with an experienced acoustician and an industrial design studio to optimize the design and structure of the speaker. Throughout the process, we have tested the prototypes in a professional sound studio. \r\n\r\nFinancing \r\n\r\nRevolving credit facility for orders up to 10,000 units is already in place. If the product proves to be a big success the credit facility would have to be re-negotiated, but we believe the credit facility we already have negotiated, should be sufficient to handle the demand. The company also has the option of having orders shipped by air freight, reducing the time the drawn credit is used and hence can increase the rotation of the credit to handle an increased number of orders.\r\n\r\nLogistics \r\n\r\nTo ensure that the distribution of our speakers will go as smoothly as possible, we have outsourced the logistics to a professional third-party service provider.\r\n\r\nSales \r\n\r\nThis is an ongoing process which will be intensified once the first production batch has arrived. We have tested our speaker with a couple of electronics retailers and received very positive feedback, but most retailers are reluctant to make orders based on prototypes. Still, we have already secured the commitment of one of the leading electronics retailers in Scandinavia, and we believe we have already validated the commercial potential for the product.\r\n\r\nMarketing \r\n\r\nThis is also an ongoing process, where we will make use of the different resources available to us at every step of way.  We are committed to renewing ourselves constantly, staying updated on the latest tools and trends, to get this speaker on top of every potential portable speaker customer\u2019s mind. We also have the advantage of having an in-house team of great creative artists that can produce and deliver any marketing material needed, from in-store graphics, packaging and sales material to commercial videos, webpages, banners and posts for social media marketing.\r\n\r\nPatent rights \r\n\r\nThe company has already secured international patent rights for our speaker under The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) network which consists of 152 countries and states. We are in the process of securing our patent in most of this network with the help of the biggest intellectual property law firm in Norway, also listed as top tier in the world regarding trademark, copyright and patent law.\r\n\r\nLocal taxes \r\n\r\nPlease note that whilst we endeavor to ensure that import taxes and duties are kept to a minimum for territories outside of our warehouse locations, local import taxes and duties may be required to be paid. Sodapop has no control over local customs offices and, as such, cannot be held responsible should you be charged import taxes and duties in addition to your purchase and shipping price. It is always best to check the position in your country beforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n\r\nAll that's left to say is a big THANK YOU! We at Sodapop sincerely appreciate your support of our project and for backing us. May we bring real bass to small speakers together!",
  "\"The Edward Everett Horton DVD Project\" is my NINTH Kickstarter-crowdfunded  project, and all previous projects were successfully completed, and were done so on time or rather close to the expected date, and each went about $1,000 over the funding goal. Those DVD projects have been  well-reviewed in publications such as the NY Times, Sight & Sound, Cinema Crazed, DVDTalk and classic film blogs, and by dozens of Amazon  customers.\n\nThere is always the chance that a scheduling or tech issue, or a  hiccup in the life/schedule of yours truly or someone on the production team may arise during the production of any DVD project, and when that's happened  previously it has only delayed the release by a month or two. The one  exception was on \"When Knighthood\" when, just as things were wrapping up  on production, a reel of nitrate 35mm containing 6 mins of lost footage  turned up; it was worth spending the extra few months getting that  print to the Library of Congress for preservation and scanning in order  to complete the film.\n\nAdditionally, the current pandemic has made guaranteeing the scheduling of just about everything kind of a wild card. I will keep you posted on any shifts in our production schedule as they happen, and beg your patience with all this, as well as with the deliver of your copy of the DVD given the various unknown factors currently inhabiting the USPS and foreign mail services.\n\nI'll keep you updated weekly with my progress, and if there are any  unforeseen delays you'll find out as soon as I know. For background, you  can read all the updates from \"Accidentally Preserved\", \"Musty Suffer\"  and \"Marcel Perez vol 1\" and \"When Knighthood Was in Flower\" and \"The Alice Howell Collection\" and \"The Douglas MacLean Collection\" on their respective Kickstarter pages. You'll find I've kept backers up-to-date  on each DVD's progress on a regular basis, and am still sending news and  updates to backers several months after the project was completed.\n\nI have been the producer of The Silent Clowns Film Series since its inception in 1997 and have seen it through 21 successful years of  year-round shows of classic silent films in NYC as well as a number of  partnerships with different venues, and its becoming a not-for-profit.",
  "The main obstacle that I face is gaining access to the site. I don't know how much access I can have to SpaceX facilities, themselves, though I have been granted access in the past. I can only do my best in that regard. I can promise that I will shoot photos of as much as gets in front of my camera as I can. I have driven many thousands of miles back and forth across Texas and surrounding states, shooting hundreds of photos during weeks-long road trips. I'm used to the challenges of these types of trips. My main weakness is processing the photos once I've returned; it typically takes me months to go through all of them. \r\n\r\nI am collaborating with a partner to start an online space exploration education company. My plan is to use these and other photos as part of our startup. Space exploration is near and dear to our hearts, and this is a unique time in the history of private space exploration. I hope to conduct many trips like this one, to document the state of space exploration.",
  "The biggest risk with any relationship is whether or not the couple will stay together. It'll be quite the change from being on Skype all hours of the night to actually being able to be in the same room, but a welcomed change it will be! Our dedication to each other isn't something we take for granted, and anyone who's ever been in a long-distance relationship can tell you how hard it is at times. We are committed to each other and will work to insure that our love grows stronger every day. Yes, even the days she could kill him for looking at coins for hours. We are in this together, and wouldn't want it any other way.",
  "The truth is that I've never written a book, although I'm gonna hire a designer to help me make the book look good, I'm still gonna be the one who decides what recipes will have as well as other contents. \r\n\r\nMy expectation is to have the Vol. 1 ready by December or early June and, if enough funding is reached, have the Vol. 2 by March.\r\n\r\nSo the risk is taking too long making the book but my challenge will be to have it ready and published by January.",
  "Only potential risks include a later date of album's completion due to production time, availability, etc.",
  "In this digital day and age, even great music often goes unheard. By creating a network of support here on Kickstarter, I am also creating a network of people that will hear my project. Every tier of donation is rewarded with a digital download of the project, and that means brand new ears hearing my brand new music. Hopefully, you will like the music enough to share! At the end of the day, we are only doing this in hopes of touching someone's life the way other musicians have touched ours.",
  "The largest risk would be our funding for the purchase of the building falling through.  We feel quite confident that with Craft3 assisting us, the purchase of the building will happen.  \n\nConstruction costs and timelines can be very tricky to navigate and end up being more than anticipated.  We are working closely with a historic architect local to Ellensburg to help us stay on budget and on the timeframe we'd like to achieve.\n\nWe have already met with City of Ellensburg historic preservation specialists to make sure the building can be restored and we've received the green light from them.  The current owner did a lot of necessary earthquake upgrades after the 2001 Nisqually earthquake so we feel confident we will not hit any structural issues that require major funding to fix.  \n\nA study done for CWU when they were considering purchasing this building showed the theater would be in use over 150 nights per year.  Many other groups have contacted us already, seeking space to rent and venue space for their existing groups.  We feel confident we'd be able to generate a large amount of revenue from renting the facility to for-profit groups and we promise to work with our lender to be able to offer either free or very low cost rental fees for other non-profits.",
  "Every radio is different.\r\n\r\nHundreds, if not thousands of different models of mantel and tabletop radios were produced during the '50s, '60s and '70s. Because we are not using the original electronic components, their variety is not a concern. We have carefully selected a bluetooth amplifier board that is compact enough to fit in any case, with the volume control and power connection on separate wires so that they can be located wherever the case requires. The volume control has a nice universal fitting so that we can generally reuse the original volume knob, while the power connection has been selected to fit unobtrusively where the original power cord exited.\r\n\r\nElectrocution?\r\n\r\nIn the interests of safety we decided to keep high voltages out of our speakers. All speakers are 12V only, powered by a unique USB cable that connects directly to your existing phone charger or USB battery bank*. To make things even safer we've kept soldering to a minimum, and fused the power input on every conversion. By not using any old electronics other than the speaker we mitigate any risks that could occur through old failing electronic components and wiring.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\nWe chose to operate with bluetooth 4.0 connectivity to maximise compatibility. No additional apps or cables needed, just turn on bluetooth on your phone, select the speaker and hit play!\r\n\r\nCompliance\r\n\r\nAustralian Standards compliance is one of the tasks that will be undertaken with the money raised in this campaign, however we are confident that we will pass with flying colours. Our bluetooth module has been FCC tested and our 12V, 8W per channel amplifier is low enough powered that we are advised it should be a walk in the park.",
  "This is an ambitious project but very achievable with enough help. Unlike most film & video Kickstarters, this movie has already been made so the chance of you being able to see this film is extremely high if you back this project. Obviously, COVID-19 is the biggest threat to Wednesday in Space's cinema run at the moment. We believe our current timeline for release is still safe and sensible but we will communicate if government advice changes and our late November premiere has to be pushed back.\n\nWith that said, we hope you're excited as we are to bring this funny film to screens, big and small.",
  "The Covid-19 virus has turned the entire world upside, as we all know. The time frame of production and release of the film will largely depend on where we are in the world in relation to the virus. The plan is to shoot in late September/early October, if the virus situation is way better. If not, we may have to temporarily hold off on the shoot but our intention is to shoot 2 months after the end of the campaign and release the film in spring of 2021.",
  "As with any film production, there are risks and challenges associated to 'Numbleypeg'.\n\nCurrently the biggest risk to production itself is the global Covid-19 pandemic. Should restrictions become stricter in the coming weeks we may need to delay filming, although this will not delay the delivery of backers rewards.\n\nThe film's scope is achievable and realistic, and the shut-down of the global 'studio' industry actually presents an opportunity for indie filmmakers to create.",
  "Once I am finished with the project, I know that my biggest challenge will be to get the blog out and find the publicity.",
  "The biggest challenge I have is not having the  money to go to South Africa. I was accepted last year but did not have the money. This is my last chance to fulfill my dream and I hope I can make enough money to go here!\r\n\r\nIf I have enough money to go to South Africa, with the help of all you, my next challenge would be my camera; it is not an underwater camera but with the equipment sold I can easily turn it into a camera that can produce images underwater when I am in the cage taking pictures of the Great White Sharks.\r\n\r\nAnother risk is that the quality of the pictures might not be what I am hoping for. I hope when I go to Africa in December the water will be crisp and clear and therefore having an awesome environment to document the sharks in.\r\n\r\nSince the weather is flipped from the USA and South Africa, in December it will be summer there. Therefore, I am hoping the weather will not be a problem and will not rain or thunderstorm, causing the production to be postponed a day or so. Since I only have a month to spend in South Africa, I am hoping I can document and photograph as much as I possibly can!",
  "In creating my cook book there are two challenges that I plan on possibly encountering. The first being a personal one. Being an artist has its ups and downs, creativity comes in waves and then leaves you all at once for a few days even. With all my art in the past, I've encountered this mental block, but the thing that helps me power through is having a predetermined plan ahead of time, full of different projects and options. I often start a drawing by having five different options and ideas, so when I get stuck I can go right on to the other and just come back to it later. The same goes for recipe creation. By planning out a whole list of the recipes I want to tackle, if ever I get stuck or frustrated I can go on to another (even if I have to stare at my lumpy caramel for a few seconds to sulk).\r\n\r\nThe second hurdle may come with the publishing. I have currently been talking to a plethora of different publishing companies, I just have yet to commit to one and start the publishing process. I see this happening within the next few weeks, but if for any reason this is not possible, I will self publish the book and still be able to send it to backers.",
  "Aside from restraining myself from eating all the food before taking the photos, there is one element to consider:\r\n\r\nWhile the recipe cards will be printed locally with high quality stock and quick turnaround, the box production will be done oversea. Due to the nature of importation, certain delays may arise during delivery. \r\n\r\nLuckily, the box design development is close to completion once the colour and lid-closure are finalized. As soon as the campaign ends, the manufacturing shall commence, leaving lots of lead time to meet The Recipe Box's distribution deadline.",
  "Starting any new business is not without its risks and challenges. For us, that means we have 4 significant bridges to cross. .\r\n\r\nFinancial sustainability: A real (but perhaps unfounded) concern that we have is that people will simply not show up. The truth is that Fishtown doesn\u2019t have a movie theater currently in operation, and the nearest small theater is in the heart of Center City. This doesn\u2019t give us much to go on as far as what kind of attendance to expect. Keeping that in mind, we designed our budget to be able to survive for on a bare minimum. Filling just 6% of our seats per day will provide enough revenue to cover all of our operating costs for the duration of our lease. This budget also doesn't account for revenue from things like theater rentals, on-screen advertising, concessions or merchandising. We feel that this gives us a great buffer against fluctuations in attendance, and will allow us a great deal of flexibility in finding the most profitable way to operate.\r\n\r\nAcceptance: Fishtown can be a deeply political place, and we\u2019ve already encountered folks who for one reason or another are less than thrilled with the idea of someone opening a movie theater here. One of the unique things about what we are doing is that instead of destroying a Fishtown landmark and replacing it with something new, we\u2019ve found a happy medium, by partnering with a long-term resident we can create something new out of a space that's already here. In time, in we think that those who feel apprehensive about what we intend to do will realize that we\u2019re just another part of why this is such a great place to live.\r\n\r\nRenovation: As inspiring as the Liberty Vintage garage is, a movie theater it is not. The bulk of our costs will be spent transforming this space into Fishtown's only neighborhood cinema. We are confident that with a solid vision, a written plan, and a great general contractor, we can build something enjoyable  and functional.\r\n\r\nLicensing: There is also the issue of licensing films. Before we can (legally) screen a movie publicly, we must get a license to do so from the distributor. We are actively contacting distributors in order to expand our catalog for opening day. Having a great selection on opening day and beyond is extremely important to us. The challenge comes with getting the right films at the right price at the right time in order to give everyone the best experience possible.",
  "The difficulty is the extent of the renovation that needs to take place in order to get us open.  As you can see from the video, a lot of work needs to be done, and it comes with a hefty price tag.  Whereas we feel confident that we can afford the major renovation, it is important to us that the community has the opportunity to share in this historical revitalization.  We also want to stay viable during the renovation, and additional liquid capital will help us do just that.  \r\nTime, unfortunately, is our enemy.  It has taken a long time to fund our project. This is why we feel that an infusion from the Kickstarter community at this juncture will be the blessing we need to help us achieve the next level in our renovation.  \r\nOur team has the tools to make this project a tremendous success.  Each member has their area of expertise, and are dedicated to making this building a thriving part of the Stockyards community.  As we are a multi purpose facility, we have worked hard to build a strong advisory board, a strong team of consultants and a clear plan to bring this building back to life.  With the onset of two of the worst Hurricanes in history, we know that our timeline may extend, materials may increase in cost, and we may have to fill a gap to meet these new challenges.  We believe this small Kickstarter will also help fill that gap.",
  "With all their hard work done to produce their album, they just need that final push, one that comes with its own struggles. One of the unique characteristics of Eight Beat is that not one member studies music. All members are full-time students who major in engineering, computer science, chemistry and business. They simply love to make music and share their love with the world. Due to this it makes the ability of recording, arranging and performing an extra effort, one that they have continued to excel in. While this project is underway, many of the songs need to go through a post production process and some final recordings. The post production involves mixing, editing and when all is right mastering. A concept album featuring only one genre of music is something not normally done in the a cappella world, this project breaks the trend of traditional storybook albums.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith your backing we will fulfill our ultimate goal of releasing the most ambitious goal Eight Beat has ever taken upon. Thanks for your donation, you will not be disappointed!",
  "RISKS ARE LOW\r\n\r\nDigital Amplifier Company has a history of successfully amplifier designs spanning more than 20 years.\r\n\r\nConfidence is very high that we will be able to optimize the MEGAschino Cherry Amplifier board set because the modifications are minimal -- mostly parts placement. We successfully prototyped the boards for our previous Kickstarter project.\r\n\r\nWe are also confident in our ability to successfully develop a 2000W transformer to fit our existing chassis. Countermeasures are in place to accommodate a taller transformer by modifying the chassis lid if necessary. We recently built a 2000W prototype transformer that exceeded maximum internal height by less than 0.5\".  Worst case, we will get as close as possible to 2000W.\r\n\r\nOur customer-first philosophy has led to a growing and loyal customer base, so we expect sufficient participation in this Kickstarter project. We also have a track record of four successfully funded Kickstarter projects. We reached our funding goal on Day 1 of our two most recent Kickstarter projects.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGES\r\n\r\nOur biggest challenges with this project are logistics and timing. This is common for any new product development where the technology is already proven.\r\n\r\nHOW WE WILL USE THE MONEY\r\n\r\nThe funds will be used to design new boards for streamlined assembly and development of a 2000W transformer.\r\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN / TIME LINE\r\n\r\nThe supply chain for the MEGAschino is already established through previous designs and prototyping of the original MEGAschino boards. We are using the Classic Cherry chassis, so wire harnesses, transformers, faceplates, and shipping containers have all been used in production amplifiers for several years.\r\n\r\nThe time line for delivery of the new transformer and board set is approximately 3 months.",
  "We have spent years developing, testing and perfecting this product. The circuit boards have been designed and thoroughly tested, the software has been written and the enclosures + various other hardware related bits have been carefully designed and selected. \r\n\r\nBringing all of these things together is a complicated process. Manufacturer delays can happen from time to time. We have done our best to prepare for possible delays in PCB fabrication, enclosure milling/printing and component shipping.\r\n\r\nWith that said, we are confident that we can deliver a high-quality product that you will love - and most of all we're excited to see what you can do with it!",
  "The artwork in the book has already been created, the book is designed, laid-out, and is ready to be sent to the printer. Products have all been accounted for and I\u2019ve done all the prep, budgeting, and research to complete the project once funded. Although this is my first Kickstarter campaign, this isn\u2019t my first time selling products and fulfilling pre-orders. \nI\u2019m 100% confident and dedicated to getting everyone their books and extras with the upmost quality and care. And I promise to communicate and remain open and transparent about the process, including if any complications do happen do arise. \n\n\nMy goal is to have the book and rewards in backers hands by September 2020, hopefully sooner! (international orders may take a little longer due to customs and overseas shipping); \nThe current COVID pandemic may cause some shipping delays, but my suppliers are otherwise all running well, so as long as we all have that in mind, everything else should run smoothly! I will, of course, continue to monitor this and will remain open and honest if it should impact any production and will make any necessary changes accordingly.  \n\nThere is about a 10 week turnaround on production of the book that includes shipping from overseas. If the project is fully funded, and after payment is received (usually about 2 weeks after a successful Kickstarter ends) I will send everything off to be turned into a book!",

  "The Kickstarter collection is ready to go. We are fully prepared to start production at the end of this campaign in our own facility. We will reach out to every backer when the campaign is over to find out which dress shirt you would like us to send you, as well as basic information like size, fit and address. \n\nWe will also work with our backers hand-in-hand to find out which size and fit is best for you. If, for any reason, the shirt isn't the right size, we have a flexible exchange and return policy. We want to insure that you receive a quality dress shirt that fits you, and that you can proudly wear.\n\nProduction delays can happen, but Wolper team will communicate with backers directly and keep them up to date with any issue happening with their shipments.\n\nOur major challenge is reaching our funding goal. The funds from this campaign will allow us to complete the development of our online tailoring services and expand our product range. A successful campaign will also help us expand our production facility in Tunisia, allowing us to create more job opportunities in the community.",

The only thing that may hold up things is from Archway Publishing whom I asked to check back with me next March to see if I can up with the money.

  "The black and white version of the book has already been written, illustrated, playtested, and formatted, so we're in great shape to start a print run.

If we meet our stretch goal to upgrade to color printing, we'll spend a little time beautifying the color version and then will go to press. \r\n\r\nWe'll be self-publishing this book using a Print on Demand service (CreateSpace, IngramSpark, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe anticipate that fulfillment will go smoothly, as it did for our previous Kickstarter project, but have built slack into the schedule to accommodate any delays in production. \r\n\r\nWe'd love to have the problem of too many backers, since, as with all publishing products, the more orders we get, the more bang from our buck we can get via the printers!",

  "Any project with as many moving parts as the production of a six-episode comedy series is subject to risk. One of our actors could get sick, one of our locations might get damaged, one of our crew members could become unavailable. Still, we have contingency plans for all but the most extreme disasters. (Let's face it -- a Los Angeles earthquake could really mess us up.) But we've got back up cast and crew available. And low-budget filmmaking, by its nature, requires the ability to think on your feet. When we made ANALYSIS PARALYSIS, THE PERFECT WEDDING, RUSSIAN DOLL, and OUT OF BODY, we handled several last minute challenges successfully, and if similar problems arise in MARRIAGE OF INCONVENIENCE, we expect to do the same.",

I wish more could have seen it and that we could have made more after that.\" And they'll sadly know that if it only were for a successful Kickstarter campaign, that the fate of the movie and their lives would have been different.

  "Being an epic tale, our film requires us to go into uncharted waters. From a production standpoint, as the story brings Bilbo and Alex around the country, our team will also venture into new terrains, going to supermarkets, forests, and deserts. Finding these locations, as well as transforming them into what we fully envisioned, will take extensive research and time from our team. Furthermore, we will be taking on another challenge, working with our very first cow.

  "Hearing loops, though a relatively simple technology, can become difficult to install in large commercial settings such as theaters.  The design of the theater and its structure come into play,  A theater's sound system needs to be analyzed to determine if modifications have to be made. Interference of any kind (i.e. from electrical panels) needs to be identified and erradicated to enable the loop to work properly and to produce superior sound quality.  New microphones may need to be purchased and installed near and around the stage.  All of this needs to be done by experienced loop installation professionals.\r\nI have already succesfully coordinated the installation of a loop system into an approximately 300 seat theater in Albany, NY, called the Cap Rep.  Here is a link to a Fox News report that was done at the time of that installation : http://wnyt.tv/6h2g7.   \r\nTheaters need to find the funding to make such installations happen.  Costs for installations vary depending on the facilities being looped.  Estimates for looping range from a few thousand dollars to a few hundred thousand dollars depending on the venue.  I help the theater staff identify funding opportunities within their surrounding communities so such installations do not impede or interfere with their existing production budget.  And the amount of money I have requested will allow me to supplement the theater's loop funding as necessary (i.e. if a sufficient amount of money cannot be secured through grants or other subsidies) to ensure that projects that are started reach completion.",
  "The challenge: \r\nWe need the musical to be indoors.  This allows us to perform year round without the worry of sun, wind and rain.  In order to do this, we need a circus tent which is the largest expense we have.\r\n\r\nThe production size and scale is the next big challenge. We are partnering with some big names in show business to make this happen. Showtex for our stage design, BlackTrax and Performance Audio for some of our lighting effects, and Circus Arts in Byron Bay, Australia who will be training our team in the art of aerial acrobatics.\r\n\r\nWe're not a skit or drama. We're creating a full scale mobile production. Think Cirque Du Soleil with a message of hope.  The simple fact that it's mobile increases the challenge but doesn't make it impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Risk: \r\nThe creative founders behind Help!, Eric and Terry Helmick, have already invested over $100,000 in the project to date. They've purchased a bus for transporting the team, backed the creation and purchase of all the illusions which will be used in the show, and taken the tour on the road throughout the western United States to \"test\" their idea of bringing quality entertainment to community neighborhoods while serving people.\r\n\r\n\"We found that communities were very excited about having Help! come into their towns. Who wouldn't be? We offer an amazing amount of volunteer service hours for just about any need a community has. Furthermore, we bring an epic love story that inspires, is filled with hope, and gives people an opportunity to dream.\"\r\n\r\n                                               E W Helmick, Executive Director and Founder",

  "We all have full time jobs, so while OK|LA has truly become our collective priority, adulting has tried HARD to get in our way. We have refused to let it! We are taking off of work as much as we can, often meeting late at night after work and shooting into the early morning just to be sure we can pump our project out.\n\nOn top of scheduling, we have struggled with securing locations, rewrites, finding cast + crew, finding props + set dressing + lighting with such a tight budget, and more. But hey, that's showbiz, baby! *finger guns*\n\nEvery obstacle we have conquered together has taught us a lesson and made us stronger and smarter filmmakers!",

The beauty of this project is we've been there, we've done that! The major hurdles were overcome in the lead up & during the major shoot. We're not saying it's smooth sailing from here on in, but we're almost at the finish line. Our biggest challenge now is completing post within budget allocations and submission deadlines....EASY!",
  "Risks.\r\n\r\nIf we don't reach our goal, you don't pay a dime. We also don't receive a dime. And then we're left to sell our bodily fluids to science in order to fund this project. Or, I could leave a box of books in my hatchback - as I often do - and someone steals the car, along with the books.\r\n\r\nThe real risks of the project is getting overwhelmed with time and not meeting our deadlines when it comes to our promises to our backers. And of course, the connection to the backers is in every facet of production because without you...there is no production. \r\n\r\nIt's a small book and therefore risks are minimal.",

We already have the Unique Dyslexic Facebook but we need to make people more aware that its there. So far I have had zero budget for Unique Dyslexic Eye podcasts so it limits the footprint.

At times we have to initiate a plan B or C to overcome these challenges.\n\nOur industry experience with concert productions have qualified us to overcome production challenges.

  "We have been enjoying music from several versions of our working prototypes already. They play loud, quality Bluetooth music reliably, so there is minimal risk for developing Ekko for Kickstarter production.

It could take a few iterations to resolve any potential issues in order to streamline the design and process for mass production, but we are committed to getting Ekko shipped into the market and we have the skills to do so. Our working prototype is proof of our skill and commitment to succeed. \r\n\r\nOther risks to consider are shipping costs. To be fair to backers, we will not be charging a blanket rate, but instead will pass on the shipping charges to the backers outside kickstarter. This way those that live closer will not have to overpay. Please contact us for shipping cost estimates with your preferred destination address.\r\n\r\nLastly, California based backers will have to be charged sales tax separately.

  "This is our 7th Kickstarter campaign so we know enough to know that we face some risks and challenges. This same experience will be invaluable in overcoming any challenge we might face. Let's talk through some of the possible challenges.  \n\n1. Transitioning from prototype to full-scale manufacturing. Currently, we have fully functioning prototypes from the same factory that will make our full production run so we anticipate manufacturing to go smoothly. Furthermore, since there is no major tooling required, it mitigates many of the major unknowns. However, full-scale manufacturing is always different than making a small run of prototypes. We have a well-respected manufacturing partner, and they have been responsive to any feedback we've shared.\n\n2. Global supply chains and logistics. This has been an ongoing issue facing many industries over the past year. During our most recent campaign, we experienced increased container shipping costs, slower shipping timelines, and continued risk of lockdowns in countries like China.  There is the risk of additional lock-downs in the countries we manufacture in.  \n\n3. This is a project and we're using Kickstarter to create something new! That means that things such as design, features, accessories, and any/all aspects of the project are fluid and a work in progress! We've done our best to present our project transparently and honestly - and it's our full intention to deliver everything as shown on the campaign page and video. However, as creators, it's ultimately our job to bring the best version of the project to life - both for backers and for us. That means things can change throughout the campaign and after.   \n\nLessons learned from past campaigns:  \n\n1. Keep it simple. This has probably been our #1 biggest lesson learned and one that really impacted our most recent campaign. As a creator, there is always a temptation to try to do everything - add more features, more accessories, more add-ons, more, more, more! This can make for an exciting campaign, but the fun quickly evaporates post-campaign. That's why we've made neon buffalo as minimalist as possible and kept the weight variations to three options. Simple.  \n\n2. Underpromise and overdeliver. We're optimists at heart - it's essential for us as creators to have a positive and hopeful attitude. However, we've learned the need to balance that mentality with realistic expectations. Especially when setting deadlines and communicating with backers.  \n\n3. Communicate more than you think is necessary. We always strive to be transparent and keep our backers updated. However, in our most recent campaign backers seemed to want more communication. We'll communicate more frequently during this campaign.  \n\nWe hope that sharing these risks and challenges gives you more confidence in us: to be honest, transparent, and ultimately bring this project to life in the best way possible. We are excited to get going!",
  "We know that the core of any tech product is in its build quality and performance. Right now N3ptune prototype speakers have been made using 3d printed and machined components. When productions starts parts will be made using injection molding and other different processes which may affect or have a different sound output than our tested N3ptune prototypes. If sound quality or design quality is affected we will re-tool the speaker until we build a premium quality speaker that is of same sound quality or better than our prototypes. This process is not easy nor fast.\r\n\r\nPerformance and build quality is what will separate us from the thousands of different speakers in the market today, so we will test and re-test every component of N3ptune once we get the final prototype from the manufacture and if something does not meet our standard it will have to be re-designed or re-tooled until we fix it and it meets our standard of a premium built speaker.\r\n\r\nManufacturing and delivering a premium line of wireless speakers will not be an easy task but we are confident that we can meet our timeline without sacrificing quality or performance with the finished product.",

It will be all shared in my music, which will be translated through my soul.\nBudgeting will be my biggest challenge. I would have to cover costs for my band, my mixer, my producer, my PR manager, and even more people on my team, like my graphic design team, my marketing team, and my advertising. \nI would like to cover costs for time, for travel, and for special costs like studio equipment.",
  "We've already scripted and cast the next two seasons, so there is little risk that more episodes won't be released, but there could always be unforeseen challenges that prevent it from coming out as soon as we would like. \n\nThe biggest difficultly we've run into is coordinating such a large cast; in the first season it was always a struggle finding a day when everyone was available to shoot. For season 2, we'll be scheduling and shooting far more efficiently, minimizing the number of shots that feature large groups of characters so that we can shoot most things without the full cast being present, and making the most out of it on the days that we do have everyone there.",

Over the past three seasons, I've tried to make as many episodes as possible on a very limited budget. \n\nI love making this podcast and am beyond grateful to all of those who have supported this project thus far via Patreon. However, I've found that it just isn't practical for me to continue making new episodes without more substantial financial support. Going forward, I just won't be able to prioritize the work it takes to produce the show without your help. \n\nThe main risk I can foresee is that a guest expert that has already committed to joining me this season may have to cancel (but we all LOVE talking about gardening, so why would they do that?). This would require me to find a new guest or change the content of that episode. Other than that, I am confident that I will be able to release all of the episodes planned for this season and then begin planning for next year.",
  "We need to get our copyright so no one can steal our name!",
  "Scheduling the production of this show around my work schedule as a freelancer will be my biggest hurdle. I plan on counteracting this by setting plenty of deadlines throughout the show's process. Additional challenges: potentially learning & purchasing new software for sound design as well as purchasing equipment if production runs past May of 2019 (which is the tail end of my equipment rental season). These challenges are lightly accounted for in my budget.",
  "The challenge on this project is in further pushing the creative envelope on radically re-inventing how a content-rich, deeply truthful book on Chefs is physically produced and experienced by the reader. I'm always looking for ways to make information more totally exciting and fresh, and to bring a quiet yet critical humanity to all forms of creative endeavor. \r\n\r\nWe're now at the actual book production phase. There are so many major and minor details and completion expenses with self-publishing it's mind-boggling, and to produce books at this insane level of quality makes it all even more so. But having a project under your own creative control means that you don't have to compromise on content or physical quality, and give people something truly special. This mode of creation leads into a purity that makes the intense work rewarding and thrilling. \r\n\r\nHaving produced Notes From A Kitchen Volumes One and Two, we have extensive knowledge and experience in all aspects of high-quality book production, distribution and shipping.  \r\n\r\nAt this point the primary two-year documentary photography and interview phase is now completed,  with image editing, copyediting and creative book design in full force and actual pages being prepared for press. The dollars from this campaign will go towards producing these beautiful Limited Edition books and if, by chance additional funds are raised, our intention is to add more special creative components into the books, and create launch events with the featured Chefs all across the country!",
  "Timing: The biggest challenge for this project will be keeping the production of our editions on schedule; we want to make sure that the editions reach our readers while the featured ingredients are still in season. This risk is mitigated by our past experience in the publishing world and keeping our first print run to a modest size. \r\n\r\nAssembly: Each Short Stack edition is stitch-bound by hand using a needle and baker\u2019s twine. With thousands of books to bind, we\u2019ll be enlisting the help of readers through a series of bookmaking gatherings, where the featured authors will serve some recipes from their editions and bookbinding guru Jordan McIntyre will teach attendees how to make a book. On top of that, we\u2019ll be hiring a fleet of helping hands to ensure our books are stitched on time.",

I would like to thank you in advance for your patients and I will keep you updated regularly on the process.",

The process takes time, but we will get them to you as soon as humanly possible.",
  "Status of the project: \r\n\r\nWe have a working prototype for both the earplugs and the app. \r\n\r\nWe have worked for months with our manufacturer to produce the injection mold needed to create the silicone part of the earplugs, and it's basically ready for mass production. We are now waiting for different filter samples to test in real live music environment and decide which one is best, and submit for testing and certification. We are working with one of the best testing laboratories in Germany, and they just need us to send them the final samples.\r\n\r\nThe carrying case doesn't need custom mold, and the manufacturing process is very simple once we make the order. \r\n\r\nThe carrying case tray and packaging box for the earplugs has been already produced in mass when we did our proof of concept. We have a few improvements in our new design but we expect our printer to be able to execute without problems as they did last time.\r\n\r\nFor distributors, we still need to design the distributor pack, but it's a standard box that our printer produced in the past for other clients.\r\n\r\nThe app functions properly in both iOS and Android, but since we won't be able to test every model in the market, and every phone might receive slightly different sound signal depending on factors that we can't control, like how old or damaged is your microphone, we need to add a calibration section, so the users can adjust if needed. This is a quite simple implementation though. We have developed apps in the past and we are already approved as developers in both the Apple App Store and in Google Play.\r\n\r\nFor delivery, we are currently working with an award winning warehouse in the UK that will ship internationally in a professional and timely manner. \r\n\r\nRisks:\r\n\r\nWe are aware that the timeline for delivery in December is quite optimistic, but it's possible. We will do our best to deliver before Christmas because EarDial is the perfect present to any music-loving friend. Only if everything goes as expected we will be able to meet this deadline.",

  "For anyone investing in more than one issue at a reduced rate, we would want to make clear that we can only honestly deliver the full set, over the decade, if we sell enough of issues one, then two, three etc., to get us to the next issue, creating a domino effect to the conclusion of the final issue, number 10. If we create something that is compelling and significantly different to anything else out there, which is exciting and fresh (which is our aim!) this won\u2019t, we feel, be a problem. But it\u2019s a risk. \n\nWith the pandemic we are aware this horrible virus might linger or return in a different manifestation. If it did, it would of course be tragic. For INQUE, like everyone else, there could be delays. There is not a strict print deadline for each issue, as long as it\u2019s in its designated year (2021, 2022 etc.), so this isn't a major problem, but could consequently pose a challenge if we ran out of time in any given year. We are however working with printers who have the ability to stay open whilst maintaining safe social distancing.\n\nFurther, a challenge is figuring out how we package a valuable art print in each issue by our guest artist, without it falling out or into the wrong hands (i.e. someone who has not bought the magazine). We don\u2019t want to have each issue shrink-wrapped, so need to resolve this. Also, deciding against having a digital edition, we need to work out how to ensure people know about the magazine online and have the access to pre-order issues.

As theater artists ourselves, we understand what it feels like to constantly be asked to work for free, or for less than we are worth. We are part of an industry that has a vested interest in paying creatives little to nothing, an exploitative practice that has gone on for far too long, making theater, both the creation and practice, accessible only to those with the right resources, funds, and connections.

So the only real challenge is to meet the promised deadlines for shipping backer rewards.\r\n\r\nHere is are some possible scenarios that could delay the shipment of your reward:\r\n#1 - Parts do not arrive on time. In particular, the Vimex pots are not scheduled to arrive until early January. If this order is delayed, which is possible due to the high demand on the manufacturer leading up to the Chinese New Year, production will be delayed accordingly. If this happens, backers will have a choice on whether to receive their rewards on time with Alpha pots or wait for the glass-reinforced Vimex pots.\r\n#2 - Orders of my other products exceed my production capacity, which may slow down overall production. My production schedule priority will go to filling backer rewards, so even if this does happen, it should not cause a lengthy delay.\r\n#3 - January is the first month that my wife returns to work after a few months of maternity leave.

Evan is learning as we go and has been hard at work researching RSS feeds, hosting sites, playing with editing software and making sure that Pilot Co-Pilots! will have everything they need to produce an entertaining 40 minutes of listening per episode, but we're sure there will be some snags. Please feel free to offer any professional advice if you've done this all before!",
  "I've fulfilled 6 previous Kickstarter projects solo, and helped handle shipping for a further 3, so I am rather practiced at this by now, and I know my printer is top-notch and will deliver on time. My fulfilment process is also pretty polished, so I am confident of delivering as quickly as possible. If any problems do occur, I'll be sure to keep backers updated regularly.",
  "The biggest challenge is lack of financial resources. \r\n\r\nI shortened the duration of this project due to the deadline of MAY 18th and there is a 14 day collection period. This would allow me to still have time to book the flight and hotel for the performance and event mixer.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your help!!\r\n\r\nVisit DefiantSuccess.com",
  "The biggest challenge this time around is that we're actually aiming for an amount that would cover the expenses of putting out two issues next year. On one hand, given some of the past kickstarters there have been for fiction anthologies and new zines from people much more hip and cool than us, $5k is peanuts. On the other hand, it would require a significant increase in our existing readership to pull it off.\r\n\r\nThe increased number of backers would mean more copies having to be shipped out, which could either mean more time spent manually entering fulfillment information into Amazon and Lulu or time spent stuffing envelopes. Either way, there's a chance I'll be spending more time than in the past getting orders out to people.\r\n\r\nThe quarterly schedule has been pretty break-neck for us this year. However, I've made certain to get well ahead of the game on issues 9 & 10 so that nothing comes down to the wire. Even if we do get $10k, chances are we'll still go back to semi-annual for 2019. Excess funds will be used to get other projects off the ground as we look into doing more special releases like Wild Stars III.",
  "As Editors, we have found an excellent working partnership that sticks to deadlines, and that above all has a great time producing it together. This foundation will ensure the launch of No.1 as well as the energy and excitement to move straight onto No.2. \r\n\r\nAs an independent publication, our biggest challenge will be in its distribution. For the No.1 we are approaching stockists individually, but with lots of advanced planning and many existing contacts we are well on the way to ensuring it is widely stocked across the U.K. as well as in select stores in Europe and the U.S.A. Your advance sales will go a long way to helping us.\r\n\r\nWith our very trusted designers, Kris and Tom, we have a great working relationship with our printers to ensure excellent quality and expedient delivery.\r\n\r\nKeep track of our progress via www.tintedwindowmag.com and Instagram (@tinted__window).",
  "The biggest challenge we face is, of course, not losing money! Edinburgh Festival is well known for being expensive and huge. Whilst this year it will inevitably be smaller (no international artists), the audiences  will, in turn, be smaller because of social distancing.  We are therefore packing in as many shows as we can - 38 in total over 3 weeks. \nWith regard to the dreaded Coronavirus, we will test regularly and in accordance with the wishes of the venue.",
  "VOOR DE POES Magazine bestaat twee jaar! Doordat we met het magazine (nog) in een aanloopfase verkeren, is er nog geen winstmarge in beeld. Toch, dromers die we zijn, willen we dolgraag dit kookboek voor kat en baas realiseren. Om de kosten enigszins te drukken, vragen we jullie om een bijdrage, zodat we dit unieke kookboek kunnen gaan realiseren. Help jij ons kookboek de winkels in?",
  "After half a year of production Talking Machines has established a reputation for through, unbiased coverage. Because of the success we've had so far, we expect the project to continue through the end of the first season. If we can raise the funds, production pressures of season two will be essentially the same as season one. \r\n\r\nAs long as our scheduling assumptions for reward production are correct we should have all your Talking Machines swag ready for you in time!",
  "My biggest challenge will be producing Bandwagon independently. Finding stories, gathering tape in the field, and editing and mixing episodes on a monthly basis is a tall task. And that doesn't even include promoting the show so that people actually listen! That's why I need your help. Your support makes this possible.",

  "We're working with Make That Thing, who have produced and fulfilled dozens of Kickstarter campaigns. They know what they're doing and will get your books to you safely and quickly!\r\n\r\nSTW has had success with Kickstarter before, and Make That Thing was a major help in making sure everything was delivered smoothly.  This project will be in good hands with them!\r\n\r\nThe general design of the book is complete, so there shouldn't be too many concerns moving forward! In addition, I will be able to devote significant attention this summer to making sure the book is delivered to the printers with more than enough lead-time, so all systems are go!",
  "Our major challenges will stem from the actual production of physical copy of the journal. We have already solicited several submissions for this edition of Echolocation, and have a healthy pile of submissions to read. The actual literary material will, luckily, not be hard to find. Where we may be slowed down are in the design aspects of journal - hence, we've posted a tentative production deadline of April 2018. Depending on how we reach our fundraising goals, we may be able to release in early April.",
  "There shouldn't be many risks still associated with this project. The stories are already selected, and have all been handed in - so that lineup is final. The printing company is on standby. The design/layout team are ready to go. We just need the money to make it work.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, around half the target money will go to the authors, so you know that you're helping support the people who deserve it most. The rest of the money will cover layout, proofreading, printing, postage, as well as all the other goodies we're offering - the postcards, T-shirts, etc. \r\n\r\nDelivery is expected to be December 2017. We see no reason why we can't achieve that - barring an act of God, the rewards should be with you before Christmas.",

  "LOW RISK! Now in our 10th year, we have released 71 issues. So we have an established track record of creating high-quality magazine content. We already have our entire team in place, and we\u2019re running like the proverbial well-oiled machine.\r\n\r\nPlus, there\u2019s a combined 50 years of print experience between our Publisher and Art Director. The only difference with production of the physical magazine is working with an outside partner who will manage printing and shipping the magazines to subscribers.",

I will not let anything rest unless it is as good as it can be, and I plan to bring that same level of dedication to CREATEcast.\r\n\r\nObviously, a podcast such as mine is only as good as its guests. That said, I already have an incredible lineup ready to record and share with the world. Get excited.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, one might be concerned about the frequency of episodes/production. As of right now, my plan is to have episodes airing every two weeks, starting in early May. Regardless of the air date, applicable backer rewards will ship in early June - happy summer!",
  "Can We Deliver?\r\n\r\nWe've been designing and manufacturing high-end audio equipment for more than 35 years. We know what it takes to make a vision come to life, and we will do our best to deliver your AxiomAir on time and to spec.\r\n\r\nAlthough we've spent over 3 years in development, there are always unforeseen difficulties that may arise. There could be unexpected issues with the software that would result in updates happening after the product has shipped. (Requiring you to update the speaker from the interface.) There could be delays with component supplies or delivery that delay the project overall.  We pledge to keep you apprised of any unforeseen issues through regular updates.",
  "We know great quality is hard to find, and with this project we cannot afford having bad quality components. That\u2019s why we will manufacture it in UK to ensure only the best materials are being used. Any hardware project is a challenge so producing and shipping OnBlink out into the world won't be easy. We've spent considerable time assessing the potential risks, such as delays in component sourcing, issues with the process compatibility testing or fulfilment. Through understanding these processes we have strategies in place to keep the the project on time. Therefore we're confident that when we will face the challenges that inevitably come our way, we will be prepared to tackle them head on.\r\n\r\nThe reason we are shipping units in a small initial batch and a second larger one is so that we can ensure the highest quality for our backers. Assembling and shipping the first batch means we can ensure all the parts meet our spec and so we can make changes to manufacturing processes. We are confident that this is the best way to get the products to you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSince QA is such a major focus for us, we\u2019ll be testing components and subassemblies multiple times during the assembly process. Although this adds a little bit of time, it also ensures a robust product that can withstand you putting it through its paces for many years.",
  "As with any manufacture there are inherit risks. We have planned meticulously and have secured a supply chain as well as a trusted manufacturer. However there is the possibility that there may be issues with tooling or other unforeseen issues that may delay delivery.",

  "Every movie project carries with it a great assortment of risks. With so many variables in the post-production and distribution processes, the only certainty in filmmaking is that things will go wrong. Solving problems, then, is an essential part of the process.\r\n\r\nThe producers of All Sorts have over 30 years of collective experience in filmmaking and have encountered, and overcome, many difficulties. Now that principal photography is complete, our largest risks are already behind us.\r\n\r\nOur biggest challenge now is getting the movie completed and seen by as many people as possible. This can be overcome by clever and persistent promotion, generating buzz via social media, building a fan base, and getting the movie out on the festival circuit. We have already enjoyed a lot of early press and social recognition during filming in WA state, and have fed the momentum by sharing clips, stills and behind the scenes interviews on our website and social media platforms. This Kickstarter campaign will help us move All Sorts onward and upward!\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time and for supporting Independent Filmmaking!",
  "The biggest risk for any comedy is for people to actually find it funny. We all know that terrible feeling you get when you try to make a joke and no one laughs. That is why we've taken time over the last few years to make a vast number of comedy sketches. These projects taught us the many pitfalls and challenges that come with comedy. \r\n\r\nWe've learned that the writing, an actor's performance, and comedic timing are all major influences on whether or not a joke is well received. That's why we've spent over a year working on our script, going through multiple re-writes and beta readers to ensure our script is full of both humor and depth. We fully believe that each actor that has joined our team will be able to deliver an outstanding performance for their character, and we will work hard, both on location and in the editing room, to best showcase their performances visually and through comedic timing.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we face is going to be standing out amidst all of the other video content that can be found out there today. We know that we can settle for nothing less than complete excellence in every aspect of the show. A few things we feel we have in our favor is a very unique concept, a good script, and an outstanding cast.",

All of the people involved in creating Tour de Lovecraft are experienced participants in the crowdfunding process. We have our manufacturing partners in place, and a reasonable timeline in which to create and deliver all the rewards from this campaign. The majority of the essays for Tour de Lovecraft : The Destinations have been written already.

I have allotted myself cushion in terms of the time it takes to get things done. If for for some reason the timeline changes I will notify you. \r\n\r\nThe album is done. I have researched merchandise and publicity firms. I have directors, designers, promoters, actors and videographers ready to create magic. \r\n\r\nThere will always be fear in my line of creativity, but I feel that nerves are healthy and proof that we are alive. It is also more important to me to try rather to give up before I give myself a chance to start.",

  "There can be production challenges associated with any manufacturing project (supply chain issues, delays, equipment failure, theft, etc.), but we've been through this many times before and have a lot of confidence in our ability to fulfill this campaign in a timely fashion. We have built a strong working relationship with our foundry and are supremely confident in their ability to meet any level of demand.\n\nA unique challenge for us is that molds wear out over time. We have a lot of experience in jewelry design and metal casting, and we know how to plan for this. As many people have discovered, 3D scanning, design, and printing all require expertise. We are veteran users of these technologies and have worked in many high-stress situations to develop great products.",

  "We've already made 4 hilarious episodes of our series. We have an incredible crew and team assembled and they're ready to get started making more Room actors magic! The making of the show won't be difficult. We have the scripts finished and we just need the funds. \r\n\r\nWe discovered after our last Kickstarter campaign that we offered too many varied rewards and fulfillment of these on a very tight budget was costly and tough. I modeled our previous campaign on Reading Rainbow and Veronica Mars! But they made millions and millions of $$. And we made $30k. So offering the same rewards they did was unrealistic (although kudos to us for aiming high - haha!). We pared it down this time and are keeping it simpler. \r\n\r\nI already have the posters (signed and unsigned), T-shirts, mugs, artwork, DVDs and Bonus materials ready to go, so all we need to do is send it out! Last time, I needed to design and manufacture all of it!!! We are sitting pretty this go around. Thank you for joining our team and helping to make this hilarious series!",
  "As student filmmakers, finding the most cost-efficient and effective resources to implement in our film is not an easy task to come by and can be quite difficult when dealing with certain filmmaking elements such as budgeting, casting, and set designing. Most of the time, our funds come out of pocket to make up for the remaining budgeting costs we couldn't fully obtain. These funds can be quite expensive for us to donate ourselves when working with a lot of these different film dynamics.\r\n\r\nWe hope that through this Kickstarter we can fully fund this film in its entirety, including any screenings and festivals we'd like to submit to, and that our efforts in creating it will reflect your confidence in our cinematic pursuits with your generous funds.",

I plan to utilize all social media outlets to promote the mixtape and I hope to do interviews with local podcasts or YouTube music reviewers. As I began to record songs for the mixtape, I'll be thinking about ideas for promotional videos and cover art for individual songs. I will have to find someone with the talent and resources to help make this possible. Currently, I am looking for a female R&B vocalist to help me record my more soulful tracks.",

  "Every project takes twice as long as originally planned, and costs twice as much. This is why this kickstarter campaign covers only the professional services we can outsource. \r\n\r\nWe don't need to outsource the baking. Both Scott and I are competent home bakers, and we have a number of chef friends who are not only enthusiastic cookie recipients and reviewers, but who had also given us a word of advice when we needed it. \r\n\r\nWe don't need to outsource the publishing, because both of us are published authors and I have been publishing my our books through my own imprint, Mugen Press. \r\n\r\nWe don't even need to pay for all the butter, nuts and sugar we've gone through over the years. Those are sunk costs we invested out of love.\r\n\r\nFormatting a genre paranormal book, or even an illustrated anthology, is much easier than doing a good job on graphic design of both the interior and the book cover. For this reason, Chuck Beard, the designer responsible for Pittsburgh Magazine, generously offered to be part of this project. \r\n\r\nNo matter how much better the phone cameras have become, nothing can replace the quality equipment and especially the experienced eye of a professional food photographer. Laura Petrilla shoots lovely images of food for local restaurants as well as food magazines, and she takes stunning portraits of the chefs while she is at it. We are lucky to have her playful creativity.\r\n\r\nMiranda Pavelle, a professional animator, is our videographer. If you see anything animated, it was she who decided to play. \r\n\r\nThe cookbook will be ready in e-book format this spring. If there are any delays on the e-book delivery, I will let you know. The printed format always takes a bit longer, and we are have our secret internal deadlines to make sure you get the book in your hands well ahead of the book launch party. If you bring it, you can have it autographed by the whole team.\r\n\r\nSending out tins of cookies is what we always do, and those of you who donated at a level where you will receive a shipment, your tin will be the same as what we like to send our relatives and friends. \r\n\r\nAgain, in case of unexpected delays, you will be notified. \r\n\r\nWe will send out notices of milestones being met, of bloopers that happened (Hey... did you know that liquid smoke looks just like vanilla when not properly labeled?), and you just might land a surprise cookie story in your inbox. Or a lone, interesting recipe!\r\n\r\nWe will keep in touch. Thank you so much for your support!",

  "There have been many challenges in the past when it came to designing pedals and getting from idea to a physical working model. From finding the right parts to the hundreds hours of R and D, But there is always a way to overcome these challenges. Sometimes it was spending hours online looking for that one rare part or spending days and nights swapping parts and analyzing signals to get the desired outcome from the effect box. My biggest challenge has been raising money on my own to make a large order to suppliers to get the parts I need at a cost that wont kill the project before it can take off. I have overcome this by doing it in small steps, one week, purchase one part the next week get a few parts and eventually it all my designs came to life. Now that I have a few functional models it would be great to make a production run a get these great pedals out to musicians. This is why I am here at kickstarter. As for the \"if\" we are funded factor. I believe that most changes i will face from the \"funded\" point will plainly be time. I do work a full time job working audio for an event company. But so far this had not really slowed the process. When i am not working for the man, I am working on Vintage Efx. I put a lot of time into this project because i believe my years of experience in the field of audio has provided me with the skill set needed to deliver a unique and long lasting product. We honestly feel that our biggest challenges have already been overcome, its simply time to make these products, we just need a little financial push to really get of the ground and get our product to hundreds of players out there.",
  "Leo is a hand assembled piece of electronic art and the utmost care will be taken during assembly. With collective experience of delivering multiple electronic products, we are familiar with the challenges ahead. With many working prototypes, we are confident in our design. Production of electronics is a complex task and there is always a chance of error in manufacturing, or difficulties in obtaining parts, which can delay delivery. We are confident of our partners' abilities to assist us in the most complex processes of the build. Pending successful funding, we have arranged production to start in March 2015. We have already developed extensive electronic testing and benchmarking software and procedures to assure that every shipped Leo performs to the highest standards.",
  "I learned a lot from my first Kickstarter book project, and hopefully those lessons will help this one go smoothly. \r\n\r\nA bigger quantity of books means bigger logistical problems with storage and fulfillment \u2013 but I've looked into (and budgeted for) storage/warehousing solutions, and this time I'm working with a shipping company that makes sending out the physical rewards far more efficient. \r\n\r\nI've put a lot of thought into planning out a tight production/fulfillment timeline, but there's always the possibility of unexpected issues with book production or shipping, or unforseen circumstances that could delay me finishing my work on the book files. If problems arise, I'll do my best to keep all the backers updated on the situation, and what I'm doing to get everyone's rewards delivered as soon as possible.",
  "Truly, the biggest challenge will be getting the word out. Unlike other kickstarters, I have decided not to have multiple small tiers. Instead, I am only interested in selling the book. I think there are 250 people in the world who want buy this book, but I'm going to need your help! \r\n\r\nThere are two things I'd like you to do. First, buy my books. Then TELL EVERYONE!

  "As we move into the production phase, most development risks have been addressed. The finish and audio quality achieved is second to none and we are now focusing on tweaks to further enhance the user experience. With those improvements being worked on during the Kickstarter campaign, we are confident that production can begin immediately after a successful campaign draws to a close.\r\n\r\nWe are working with experienced and reputable manufacturers; delays are sometimes inevitable when creating a unique product It is with this knowledge in mind that we set a very realistic delivery schedule. The factory can build up to 100 units a day. If possible, we would like to deliver product before the estimated shipping date. That will be challenge that we hope to meet.\r\n\r\nKickstarter pledges will be critical to launching us into that next phase of production. It will not only allow us to begin the production run for the first batch of ARCHT One units, but also allow us to set up quality controls and supply chain logistics, ensuring the company builds on a strong foundation. \r\n\r\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign, our next goal will be to launch ARCHT One in retail stores.",

That being said, things outside of my control, such as technology failing, shipping delays, human error, miscommunication, etc, can always arise. In this event, I'll do my best to resolve things quickly and stay in communication with my backers.\r\n\r\nAll the comic artwork, digital files, and previous chapters' printed issues are finished and ready to be sent to you all! All that's left to be done is the actual printing of Chapter 4.",
  "Because Caitlin and Dave - as well as their collaborators Larry Buchanan, Courtney Nguyen and spiritual guide David Granger, former EIC of Esquire Magazine - all have experienced backgrounds in media, we've had a rewarding time compiling what we think is incredibly compelling editorial material.\r\n\r\nWhat we don't know much of anything about is printing - we're doing our research meticulously so that we end up working with the best partners to give us a quality product that we can put in front of our readership. For that reason, we're looking to solely raise funds to cover the cost of printing 10k copies of the first two issues of Racquet, which ends up being at least $25k per issue. We're smart people who aren't afraid to ask questions and work relentlessly, but we want to make sure we get this right so that we can serve a healthy community of tennis fans now and well into the future.",

  "\u201cK & the Crazies\u201d is a passion project in which we will release regardless of our fundraising outcomes. We have come this far and will continue to see the project through to its release. Though we are seeking partnerships for the project with hopes of reaching our full budget of $75,460, the reality is we cannot presume such relationships will be acquired. In the event we do not secure full funding, our resourcefulness of skill-swapping, gathering in-kind donations, volunteer help, and scraping between couch cushions will ensure the successful completion of this podcast. That said, your support will help us tremendously as we move forward.",
  "The risk involved will be the terms of studio rent and set up, licensing and presenters commitment and production skills. The longevity of the project means the contributers will be given training and opportunity to provide feedback on each others shows and content, maintaining a team morale with a heavy focus on innovation and inspiration. Feedback from listeners will also be heavily considered and utilised for consistency and functionality",
  "This project anticipates formerly incarcerated individuals wanting to share their success stories and the impact they are having on their communities. However, some of these individuals may wish to conceal their identity. This would present a challenge to this project if it happens too often because the entire premise is based on filming captivating interviews for people to watch. Watching the back of someone\u2019s head on camera would not produce the objective of this project.\nThe number of successful formerly incarcerated individuals out there should be a sufficiently high enough number to mitigate this risk.\n\nAnother challenge we will face is ensuring the authenticity of the stories we hear from our guests. We are developing a system that we intend to use to verify that our guests are being forthright and honest about having been incarcerated and the length of their incarceration. However, many of the finer, more personal details of their stories will be harder to verify, and we will have to take our guests at their word that they are being honest.",
  "Before launching our project, we customized all sets of molds from a top-notch manufacturer (one of DJI's suppliers) and conducted a trial manufacturing run to ensure a smooth transition from prototype to finished product.

If there are any cases of any unexpected circumstances, we promise to communicate with full transparency to you, our backers, and work to resolve all issues in a timely manner.",
  "The major challenge facing any independent film is distribution. How do you get your movie out there for people to see? With the proliferation of streaming services and video-on-demand options, the opportunities are endless, but the goal for most filmmakers is still to get their film into theaters. \r\n\r\nThe most obvious way to do that is by submitting the film to film festivals and hoping someone picks it up for distribution. Many film festivals receive thousands and thousands of submissions, but can only screen a hundred or so (if that), which makes this route of seeking distribution very difficult. In order to better your chances of succeeding on the film festival circuit, filmmakers need to develop a film festival plan.\r\n\r\nAs part of our plan we have factored film festival submission fees into our budget. 20% of our festival submission budget will go towards major festivals (Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, etc.), 50% will go towards mid-range festivals (South by Southwest, Slamdance, etc.), and 30% will go towards smaller/local festivals (Oak Cliff Film Festival, Dallas VideoFest, Dallas International Film Festival, etc.).\r\n\r\nWe have also created a festival submission timeline where we have researched each festival in-depth (their eligibility criteria, programming from previous years, etc.) and prioritized the festivals that a) our film has a better chance of getting into, and b) actually screen films versus those festivals that merely accept your submission money but don't do anything to promote it or get it in front of people.",

  "About me:\r\n\r\nMy name is Lady Pixel Heart. I'm a professional freelance artist with 6+ years of experience making art. I draw mostly monthly commissions for people of their ocs, fanart, and sometimes my own characters.\r\n\r\nI've been writing this story for over a year now (currently I'm writing Book 3)! I'm handling the whole project by myself, which is really hard to find time for inbetween projects.\r\n\r\nWhy Kickstarter??\r\n\r\nIn order to create these chapters I will need at least 2 months off from commissions. The money I usually make for taking 5-10 commissions each month helps pay for bills, groceries, and living expenses. \r\n\r\nIf I can't get this time off of commissions I won't have time to work on the comic once it comes out on the 31st of October when I release the first 3 pages of Chapter 1. \r\n\r\nIf I can raise the funds I will be able to produce the chapters right away giving my audience less time to have to wait for the next pages!  It's been a dream of mine since I was very young to make a comic series that people could follow and enjoy so I hope that you'll support me in this endeavor! <3",

  "Coming up with delicious recipes that are healthy and good to eat is challenging when it come to foods that not only taste good but have benefits of reversing many ailments just by not eating processed foods. My goal is to do just that:  create a book that will introduce people to a world without processed foods and educate them about the benefits of eating healthy foods.\r\n\r\nI need this vehicle, this book, to educate people about the dangers of eating processed foods.  Many people don't know these dangers and it must be made clear to them.  They need to know that many childhood ailments are caused by the foods they were introduced to at a early age that led to many ailments, such as diabetes and many other horrendous diseases caused just by the foods we eat everyday.",

Because of this, there aren't as many writers writing queer lit. By offering a competitive rate of pay for those who submit to our magazine, we can prove that it is worthwhile to write queer content, and encourage writers to submit to us. By running this kickstarter and gaining publicity and funding, we are proving there is a need, and there are people out there willing to pay for stories that represent who they are. All of this goes toward getting the writers and artists to create the work we want, and to give them an outlet to share those stories with the world. \r\n\r\nGetting it to the readers - This magazine is powered by a handful of young people with a passion for great fiction and great writing. We don't have a publishing company backing us up or a long list of connections in the writing world. What we do have is a strong social media presence, especially across tumblr, where we have all been active for years.

  "As with any project, there are risks and challenges. We all have families and jobs and lives to maintain outside of our passions. So, bringing a group of people together to make this happen has not always been easy. We've had issues with time management, under-funding, and distance related problems. Nonetheless, we have recorded, mixed, mastered and released an album within the deadline we set (that album can be downloaded for free at www.caryhays.com). The single from that album will be released on Pandora very soon. And we've already created an example #irepresentNW video.  \r\n\r\nIn an attempt to show that we are a solid group of artists with great working relationships, we created this Kickstarter Project having created something very similar on a smaller scale. Something to show that we have already come across, addressed and overcome such obstacles. \r\n\r\nBeing that we are self contained, the overhead is very low. We are paying our engineers and videographers and designers for their time. But keeping it in the family means patience and understanding. We're able to get work done without the weight of money issues. We simply need funding for the vast number of things needed to put together a project of this magnitude. Travel, securing locations to shoot, recording in an analogue realm, mastering, manufacturing, promotion, etc. We plan to complete the project we've envisioned in a timely fashion, and the amount we're seeking will be all we need to keep things moving.",

  "The Risks i am taking are very fragile. I am putting myself out there trying to become one of the best singers America has ever heard. I want to influence all types of people with my music and all ages. I want to show the world love is more than a definition it is the true meaning of life. My challenges are to get passed opsticles.",

  "1) We have never produced a full podcast: This will not be an issue because we have extensive experience in audio production and editing due to our experiences at both of our jobs.  It should take us about 1-2 weeks once we have the studio set up to produce a high grade podcast show.  \r\n\r\n2) Purchasing the equipment: We have done extensive research on the equipment that we will need in order to produce a professional level show.  So this was a challenge, but if/when we get funded, we know exactly what to purchase, and how to set it up.\r\n\r\n3) The final and biggest challenge we have to deal with is gaining sponsorship.  This has more to do with the longevity of the show.  The $7,500 that we need to start will sustain the show for a solid year.  But in order to keep this wonderful thing going, we will need sponsorship.  We have a couple of local companies and restaurants on the hook for paid sponsorship, but they want to see our studio and product before they sponsor the show.  But if that happens, then long live the \"Sunday Before Monday Podcast\".  Hooray!!",
  "Obviously, with any project, there may be challenges involved especially when you're self-employed but I will update you every step of the way!\n\nI have already found a printer I am hoping to use to create the journal, any issues with this I will obviously let you know about ASAP.",
  "Because the Mini Alley is handmade, it is challenging to have mass production like other typical products. We have made and sold over 4000 units worldwide with other MiniAlley designs. Therefore we are experienced and have a reliable manufacturing plan and process that can handle unexpected problems. During the first campaign, the pandemic forced our main workshop to shut down for several months and caused up to 2 months delay in our delivery schedule. However, we were able to make necessary changes and worked diligently to get back to schedule quickly. In the end, we actually started shipping early for many backers.  For our second campaign, we completed and shipped everything on time without any delay. Any issues or concerns from backers were addressed within 24hr.  The trust of our great community is reflected in the many positive reviews we've received on previous products and campaigns.",
  "While it is exciting to bring new plays to life on stage, it is always a big risk to small theatre companies. This is especially true when the play isn\u2019t something easily recognizable to mainstream audiences or an adaptation of a well-known intellectual property. However, our playwright Maggie and director Amy are long-time collaborators who have gained a dedicated theatrical fan base in Seattle over the last 5 years. In addition, Macha Theatre Works has a proven track record of producing successful new plays, and has gathered a passionate, talented group of actors, designers, and staff for this project. We are committed not only to making the best art that we can, but also making it the best experience possible for everyone involved, from the start of rehearsal to the last curtain call. Theatre is only as strong as the team behind it, both on and off stage; we know we are strong and can overcome any risk that might arise along the way.",
  "To mount this production at Park Theatre is a huge venture, and pushes my company to its limits. The overall budget required just to cover essential costs, such as venue costs, marketing, and fees for the actors and creatives involved, is \u00a350,000 ($65,500). Ticket sales have been calculated to cover 40% of our expenses. We already have raised 30% of this sum from sponsors and supporters, and will cover 10% out of our own savings. \n\nTo cover the remaining sum, we need more people to get behind this project! The money raised through this campaign will be used for set, costumes and props, to ensure a high-quality production.",
  "We have successfully completed and fulfilled three Kickstarters as a team and have learned a lot from them. One thing we have made sure before running this Kickstarter is that our book was ready to be sent to print before it even began. Our digital rewards outside of the book are also ready, and we have secured an amazing third-party fulfillment service to help us send out books.",
  "Filmmaking is inherently unpredictable. There are risks and challenges at every stage of process that could affect things like the timing of the release and the dates that rewards get delivered. But we've built a team (and have loads of crystals for good energy) that is ready to meet any challenges head on and we're confident we'll produce a film you'll love. That being said, anything can happen so please understand the risks before you make a contribution.",

We do not foresee any significant challenges ahead, at least not any so significant that they are going to cause a delay in our timeline. As long as we hit our fundraising goal, we will continue through the development process until we get DotComCrowd online.\n \nOf course, if anything unforeseen does arise, and we need to push back our timeline at all, we will keep you updated. As a contributor to this campaign, you are a part of the DotComCrowd movement. We will send you regular updates about all of the progress that we are making, letting you know of the work that we do and any important milestones that we reach.",
  "We have had to resubmit our Arts Council application for funds towards this show; if they turn us down a second and final time we will be very short of funds indeed. We have drawn up an emergency budget to deal with this eventuality - which will still make sure people get paid - but it will be tighter than we would like. \n\nOf course the London theatre market is hugely competitive, but we have honed Lipstick through two rounds of Arts Council funded workshops. We are confident it is a strong and timely piece of work, and that we have the best PR and marketing team possible.",
  "With THREE successfully funded, successfully fulfilled Kickstarter campaigns under my belt (the last two of which were fulfilled months ahead of schedule) this isn't my first rodeo. I've learned a ton about potential pitfalls, unforeseen expenses, and other assorted disasters that can cripple a crowdfunded product, and I'm confident I'm heading them all off at the pass! Additionally, with the exception of the cover and any stretch goal materials, the art to be included in this book is done. That's right, the 130+ pages of pure comics that make up the meat of this volume are 100% in the bag. This campaign is about as low-risk as they come, but that said, life is life and there is always a slim chance of unforeseen delays, etc..",
  "I do not foresee any issues that I cannot handle. Of course problems will occur however, I am very confident that I can deliver. I am very industrious and able to automate or hire friends temporary or permanently for most production work.",
  "Though this is our first Kickstarter campaign and the first interchangeable modular headphones we design, we have plenty of experience in making audio products and operation management that we are fully aware of all the potential risks and challenges we might face. We feel like we have done all the research and preparations before launching our campaign on Kickstarter. Perhaps some unpredicted problems will still happen during the production period; however, we promise you we will be completely transparent to our process so that you are always aware of how your headphones are progressing.",
  "This is a low-risk project because the director has already invested the minimum amount of money to get this movie finished.  This crowdfunding campaign is to make the movie better than the bare-minimum budget version.  If a low amount is raised, it goes toward a few more crew members for the difficult shots.  Fund beyond that go toward renting better locations, hiring more help, getting more lenses and even a B camera.  Contributions go toward any number of production costs.  But again, the bare-minimum has been covered.\r\nThis is the first kickstarter campaign, but the sixth crowdfunder for the director.  There were five previous crowdfunding campaigns on a different site (not sure if a competitor should be named).  Each was successful and the movies were completed.",
  "Our main challenge will be filming in only 6 days. That's what you get for working with talented and in-demand folks like Austin and Joe and Freddie.\r\n\r\nThing is, these methods and characters and stories are things we grew up with, and things we have hungered after for many years now. We have been ready since the third film wrapped.",
  "Other than not reaching our funding goal, the risks and challenges are very low. We have all the films in our possession (except for the Danish Film Institute scan which will be sent following payment), so can get them scanned and worked on immediately. \r\nThere's always a chance of an unforeseen technical issue arising, but if it does, it should only delay the production a few weeks at most.\r\n\r\nI'll keep you updated regularly with progress.",
  "The funding for this video is the lowest we could come up with in order to rent the minimal supplies, take care of crew, styling, locations and other obstacles that we are not able to fund ourselves in time for the video to be shot around the 'Xtreme Battle of the Bands, Drum line and Cheerleader Showcase' on Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015 (thus the fund timing).\r\n\r\n In addition to having difficulty funding the music video, we are short on additional promotional materials to help push the single and the video to the masses. We are hoping that with what we are trying to do visually and with the song (we are working with a historical Dallas high school for this video), we are able to gain the attention of the city and propel our vision a lot further than where it is starting. Every donation and those that go over our current goal can really help for us to make history for a Dallas artist. Lets all come together to support independent music and a rising star unlike any other here. Show that your voice and efforts can change the landscape of the Dallas music scene. This is a lot bigger than just making a music video.",
  "Our biggest challenge is keeping these events free. It is our goal to create such environments, where people can/will come, be inspired, and inspire others. We would never want an artist or someone who would benefit from the art, to miss out due to admission cost. We charge nothing for our events and really would like to keep it this way. Thus, assistance in funding this (our) projects is being asked.",
  "One problem that may arise with this project is that if there will come more book orders than we predicted a second printing of the book will be needed and some backers will need to wait for more time until they will have the book in their hands. \r\nOtherwise, this is a simple project that has little to no complications.",

Mother nature can sure change your plans. We have had extremely excited guests, who have been so flexible and able to quickly reschedule our interviews thus far. We are also able to do phone interviews as well, if needed. Maintaining up-to-date technology is more important than ever for our growing radio show/station.",
  "Possible risks to this production include an outside workload that will clash with post-production duties.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, will lead to a delay in the delivery of the show and, therefore, a delay in the delivery of the rewards on offer.\r\n\r\nI have an expected (and 'hoped for') completion and delivery date of April 2019. \r\n\r\nIf any outside forces (to do with my day-job) align to conflict with this deadline for delivery, the show will be delayed and delivered within the following month of May 2019.\r\n\r\nShould the funding goal not be reached, I will still do everything in my power to complete the production and distribution of this show, regardless of the Kickstarter outcome.",
  "There are many risks and challenges involved in completing a successful campaign. While this is our first crowdfunding campaign, we feel we have done an adequate job accounting for most factors. \n\nShipping is our largest concern for two reasons, tight deadlines and international shipping. \n\nIdeally will ship the first round of pledges in time for Christmas, according to the USPS shipping deadlines (domestic shipping). This is a tight schedule, but assuming minimal delays, we are confident we can meet this deadline.\n\nInternational shipping is something we were hesitant to offer. However we realize that a significant number of potential backers would be alienated by not offering an international option. As such we have done our best to  anticipate the associated costs. However while we do our best to anticipate problems, international backers will be responsible for applicable duties or tax, as well as ensuring items are not prohibited by customs in their country.",
  "- Many pickupwinders are inventive enough to build, create their own D.I.Y. machine at home for personal use. They might find our product not worth the investment. But with an easy to use machine like this, we hope to inspire musicians who don't have the time or means to build such a machine and who will find comfort in a small, reliable machine to start exploring this beautiful hobby.\n\n- As a small company, a big intrest will mean that we won't be able to comply to all the orders immediately. This might mean that we will need to go over the estimated delivery time as we will need some time to hire some dragonhunters, install more printers and crank up production.",

  "\"What About Shipping Costs?\"\r\n\r\nWell, you may have noticed that the reward to claim a book copy is $10. That covers the cost of the book AND shipping the book out to you (if you're in the US. It will cost extra to ship it elsewhere in the world. Sorry!).\r\n\r\n\"When Will I Expect to Get the Rewards?\"\r\n\r\nThe book is formatted for printing already, so everything should be done and shipped out to you by December 2016. The goal is to get it out before the absolutely bananas span of time known as THE HOLIDAYS (specifically Christmas and Samhain).\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, there is a chance that something may go wrong at the printers (the lettering may be off, the format may not be right, a machine could break, etc). If that happens, the rewards will have to be pushed back to ship out around January 2017.",
  "One of our biggest challenges has been the downloaded music. Although a caretaker or family member can download their loved one's favorite music, we really like the idea of the player being ready to go, out of the box. So, for now, we are purchasing each song, at an approximate cost of one dollar per song, and hope that in the future, we may be able to negotiate music rights. \nI hope you will consider backing Melody Matinee and helping us bring back fond memories to those who may have trouble recalling on their own. Thank you for your support.",
  "Scheduling is a potential hurdle that we've faced in the first six episodes, yet we overcame, and we expect to do the same on the second round!

We will need to hire 6 actors for small roles i.e. flashback scene, nurse, receptionist.",
  "A lot has to be taken into consideration when making a short film. However, we feel our team\u2019s experience gives us the ability to cope with any difficulties we may face. We will always stay safe on the shoot - the utmost importance and safety measures will be taken when filming on the bus and on the road - and there will always be First Aid-trained individuals on set. We will also be working with child-actors, and the appropriate members of the production team will be DBS checked. We are so optimistic, and we hope you are too. We could make something brilliant here.",

  "MARKETING: We are a small group of theatre artists in a very busy city. We hope to dedicate a portion of our fundraising to ensuring we have a strong enough marketing push to bring an audience out to see this important play. This includes investing in physical posters, targeted audience outreach, and online marketing content. This makes up $400 of the budget.\n\nSTIPENDS: While not every independent project in the city can afford to pay their actors and designers, we at Littlebrain Theatre are committed to compensating our artists for the work they do. More than $2000 of our $5000 budget goes exclusively to stipends for the artists. If we manage to fundraise beyond our budget, all overflow will go towards increasing actor and designer wages.\n\nSIMPLE TECH: We do not currently have the resources to build massive sets or sew intricate period costumes for this play. We will be working with the resources we have to make the best possible adaptation of \"Bicycle Thieves\" we can. Your donations and support go towards helping us to hire the best designers for his project, who can work within the parameters of our simple production to create something impactful. Not to mention, each designer will receive a budget to make sure they can afford to create what they need to for the production.",
  "We have a proven track record of producing high quality, accessible theatre, with extensive experience marketing these productions to a diverse audience and managing large scale budgets.\r\n\r\nWhat's most important to us is raising the funds to pay our incredible team of actors and creatives, and the only risk is that we might fall short.\r\n\r\nWe have the team, we have the theatre, we have the play.

Please feel free to PM if you have any specific questions.",
  "No project comes without risks. The art for this book is around 80% completed, and is ticking closer to completion every day. Once that's done, the primary risk lies with the printer. Thankfully, I have used Comic Printing UK for every single issue release thus far, and have only had positive experiences with the company for both comic and corporate contracts.\r\n\r\nBackers will be sent regular progress updates. I will never go radio silent, and if any delays do occur in case of an emergency, I will keep all participants updated through Kickstarter, the Curia Regis website and social media.\r\n\r\nAs the goal is to have the comic finished by the Autumn convention season, books should be in your hands in time for Christmas, at the latest.",
  "There really aren't too many risks. The only one I can think of is going into debt trying things, but I'm fine to wear that I guess.\r\nEventually I'd like to have a better computer and editing software, as well as a better camera, but for now I'm happy with what I've got.\r\nGotta start somewhere, and if that somewhere is the bottom, the only way to go is up!",
  "The biggest risk we're taking on this project is shooting in a method we've never done before. Although we are excited to showcase this more theatrical style through the camera lens, we are aware that things may take longer that expected and that not every line from our script might make it into the final product. In preparation for that, we will be consulting with a few Shakespeare and theater experts before the shooting date, even setting up rehearsals as if we were really putting on a play. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge is shooting on location rather than one of our own homes where we might have more control. This means that we have to be extremely wary of what we touch, where we put things, and making sure the area looks exactly as it did when we first got there. Think of it as being a guest in someone else's home, but having a group of 10-15 other people with you!",

I know what it costs and what needs to be done to result in a good looking product!\r\n\r\nMy biggest challenge is to ship a lot of books, since I haven't done that before. To prevent an epic failure in sending books, I have put the physical rewards on limited amounts. I have also thoroughly tested the packing of both 1 and 2 books with the packing-material I plan to use.\r\n\r\nIf I should have severe problems with shipping out the books, I have friends and colleagues who have experience in packing and shipping.\r\n\r\nIf you order a sketch, there is a risk of getting your package a bit later than the other backers.

  "When the project is fully-funded, the challenge then becomes fulfilling all the rewards. \r\n\r\nFor the most part, I have designed my rewards to be digital, so as to avoid shipping problems. \r\n\r\nIn addition, most people will be getting the same rewards (video / director's cut) so there's not a lot to make.\r\n\r\nI am a bit nervous about portraiture, because it requires emailing back and forth, but hopefully the people who select that option are up to it!\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have NEVER made a comic with a stranger in it. So if that happens, we'll all find out how that goes...\r\n\r\nThe main reasons that my reward fulfillment will go smoothly is that my rewards are digital (they require no shipping and are not custom made) and I work from home, so I have plenty of time to devote to making everything!",
  "Luckily, since our format is relatively simple, there aren't too many production risks involved. If we plan our productions properly - which we will - there's no reason we can't shoot two videos in one day.\r\n\r\nOur largest challenge will be ensuring our videos pack in enough fact-checked information and provide our viewers with the right websites, all while being entertaining.",
  "The main risk of this project is not being able to finishing filming in an efficient manner which could lead to a project that may not reach it full potential. This could come in a number of forms, including but not limited to poor organisation, unavoidable reductions in production quality (for example not being able to source quality set design) or simply a lack of time.\r\n\r\nGiven that I and everyone on board the project are still young filmmakers as well as full-time students, managing a project of this size will be difficult and presents many challenges. However, given that we are all so passionate about the project, we hope we can overcome these obstacles through planning, organisation and above all determination to create something that we can be truly proud of!",
  "If for any reason our project is not funded, we will be establishing an online store at www.thetinlunchbox.com on a pre-order basis only; the store will be set up based on the feedback we get from this campaign. \r\n\r\nPrinted copies will be delivered as soon as they are received back from the printer (this is wholly dependent upon the project being funded).",

  "Although we are originally from the Dallas/Forth Worth area, we both relocated to New York City in the early 2000s to work in the theater world.  We are so happy to be back home, but a huge challenge to producing Lilies is that we don't have the vast network of connections that we did in NYC or a built-in support structure. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, we both have years of management, marketing, and audience-relation skills.  We are confident that we have what it takes to make this a show to remember and draw in the crowds.",

  "Wir setzen alles daran, dass wir den M2 termingerecht ausliefern k\u00f6nnen. Unsere Lieferanten sind bereit und sollten alle Komponenten rechtzeitig liefern k\u00f6nnen. Die gr\u00f6sste Herausforderung wird die \u00dcbergabe der Produktion an die entsprechende Sozialinstitution sein. Gerne h\u00e4tten wir diesen Teil besser vorbereitet. Doch dazu fehlten uns die finanziellen Ressourcen. Aus diesem Grund werden wir die ersten Lautsprecher wohl auch nicht komplett extern fertigen lassen k\u00f6nnen.\r\nWir leben f\u00fcr unseren Traum. Damit dieser Traum Realit\u00e4t wird, haben wir bewusst darauf verzichtet, externe Investoren f\u00fcr Euphony zu gewinnen. Wir m\u00f6chten unabh\u00e4ngig bleiben und frei \u00fcber Gesch\u00e4ftsstrategien, Gewinnmargen etc. entscheiden. Um finanziell \u00fcber die Runden zu kommen, m\u00fcssen wir neben Euphony einen \"normalen\" Job aus\u00fcben. Aus diesem Grund werden wir nicht von Beginn an einen professionellen Support-Dienst anbieten k\u00f6nnen. Konkret bedeutet das, dass wir manchmal telefonisch nicht erreichbar sein werden und die Beantwortung von Mails nicht immer am selben Tag erfolgt.\r\n\r\nWe do everything we can to deliver the M2 in time. Our suppliers are ready and should be able to deliver all components as soon as ordered. The biggest challenge will be the transfer of production to the appropriate social institution. We would like to have prepared this part better, but we lacked the financial resources. For this reason, we will probably not be able to produce the first speaker completely externally.\r\nWe live for our dream. To make this dream a reality, we have deliberately refrained from winning external investors for Euphony. We want to remain independent and decide freely on business strategies, profit margins, etc. In order to make ends meet financially, we have to work in a \"normal\" job as well. For this reason, we will not be able to offer a professional support service right from start. This means that we will not always be reachable over the phone right away, and won't be able to answer every mail on the exact same day.",
  "In an effort to minimize risks, we have spoken with all suppliers to learn the stock of components, manufacturing times and times of shipments etc.\r\nEven so, we are not completely safe from possible inconveniences but in the case of this happening we will report to our sponsors and we will not stop until we solve it.",
  "The risks and challenges that Murel faces are very manageable. We already have a working prototype that is functioning exactly the way we want it to. We are aware that there are always shipping challenges to international backers which may be a challenge. Also, we are aware of and have experienced the challenges of shipping, customer service, and replacements. We plan to increase our shipping and customer service capacity by hiring out help for these two potential bottlenecks. But we plan to address each of these by a case by case scenario. Finally, there are quality control issues that may arise. We plan to personally do a quality control check of the shipment before it leaves China. We are confident that we can overcome any challenges that come our way.",
  "Risks and challenges\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge for a hardware crowdfunding campaign is managing overhead cost and manufacturing timeline. We have been in mass production of previous 2 Kickstarted products (M4 and Accessport), as well as several other products outside of crowdfunding campaign.\r\n\r\nWe have the right resources and team in place to bring this project into final mass production once enough fund is collected to open tooling and and gather raw material.\r\n\r\nWe have invested heavily into development, prototyping and preparing for the Kickstarter campaign. This means our biggest risk is not meeting funding goal for this project, which will mean a big financial loss as well as the timing into the market.",
  "There are risks in everything we do in life, but I\u2019ve done my darnedest to minimize them for this project. I\u2019ve been putting the book together as each monthly batch of comics is created, so the book will be ready to go to print by the time this campaign concludes. There\u2019s always a chance the books could get delayed in transit somewhere, but I\u2019ve left some wiggle room in the estimated ship dates. If everything goes according to plan, everyone will get their books sooner than anticipated! How rad would that be?! That\u2019s right! Pretty dang rad!",

I need no permission from anyone. I own this. I expect no delays to issuing all rewards. I have already completed one third of the work. Fifty percent of the daily prayers are already in the database. Plus I use them every day and so if there are modifications I make them on the fly. So you will receive your reward.",

  "Project risks include assisting backers from different countries find where to source organic ingredients and unleavened bread, for example as I am unfamiliar with overseas grocery shopping.  This risk could be overcome by providing general pointers and guidelines towards finding organic grocers, avoiding chain store bakeries and the like.\r\n\r\nProject challenges include setting up a website that links to the email and setting up a group email address from Gmail.  These challenges are in the process of being resolved.\r\n\r\nFurther challenges involve tapping into my inspiration and creativity to give each dish that special something.  This will take some thought, research and drawing on themes from family meals that have been passed down to me.",
  "A successful Kickstarter campaign will allow us to take advantage of bulk printing discounts and provide an easy to read and use tool that will help  people transition to a gluten-free diet in a healthy, economical, and tasty way. \r\n\r\nOur first cookbook \"Transitioning to a Gluten-Free Lifestyle with Healthy & Easy Recipes\" provides information on how to get the process started including tips on identifying gluten, kitchen set up, and shopping. \r\n\r\n\"Summer Recipes\" provides a wide variety of recipes to take advantage of summer fun and provides tips and techniques for avoiding cross-contamination during summertime events. \r\n\r\nWe were astounded at how expensive wedding and special event gluten-free cakes are (and how much sugar is used!) and knew we could do better. \"Wedding Cakes\" will show you how to create fabulously beautiful and tasty cakes with lower sugar cake frosting, and cakes at a fraction of the normal costs. We show you pictures of the cakes we created and take you step by step through the process including tips for decorating, staging, and serving!\r\n\r\n\"Let's Party\" will help you host parties or bring food to parties that is gluten-free, nutritious, and inexpensive.

There are projects that are easy enough to involve your younger kids with and healthy foods (cleverly disguised as a lot of fun) that will help kids make the transition to a healthier lifestyle. \r\n\r\nThe sample cookbooks have already been created and only minor changes are needed (like adding ISBN numbers) to make them print ready. If we are not successful, we will work harder to improve our campaign and continue to produce new titles to help both kids and adults through the process. We are on a mission to help our families, our friends, and others who have been dramatically, and tragically, impacted by gluten make this critical transition. We need your help to help others.",
  "Countless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the prototypes have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors, I will green-light production right away without waiting until the project closes. I\u2019m using a workshop that has produced countless insulated bottles for many years. So technical problems are unlikely. If you have supported my previous Kickstarter projects, you know I always come through. Frequently, I complete my projects ahead of schedule.

  "I have  incurred many risks and challenges being a salon owner for 20 yrs, in management 10 yrs prior to opening salon in 1994.When I started my salon in 1994 i could not get any credit because of a previous bad business deal from a former employer when the bank repossessed the building and all her assets in Dec 1992 (including the equipment i was supposed to purchase) . My husband also got laid off 3 months prior.We almost lost everything with both of us being unemployed for 14 months. So with no credit or investors ,I started with pure sweat equity & first and last rent. I know hard work & I learned perseverance as well as patience.I have had to balance between running a business , taking care of my mom who was sick with cancer , and my family; in which i also have an autistic daughter.We also had a fire and lost everything (it all worked out).These are my qualifications and they come from life experiences. So in other words I don't quit.  i will keep persevering until i succeed at getting my music played..the hardest will be getting my music on yahoo & aol.I already have some one to help with advertising etc. I am aware the internet has slow times just like the hair business.That is why i want to build my audience to keep my stats up.

  "The main challenge will be to get a print that will meet the quality criteria. When designing something on the computer you won't necessarily have the color represented in the same way when you print it, even if you use a high quality printing technique. \r\nIn order to solve this, I will go through the desired iterations until the quality of the print is to my and hopefully your satisfaction. \r\nThere could be some issues with delivering the print to you in time, based on the number of iterations the design process has to go through.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this, I will make sure to speed up the logistical process of delivery in order to make up for any lost time due to the design process.

  "Our product is still at the prototype stage, thus, to transition from prototype to finished product will pose as a challenge to our team. While the functionalities work well as a prototype, we want to continue improving our product to be more sturdy and function well as a finished product to deliver the greatest value to our backers. We have done several tests on our products to ensure that they work well consistently, and continue to execute more tests to improve the product. We are also continuing work on the prototype to develop newer and better versions of PAU.\r\n\r\nManufacturing is one of the largest challenges for our product. Every product faces significant difficulties when transitioning from the prototype to the product stage, and ours is no different. In order to mitigate the risk of this transition, our team carefully screened potential partners.\r\nIn October, we went to Shenzhen to visit hardware manufacturers. We were able to find a manufacturer who was able to manufacture and assemble both the shell and the PCB together, and had successfully manufactured for Kickstarter products before, so will be able to help us fulfill our goals.",

We are not dependant of third parties, this watch collection follows same product life cycle as any other new models from other brands within our group. We plan to start our delivery process in Jun 2021. While we are fully confident in our campaign goals, there may be some unexpected issues in our production and shipping process beyond our control. If unexpected things happen, the MERKUR team promises to keep all our backers updated and informed and handle the concerns with care. We will work closely with the logistics company in advance to make sure the process goes smoothly. Please be aware that there may be extra customs fees due to the policy of different countries. Backers will be responsible for customs fees, duties, VAT, import taxes, etc. administered by your government. They are excluded from the shipping fees. Normally, you won't be charged import duty taxes. However, given many different regulations in different countries, We can't guarantee that 100%.

  "CHALLENGES.\r\n\r\nThe issue #1: PLANNING\r\nWhen you talk to us about the play, you will hear excitement, joy, wonder, and... that it's tiring. We are working on this because it's a labour of love. We love it and many of us work on the play in our spare time and in between hours to fundraise, promote, write, create, plan and produce.\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nWe endeavour to work to a clear production schedule which maps out not only what needs to be done, but also how to mitigate risks, move times lines and help juggle the opposing time schedules of Philip and Avni! \r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue #2: A LARGE CAST\r\nWe envisage challenges on the way; preparing the actors, managing schedules, rehearsal spaces, cast expectations, as well as using the opportunity to support them to develop professionally. Importantly, we want to pay them fairly.\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nWe love our actors and they bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to their roles. They are well versed in Eastern European literature, or have personal connections to the themes. From this foundation of respect, we will endeavour to work with them to manage expectations, provide concrete and manageable schedules to work with, respond to feedback and offer them support. This kickstarter is a perfect opportunity to start this journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue #3: We\u2019re doing this for the FIRST TIME!\r\nPhilip and Avni are working towards their debuts in directing and producing, respectively, as well as bringing the play to the UK stage for the first time!\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nBoth Philip and Avni have trusted mentors who are experts in the field. They are working closely with them to identify potential issues, work through problems and offer guidance along the way. They have also spent over a year researching the play, it\u2019s ideas and the writer \u2013 speaking with academics, technicians, producers, psychologists and engaging the polish community. It is through these meticulously built and strong foundations that the play has a platform from which to succeed. \r\n\r\n \r\nTHE RISKS\r\n \r\nThe issue #1: SMELL DESIGN\r\nUsing scents as part of the performance is ambitious, and we want to get it right. It runs the risk of being tokenistic.\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nWe work closely with Harry and Sarah from 4160 Tuesdays perfume who are experts and have a lot of experience in this area. With Avni\u2019s work at festivals and in performances using scent, there is a practical and creative vision which emerges. It will be tested in rehearsals to ensure it works and enhances the play. We will ensure Harry and Sarah are present to advise and inform throughout.\r\n \r\nWe would also like to test the innovation of using scent to get into character for the actors - a unique way of preparing actors for the performance.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe issue #2 : NOT REACHING THE GOAL\r\nThis goal is one generous step in a long journey.\r\n \r\nThe solution: \r\nWe believe in equality, fairness and collaboration. If we reach the goal we can start the journey as we mean to go on, and do this performance justice, not only for it being a seminal piece of literature, but as a positive marker for women and help open conversations about equality in all of it\u2019s forms. \r\n\r\n \r\nAny donations that meet (or even exceed) our goal, will be incredibly appreciated.\r\n \r\nThanks again everyone and happy fundraising!",

  "This will be the first time that Concrete Temple has created a play in which all the characters are puppets. The challenge is to bring to life interesting, engaging puppet characters without relying on actors on stage. \r\n\r\nCreating just the right characters and puppets is always a challenge and will take considerable trial and error. First thoughts about the appropriate materials, sizes and range of movement needed may not be the most effective choices. The processes of experimentation of form and function and the workshop collaboration take time, space and materials - the challenge is having enough of each.",
  "The art for the webcomic pages is complete and already set up in printer-ready files.\r\n\r\nFulfillment is always a challenge for me, so I've factored in the cost of having the the printer do fulfillment of books and bookplates.\r\n\r\nFor books with hand-drawn art, I've factored in having a certain number of books expedited and shipped early so that there'll be extra time to work on art.",

In the end, we will have; a high quality and professionally mixed EP, a video of one of your favorite Theresa Payne songs, and we also walk away owning all of the material.  This includes audio, video footage and session data. Any extra funds that we raise over the $1500 goal will assist us with costs associated with marketing, promotion, and packaging.\r\n\r\nThe particular challenge that comes to mind is simply that we will be unable to afford the opportunity to record this EP.  With the help of our social media networks, and the relationships built around our city, The Theresa Payne Band, and myself are more than qualified to overcome this $1500 challenge. This is also what makes the risk worth taking.",
  "FYI - this campaign is all or nothing so I don't receive anything until I've reached my goal. When you donate, the funds will not come directly out of your account, only if I reach my goal. \r\n\r\nThe challenge?: Pushing back the album release date (right now an early December release), and not having the opportunity to fully promote it the best way possible, with an awesome PR team.",

The biggest challenge we foresee moving forward is  lack of funds raised!\r\n\r\nAs you might know, with Kickstarter, if we don't raise all of our goal, we don't receive any funds (funds pledged are returned to donors) . If this happens (and we really don't think it will), we will have to readjust our timeframe and end goal.\r\n\r\nWe've also been careful to make sure that we are able to fulfill our rewards.",

This is something that has been looked at and mitigated as much as possible.",
  "I have the earphones on stock and every order that is sent will have a tracking number using DHL. The charger cables are also on stock. Any orders after stock is sold out will be back ordered and will be delivered within 10-15 working days note this does not include shipping time but a tracking number will be available through DHL.\r\n\r\nDepending on how much orders we get will determine the delivery time. which will be between 7-21 days.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to put Hussi earphones and charger cables in the hands of retail surf,skate and adventure stores. I first need to get some sales behind the brand and money in order to invest in marketing and advertising. The next step will be to go wireless and produce more adventure products.",

  "I've already received an estimate and timeline from the Bar Dog website creators, and they'll start working on the site once the Kickstarter is successfully funded. It will probably take a few months to complete, as they have multiple projects going on, and we'll more than likely go through a few rounds of revisions. Ideally, I'd like to see the site up by the end of January and of course, I will keep all Bar Dog supporters informed of the project's progress along the way.\r\n\r\nRegarding the rewards, I've created and professionally printed a few independent comic books, and I illustrated and designed an award-winning children's book. I've already received quotes from two printers for the Bar Dog project\u2014the first will be creating the comic books, stickers and posters and the second will be printing the t-shirts. Also, in my years of working on the creative side of advertising, I've shepherded hundreds of projects from original concept to final development. In producing the Bar Dog rewards, I'll not only be creating many of them myself, but I'll also be supervising the production of all Bar Dog products, from t-shirts to coasters, to ensure that anything bearing the Bar Dog name is of the highest possible quality and, most importantly, delivered on time.",
  "I've done a lot of research and have contacted several publishing companies. There is one company in particular that is really interested (actually waiting on me) to produce the book. The only obstacle that I can foresee is getting the publishing done in a timely manner. My goal is to have the book in the hands of my supporters by Valentine's Day. \r\n\r\nThis has been a year and a half in the making. Yes, it is a lifestyle change. This project is something that I believe in, something I live and will live for the rest of my life.  Most of the legwork has been done. I have recipes in mind... It's just a matter of putting it all together!",
  "We are working thoroughly and promptly to ensure the R+D tour of 'The Edinburgh Test' reaches as many people as possible. We are doing this by working closely with family networks and services local to each area we visit to spread the word and ensure the success of these sharings and feedback sessions. \r\nWe will be taking on board all audience feedback from this Research and Development period and will continue to rework and develop the production, finding the best way to present this story to audiences, ready for our London run of the production next Spring.",

  "With over 25 years of experience in electronics manufacturing (Mathias was a leading manufacturer of PC diagnostic hardware in Europe) we have many contacts in the business. The obstacles of manufacturing high quality electronic devices within the intended timeframe are well known to us. As we're relying on several local manufacturing sites, we don\u2019t have the timing or quality issues you will face when manufacturing in Asia. Our preamp will be thoroughly \u201dmade in Germany\u201d. Unexpected component shortages may result in a delay in the production schedule. In order to prevent this, our component selection strategy has always considered acquiring the components from multiple sources.\r\n\r\nThe development of the iOS app is nearly finished and at the end of the beta testing phase. The programming of the Android app is currently in progress.\r\n\r\nThe first stage of manufacturing the poets One is the acquisition of components, which will run simultaneously with the making of PCBs and the 3D-printing respectively injection molding of housings. The second phase includes electronic manufacturing, followed by assembly and testing. Shipment will start four months after the campaign\u2019s end.",

While I can't work on the book during the fall semester, if funded, I will be working full time on Multiplex (including the regular updates) for the rest of the summer and after completing my MFA in December. My timeline on the first Kickstarter project was a bit too optimistic, and I ended up going over budget as a result; I've made every effort to make this timeline more conservative.\r\n\r\nThere is one likely wrinkle next summer (my fianc\u00e9e and I making an interstate move next summer) but this has already been factored into the timeline. If it ends up not happening (I\u2019ll know in the next six months or so), the books may be able to ship early.\r\n\r\nThe biggest risk is not making our goal!",

To date, we have held dozens of interviews; transcribed and translated more than 20 interviews; Shot photos for half of the featured recipes; and completed the book layout and design. We have compiled logic models, assumptions, key strategies and metrics.\r\n\r\nOur book team of 11 talented and committed individuals are ready to move full speed ahead. However, with the holidays approaching there is a risk that our print schedule may slip into the summer of 2015.",
  "I am projecting to have this book published by February.  The timeline is 60 -90 days from the time I submit it to being printed.  I am 3/4 of the way done writing this book.

I want it to be budget friendly so that anyone who wants better communication between food and their health can obtain it.  \r\nYou will have the cooking sessions before the book due to timing for the publishing.",

Please note that I do not photoshop clouds etcs to my work as it will ruin the originality of nature's creation.\r\n\r\nOther risk involved which may be beyond my control would be the production time for the calendar.

  "Risk:\r\nAs with any new business adventure, there are risks.  Most risk can be calculated and procedures put into place to overcome those risk.  In the Vermicomposting community, the risk is always the same.  \"Consistency\".  Finding the right combination of soil composition and bedding to grow worms successfully then maintaining that standard.  Other factors are what the worms are fed and how often. Most or all of the large Commercial Vermicomposters feed straight \"Composted Cow Manure\".  We don't!  Moisture content, temperature and PH are other important factors.  Throughout the last year, we have perfected a system that have our worms maturing sexually in 8-10 weeks instead of the normal 10-12 week time frame.  Once mature they start to produce 2-3 eggs a week and each egg casing on average is producing 2-3 healthy juveniles.  The fact that we started with 1000 worms and even lost half of that batch due to inexperience in the first 3 months then came back strong is testament to our commitment to being the best in the field.  We don't give up.\r\n\r\nUnexpected Obstacles:\r\nWe\u2019ve worked out all the kinks that one usually encounters while farming worms.  Not sure of what could or would be unexpected seeing as we\u2019ve encountered most if not all the obstacles one expects in this industry. \r\n\r\nNo pending projects.\r\n\r\nMost of what we encountered in the beginning was typical of what others in the industry have gone through.  We were able to confer with other successful wormers.  However, experience is still the best teacher.  This last year has been a learning experience.  Additionally, we were not afraid to try new things based on what we were learning about what makes a good earth worm.  We have had great success and will be keeping many of these new techniques proprietary.",
  "This is my second go at trying to make THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE happen and it is not easy. I am more than qualified to making sure in creating a great 80's style horror movie. It will have some legends and things that no one has ever seen in a movie before. I want to create a movie that will go into the books as a brilliant master piece. The obstacle that I face right now is not having full funding for the movie. I am just merely asking for every horror movie fan out there to make this happen. Hey I am willing to do what it takes to make this happen. \r\n\r\nRight now due to the movie not being fully funded it makes it difficult to pay a lawyer to write up a contract for the film company to get the production staff, casting directors, art directors, lighting crews, and editors for the production. In order for this to happen you have to have a legal contract with the production company. Then also there has to be a contract with the agents and assistants that their client is pleased with what is going to be made into a movie. I feel very confident that I can make this happen and have horror fans out there love what my vision is for THE POSSESSION OF INNOCENCE. I have many challenges and I am willing to face them and work to make it happen.",
  "A film project, even a short one such as this, is a machine with so many moving parts, I can guarantee the production will run into challenges. The good news is\u2026 we love doing this. Each challenge is an opportunity to streamline the process, improve, work smarter, create, and push boundaries.  \r\n\r\nScript not working? Bring on a different writer for a new perspective. \r\nPost-Production turning into a time-hogging monster? I know excellent artists who can jump onboard. Hard drive crash? I have everything backed up at all times. Camera meets gristly demise under wheel of production truck? Call one of a dozen people that will gladly help us out. \r\n\r\nAnother perk of Kickstarter is that whatever your contribution level, you'll be kept up to date as we go, with our successes, challenges, and inevitable silly set stories.",
  "I have calculated that I can paint thirty 22\" x 60\" scarf panels per 5 day work-week. A five day schedule leaves two days for catch up and problem solving. This allows Two weeks for painting. At the end of week one the first thirty scarves can go to my seamstress for hemming. Second week, the next thirty, so as I'm painting, she is hemming. I have contracted with her before on another project and was happy with her work and delivery. Should she show any delivery problems, I have a recommended alternative for back-up. \r\n   My supplier of silk has a large and diverse inventory, in a broad spectrum of colors. The inks I use are well stocked at my local art supply store. I also have alternate sources in Los Angeles.\r\n    I have already painted prototypes of the scarves as Christmas gifts for friends and family. They were very well received. I know my painting technique and production process, which is how I calculated my production capacity.\r\n    I think the Artisan Festival is a good venue to launch the line and assess the public response. Any remaining inventory from sales at the Artisan Festival can be offered on an Etsy store and through local specialty boutique shops and art galleries. Market research shows hand painted silk scarves sell  between $45 upward to $80+ each. I intend to offer at a retail price of $80.\r\n  My studio is in my home, and has sufficient space for the production of this initial venture.",
  "This is a low risk project. The main challenge will be to make sure the individual works, which are heavier than the average panels and occasionally have fragile  additions, are crated and shipped with care.",
  "I've found that the most difficult thing in becoming a financially successful artist is acquiring the right following.  A gallery can be useful for it's mailing list, but there have to be enough art collectors, designers, and other clients interested in my work to provide enough income to live and have a full-time studio practice.  In New York there are many gallery's that can provide this for but can charge the me anywhere from 40-75% on the sale price of the artwork.  In London it is common for an emerging artist to rent a space for an exhibition but will not necessarily receive promotional help from the gallery.  I have chosen to have my first solo exhibition in The Annexe of The Brick Lane Gallery.  The space is for rent, but also gives me access to their extensive mailing list.  Hopefully, with both of our promotional efforts, this exhibition will produce a crowd capable of propelling my career and producing opportunities I wouldn't otherwise have.  Luckily, I have many friends in the art world who can help me with this DIY approach and with your help, can use this well located space and their resources to put together a very professional, well-represented exhibition.",

  "As with all projects, there are some risks and challenges that might be faced in post production. This will not affect which awards will be sent out but may push back the estimated time you will receive them. For example, cd replication or t-shirt production may experience complications that would push back the release date and/or when you receive the rewards in the mail.

  "Ya'll have already donated, but because we did not meet the goal, none of the money was processed and was not withdrawn from your account. I am re-launching a project so that those who missed the deadline can pledge as well. The reason for my lower goal is due to payment time. Because my first project did not get funded, I had to find other means to pay a minimum payment for recording. This has allowed me to lower my funding goal.  So even if you already donated, please donate again. I need your help! It may be difficult to get ya'll to re-donate, so I please ask that if you plan to re-donate (and I hope you all do), donate and then pass it along to any friends/family/previous donators that may want to help out but may not see this post. Any questions you have, please feel free to contact me via Facebook message. This pledge period will only be 5 DAYS LONG!!!! Thank you all!",
  "There really aren't very many risks or challenges since we have done this before. The same printer has been contacted, we did all the math to make this possible including shipping. The biggest challenge is raising the money to reprint which we are doing through taking pre-orders and fundraising. If we don't raise enough funds then we will not print this book. It's scary to launch my first kickstarter but thats the modern age - and I'm all in :) . It's going to be hard to zerox and send out a brand new zine but I'm up to that challenge - and have a year to look into the least expensive options of how to fulfill that xoxo",
  "There's always a risk in delays when manufacturing as there is a lot of hand work. Things that could go wrong include: too many seconds quality pins, slow shipment, manufacturer errors, etc. However, I've worked with my manufacturer for years of designs and they are very prompt and produce great pins! I don't see many things happening that would delay the production for too long and if there are any errors they have always promptly remedied with a fixed batch.\n\nThere may be minor differences in the actual pin vs what you see in my mockups due to hand enamel filled precision, color matching. These should just be small changes though and the pins will be close to what you see here as much as possible!\n\nPackages may get lost without the right address, so please double check your address to be sure that it's correct! If packages do not arrive over 2 weeks past estimation, I will ensure I correctly make a solution to get the product to you.",

  "There are many factors that go into making this a successful project. First and most important is your support! Reaching the goal together will allow us all of the necessary resources to make the project come to life, printed and delivered to your ears. However, even after this project is funded, there are potential setbacks, such as production delays, scheduling and time constraints, musical challenges in the studio, and other details. \r\n\r\nSince the musicians on this album are spread out around the east coast and have separate gigging schedules, coordinating travel and rehearsal time is a challenge. Everybody has been working together on making this happen so that we are polished and ready to go when we get into the studio. We're all dedicated to making it a great record!\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge of this project is getting it funded, which is where you come in! I know we can do this with your help.\r\n\r\nAs a recent college graduate, this project is a huge financial undertaking for me. It's something I have wanted to do for a while, but until now have not had the time or resources to make it happen. This may be my last year (for now) living in Boston, which has been an important and influential time of my life. I would love to make this project a reality during this year as a way to represent and celebrate my time here, but it cannot happen without you!\r\n\r\nKickstarter is a valuable resource for independent artists like myself to raise money and support to make their creative projects come to life. However, Kickstarter is also ALL OR NOTHING - if the goal is not met by the end of the 30 day donation period, no money is made and we cannot go through with the project. I'm truly grateful for whatever amount of donation you are comfortable with giving. Your support for this project and all other independent art out there means so much to me!\r\n\r\n- John",
  "Due to the unique nature of this project I may encounter unforeseen obstacles and challenges. I am confident though that I will be able to meet and overcome these challenges. Here are a couple that may occur.\r\n\r\nThere may be a far greater number of participants than I originally accounted for. This may mean it will take significantly longer to complete the artwork and have it ready for show. But don't worry, I will work diligently until it is finished.\r\n\r\nIt may take some time to acquire a location to display the artwork. It is important that certain elements are ideal i.e. price (if applicable) and locale. I don't want to settle on this aspect of the project. However, I am sure it will only be a matter of time before I find a suitable location.\r\n\r\nFinally if you have any questions or concerns regarding One\u00b2 please do not hesitate to ask.

  "The biggest risk with any food related production, is ensuring that it is safe for consumers.

By having the funding to expand into a true commercial kitchen space, we ensure that our customers are receiving only the highest quality for their money. \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge is in finding your market for a specialized food item.

  "We are all proud of the music we write and play and we have no doubt that whatever comes from this will be a debut we're all proud of. But there is a lot of uncharted territory too. Our band members, while united by a common love for the music we make, come from very different musical backgrounds, ranging through jazz, progressive rock, classical, indie rock, and pop. A lot of work will go into reconciling our individual musical instincts to create a unified whole sound that is distinctly ours.\r\nAnother challenge is that we're still a very young band, most members having only worked together for less than a few months. Because of this, we don't know exactly what our sonic profile should sound like, and, perhaps more importantly, how to create a record that we can accurately reproduce live. That's what we have our producer for, fortunately, and his experience and wisdom will serve us well in the coming months as we explore the tracking together.\r\nThis band has a great work ethic. We rehearse constantly, communicate well, and fight like mad to make sure each song is perfect. It's these qualities that will carry us through any difficulties we encounter in the recording process. We are so excited to share a well-crafted recording with you soon!",

For more support I would take the absolute best photos I possibly can. With better quality photos I am sure to find support. Advertising could be very easy especially with all of todays social media. I will definitely use that to my advantage. Now timing is just a matter of being in the right place at the right time to capture that perfect photograph. For that I will just have faith that I am going to be in the right place.",
  "We have been hard at work getting all of our last minute details put together.  We just don't have the funds to finish the project without your help!

All of the pieces have to fall into place in order for us to get the physical copies out as soon as possible.  We will do our best to get the album out early in 2014, but the reality of creative projects is that we have to take the time necessary to get all the pieces in just right so that we don't disappoint you, our supporters, with half-hearted workmanship.  We will get the album out as soon as we possibly can!  We hope you can be patient while we give our all in these last steps of finishing up!",

I have been following a multitude of artists and their journeys in making enamel pins so I am not a stranger to the process.\n\nI have ordered merchandise (washi tape, acrylic charms, and lanyards) through Chinese manufactures so I understand that communication and transparency are very important. Delays due to customs, errors in making, and any other issues related to the production process may happen but I will make sure to be upfront with you my backers through these next few months.\n\nOnce the pins are in my possession I will be checking over them for any errors before shipment.

  "Production time is going to be the largest issue. I'm working with my manufacturer to make sure everything runs smoothly and quickly, but the more designs we make the longer it is going to take to get them all produced. \n\nI will try to wait until all pins are produced before shipping them out in order to avoid multiple packages being shipped to the same backer.

We could run into issues securing the location or delays with construction of the pickup window, etc. As the owners of the business we promise to keep you informed of any issues that may come up, and let you know how that will impact your ability to claim the reward for your pledge level. \n\nThe biggest risk to the business is not finding a suitable location within the time window provided in the rewards section. This would put the discounts, free coffee, and event rewards at risk, and those would be refunded.\n\nWe will fulfill all merch and product rewards should we be funded.",
  "If this Kickstarter does not meet its goal, my dream of completing the Kimchi Hotel will take an additional year or more to complete. I will continue to create my kimchi using the best traditional and authentic methods but it will be missing an important component that the Kimchi Hotel would provide. \n\nMore importantly, my desire to be a stronger contributor to the local community will not be realized.",

  "This isn't our first rodeo \u2013 We have worked with the same manufacturer who has always been not only very quick with deliveries but prints top-quality pins. We are always extremely happy with their work!\nHowever, we understand there are always risks. Pin shipment being delayed due to unforeseen circumstances or manufacturing problems, etc.\nThough these occasions do occur in pin printing we assure you if any problem does occur, we'll make sure to update all backers straight away and work diligently until the problem is corrected.",
  "The only risk is of delays in production, resulting in the pins taking longer to reach you.\nTo minimize this risk, I have found a manufacturer that I trust and have created a reasonable timeline to work with.\nIn the event that a delay does occur, I will communicate with backers in a timely manner and keep everyone updated on the situation.\nPlease note that the final products may have slightly different colors than the designs, based on the manufacturers availability.",

  "The book is complete, as are the illustrations, layout is underway and the printer is ready for us; so only the usual shipping delays, natural disasters, and unforeseen hiccups in the shipping process can stop us now. \r\n\r\nIf I meet the stretch goals there is more work yet to do. One short story needs to be finished, and its illustrations completed. I will also need to paint a cover illustration for The Cambriol Riddle. Then it will all go to layout and then the printers. Doing that and the audio books will take time beyond the reward delivery goal of July 2016, so if the stretch goals are met, the additional material may arrive as long as 6-8 months later than the rest. Whatever happens, I will mail the initial, non-stretch rewards as scheduled in July.",
  "As previously mentioned, this book is finished and waiting for an audience to discover Ruth and her struggle to answer the question: what makes someone or something beautiful.  The last hurdle proves to be financial, which can be overcome with your help.  My goal remains modest and the gifts reflect the cost of publishing and producing the final products. Thank you for taking the time and showing interest in reading about my novel.  For those who donated, I extend to you my immeasurable appreciation.",
  "With the book already complete, the only risk we could have is in the printing process and distribution, which we've researched thoroughly. We feel confident that we will be able to get the book distributed by the end of spring 2016.",
  "I have been managing small merchandise, answering customer queries, and shipping orders successfully for a few years now. However, this project relies on several factors that are outside of my control, and it is the first time I am making hard enamel pins. Any delays or issues that my manufacturer faces when creating the pins are beyond my reach, though I will ensure all backers receive regular updates. \n\nPlease understand that all pins are liable to minor changes in design and coloration depending on my manufacturer's ability to reproduce them. Of course, nothing will be radically changed, but be aware that my manufacturer may need to make small changes such as thickening some lines to ensure the pins' integrity, and that no color can be perfectly matched to the exact hue you see on your monitor. \n\nRest assured that all backers will receive high quality hard enamel pins, and any issues will be dealt with using my own funds if necessary. All backers will receive regular and honest updates, even if there are no issues to report.",

We will ensure we keep you all informed if any delays do occurs.\n\n\u2764Please double check your address to reduce the chance of a package being lost. Once a package is mailed, it is out of our control but we will do our best to assist and accommodate for any lost packages. \n\n\u2764Please note, to keep costs down the pins will be posted unregistered*. If you would like to get registered post please contact us so we can let you know how much extra you will need to add onto your pledge. \n\n*The five and six pin tiers automatically come registered for Australian/domestic pledgers as the postage cost worked out to be about the same as unregistered.  \n\n\u2764Backers are responsible for any extra duties or customs fees.",
  "I am using the same company for the pins as I did before, I believe they can deliver in the allotted time. Any delays caused would be very minimal, last time it was only by a few weeks as the volume of pins increased greatly from the start goal, and we got the pins out within 10 days despite the volume.",
  "There may be a time delay in receiving books due to problems in the supply chain. Other than this I am confident that we can meet the goal.",

  "Although I hope my project takes off,  I understand the potential risks and challenges.  Even a share can help spread the word to expand my audience to help support my product.",
  "The risks are my art does not sell due to the volume of tourists who are currently not visiting Spain (although I expect this to change) and being successful in how I promote my art on the World Wide Web.  I am very confident about my art, will work hard to make it a success for me and my pledgers. I am also realistic and whilst there may be slippage to certain dates I wish to set up and develop my art business the focus will still be on success.",
  "We've already had some challenges with this project, which mostly have to do with the permitting. It's expensive and long winded, but ultimately, we are confident in our ability to get this project completed! We've already worked so hard to get this going, and this is truly the final piece.",
  "Combining cats and coffee has presented challenges at every step of this process. Our main remaining risks and challenges are below: \r\n\r\nRisk 1 - If our Zoning Variance as an animal boarding facility is not approved. We will have an answer for this March 28th, which is during our Kickstarter. We have been in contact with the city planning department for awhile and knew this would be a box to check. The city officials have been extremely helpful and while it's always possible, we are not overly concerned about this being denied. If for some reason we are denied, and can't fight it in any other means, we will cancel the Kickstarter and no one will be charged. \r\n\r\nRisk 2 - If the Kickstarter fails. This would be bad on several levels. The biggest problem is that it would be an indication for us that Dayton is too small to support a unique business like a cat cafe. We have invested heavily with our time and emotions, and we've certainly sunk some costs into this dream. If the failure is extreme, we may call the project off. If the failure is slight, we would consider turning the upstairs into a residential or commercial rental to scale down the size and operating expenses of the catfe and press on. \r\n\r\nRisk 3 - If we run of our money before we open. We've laid out planned expenses, built spreadsheet after spreadsheet, and built a business plan. However, we still lose some sleep over this one because of the unknowns with a project of this type. Our building purchase and renovation costs are covered through one loan and we hope to raise the funds for the cafe equipment from this Kickstarter campaign. It would be amazing if we hit our stretch goals and were able to cover the furnishings as well with Kickstarter funds. Otherwise, the furnishings and first few months of expenses will be paid out of our savings but if we needed to take a small business loan on these items, we would be able to do so. \r\n\r\nRisk 4 - If large changes are requested with our building permit or from the health department. It would be uncomfortable, costly, and push our project back, but we would be able to keep moving and work within the requirements.",
  "Viel Arbeit liegt vor mir. Geeignete R\u00e4ume m\u00fcssen gesucht werden.

Dieser sollte gut erreichbar sein, Parkpl\u00e4tze und sanit\u00e4re Anlagen haben. Ein weiteres Risiko ist die Konkurrenz, denn diese schl\u00e4ft nicht.\r\nWerbung muss gemacht werden, denn der beste Raum bringt nichts, wenn keine Leute an die Kurse kommen.

  "As with every new business venture, there are risks and challenges. The good news is that we have the experience in running this business already - and know that what we are doing is tried and true.  We have a strong business plan and our new location is surrounded by rapid expansion of small businesses moving into the area. We also have the support of the community. We will be the first teaching kitchen of this kind in Baltimore City and the demand for the hands-on experience and for commercial kitchen space is very high. So what could go wrong?  \r\n\r\nWell, many things of course.  But the biggest hurdle we have is gathering all of the appropriate equipment required to meet health and safety codes.  This equipment is expensive and we want to make sure we are not sunk before we start.  By getting our necessary funding, we will have met our greatest hurdle.",
  "Of course, this is a big challenge for me. The first project, the first big set of orders.\nMoments  of risk are always there, but I hope I will do everything right.\nThe moment of risk I'm worried about is working with resin. Because resin is a very delicate material that sometimes gives me surprises and then I need to correct my work and it takes time. \nMake a coasters it\u2019s minimum three days job. First is painting and waiting that will dry, after decorating with seashells and hardest job coated with resin. Finally resin like dry 24 hours before will come shiny and beautiful coated. \nBut I already started work with my project and I hope I will do all at time.\nOf course arthritis is unpredictable and sometimes causes me to limit my work, but I hope the first time will be successful for me and everything will work out.\nThanks a lot about your understanding and support.",

  "RISK AND CHALLENGES, BUT WE HAVE SOLUTIONS \r\n\r\nAs with any exciting new venture there will be risks and challenges to overcome, the essential thing is to have a plan and to put it in action. Confident AFF will be an important platform for many filmmakers and audiences, we are committing hard work to it because we want to get it right!\r\nBelow is a list of the risks and challenges we have identified and how we are going to overcome them:\r\n\r\nRisk/challenge:\r\nProtecting intellectual property.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nWe want as many people to see the films but we also must ensure they are protected from piracy. We will do this by making sure the website we create is a secure platform to showcase the work. To view the films the audience will need to sign up and log in and will not be able to download the films. We will be spending a great part of our budget building a safe film community. \r\n\r\nRisk/challenge:\r\nTo ensure every submission is fairly judged.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nIt is essential that every submission is given equal attention. The Accents team will watch and review every film. The reviewers have all studied film or work in the industry and press so they bring a strong understanding of film. Once the initial selection is made the films will go to a judging panel. We aim to have a panel of judges who are all industry professionals of note who will be able to bring different areas of expertise.\r\n\r\nRisk/ challenge:\r\nWith over 3000 film festivals active in the world one could consider the market over saturated. We may face a challenge of creating interest in another film festival in an already saturated market.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nWe see Accents as a cutting edge, new platform for a film festival. We are looking for a particular type of filmmaker who does not have a dedicated film festival yet. Furthermore the online platform endures accessibility for the filmmakers and audience so we believe we will be able to reach a large crowd. Using part of our budget for promotion on sites such as Withoutabox, Filmfreeway we will be able to reach out to a large number of already active filmmakers.\r\n\r\nWe hope you want to share our vision and thank you for the vote of confidence. If you think we have missed anything out or wish to give us some information, please write to us!\r\ninfo@accentsfilmfestival.com",

  "The biggest challenge I foresee, once funds have been raised will be managing the quality and craft of the finished book. I hope to print and bind the book in Italy. I will attend all the stages of production to make sure it is of the best quality it can be.\r\n\r\nOnce publishing is complete my challenge will be distribution and promotion of the book to be. I\u2019ll need to work with distributors and independent bookshops whilst trying to gain publicity and a presence at book fairs around the world such as the NY and LA Art Book Fairs, Paris Book Fair and Offprint London.",
  "I originally planned this road trip for January, but having taken some advice about Kickstarter (and road/weather conditions) it has been postponed till the end of February/ beginning of March 2017.  \r\n\r\nThis has given me more time to prepare and plan thoroughly.  The only thing that can stop me now is illness or weather so bad that it's impossible to drive to some of the destinations.  However, this is a trip that can be postponed again if necessary, so it will definitely go ahead this year, even if it has to be done in short bursts.",
  "I am happy to say this is my second Kickstarter so I've been around this block before with both the funding and production timelines. I also have made many different enamel pins before so I am not new to working with my manufacturing partners or handling orders!\n\nI've chosen the manufacturers I'll be using after working with them for over a year and I trust them to work with me during the process to make the prettiest product I can! \n\nI am confident in my ability to communicate unexpected setbacks in production to backers as they occur and work to make everything run as smoothly as possible.\n\nPlease note that minor changes to the design may occur in production, and that the images presented here are just mock-ups for presentation purposes. I don't forsee any major issues, but should there be any my backers will be the first to know :)",
  "The risks and challenges that will come with completing my project are actors not being available and time (the film will be submitted to various film festivals around the United States so there are deadlines to be met) and daylight (since most of the filming will take place outside). I will overcome these obstacles by having a complete script, shot list, keep my actors up to date on every major or minor detail, and will have a detailed schedule for all the shooting dates.",

The challenge of creating this study is a great one, because today we do not have the resources to have a computer and cameras capable of offering what we are thinking of realizing. The community would participate in the creation of the works!",

  "The challenges I foresee are, not enough funds to complete my journey. The contingency in place for this is to max out every resource available to me, even if it sends me to walking the streets with a store buggy.\r\n\r\nThe other challenge I face is finishing the audio and finishing touches to the movie before the deadline. I know the audio students who are helping me make this happen are motivated-after all, their careers depend on the success of my film.\r\n\r\nI may not have the answers to every challenge I might face but rest assured, I will find a way to make it happen. My success rate for life is 97%. I can prove it!",
  "Several risks can come into play during the filming of this video. We will all be riding our motorcycles which is an inherent risk in itself. Another risk is that equipment could be stolen in the journey. To overcome these two risks, we will be staying in our group making sure everyone stays as safe and aware as is possible. A challenge we will face is getting the right shots. To overcome this challenge, we plan on placing several cameras on different motorcycles to get as many different angles as possible. We will also have a handheld camera at the festival to document that portion.",
  "The risks associated with a project like this, are very simple, permits and insurance are generally the main obstacles and in most cases, remedied by funding and tenacity. I have tackled things of this nature in some pretty hostile environments and been able to pull off my goals, even when the venue itself was not being supportive. In this case I don't foresee any negative energies from The City of Glendale or the Arizona community as a whole. The general consensus is, very supportive and I am poised to bring this to fruition provided it gets funded properly. The \"Buzz\" on the streets is picking up and this is our final necessity, before our last months big push.",

  "As an existing business our risks and challenges differ slightly from a startup because we have an existing customer base.  \n\nFor us one of our biggest risks is our own success, if we do our job properly many of the businesses who use our space will move on to owning their own roasters.  Part of the reason for moving and ultimately the kickstarter is to get into a larger facility that allows us to cater to new and more customers.  \n\nTime is always a challenge, there never seems to be enough.  We know that some of our rewards will be demanding on our time, but we feel we are up to the challenge.  Plus, we love what we do and sharing it others is part of what we love about our jobs.\n\nCompetition is actually good for business as it forces you to be innovative and creative in how you operate.  Aspect is not the only collaborative roasting space in Portland, we are however the best.",

So I went to culinary school. \r\n\r\nNow with a degree in Culinary arts, a Bachelors in Nutrition and 5 years of high volume experience directing a school lunch program I feel very comfortable with the prospect. High volume cooking is my comfort zone and soup is my best friend.\r\n\r\nI have secured a partnership with a local grocery to provide raw ingredients and I have made another with a local nonprofit that distributes food to need distribution points. They both assure me I will have sufficient supply and demand to be viable.",

  "There are many risks, as there are many costs to bear.\r\nThe greatest risk comes from reducing, if not completely abandoning, my current job, which I hate but that gives me life! the current expenses and needs of my children involve responsibility and I do not embrace the idea of a new life with unconsciousness and superficiality. To carry out this project I would need to buy materials, colors, woodworking equipment, find a place where I can work, tackle the fiscal expenses for starting up the business. I estimated that to take the step safely I would need \u20ac 50000. I do not ask here a figure like this, also because I imagine it would be extremely difficult to get it in 30/40 days .. but the requested contribution could certainly encourage me on the path to a new activity and to a significant change in my life.",
  "The artwork for the pins is complete and I have gotten pricing from my pin manufacturer, so there are only two areas where there are possible risks/challenges during this process:\r\n\r\nProduction: there can always be errors in manufacturing with any pin. My manufacturer offers a guarantee that should there be more than 10% \"seconds\" in the pins I receive, they will remake the pins with issues at no additional charge. I have had excellent success with them in the past several runs of producing pins. Should there be a manufacturing issue that results in pins having to be remade, it will delay backers receiving their pins -- but I think it is better to receive a beautiful pin even if there is a few weeks' delay.\r\n\r\nShipping: as I am shipping from Canada, it is likely that most backers will be in the USA or overseas, which means that packages will have to cross an international border and could be delayed by customs. It also means that tracking may be too cost-prohibitive to offer, so I will not be able to update process of packages as with a tracked package. I will have to ask for backers' patience in receiving their pins as it will not be as speedy as they are used to receiving packages sent from within their own country. And should there be any issues in receiving the pins not accounted for by postal slowness, I will be happy to work with backers to make sure missing or damaged pins are replaced.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, I'll be happy to try and answer them to the best of my ability. Thank you!",
  "Biggest risk is going to be acquiring the gear that would make this project look incredible. Another challenge will be the set design, being a group of students and indie filmmakers, our pockets aren't the fullest. We have just enough to pay cast and crew currently. We plan to use this Kickstarter to help overcome these worries along with the drive that the cast and crew have to make this project blossom.",

  "The first challenge will be finding a suitable space. Midtown KC is YUM\u2019s home and I am not looking to relocate outside this area. \r\n\r\nThe most challenging aspect will be the move and transition. Setting up a new space that meets all city and health department requirements\r\ntakes time and money. Reopening with new team members and increased production will be a learning experience. Fortunately, I am very organized and I have experience managing others.\r\n\r\nI am willing and able to face these challenges head-on. After all, nothing great comes without hard work!",
  "If anyone would like to donate their talent/skills to help bring the Cider Barrel back to life I would be extremely appreciative and over the top excited. That would cut costs drastically.\r\n\r\nIf I am unable to meet my minimum goal, I will have to change the plans completely. I could rent out a local commercial kitchen and sell my prepackaged goods at the Cider Barrel but lets face it..it won't be the same. I would not be able to open the building for customers to finally come inside of the Cider Barrel as it would be dangerous (and against many rules :) . I would also have to change my plans of partnering with local schools as well as creating oportunities within the special needs community and that is one of the main reasons I want to do this. \r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure...I am a hard worker and will do any and everything in my power to make this happen :)",

The biggest hardship is having a Coherent, Entertaining Novel, worthy of your investment written and edited before that date.\n\nIt will be self-published, with the expectation that we will not have any editor or agent to help represent it becoming a reality. We have no desire to waste your time and understand the massive amount of effort that will be necessary to make this a reality!",
  "I already have the images for this exhibition and prints for some of the images i wish to exhibit.\r\n\r\nI will still have to decide on how to present the work in the space.  I would ideally like to mount the images on aluminium but that will really depend on affordability and how many images I choose to exhibit within the space. A more affordable option would be to mount onto foam board.  I may chose instead to show more images, unmounted which worked well when i displayed smaller prints at our interim show at the university.",
  "There are very few risks. Because of the limited quantities, I should have no trouble filling orders. The biggest risk is probably getting a paper cut and that's unlikely because its really thick paper.\r\n\r\nAll the images have been completed! I've used the printmaker before and the results are excellent. I will replace anything that is damaged in shipping.",
  "Traveling to television and radio stations to promote my book has been a challenge. I did not anticipate the financial challenges that come with promoting a book.

  "La crise sanitaire de COVID-19 peut \u00e9ventuellement retarder le projet de quelques semaines, mais pour l'instant tout s'annonce bien, sans retard ni probl\u00e8mes. Le deuxi\u00e8me risque serait de ne pas atteindre le  montant minimum que nous avons fix\u00e9 sur Kickstarter de 5600\u20ac Car cela annulerait la collecte de fonds. C'est pour cela que nous avons fix\u00e9 ce montant sur Kickstarter  car il nous paraissait beaucoup plus  raisonnable et atteignable que 22000\u20ac, il repr\u00e9sente un quart du montant total du projet.

  "We have completed an orchestral recording project like this at Kickstarter before, and since we have ALREADY recorded the main materials of this album, the risks of this crowdfunding are minimal. However, if the extended pledge were met, we still would have to consider the coronavirus crisis before we proceeded to the additional recording. As of the end of March 2020, the Hungarian government has restricted major public activities and gatherings, and the orchestra has stopped all activities until mid-April 2020 at least, and, depending on the virus crisis, that might extend. In addition, the worldwide shipping of the physical rewards might be affected too, depend on where you live. This has been an incredibly difficult time for musicians, and we would like to support all those who have provided wonderful music for this project.

  "We have organised a host of other experiential at events on very tight budgets with no funding from government sources so are confident we can present a well organised and successful event. However it is important to take into account that things do not always go to Plan A so we always work out contingency plan. In terms of rewards we have an agreement with a great printer in place who has shown us samples of prints mounted and we are very pleased with quality and finish. We also have selected imagery and are pleased with overall look finish and quality. If there is a delay with prints outside our conrol we shall communicate regularily with all our backers . we shall also update all our backers with brief daily update on progress preparations for the event.",
  "At this time, if the project is successfully funded, there should be nothing preventing me from completing the work and the rewards on time. I've been in communication with a local print shop and all rewards have been priced and will be ready to produce as soon as I can provide the imagery.\r\n\r\nA venue for the exhibition has not yet been selected, but this will be resolved once I have enough work in progress to share with a prospective gallery.",

  "Opening a restaurant is never easy, and we are aware that many restaurants fail within a short time after opening.\r\nBoth of us have experience in restaurants of varying levels, and also in other industries, all of which will complement this venture.  We have a great team of experts behind us who are helping make our vision a reality.\r\n\r\nBringing dogs to bars and restaurants is technically illegal in NYC - however, as of March 2015, it is at the restaurant owner's discretion to decide whether dogs are allowed in outside areas or not (http://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2015/S4327A)\r\n\r\nOfficially though, dogs cannot be in the areas where food is served or prepared. We have found loopholes to get around this regulation, though.\r\n\r\nSince we are planning our first location in Brooklyn, we are aware of the potentially cold winters here - therefore, we will make our outdoor area as pleasant as possible - serving hot drinks (think mulled wine and hot cider), providing blankets and a source of heat (heat lamps, covered fire pits etc).\r\nHowever, we will, of course, have an indoor area as well.\r\nEssentially, our (human) guests will go to our food/drink establishment, order whatever they'd like and then take it to the seating area next door/outside. We will basically be running two businesses under the same roof.\r\n\r\nHuman and dog safety are our top priority and we'll have a Bark Ranger on site who will interfere if trouble arises, ultimately, dog owners are responsible for their dog's actions.",

  "With every project there are so many things that can go write or wrong. As a team we will work hard to overcome these. Below are some of our worries. \r\n\r\nWriting - We have set ourselves an ambitious writing schedule but it is one that we think we/I can do. I wrote Lollipops and Ass Whoopings in 10 days and that was 20,000 words. With a dedicated writing space and time to write (which means I'm accountable to you all) the challenge is doable. \r\n\r\nSchedule Restrictions - In order to meet our aim of getting this all done ready for the Academic Year in 2019 we have a tight schedule to meet. It will rely on the writing going smoothly and of course this Kickstarter getting our target. We want to do it by the next academic year as we can speak at Freshers Fayres and Schools about the book and being a writer. \r\n\r\nBudget - It is a tight budget. I won't lie to you. It relies solely on the fact that the team will be volunteering a lot of hours and things going smoothly.\r\n\r\nWe really want this project to work and we share your concerns. If you have any, please feel free to share them.",

  "Il y a bien entendu des risques, d\u00e8s lors que vous vous lancez des d\u00e9fis. Me concernant il s'agit avant tout de risque financier. Effectivement quitter son travail pour faire de la peinture c'est assez os\u00e9.\r\nPour relever ce challenge je m'investirai \u00e0 fond dans la r\u00e9alisation de nouvelles toiles, et j'utiliserai l'autre moiti\u00e9 de mon temps \u00e0 la communication.\r\n\r\nThere are of course risks, as long as you challenge yourself. Concerning me it is above all about financial risk. Actually leaving work to paint is pretty daring.\r\nTo meet this challenge, I will invest myself in the realization of new paintings, and I will use the other half of my time in communication.",
  "As with my previous kick-starter campaign, I don't like to take big risks. I ask for help at the last minute, well after I've done everything I can. (Although one day, I hope to try new methods!) Therefore there are practically no risks for backers.\r\n\r\nThe film has already been written, shot, edited and scored. We are in the absolute final stages of audio mixing, which will probably be done by the time this kick-starter is launched. I will then test it with Chris on the projector, make any adjustments, test again (I usually aim for first or second test to be the final one), then it's done. If I die, the show goes on. If the cinema gets fried by a dragon, then we might have a problem.\r\n\r\nSince the campaign ends the day before the premiere, the film is scheduled to be tested within a week from now. The only risks are technical ones, computers deciding to fight me, which I am pretty used to by now! If some horrific freak technical problem happens and the Premiere can't go on, then I would know well before the kick-starter would end, and would not allow it to take the money from its backers in the first place. I have already started production on the rewards, which are relatively easy to complete at this stage from previous experience.\r\nVHS is a bit of a tricky one, but we reckon we've solved it doing some tests.\r\nWhen the film is on that projector, tested and given the nod, it stays there. It sleeps until the day our supporters arrive, and then, IT'S TIME FOR THE SWORD!!",
  "The most challenging part of this project since day one has been editing. It has been hard to find the right editors, and it has been time-consuming to fix the manuscript. While the project is in its final stages of editing, there is still the risk of delay in the editing stage although there is not a chance that will be delayed further.\r\nHowever, the risks and challenges are after editing. Marketing requires me going out there promoting The Children of Lindisfarne. I am ready to meet these challenges with confidence in my networking efforts that I have made over the course of the last two years, and my expertise in the publishing industry.",

  "1. Manufacturing problems\r\n Manufacturing can require a lot of expensive trial and error, with\r\ncost of materials and availability of essential tools changing regularly. This is why we've built in a margin for error into our Kickstarter goal.\r\n\r\n2. Design flaws \r\nWhile we have gone to every effort to predict how device foo will work in the real world, the reality is, we're Kickstarting this because it's never been seen before. That means that unpredictable problems with the design will likely come up. There is a risk, that one of these\r\ncould be problematic, however, by using the most advanced computer aided design techniques, we've minimized this risk to the level that anyone can. We've worked through many issues before and don't plan on stopping if we hit a roadbump. We will always keep you updated of new developments.\r\n\r\n3. Illness / injury / death \r\nUnlikely, but this is a small team, and it's always possible that\r\nsomething could happen to one of us. That said, we have a team precisely so create strength beyond what any one of us could create. In the event of something getting in the way of one us completing the project, we are all committed to pulling together, taking up the slack, and ensuring this project gets done. Period.\r\n\r\nIs there some other potential issue you're wondering about?\r\nIf you're wondering, others probably are, too!

  "80% of the filming is already finished. Yippee! No risk there. The remaining footage, however, will be a challenge, but it's one I'm prepared to tackle. In particular, cuttlefish and squid will be difficult to film. They are finicky creatures, and I'll need excellent macro lenses to capture the ultra-fast movements of their chromatophores as they change color.\r\n\r\nI'm confident, though, that with a photographer's patience, artist's eye, and engineer's technique, plus the help of the invertebrate experts at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, we'll be able to capture this tricky footage.",
  "Possible bumps in the road are mainly the time it will take to get the paintings done and the cards printed. I have no control over how long it will take the printer to complete the cards. \r\n\r\nI also may need to have some of the art supplies shipped to me which could lead to further delays. \r\n\r\nI don't think any of this will create any real problems.",
  "As with any new business venture, this project comes with many risks for me personally and for you as a backer. \r\n\r\nThe first risk for #MakeArtHappen is that I won't reach my funding goal of \u00a32000. I've thought carefully about this goal and have done lots of maths to work out that by reaching this goal I will be able to provide backers with a quality product at the end of this project, as well as have enough to finance my trip to BCTF. \r\n\r\nIf I don't reach my funding goal, I will still be going to BCTF, but I will have to find financing elsewhere - I have several different funding ideas on the go right now, so my hope is that between all of them I will get to BCTF and have enough products to make some trade deals. \r\n\r\nIf I exceed my funding goal, this will mean a bigger range of products will be on display at BCTF, increasing my chances of making an impression on traders. When I signed up for BCTF, I was told that often new exhibitors don't make much money until the second or even third time they attend, so further money now will continue to be invested in my business for the future.",

  "I have a great relationship with my manufacturers. I trust in their ability to offer me amazing quality products. However, sometimes the factory can and does make mistakes. Mistakes may be incorrect plating or color discrepancies. These may delay the production of pins, pushing back shipping times. \r\nwith trail and error in creating pins with this manu in the past, I myself now know what to look out for before it happens. This should help in minimizing any issues or delays.  If for some reason we do hit some snags along the way, backers will be updated frequently so that you have peace of mind.\r\n\r\nMy greatest concern with these pins is that I have never used the pearl effect before. On seeing examples of the effect, I believe the pins will look incredible. However if for some reason the effect is not up to my quality standards, the designs may change for the best final product.\r\n\r\nPlease also note, that the shipping cost does not include a tracking number. After funding a tracking number can be arrange with extra cost.

Ainsi, pas de craintes \u00e0 avoir quant \u00e0 une \u00e9ventuelle annulation du film !",
  "The risk of this project are low. It's all about creating a work calendar and sticking to it.",
  "Possible challanges - what I already done and still need to do.\n\nRegarding the people that will be involved in the project, some scheduling will need to be done. I don't see this as a major risk since I'll mostley coorporate with models I personally know and lives nearby, but unexpected circumstances such as the pandemic might get in the way. Since I have quite an extensive deadline I will most certainly be done by time anyway.\n\nTechnical aspects\nPhotoshoots of this type depends on both people and technology. Memory cards can be corrupted, equipment can break. I will do my very best to prevent this from happening and store my photos on several disks. \n\nProducts and procedure\nI have previously used the same photo lab as I will in this project, and always been satisfied with the quality as well as the delivery time. For shipping I will use the Swedish postal service, PostNord, and when possible within the prizingr range use trackable shipping and / or stamped mail that include insurance of the photographs. If any issues arise, I will communicate them directly and always make sure to solve them as soon a as possible.",
  "I have conquered many roadblocks to get this far. I know that I can succeed in this. I won't allow myself to fail.",
  "I am currently working solely on this project so I see no reason that it would be disturbed. Once the project is funded I'll have enough money to hire the studio and start producing the artwork.",
  "The only challenges with my project at present is getting through the developmental editing phase. I am in the first stages of the developmental editing process, and am eager to move forward with help.\r\n\r\nOnce the manuscript has been edited, I can submit it to the agents that have requested it.",
  "This project is fairly low risk, assuming we get full funding.  Everyone on the team knows each step to bringing this CD to market and it would be exactly like the previous recordings we've released.",
  "The potential risk with creating larger painting is time.  With any project a time element becomes something that is always a fear factor.  Depending on backer's request for competed works of art...will I, as the artist, have sufficient time to plan, create, and complete multiple works of art.  \r\nIn order to overcome this obstacle I have set aside a month's time frame between the final funding date and the estimated time of delivery.",
  "There is a possibility that it will take some time before land can be purchased due to  the cost of the land.",
  "The biggest risk is getting the book published and subsequently purchased. I have pre-vetted a publishing company who is interested in working with the book and will help promote the book along with my efforts. It is my goal to get this book published through multiple sources electronic and physical copies in multiple stores!",
  "The risk that this project will fail is not that big. If this fundraising will not be enough to complete the project, I will write it anyway. All right, that will take longer, but I sort of see this as a duty.\r\n\r\nThe other risk, is that it will not sell a whole lot of copies. Well, here is a challenge, it just have to be damn good and it will!!",
  "It has been a difficult way till now but the first stall is opened your help is going to allow me go to the next step an be able to achieve  a good position in the sector. I have learned so much about my customers and now is the time to offer them the products they want in the way they need.",
  "Risks:  1. Renovating old houses always uncovers things that need to be addressed. We have budgeted low in this area and we hope that works out for us. 2. There are already to go food places in town though none remotely similar to what we want to create and none specialize in offering local food (to our knowledge).\r\n\r\nChallenges: 1. Changing behaviors. The winter traffic in Kingfield on Friday afternoons, Saturdays, and Sundays can be so thick, it takes a couple minutes to pull out into it safely. Drivers seem to have tunnel vision when it comes to getting through town. Grabbing their attention, getting them to stop, and get their regular business will be a challenge. 2. Getting locals out in the winter. When it gets dark at 4, getting people out and off the couch will be a challenge. We have some ideas to make this happen.",
  "Doing this project as a foreigner in Vietnam is a challenge by itself. The huge cultural differences as well as the different approaches of getting things done, the standards of production and execution, are far from what we are used to in Europe. This is an exciting, but at times also very frustrating challenge. But having lived part-time in Vietnam for over 6 years now, and with the help of my partner, who has worked in Mui Ne for 9 years and speaks enough of the language to communicate with the builders and local authorities about all issues, we are confident to follow through with the project. There will always be hick-ups and therefore our time frame to finish the project isn't set in stone, but with your help and our motivation it will hopefully all come together by the end of this year.",
  "I am starting from the beginning. And I need the money to start.\r\nPeople are the most important to me. And I need them most.\r\nBut money is important too.\r\nIf 300 000 people shares \u00a31, I will get the money to start.\r\nThanks to the internet everything is possible.\r\nAnd later I will need to pay bills, taxes - I believe I will make the money needed on selling muffins, teas, coffes.",
  "The biggest challenge I face is the rather steep learning curve of movie making beyond the purely creative realm. How do you promote a movie, what are the options to distribute it, what is Netflix's phone number? It seems the answer to all this kind of stuff is getting in touch with pros that know how. I am not the best networker. My biggest hope is that this Kickstarter will help me find kindred spirits that have experience in these areas. The other biggest challenge is nobody likes heavy metal anymore, but all I can do is follow my muse and see where it leads.",
  "I think the biggest risks and challenges that come along with this project is the elements themselves.  Canadian winters can be harsh and unforgiving depending on the location.",
  "There's very little risk in this project - basically if I don't hit the target I won't publish the book. The only risk is that I will lose faith in my writing if this isn't a success. With your help I won't have to worry about any of this, so here's hoping that there are generous people out there who want to read my book.",
  "Current Project Status:\r\nWe are nearing the final stages of our site designs and are working to submit plans to the city to begin the approval process around August. In addition we are in our financing stage and working diligently to ensure Mutts and Mugs is opened on time.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason the project does not go through then your memberships will be fully refunded.",
  "The risks for this project are very low. As mentioned in the video, I attempted to launch the project. The one and only thing making this idea a reality is the lack of a modern computer. Once that is in place, my passion for teaching and dedication to the project will be unstoppable.",
  "With permission from the landlord to paint the mural, our risks and challenges are, thankfully, at a minimum. We simply need to raise the funds to purchase the products and ensure the time available for Caitlin to complete this work of art.",

  "The biggest challenge thus far is the initial printing of the prints.",
  "The challenge of this project is to really bring people together to connect with each other. This will rely heavily on the space of the venue and the size of the framed prints to create impact with the audience. \r\n\r\nIf we are unable to reach our goal, the project would still become reality, but would be on a much smaller scale and quality which would defeat the point of trying to bring as many people together as possible out of the web of anti-social networking. \r\n\r\nWe have a venue, printers, framers volunteers ready to go. We just need the funding to bring this to life.",
  "The risks are always there as with any project. Mostly with a project like this it would be with printing problems and delays. I feel I have done my research and have my bases covered. There is always scheduling and booking mistakes when shooting with models but I have given myself enough time to deal with those types of problems. Any other problems that arise I will keep you, my backers, informed of any change in schedule.",
  "Risks and challenges\r\n\r\nthere is little to no risk involved, images are ready to go as soon as the project completes and the money deposits.",
  "Finding space would be the normal risk and challenges to head off. Would want the space to be as transportation friendly as possible.\r\nWith enough space we have at least two stories for comfort and to keep things up to code.\r\nNext challenge would be obtaining our food and liquor license. Already started comparing zoning regulations and some real estate. Worst case we find space and open without the libation of alcohol till the license can be obtained.",
  "* There may be some delays in prints depending on the amount I will have to print and ship.\r\n\r\n* Shipping overseas will take longer than shipping within the USA.",
  "Berkeley Bob's will have to move from its' current location because of reasons that cannot be controlled by the current owner and hopeful future owner. This sounds like a dreaded problem but Bob's is ready to grow and could use the extra space. We already have a new home in mind, therefore urgency is key!",
  "This CD will be the fifth of the Great Lakes Series, and the 7th CD recorded by the band. We arranged for a fantastic venue for recording the music, and have completed raw audio recording sessions in late July. We are confident that the recording went well. Post production and CD duplication and distribution should not pose a risk.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, with the added experience of successful 'Ontario', 'Michigan' and 'Erie' Kickstarter campaigns, we have a full understanding of what is involved .",
  "Although projects like this have many risks and challenges, I am happy to say that the CD is completely done and ready for production/distribution!  As soon as we raise enough money for the label fee, MSR Classics can begin production and the CD will be available for sale shortly afterwards.",
  "There is a certain risk, the weather, site closures, distances to travel but those are overcome by proper research.  Another risk is, of course, the funding. The technical challenge is the photographic equipment, to be at the right place at the right time.\r\nAll this has been overcome in various projects in the past, sometimes with delays but always completed.",
  "It's my first project but I promise I can do it with you guy's support. I will have a home of my own to write about.",
  "My biggest challenge is writing it on time. There is no risk because I have all of you for support",
  "I think some of the biggest challenges were gonna face once we have this book edited and published is really gonna just involve getting it out there on the shelves. were gonna start out selling it mostly online and once we start getting enough good reviews on our work then were gonna take our book to some of the major bookstores like Barns and Noble. but were confident that with our hard work and dedication it wont be long until people are seeing our book on shelves around the world.",
  "Short of injuring myself, and being unable to record on the given dates (in which case the project would be delayed rather than cancelled), I do not anticipate any risks or challenges with the project.",
  "To be honest, I don't think that there is a ton of risk with my project. The recording is already underway, the artwork is secured, and it should be in production by the Fall. The only things that might derail the timeline slightly are if a guest artist backs out or if the tracks aren't mixed/mastered on the current timeline.  Having said that, I have full confidence in the team I've assembled to deliver the project on time and with professional quality!",
  "After the project is successfully funded, the recording will definitely happen. In the event that for some unseen reason (an act of Nature, for example, or if Dean Williamson falls ill), the entire production will be rescheduled. This production will be under contract with the Nashville Musicians Association in Nashville, TN, so once we disperse the funds, the project will definitely go forward, no matter what.",
  "The risks of completing my project from the standpoint of producing a show are purely funds related, if my funds are low i'll have to do all of the work in-house, if i'm able to hire some help, i'll delegate when necessary.\r\nFrom the stand point of producing rewards for pledges, i'm using a specialist company to produce my rewards.\r\nIf my Kickstarter project is not successful, I will send prints framed behind glass and be unable to attend the opening.",

  "Here our plan for the movie: shoot in summer 2017, postproduction after that. The idea is to have 4/6 months for the visual effects.\r\nWhen the distributor will see the movie completed, probably we will have a version in dvd and/or blu-ray. In any case all the backers will have a digital version of the movie.",
  "We've overcome a bunch of challenges in our journey already, from finding our production facility to the months of working with the USDA to get our flavors approved. We're so close but we still need some help, YOUR help!\n Our challenge now is to raise enough funds to get this snack train moving and keep it moving: we want to begin producing our chips, get them into our customers hands and not have to halt production once it\u2019s started or compromise on our vision of quality and flavor. \n\nYour support will allow us to get the first USDA-approved production run of Steak Chips started as soon as possible so we can deliver them this summer and keep on producing without any hiccups.\n\nWhile we guarantee the delivery of your rewards, we can\u2019t ensure the exact date your Steak Chips will be delivered due to the supply chain issues during this worldwide pandemic. However, we will do everything we can to get your order to you in a timely manner.",
  "Current wholesale supply issues have staggered multiple industries. Concurrently, the shipping industry has also taken many hits as protocols and staffing issues have slowed many supply lines. Controlled production will enable us to overcome many challenges, as will planning ahead and sourcing local when possible.",
  "As with any start up business, there are always risks involved. But again, we hope our passion for craft beer, the community, and our experience, alongside your support will make us successful. \n\nFirst and foremost, if we cannot reach our goal of $15,000, your financial contribution will not be processed. If our goal is met, we'll pay a small fee to kickstarter and use the funds for start up costs of Mythmaker!",

  "Perhaps the most expensive thing we have for the event is the ourfits and props/sets that we need. Many of those who come to do pictures do not have the nice clothing or formal wear that makes for a good family picture. I have had kids in tattered jeans and shirts show up for the pictures. The way their eyes shine when you pull out a new looking dress shirt or suit, it is almost as amazing as the pictures themselves.",
  "As you have mentioned, every project comes with its own unique risk and challenge. In my case, being first in something that was not done before is one of the most crucial risks. I am not producing a CD of Christmas songs for the holiday season -- something, that has been proved to be popular and commercially profitable. No.\r\n\r\nI am trying to produce a CD of a rare collection of the music that has never been heard before. I am an independent artist and no record label is involved - therefore, I take all the responsibilities AND risks on my own. It is scary and exciting at the same time.\r\n \r\nThis project has been in the air for more than 2 years and finally, I get to its core and can fully concentrate on it. There were a lot of delays, unplanned circumstances but now it is my main project on the table. \r\n\r\nSince the CD is almost done, it should not take too much time before the world sees the final product. It is a challenge, and a journey that takes a lot of energy but I am thrilled to reach the final destination point towards May 2017.\r\nI am pretty sure it will be a success -- at least, from my part I have done my best. I hire the best professionals, and this funding from Kickstarter will insure the quality, speed and success of this project.\r\n\r\nI sincerely can not wait to share this CD  with my community -- and by my community, I mean, Armenian, American, Russian, Canadian... \r\n Because, there are no borders in music. And this CD is about to prove it.",
  "We plan to release our album as soon as possible. The date of publishing might be even earlier than planned one for May 2017.",
  "We have people coming we just need more advertising.We are renting so we are not stuck in a lease we can get out and just go to homes but we started doing better having a studio for people to go to and we can offer more this way.People do pay now before they come so that helps us not having to buy more stock before hand till we get a down payment.",
  "The only risks would be time, I'll post updates and photos as I go along in the process. I'm looking at 3 months to complete!",
  "It is true, even after this project is fully funded, my book may not get published. I am really committing this summer to finish my story. I will be pushing hard at publishing companies along with my contact. \r\nEven if my book does not get published, any of you can shoot me a message if you'd like to read it, and I'll send you a copy of it through an email so you can enjoy it.\r\nAlso, The cover photo I have is not going to be the book cover. The book cover has yet to be drawn, but it will be of the main character Cain, with his spiritual companion he chooses behind him.",
  "Although I have the complete support of my family the main challenge will be to write this novel in the presence of my nine month old daughter. She is AMAZING and I continually want to share with her everything that is good in this world. What this means is that this projects' greatest risk is a delay in its release. But, I also believe that in seeing how my daughter interacts with the world around her I will be even more inspired to share both her great grandmother's story and the magic that was passed on to me.",
  "I have dealt with Manufacturers from overseas for the past two years and I have full confidence in the one I have selected for this campaign.\n\nShould any bumps in the road be hit such as shipping delays, damaged pins, etc, I'll be in contact with my manufacturers to resolve the issue alongside with keeping my backers updated. (I'll be posting Updates here alongside my twitter @ Triangle_Art_JW)",
  "The biggest risk that will be faced is failure.... I could do everything I need to do to get this bakery up and running and anything can happen to destroy all progress. I mean look at us now, so many people are losing their businesses because of this crazy last year we had and here I am like \"Give me money too!\" Like I am anything special? All I can say, is that I will do whatever I need to do to make this bakery a success (except go on tv, I am sorry guys, I really do not think I can do it). And to me success is just plain surviving. If the business lives, supports my family and helps some people (and animals) along the way then I will say the bakery is a success. All we can do is adapt and not give up, and with the people I have in my life, I am confident we can make this work. (On the other hand, if you donate to this and we completely fail you will have lost all the money you invested and leave with a t-shirt.)",
  "Trying something new always involves risks.  \nSince we started our farm we have faced- and overcome- many obstacles.  Our first syrup season was the worst maple production year in recorded history, so we began developing ways to sell & market our products directly that increased awareness & opportunities for maple syrup.  We focused on innovation & experience instead of competing against friends & neighbors on price.  A catastrophic flood wiped out our roads and washed away our sap collection equipment- we built bridges, improved infrastructure, and rebuilt our trails in a sustainable manner to better weather the next storm.  COVID cancelled in-person events, our largest source of revenue; we spent almost a year developing Embark so we could bring the good energy of our forest directly to you.  Resilience is built into the very fabric of who we are as people and as a company.\n\n\nPotential Risks & Challenges:\n-Supply Chain Disruptions causing delays:\nOne of the biggest challenges we have faced are supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic, which may result in production delays.  All of our ingredients we have either produced directly on our farm or have built relationships with other producers to secure the quality & quantities needed for our launch.  There are some factors, such as packaging timelines, that are beyond our control.  If any delays do occur,  we will stay in constant contact with our backers, and will have your adventure packs to you as soon as they are available.  Above all, we will stand behind delivering a quality experience.\n\n- Reward Fulfillment Delays:\nOver the years we have developed efficient order fulfillment systems for our current line of maple syrup, and  we are well prepared to meet the shipping demands we anticipate with this project.  There is the potential that this project is successful beyond our wildest dreams and we need an extra few days to get everything shipped.  If this happens we will redirect our crew to making sure everything is shipped as soon as possible.\n\n- Scheduling Conflicts & Weather Variables\nWe are extremely excited to share our beautiful forest with everyone who chooses an Embark Experience reward.  We will have a schedule of available times for you and your group to visit the farm, and will do everything we can to accommodate your scheduling preferences, but it is possible that you may not get your first choice weekend, or that the weather is not what you hope for.  In the event of weather cancellations we will do our best to reschedule a time that works for you.",
  "There are always risks in publishing. The biggest and most obvious one: the book simply doesn't sell. It's a risk that everyone from small presses to the big five publishing houses face. There is simply no way of knowing what the public wants to read. For me, I plan to listen to the public in terms of reviews they leave on websites such as Amazons and GoodReads, and the feedback I get via email. If it's quality of book, I'll address. But mostly, I'll continue writing and producing books. And hopefully, either I'll connect with readers or one day get the good sense to stop trying.",
  "Every start up has risk involved. We have minimized these risks with your contributions. The only thing that could stop us from fulfilling the promised items would be if we were unable to get the product to create. With that being said, once we receive funding we will be producing the products for our backers first and get them sent out.",
  "There aren't a whole lot of risks that I can foresee. Most of the shooting is complete and I've been working on the visual effects for more than a year. Although it's been slow, the fx are coming along.  With funding, things will go a lot faster because, as I stated earlier, I can hire people to help render and/or rent a faster computer.",
  "Some of the risks and challenges will be to actually have the cast I've picked out to be the ones to actually do the movie. Some of the movies great success will depend on that fact, but I know that once they've been able to read about this project and take a good look at it, they will definitely like what they see, and will more than likely hop on board with this project.",
  "One of the risks that I might face is not being able to sell my product after it is created. To overcome this, I plan to get out of my comfort zone and be more social and open in the selling of my product. I want this to be as successful as it can be. Another risk and/or challenge might be the fact that I won't be able to raise enough money. In order to overcome this obstacle, I will have to organize my priorities and give myself and my different projects certain budgets.",
  "There are no significant risks involved in this project as the deliverables and aims are straight forward!",
  "We cant think of any at this time",
  "It has taken me six years to write \"Hope Remains.\" Many sections including the beginning have been redrafted over 50 times. Truly, writing is rewriting. That said, I'm not sure how many more times I will need to rewrite \"Hope Remains\" after my favorite editor, Chris Roerden finishes making edits.\r\n\r\nIf anything, one of my outstanding characteristics is perseverance. Perhaps, that's why I've chosen the topic of hope. We all have this quality in us; now I ask you, my friends, new and old, to have faith in this project. I certainly have.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
  "We are creating something new, so we recognize there will be some unforeseen challenges and obstacles. Luckily, this isn't our first rodeo, or our first album! We have a great production team, as well capable representation and administrative staff. We are confident that we can traverse any stumbling blocks with the support of the entire Sybarite5 team and of course, with you!",
  "I have been a composer my whole adult life, and throughout a career of composing, teaching, and running music schools, have established a voice which I think The New York Times described pretty well: \u201cfashioned with the clean, angular melodies, tart harmonies, lively syncopations and punchy accents of American Neo-Classicism ... the textures are always lucid; details come through.\u201d I bring to my composing of American Pilgrimage a tremendous passion for the diversity and emotional breadth of our country, as well as a musical language to express this passion honed by the almost 100 works I have composed in the course of my career. The challenge of bringing a new work to life is always a daunting one, but I am lifted up and inspired by the extraordinary artistry of the American String Quartet, who are true collaborators in this project.",
  "As with any business start up - we have risks.  The biggest is the financial risk.  We want to fund most, if not all, of the business on our own through saving and making the best decisions we can.  We have growth risk - both fast or slow growth would impact our lives and we have to be prepared to adapt to both.  We are confident our cookies will sell and people will want them but the challenge will be to ensure consistent sales strategies as well as production.  Another big challenge for us will be to operate effectively and efficiently to meet demand:  focused prep time and baking time, allotted time for packing and shipping and most importantly time to learn and adapt as needed when we have great feedback from our supporters.",
  "We've built this Company because we really believe that it fills an important need in the Fraser Valley food ecosystem.\n\nWe know that change takes time. Changing the shopping habits of local people will take time. We also know that time costs money. We've built the platform for small vendors and farms to sell their delicious goods direct to you at home.  Now we need to develop the products and curate the meal bundles to ensure we are able to meet the weekly food needs of families, and bring local food into the homes of everyone in the Fraser Valley every week.  \n\nYour support will allow us to invest in buying more local foods throughout the harvest season, and hire more passionate people to create products with those locally harvested fresh foods. This is no easy feat considering we are in the midst of a period of unparalleled uncertainty due to the pandemic. \n\nTime will allow us to rebuild our customer's relationship with local food, and deliver a much-needed service that enables everyone in the Fraser Valley to get fresh food to their families table each week. This same service will put money back into the hands of our farmers, artisans, chefs as well as those most in need within our community.",
  "We would love to see other organizations \u201ccompeting\u201d to serve these teens and young adults.  And, to be fair, there are organizations that mentor youth. There are also companies that have workbook-related content in some of the areas our resource material gives an overview on. Different organizations focus on school programs, juvenile aged youth, prison transition, the foster care industry and church youth programs. We believe that this solidifies the need of our material and creates our advantage because we can be an addition to all of them. We stay general in nature and can redirect our marketing based on technology trends where others cannot without considerable disruption. For example, if an area has a high drug overdose rate in teens, we will focus on that subject. If they experience a high dropout rate in the local schools, we center our marketing to parents. The content we offer exposes obstacles and society\u2019s challenges with the resources they can turn to that focuses on that topic without causing harm to themselves. Our competition is limited in scope and resources for the vertical markets we seek to gain market share in. We will bridge the gap from specific content to a society balanced lifestyle.",
  "I have put many years into the formulation of my ideas and understanding of humans, both ancient and modern. I have a good chunk of this material written in some basic form, but I know that writing quality content comes in chunks. One issue I currently have is my full time job. If I can get a successful round of funding, it will help me take the necessary time I need to conduct research and continue writing. I could potentially run into an issue of not having enough time to finish the book and get it to backers by the proposed date. I understand this is a very plausible situation. However, I personally enjoy doing research and writing, so I do not think I will run into any significant setbacks due to a time constraint. If I am able to travel for on-location research, there is more of a possibility of that causing a time delay than anything else. If the opportunity to visit any archaeological site does arise, I will be extremely conscious of my time to ensure my efforts are calculated and targeted at the most pertinent information for my cause. I am extremely focused and driven to make this a great book that is accurate, informative, and enjoyable to read. If I run into an issue finding a publisher, I will use any remaining funding, and any funds I can personally provide, to self publish the book.",
  "The biggest risk is that these stories will not sell. I also can run into not enough product to fill demand. (Wouldn't that be amazing) I plan on taking a very active role in getting my books out. I will want to distribute my books in schools and libraries and hopefully I will get enough backing to be able to get them in bookstores across America. \r\nEventually I would like to do a comic series and make the world a lot deeper. \r\nWriters block is always an obstacle, however I will strive every day to finish each project with great stories, great illustrations, and great quality books that everyone can enjoy.",
  "Like in any project I know  there will be up and downs, obstacles to face but together we will overcome them. The rewards will be your appreciation for the Arts and a fantastic collection of unique  works of arts manifest in a pair of shoes.",
  "Risks and challenges include accomodating properly accomodating involved professionals in front of and behind camera during the shooting processes. \r\n\r\nAll casts and crew will be fully certified with reasonably strong resumes and credits to date.\r\n\r\nMerman will under go specialized training for under water scenes.",
  "There are always risks with anything. But here it mostly not getting the rewards delivered on time (I am only one person). Not completing the story/novel in time. After everything not getting it published. The list goes on and of course I might not get accepted onto the MA but that will not stop me from writing.",
  "Risks:\n- Certification Timing\n- Supply Chain Delays\n- Production Scheduling\n\nWe are highly confident of executing all three, the current working climate may result in delays. \n \nChallenges:\n - Visibility in Highly Competitive Market\n - Building Brand Recognition\n - Achieving Sustainable Scale",
  "the most challenging thing about this is to be able to get enough willingly strangers to let another stranger get close enough to photograph their eye, I have to use my charms per say to do so especially in a town as in Boston where the city is big and people are always on the go. But I believe if I ask a 100 people a week at least 10 would say yes which will get me enough to make a 40 page book, then I have to find a company in Boston to publish the books at a decent price and that their book making techniques won't distort the art, other than that no other challenges should seem to arise, & Boston is full of friendly people.",
  "Biggest challenge is to put together a team of talented people: models, MUA's, hair and stylists, as well as clothing designers. Evita and Tim has around 20 years of experience in photography industry, and we will be doing everything for this project to be finished in our set timeline.\r\n\r\nAll the steps in the process will be posted here on project update page, as well as our facebook, twitter and instagram.",
  "I am looking for more than funding - I am looking for networking sources in the publishing world. I have dreamed of publishing a book my entire life, but I know I am a novice in this industry. I will, however, work hard to make this dream a reality.",
  "Our film will be roughly 5 minutes long and with such a low budget we hope it can be the best we make it. Now we are still at a fairly early age of our production, so it's very possible that we will encounter some obstacles, yet we will overcome them no matter what, one problem we are currently encountering is finding an ideal location to shoot our film, but we do have two possible locations that we are currently trying to contact, so hoping all goes well.\r\n\r\nOverall i see our biggest challenge as creating such an immense and suspenseful film, that will grab the audiences (you) attention in such a way that it comes off as very entertaining to watch and hopfully with the more support this can be more easily achieved.",
  "The books nearly done, well I would say the writing is around 70% finished, but like everything there will be ongoing changes and revisions, that's even before the editors got their hands on it, oh, and I have to write my lovely few backers in there too. \r\n\r\nThen I have to sort out all the technical bits, and the setting up bits, and  the general bits.\r\n\r\nSo in essence we, are really, nearly, there!\r\n\r\nUnless a rhino sits on my hand. Then I'll have to type with my nose...",
  "Since the novel is already completed, all that I would have to do is add additional details (1 month), resubmit for copyright, create a better cover, find a publisher (I use an online publisher), and create a delivery schedule. In addition, I serve students at a local public school and will have 2 weeks in December to enjoy my family, thank the LORD, and complete the project. \r\n\r\nIf setbacks should arise, I have the support of a wonderful wife that will assist were necessary and if additional funding is needed, I will furnish it from my own reserve. The project isn't meant for lucrative purposes but to share what God has revealed to me through hardships so that others don't have to go through the same ordeals. I look forward to receiving your support and know that you will be richly blessed by the product of our mutual labor.",
  "The risks are that firstly it's not enough money to motivate any hobby translators, though this is a smalll risk since many of them have been doing this for free. If this happens, the money will get returned and I'll lose some money on kickstarter fees about 7% of the money.\r\n\r\nI can not get in contact with he-man, in which case I will sponsor another author and get one more book translated with he-man's gratitude money.",
  "Please note that the colors may look slightly different on screen than in person. Designs may alter slightly in the manufacturing process. Sometimes pin quality can vary, so if we surpass the funding goal, I might order extra.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not responsible for lost or stolen packages after we send them off to USPS. But we will work with you to the best of our ability to get the package to you.\n\nThere are no refunds after the campaign has ended and pledges have been collected.",
  "Of course there is the case of not finding artists who wish to have their work in gallery, also the issue of the storefront being hard to aquire. Other than that art is art, and art is never wrong",
  "The only risk and challenge I can foresee is an overwhelming response to this project on Kickstart. If we are fortunate enough to encounter that problem, we will secure other artists in the Niagara/Toronto area to help complete paintings.",
  "The risks are minor, I have the material I need to start and complete the project.",
  "As I have already painted the penguins I don't foresee and major problems. I already make my designs into gift items, so I know they will be great quality.",
  "The choir will be ready, the music will be ready, so the only real challenge to the successful completion of this project is NOT raising the funding we need to take a full choir with us to Wells!  In the event we do not reach our financial goal, we will unfortunately need to proportionally limit the number of choristers who are able to attend - something that we would truly hate to do, as it will be an incredible experience for every member.\r\n\r\nOur donor rewards are produced though our administrative office, and as such do not require outside manufacture, clearance or approval prior to shipment.",
  "Given the nature of traditional publishing, we cannot guarantee that the story will be published with a traditional publishing house. We feel we have done the hard work to give this story the best chance possible. We have put in countless hours of marketing work and research. We have kept the budget trim to minimize the risk to investors. And we have ensured that the rewards, for the most part, are readily available whether or not A Hero\u2019s Curse is picked up by a traditional publisher at the conference.\r\n\r\nGiven that there are so many different rewards and add-ons available in this campaign, there is always a risk of delays. But we will take every precaution to avoid those risks.",
  "I have a lot of experience in designing enamel pins, I feel confident in my ability to accomplish the main and the stretch goals. But it will all depend on you guys! See above for some examples of pins I have made in the past!\n\nI don't expect any major risks, however, I understand that there is always the chance of a delay in production and longer than expected shipping with overseas manufacturers. All Kickstarter pledgers will receive pins that are in good condition and I will examine them personally before dispatch.\n\nIf there are any delays I will keep everyone updated throughout the process.\n\nMy artwork is already completed, I just need your help to make these pride hearts happen! Thank you so much for supporting me.",
  "I've been designing and creating enamel pins for the past 7 years. There are quite a few steps in the process of having these manufactured, and things often go awry. Luckily I have an established history with a wonderful company that has done amazing work for me in the past. I've also already paid for mockup/examples of some of the designs to ensure their ability to bring them to life! I am absolutely confident in the end result of the pin series. All of the pins and add on items will be quality tested before packaging and shipping. In regards to shipping; I am only using tracked postage and once mailed I have no control over the time-frames USPS provide but can replace items if the package is lost in transit. During the production phase, I will be updating backers when I have further information.",
  "1. Shipping times - They may be a little off, and I have no control over any of it.  So, please be patient and take the timeline as an estimate, not 100% set in stone.\n\n2. The potential for lost packages - Porch Pirating is a huge problem in the United States particularly.  I recommend checking your tracking daily, and the reason I am not offering shipping without tracking, is to mitigate the possibility of things being percieved as lost, when they are not. \n\n3. After the kickstarter ends, I will not be giving refunds unless absolutely necessary. You can cancel your pledge any time before the kickstarter ends or edit it to a different amount - lower or higher, but I cannot refund you, once the campaign finishes in most cases, or we cannot produce the products.",
  "Delays are always possible when it comes to manufacturing any project, so production times are always estimated and never 100% guaranteed. This doesn't mean if the project gets funded it'll never get to you, it just may take longer than initially estimated. :)",
  "Manufacturing has a possibility of taking a considerable amount of time as well as shipping, but we hope to have a very concise timeline to avoid wasting any time. \n\nIf this project isn't funded of course, that would be a challenge as well and unfortunately the bags may not be a possibility.",

  "As with many small businesses just starting out working capital is always a concern, having enough inventory to supply demand, while also saving enough money to promote your product is something all new and growing businesses go through.  Our specific risks also include building a loyal following and convincing stores that we deserve a spot on their shelves.  That's where you come in.  We are confident that once people taste the food that's been prepared with Flavor Seed's seasonings they will instantly be a fan for life.  With this kickstarter, we are not only asking you to take a chance on us by buying our product but we are also asking you to use the product and share it with your friends at a backyard BBQ, family supper club, neighborhood pot luck, or weekly Taco Tuesdays.  We promise, you are getting the best ingredients with NO additives, chemicals, pesticides, or other junk mass produced seasonings are feeding you without your knowledge.

  "As in any outdoor photography shoot, mother nature can be unexpected.  However, even if the elements are a factor for wide open vista's, photo sessions can be created both inside the roundhouse (as is shown with the image shown in this project) to close up shots outdoors keeping with a nostalgic feel.\r\n\r\nI own all my professional gear and can rent anything needed out of the ordinary should anything supernatural or unexpected comes up.\r\n\r\nDuring post production of the photographs, I plan to do a variety assortment of color, vintage, and painterly options, creating a vast variety of fine art options for my patrons.\r\n\r\nFinally, all investors from Kickstarter can choose any image from this shoot, or any other image I have in my current portfolio, so you can feel safe in your investment.  Even should an emergency or act of God happen to take place preventing the photo opportunity from happening at all, you can still get your rewards fulfilled from any image in our current on line gallery listed on our website.\r\n\r\nSo, as an investor, you have nothing to risk!

  "We do not anticipate any issues with the creation of this calendar (other than reaching our goal). Once we reach our goal we will begin shooting at Ms. Bombshell studios. The printing company we will be using I have been in business with for over 10 years. They have always produced excellent work. If the demands exceed our shipping demands than we will recruit those that have volunteered to ensure that all orders are sent out in a timely manner.",
  "We would like to grow the business, and we have been successful so far in doing this with a controlled expansion. We would like to invest in better unit cost packaging by order bulk quantities. Hence we need further support from kickstarters to continue our growth.",
  "I have secured a printing company, but at present I am not happy with the cover material options (there's won't be a dustcover, so the material needs to be correct), therefore this may mean printing and binding are done separately.  This issue will be decided on in the next few weeks, as printing will commence the first week of January 2015, but it may mean a small delay in book delivery times.",

The third book is titled and the outline is complete just waiting to get to it before I start writing.\r\n\r\nThe only delays I foresee is financial or processing delays.\r\nIf I am successful in this endeavor and the possibility in future endeavors then financial concern no longer becomes a problem.\r\nAs far as processing delays I will do everything in power to push through any delays that may present itself to continue with the course set as planned.",
  "The biggest challenge this project faces is getting people to pick up the book and read it, but I believe that it is good enough that people will share it, recommend it and beg for more! While getting a literary agent and large publishing company to pick up the book is the ultimate goal, I believe as a self published author I can become just as successful.",

  "Writer's block:\r\nEvery so often a writer is faced with writer's block, where they have no new ideas. I have had writer's block and it is the worst. However, with Soul's Endurant, the story completely done, in my head. All I have to do now is put it on paper.\r\nFinding the time:\r\nWriting out a story on paper takes more time then you'd think. Then once you've written it, no matter how perfect it sounded in your head, you generally want to change it. Part of the funds from this project will allow me to drop one of my jobs so that I can focus that time on finishing this book by mid-August.",
  "The first challenge that comes to mind will be the editing because after the first edit, I know that there will be time needed to review it and there will be re-writes and more editing. This can no doubt be frustrating and the least appealing part of the process (as it is for most writers), but my dedication to this will be more than enough to see it through. It\u2019s a process and each step is important no matter how tedious. Luckily, I am VERY ambitious. \r\n\r\nFormatting issues may also arise as I strive to get things looking the way I want them as far as the pages and overall feel of the book turns out just before publication. There can be issues with printing errors and distribution, or even ISBN assignments after publication but all one can do is work with your team and take each challenge as they come. Work through one and move onto the next and that is exactly what I plan to do. \r\n\r\nAside from the cost of publication and any technical issues, the biggest challenge I can foresee is that publishing my book will be take longer than I would like it to. I understand that publishing can be a long and sometimes stressful process which can test anyone\u2019s patience; I\u2019m sure it will mine. But being the stubborn, strong-willed, and hard working person that I am, I know that I will get through it no matter how many challenges come my way.",

  "As with every kickstarter there are risks and challenges with this, the first and most important is \"will we make enough?\" and unfortunately, we may not. I am absolutely hopeful what we do, but if we don't you will not be charged for your attempt at supporting us.\n\nAnother risk is scheduling issues. Our hope is to get everything done and shipped out so you receive it by pride. but with the way shipping has been lately we can't guarantee this. That being said we will be completely open with every step of the way.\n\nWe will obviously be trying our hardest to get as close to proper colors as possible by sending the manufacturer pantone numbers for every color. That being said we cannot guarantee that shades will be exactly as you see not only because sometimes exact shades are not available and also because colors could look different depending on the screen you are looking on.",

  "Funding a recording project is a serious responsibility. Though we are committed to partially financing the budget ourselves, the public\u2019s support is adamant to the realization of this CD.

  "Our main problem this year is funding. The project has been running every summer since 2011.  The Odd Fellows Lodge has funded 100% of this project for the past 4 years but due to limited funds and many other valuable projects, they have needed to reduce funding to 70% this year. Combine this reduced funding with an increase in youth participation and we really need this Kick starter campaign to succeed.\r\n\r\n Beyond that, the biggest challenge is finding the right balance of instruments between Violins, Violas, Cellos and Basses. We often find ourselves actively recruiting vital student players as the date of the project gets closer. We always expect some students to drop out of the program just before it begins, forcing us to scramble, but that has rarely happened.",

  "Recording an album like this is not without challenges. Once the music is written, scores and parts need to be prepared for the musicians. Musicians need to be booked, an appropriate studio needs to be booked, and a great recording & mixing engineer needs to be booked. Rehearsals need to take place ahead of time for the musicians to learn the music and finally the recording sessions need to be scheduled and executed.\r\n\r\nI already have world-class musicians on board, as well as a Grammy winning engineer, so the team is already in place, as is the studio. \r\n\r\nThe only real challenges to getting this project made once funded are scheduling difficulties. The plan is to rehearse extensively in August and record sometime in September. While everyone is committed to meeting this schedule, we are all working professionals in the film/TV industry. We may have to delay the recording to accommodate other projects that may come up.\r\n\r\nThe album is scheduled for release in December, leaving ample time for unforeseen delays while keeping the December release.\r\n\r\nBudget overages are the other possible risk. If the recording sessions take longer than anticipated, it adds costs - more studio time, added musician and engineer costs. Having worked on countless recording sessions, I have a very good idea of how much music I can record in how many hours and have budgeted accordingly. We're also rehearsing extensively ahead of the sessions, which will help ensure we stick to our recording schedule.",

  "Throughout the development of this project, we've struggled to convey the unique look, feel and humor that sets Lily & Kosmo apart.\r\n\r\nWithout a frame of reference based in today's movies or TV, people often attempt to relate it to other children's entertainment.  \"Is it animated?  It should really be animated.\"  \"I could really see this as a Pixar movie!\"  Or, \"Live action, huh?  But you're going to have some really awesome CGI, right?\"\r\n\r\nWhile there are some really movies and shows for kids today, we're trying to offer something different.  The handmade feel, performances by real, everyday kids, and a heroine who's not a princess, will make Lily & Kosmo a truly refreshing offering for today's kids (and we're pretty sure their parents will like it too).\r\n\r\nWe're confident that when people see what we're making, it'll all make sense!",
  "Principle photography has already been completed. Our final steps to finishing this film before our premiere include final edits, sound design, and scoring. We have been working around the clock to create the best film possible and spread the message that everyone is unique and should never feel alone because of who they are.",
  "One of our main risks is bad weather. That is also the reason we have scheduled the shoot in early May, where we hope the weather will treat us nicely. If the weather does not allow us to do the exterior shots on the scheduled days, we will have to re-schedule and perhaps book a less advanced camera kit if the original kit is not available on the re-scheduled days. \r\n\r\nIf there would be any problems with our caravan for whatever reason, we do have a backup caravan available. This caravan can also be destroyed. \r\nWe have planned a end shot to the film which it is only possible to have one go at. We will plan this along with engineering minds to make it most certain this will be successful. As a backup we have an alternate end shot of the film that will also be shot to make sure the film closes of as we want it to.",
  "I have written medical and academic texts and presentations for years, but my creative writing has been relatively private. I appreciate that you are taking a risk with me. I am asking you to back my project after years of hard work, training, and practice that have led me to this point. Please trust that this story is good, it's powerful, and it's going to change people's lives.\r\n\r\nI have the full storyboard, plot, and character bible done, and about 40% of the illustrations finished. I am underway with the writing and am confident I can finish this novel on schedule. I am extremely committed to this project and can\u2019t wait to see it to fruition. I promise to keep you informed throughout the process \u2013 and will appreciate encouragement and cheerleaders!",
  "I have completed the novel and currently it is being edited. The Challenges I face as a Self- Published Author will be exposure. This is the main reason why I am asking for your hard earned money. I need to advertise on all the major websites in order for word to spread about the novel. In addition because the novel includes many high quality colored illustrations it is very expensive for me to produce an actual physical book. I\u2019m hoping with your donations that overtime I will garner enough funds to produce more physical copies of the novel.\r\n\r\nIf the campaign is successful, I plan to release the eBook by no later than December 2015. As far as the additional rewards I will begin shipping them as soon as possible, in the meantime I have listed a conservative time frame of March 2016 just in case of any unforeseen circumstances. I don\u2019t plan on anything happening, but I don\u2019t want anyone to feel as though they are not getting the attention they deserve for without you guys this project wouldn\u2019t be possible.",
  "It is no mean feat to find and secure a unit, work out what needs to be done, and do it, while simultaneously fulfilling all of the relevant health and safety, legal and planning regulations. However we feel that we have researched all of these areas thoroughly and have everything covered. We have sufficient time and money as a contingency to cover the unpredictable, (but inevitable) setbacks.",
  "As of the launch of this Kickstarter campaign, 75% of the novel has been written (not yet edited), with the remaining 25% outlined and vigorously worked on daily (thus my desire in hiring a developmental editor). My goal is to have the launch of the book correspond with either Halloween (October 31st) or the Winter Solstice (December 22nd). Of course, life is unpredictable and should I not be able to finish that remaining 25% in time to be edited, finalized and sent to the printers in order to meet one of these deadlines, I might not be able to have the book ready by 2015. However, I have a strong spirit and steadfast faith in my ability to stay on task and complete this so fingers crossed everything will go smoothly. \r\nA note about the rewards: As you can see, each donation made during the run of this campaign with receive by mail a small token of love and appreciation in a timely manner (some time in May). So while it says \"May\" for all the donation amounts, those promised a hardcopy of the novel will receive their other items beforehand (in May) and the physical novel when it becomes available.",
  "Potential risks and challenges associated with this campaign include not reaching enough individuals who are willing to fund the project. Lack of funds will keep the fitness app from creating top-quality content which may make some individuals reluctant o purchase the app in order to benefit from what the app has to offer.",
  "Filming a show and recording a podcast are big endeavors, and so we will involve directing, producing, filming, and editing professionals every step of the way to ensure our success. If we meet an unexpected delay, we will keep our community in the know with regular emails and updates.\n\nIn terms of fulfilling the rewards, we are collaborating with a manufacturing company that can direct ship goods worldwide in a timely manner. One of our founders has launched 3 successful Kickstarters to date, helping us create realistic expectations of ourselves, the reward levels, and the fulfillment process.\n\nBy planning the show and this Kickstarter launch over the past year, securing the trademark, creating the business entity, and setting realistic expectations for our production timeline, we feel confident we can make good on every one of our Kickstarter promises in a timely manner.",
  "The backbone of this project is YOU, every single one of you and our team of philanthropic visionary students. We are all dreaming big and didn't have much to start this with. Rather than using Microsoft Word or Publisher to come up with our first average edition, we want it to be one edition of perfection at a time. This is why we came to you today.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is things are still in the planning phase. As I said earlier, online presence is important and we really want to be solid on that. If we pull off a fantastic job in that aspect as a result of this kickstarter funding, it would mean less money goes towards online marketing and the like.\r\n\r\nRealistic risks: not many really...\r\n\r\nBUT\r\n\r\nRealistic challenges: convincing a bunch of students who already feel burdened by work to thoroughly read your magazine. Convincing them that they should do it more than once. Trying to get valuable information out of them through surveys. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the only risk is stupidity. We aren't going in blind eyed - it has to be carefully planned and executed. We will conduct the necessary research, and try to develop the content people want to see on there. It's all about our market and helping them, but at the same time it needs to be an enjoyable and comfortable read, maybe even comical? This is a growing project and as the content is developed over time we'll try to recruit student volunteers and journalism, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore I haven't identified a real risk, but have told you upfront that delays will be expected. That's the nature of this project as it is about kicking off the brand. No risk for you, you're paying for a lovely thank you message - here's your free one - thank you very much for taking the time to read this! :)",
  "Potential risks that could happen:\n- Colors might differ in real life and how they appear in the screen, and the color is subject to change\n- There may be unforeseen delays in pin manufacturing/shipping due to COVID-19\n- For more information and inquiries, you can check my Instagram account @negipota_nyan and the update section in Kickstarter",
  "There may be some unexpected situations occurred during the campaign. However, we will minimize the risk and beat the challenges as possible as we can with our full preparation and experience.\n\nWe have our prototype finalized and materials prepared for the mass production in advance. We have signed an agreement with our suppliers and scheduled the whole process. Once the campaign ends, the mass production will be ready soon. Besides, we have got enough experience from managing our previous project, with our patented stand.\n\nTo ensure our backers can get the best stand, we will try our best to hold down the circumstances that may be out of control, and update our backers on the progress in time with full transparency.",
  "We finished recording Five Piece Combo in July of 2014, and are currently putting the finishing touches on editing and post production.  Our previous campaign, Five at Play was successfully funded and released, and we are confident in our ability to complete this latest amazing project.  Our main challenge will be getting the word out so that we can meet our goal.",
  "Costs are low and the process is easy, if time consuming. The only risk here is if response is greater than anticipated it may take me longer to ship orders.",
  "We are confident we are able to take Boss Balls to the next level with your help. We see very few risks potentially associated with completing our project and delivering on all of our Rewards. We are prepared to hire the additional staff necessary for production. We are working with our vendors to source the necessary ingredients for our product and see minimal risk involved there. \r\n\r\nWe are seasoned problem solvers and excellent communicators, so if and when any unforseen challenges arise we will be quick to communicate not only the challenge, but more importantly the solution.",
  "With my excellent organization, the only risk for #GRIPTHETIT is a model not showing up to her shoot with me. If a model does not show up to her shoot with me, she will be replaced with another model. With the power of sites such as Model Mayhem and social media, finding models are not hard at all these days. In fact, I've had models come to me instead of the other way around. No problem.",
  "The challenges are almost purely photographic in nature. The lens which must be used for such photography is NOT intended for action photography, yet most ballerina steps are very dynamic in nature. Calculating and adjusting for the nature of the photo equipment versus the nature of the ballerina's routines will be the single greatest challenge aside from finding the ballerinas themselves.",
  "This is our seventh Kickstarter campaign, and that in itself is a testament to our experience. We have delivered all the rewards from our first campaigns and we have learned a lot in the process.\n\nOur book-publishing house is located in France, so we have a strong grasp of the production chain here. With new territories, come new risks, but we're more prepared than ever to face them.\n- Localization: We have now produced 22 books in English. The process is already quite solid, but we are constantly working on ways to improve it.\n- International distribution: We now have two fulfilment centers, one in Europe and one in North America. This reduces delivery delays as well as costs for many of our backers.\n- International marketing: The marketing channels we use to publish our French books are not very useful to us when it comes to our books in English. We have found partners to distribute in bookstores, but we are still a relatively small player on the international scene and the task of creating visibility for our products lies upon our shoulders. This is clearly one of the reasons why we are returning to Kickstarter, as this has proved to be a powerful way for us to reach our readers.",
  "I have been making enamel pins since 2017, so have a good understanding of the process. The only potential risks/challenges that could occur should be be shipping delays etc - but any issues that occur will be notificed through the updates.",
  "Risks and challenges\n\nLiving in Portugal and making it a priority to produce all our sneakers and socks in Portugal enabled us to visit and get to know quite a lot of suppliers until we met a factory that had the same values as us and that helped us create this campaign.\n\nIt was a challenge to come up with something unique that reflected our vision but we are confident that the Sneakers and socks we created are exactly what we set out to create!\n\nOf the founding team we have plenty of experience in logistics and in FMCG to carry out this project and we are confident we set conservative timelines.\n\nThe 2 main risks that we cannot control that can slightly affect delivery are the supply chain disruptions (which are minimized by the fact that all our suppliers are located within a few hours drive from the factory) and the consistent change in shipping prices lately.\n\nWe commit to over-communicating with our backers to make sure that you know all progress during our production and shipping.",

We also have to cover large production costs: equipment, raw materials and installations.\n\nKickstarter allows us to manage a pre-sale in a concrete and efficient way without incurring any additional costs for the adjustment of our website.",
  "- Manufacturing delays are the most common challenge. I have immense faith in my manufacturer though. I've worked with them on over a dozen different projects big and small. They are very communicative about any snags in manufacturing. If any delays occur, I will make sure that backers know immediately. Transparency is my #1 priority.\n\n- Inspections/grading is another challenge, but not too difficult to tackle. Grading just takes time. Every backer deserves perfect pins, so I usually take about 1-2 weeks to grade every single pin before shipping rewards.\n\n- Package delivery delays can happen due to inclement weather, post worker strikes, or other unforeseeable events. I am happy to replace a package if it is marked as officially LOST by USPS on their tracking website. However, if your package is marked as delivered, I cannot replace it. Please make sure that your delivery address is a safe location to receive your rewards.\n\n- International packages are another challenge. These do not have tracking once they leave the US. I cannot replace missing packages due to being unable to determine with confidence whether your package was truly lost or not. However, I am more than happy to resend packages once, only when they return to me in the post. As usual, backers are responsible for any customs fees their package may incur.\n\n- The last and biggest challenge is always making Kickstarter a warm and inclusive space. Any hate speech, repugnant comments, ship warring, or otherwise unpleasant messages will be reported as violations of the Kickstarter TOS. If you have pledged to the kickstarter, and violate my terms, your pledge will be cancelled and refunded. Please always be kind. There are human beings behind this project.\n\n- I will keep backers posted via the updates tab, and through my social media outlets! Please feel free to reach out to if you have anymore questions! \n\n- DO NOT REACH OUT WITH SOLICITATION MESSAGES. Solicitors will be reported, and subject to the law.",
  "PRODUCTION: If there are any issues with the manufacturing process, I will be handling it. If something is completely unavoidable, I will be posting an update and gathering opinions.\n\nCOLOR DIFFERENCES: There may be slight color differences between prototypes/artwork and final versions. Any major changes will be posted. \n\nFULFILLMENT: We have a small team of 2-3 people who will be fulfilling the orders. We also frequently sell at conventions so please give us some time to ship your orders out. If there's any major delays such as interfering convention schedule, we will post an update notifying of delays. \n\nREFUNDS/CANCELLATIONS: Once the campaign has been completed, refunds and cancellations will not be accepted. Please only pledge if you are confident that you can afford to pledge!",
  "This is the first Kickstarter from the MAVERO team - so there is bound to be challenges because of that. As a result, the team have decided to keep a limited supply of every reward to ensure prompt delivery.",
  "Challenges this project may face: \n\n1. Potential delays in manufacturing and shipping - In the past I have run several successful Kickstarter campaigns, so I'm used to the platform and process and have accounted for any possible delays by pre-ordering some of the designs. I also have very good communication with the factory I use and I will update backers on any delays or problems. \n\n2. Images featured are mock-ups - Images in this Kickstarter are as close to real life as possible but the end result could differ slightly in colour and finish. If backers encounter any issues with damaged or defective items, I strongly encourage them to message me and let me know so we can attempt to resolve the issue.",
  "Everything is ready, everything is set. The printer is just waiting for the go-ahead.",
  "The book is written, illustrations are started! Soon it will be off to the editor, designer and then printers. I have allowed extra time for printing but there can often be delays when printing a book. I have tried to account for this but sometimes unforeseen circumstance can cause further delays. I will do my very best to get these out in a timely manner. I am hoping to host the launch party at the ToonSeum, however if the numbers are overwhelming we may have to move to a larger location.\r\nPlease make sure when we request t-shirt size you get that to us in a timely manner, we cannot print until we have all the sizes and that too can cause delays. I learned a lot from the Quack N At shirts I printed last year! Hopefully I can implement much of what I have learned to make this a smooth process.\r\nThank you.",

  "Possible risks and challenges might include:\n   \u2013 The time required to edit post-translation may be longer than what I'm planning for, to ensure consistency across a large document.\n   \u2013 The time required to complete the interior layout may take longer than expected.  There are lots of footnotes, so it will be a complex and time-consuming process.",
  "Risks and Challenges will be minimal since this will be the third calendar I'm printing, and I think I've got the hang of things. The calendar will be designed during the duration of this campaign and printed as soon as it's over. I estimate calendars to arrive in early December 2016 or late November 2016 just in time for Christmas and the New Year. For international orders, I can't guarantee they will arrive by Christmas (it depends how long the shipping takes to your country, customs etc) but I will say you MOST LIKELY will get it in time! They will be similar to our past calendars.",

  "We have faced a number of challenges with not only with finding the appropriate USDA approved manufacturing facility, but also packaging, label design, and finding a bag vendor. \r\n\r\nAlthough we have tested a number of other flavors that we have developed it's difficult to determine which flavors we want to launch next. We'd release all the flavors at the same time if we could. We want to make sure we take a measured and cost effective approach while launching additional flavors.\r\n\r\nNo matter the challenges we have faced we still have a great product stocked and ready to be shipped at the conclusion of our Kickstarter campaign.",
  "These days most of the children's movies only work around just CGI, well we want to make a good old fashion movie were the animals reaction is the way they talk. So help us bring something back from the past that our kids can enjoy like we did as kids.",
  "Like all Kickstarter projects, we will face certain risks and challenges in delivering the RENEWED 97 sports socks at the quality we demand of ourselves. However, the INCYLENCE team brings with it not only our passion but experience in designing and manufacturing at scale, and we've made every effort to mitigate these risks for our backers. Please be aware that even with the highest test protocol in place there is a certain risk of minor manufacturing defects in single items.",
  "In terms of designs, I already have the finalized sample of the cardigans. The pins have not been prototyped yet, but as I have several years of enamel pin design experience already, I am confident they can be made with few if any minor alterations.\n\nOne challenge is that this is my first time running a kickstarter, so there will definitely be a bit of a learning curve. However, as someone who has been running an online store for several years as well as tabled at various conventions, I am confident I won't have too much trouble in fulfilling orders.\n\nAs with all products that need to be manufactured overseas, global shipping and manufacturing delays make the actual completion date difficult to gauge (particularly in current times). I have set the fulfillment date quite far into the future to take this into account, but should delays arise I will be sure to communicate them clearly to any backers.",

Once the funds have been raised, the book will be fully translated, edited and proofread. Galleys of the cover, style and layout will be produced, before finally sending the book to print.\r\n\r\nParallel to this, we will be getting the bookmarks ready \u2013 both the simple ones and the unique handmade bookmarks so that our reward obligations can be fulfilled as promptly as possible. \r\n\r\nWe are aware that this will be a lot of time-consuming work, but this really is a labor of love. Reward fulfillment is always a tough challenge for a small group, but we\u2019ve partnered with people who are experts in delivering books and bookmarks to supporters, no later than 6 months after the campaign comes to an end.",
  "The greatest risk throughout our project is working with animals in shelters, animals that are in stressful situations can be very dangerous to deal with, the animal does not know us, we don\u2019t know them. We have a team of professional dog handlers that have positive-reinforcement training. We know exactly what to look for and how to make these animals comfortable. \nThis project has been in the making for a few years but has not been able to receive funding. The only cost for this project is for travel, we have a studio that will provide us with all equipment. \nWe work with all societies and shelters across the board that are adoption floors in all states. \nAfter the project is done, the photo-book will be created and published, and then a few galleries will be held around the country to show case the project.",

This is a one-man job, and I've already amply proven that I can produce these videos at a consistent standard.\r\n\r\nIt is possible I'll be hired for some big, time-consuming project, but if the video project has already started, whoever hires me will have to accept that I have a prior commitment to the Kickstarter community, which I take very seriously.",
  "The best thing about our project is that I am completely dedicated to making it happen.  As previously stated, I've planned out every aspect of our inaugural season, which will contain a modest two public concerts along with several collaborative events and public school residencies.   Below I will explain how fundraising is really our only challenge.  \r\n\r\nPossible challenges for us include:\r\n\r\n1. Venue selection\r\n   - Venues for our concerts include churches, recital halls, universities, museums, and other public or private spaces suitable for music performances.  Many of them charge a fee for rental, and some require things such as insurance coverage or official non-profit status.  As long as we raise enough money, we will be able to cover the costs of renting a space and any associated costs such as piano tuning, liability insurance, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Musician commitment\r\n   -This is something about which I feel very strongly.  I decided from the very beginning of this group that I would always hire professional musicians and pay them fair wages.  This includes paid rehearsals, reimbursement for travel costs, and a high flat fee for performances.  If a musician is underpaid or asked to volunteer for rehearsals and/or performances, there is always the chance that they might cancel when a paid gig comes up.  With CMS-NJ this will simply not be an issue because we will be paying our musicians fairly.\r\n\r\n     In the rare case that a musician has to cancel a concert, our area has no shortage of fine musicians who could come in at a moment's notice and put on a professional performance.  I also pride myself on knowledge of chamber music repertoire, which will allow me to adjust programs last-minute if necessary while maintaining the high standard of performance that our audiences will no doubt come to expect. \r\n\r\n3. Concert attendance/ticket sales\r\n   - Generating ticket sales is always a difficult task for new arts organizations.  With CMS-NJ, we will have a robust social media presence combined with professional designs on our advertisements in print and on our website.  Flyers, emails, website, social media, and good old-fashioned word of mouth will all contribute to generating public interest and ultimately filling the seats in our concert venues.",
  "SAO is a fairly low risk operation.  With years of growth and a tenacious leader at the helm it is very unlikely to flop.  However some things to keep in mind.  SAO is a very large program requiring lots of time at conventions.  Some conventions think this is amazing others say that it takes up too much time.  Either way no matter how much funding we receive we can not guarantee our appearance anywhere.\r\n\r\nKatie and her team are passionate, educated and in love with SAO.  And where you have talented people following their dreams, you have success.

  "Aside from raising the money for the project, I do not foresee any challenges. My repertoire is ready, the studio is open, and the people I will work with are first rate professionals.",
  "To make this project work, we are requiring the services of other musicians. While a paying gig is often enough to secure interest and commitment, a potential challenge is that a musician may fail to honor their commitment. To combat this, we can rely on our network of musicians to fill any holes, if need be. \r\n\r\nAnother potential issue could occur with the recording studio and their facilities. In case of the event that we run into any technical issues creating this song, we would either rely on the studio's exceptional customer service in correcting any issues promptly and free of charge, or simply obtain a refund and take our business elsewhere. Thankfully though, the studio we chose has Grammy award-winning engineers.",
  "It will be most challenging to capture the spontaneous moments that come without warning. I will counter this by never being with the dog without a camera in order to capture any special experience that may arise.",
  "For the moment I am working on finding funds to make the movie. I have already contacted a concept artist, 3D studio and production company that can film, set lights, etc. I also have their cost to produce the film from scratch to a finished project.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge that I can see in front of me is: funding (if I don't reach the number or get initial funds the project cannot go on), after that it is a matter of time. The reason that I don't see any bigger challenges then funds is because I have already created a production schedule, contacted production companies and created a budget for the project. By doing this I have managed to eliminate a lot of challenges that may occur. \r\n\r\nWith that said I have already managed to overcome many. The project have been under development for almost four years, which has given me time to contact and go through budget, locations, script etc.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean that no challenges will arise, but if the do I will meet them head on.",

  "I am not new to the Kickstarter rodeo, or to fulfilling and completing projects. I have five successful Kickstarters under my belt and I produced and sold fantasy art merchandise and coloring books for dozens of artists for more than twenty-five years, so I have extensive experience in production, shipping, and customer service.  I've done a lot of the design and leg-work in advance of this launch, so I am doing my best to set us up for a smooth-running project. \n\nThat said, these are \"interesting\" times. The printing company that does my T-shirts has already alerted me that they are having supply line issues that may cause delays or substitutions. The post office is not allowing some kinds of shipments to some countries due to restrictions. The most important thing I will do to mitigate these problems is keep you in the loop. You will know everything I do about when and where and what is going on with the project. \n\nI have set a fulfillment date of March 2022; I feel that this is enough wiggle room to find good solutions to unforeseen problems that might come up, but I'm actually hoping for a December delivery!

  "Like in any small business, there are a variety of risks that you face leading up to opening, and running a day-to-day operation. When it comes to opening a brewery and building a new facility, those risks become even more apparent and challenging; under capitalization, permitting, legislature approval, zoning and poor management to name a few.\r\n\r\nWe feel that with the support of the community, specifically the Village of Stevensville, we can overcome and anticipate almost any hurdles that we may face. After months of honing our product, finding the right location and deciding on a brand, we felt it was our chance to share with the community what we have to offer. Watermark plans on taking whatever steps necessary to maintain momentum, and serve the local community the beer it has been waiting for.",
  "The only true challenge I face...is having enough people behind me backing the construction of this project to make this docu-drama happen, but I see that a lot of truly amazing people have caused some incredible things to happen here on Kickstarter, so I have faith in the compassion I've witnessed which exists from funding that has taken place on this website. \r\n\r\nI'm a warrior, a survivor, and I am descended from a very long line of Kings and Queens who were monumental in history due to the changes they made in the world...leaving their mark in time while they walked this earth. It's not in me to just give up. I'm genetically predispositioned to trudge forward. I wouldn't be much of a man if I didn't try to do everything within my power to see my child. I will not stop until I have had my day in a court of law, and I'm granted the rights that I deserve as Isabella's father.

  "After the project is fully funded, we will be submitting our final files to the printer. This process may take a few days to a few weeks. Once the first proof copy is printed and bound, we will review it to ensure it meets our quality standards.\r\n\r\nWhen it does meet our standards, we will authorize the printer to complete the full order. This will be, at a minimum, 200 copies. If we raise enough money beyond that, we will order even more. \r\n\r\nOnce these 200 (or more) are printed, they will be shipped to our location in the Chattanooga, TN area. After we receive them, we will then proceed to fulfill the individual orders for those within the US who have reserved their copy by donating to the project. Any copies left after the reserved are shipped out will be sold at cost, or given to those in need.",

Although I do already have interest from labels, and although my other chamber music recordings have been successfully picked up, there's always the possibility that it will be refused. \r\n\r\nI believe in this recording, and so\u2014no matter what happens\u2014I will find a way to have it released to the public. If that means starting a new phase of funding to cover independent production of the CD, then I will do so. I owe that to my supporters!",
  "The portion of the campaign with the highest potential for delay is shipping. Each pin will be personally examined before shipping to ensure quality.

  "It frequently happens that, once started by the composer, a work begins to take on a life of its own and develop in some heretofore unforeseen ways. When this happens, a project can take longer to complete.  We are currently on schedule for the finishing touches on the work to be done by the end of April, but it is possible that it may take a bit longer.  Our backers will likely agree that rushing a creative process can result in an underdeveloped work! However, the composer's need for sufficient time to perfect the composition must be balanced with the performer's need to allow the piece to \"develop\" during the learning process.  To accomplish this, Olga has been sending Matt sections of the work as soon as they are ready, so that he can start reading through them and providing his feedback as needed.   We are limited in our timeframe by Matt's concert at the Guitar Foundation of America Convention in the end of June, which means that the work must be finished in enough time for him to prepare it for the premiere.  It may be that the publication of the work will happen after its premiere, since Matt's fingering suggestions will be incorporated into the final score.",

  "Our project is completely a labor of love. For years, Meg has dreamed of creating this storefront for the community - and truly, a replicable model for all communities! She has managed her own art gallery and worked for decades in the health food industry. Meg is passionate about this endeavor and displays an incomparable tenacity towards this goal. She is competent in her abilities and complements this with a well-rounded team of goal-driven beings. \r\n\r\nOne of our first major tasks is getting the word out. Our location is a prime spot in downtown Boulder with tons of foot and tire traffic. But we want to move beyond this! By connecting through social media with our friends and making new ones along the way, we plan to provide our house-made products in-store and online. To this end, we have reached out to our network of artists, owners, teachers, practitioners and more to bring our message and dream to a greater audience. Boulder has great local resources to tap into and once we are funded, we can move forward on our (social) media initiatives.\r\n\r\nFrom there, our biggest mission will be to keep up with demand. Once people find our products at our prices, they will keep coming back. I mean Truly Raw, Organic, Sprouted, Minimal Ingredient, Small Batch Almond Breads and Milks for less than the price of the competitors? One gallon of our premium milk for many dollars under the price of a half gallon of the Pasteurized, Homogenized other brands and there really is zero guesswork.

Animation is expensive and time consuming. If I've mastered something over the last few decades, it's how to automate as much as possible and bring costs down in processes. Animation has sped up dramatically due to software help. I purposefully will animate with rigging, rather than frame by frame, as it is super cost and time effective, as well as has improved enough to rival frame by frame animation without the costs.",

  "The world of audio drama has become more accessible and globally renowned than ever before, and this is amazing news for projects like J\u00f6tunn, as it makes them all the more appealing. It also means that the standard to which good audio drama needs to be produced is very high. We don\u2019t want to merely have a few voices tell a story with a little bit of music in the background. We want to create an entire cinematic world you can dive into every time you press play. That requires professional talent, high-end tech and innovative effects, and that therefore raises the budget for each episode to \u00a37k.  Reaching our target will allow the creation of an amazing world steeped in Norse mythology, a genre that has found a place of high regard lately, but uniquely, you\u2019ll be right in the centre of the drama.

While the ends justified the means, I hope to get some help from you this time on this exciting, but frankly, financially stressful project.\r\nEverything is in place for this recording to materialize. The orchestral score is ready and the parts will be delivered in the spring of 2014. The hall is booked. The musicians are on standby.

Logistics and transportation\n(1) Delivery time\uff1aIt needs to be determined based on the order volume. Generally, orders less than 1,000 bottles (15ml/bottle) will be delivered about 20 days after the end of the Pre-sale. Delivery time for large orders needs to be negotiated.\n (2) Logistics method\uff1aBecause the product ingredients do not contain flammable and explosive ingredients such as alcohol, we have a formal FDA number, MSDS product inspection certificate, and can be delivered in small bottles, boxes, kegs, vats and other packaging methods through various modes of transportation such as express, air, sea and rail.\n\n2. Agency, wholesale, OEM/ODM, MOQ\n(1) The minimum order quantity for Pre-sale is 1 bottle (15ml). OEM/ODM will not be accepted during the Pre-sale period.\n(2) After the Pre-sale is over, we will open the agency. The Cooperation model specific requirements are: oem and odm. The quantity should be more than 10,000 bottles. If the agency is wholesale, it only needs to meet the minimum order quantity. Our minimum order quantity is 12 products.\n\n3. How to store the product\nThe shelf life of our products is 3 years\u3002It is very important to use and store the nail polish gel correctly. Store the nail polish bottle in a dark place. Since gel products are sensitive to light, if the product is exposed to strong light or subjected to strong light source radiation, the gel will have a curing reaction. Therefore, do not put the nail polish in the open state too close to the LED lamp, so as to prevent the ultraviolet light emitted by the LED lamp from directly ir",

  "Apparel design, while a taxing medium to tackle, is something I have worked with many times before in the past.  \n\nHiccups and bumps in the road happen from time to time, but the manufacturer I currently work with is very reliable. I have worked with them for the past several years on general apparel design to totebags and blankets! Any seasoned follower/customer of mine know, without a doubt, that I produce the best quality merch, and this will be no different.\n\nShould there be any issues, it will be addressed to my backers on Kickstarter as soon as a solution is figured out.",
  "We have received a commitment from the record label as well as covered our recording expenses. What's standing in our way? If there's some unforeseen delay in the production, or if we don't meet the fundraising goal, in which case we'll have to continue to fund the production costs out-of-pocket, which means that it's going to take a LONG time to get this done!",
  "Once we have recorded the album, forming a unified final product can be challenging for a group of our size. We have a system of team-leadership in place to make sure that every musician's voice has the chance to be heard and to shape the final result, while still staying on course and keeping the whole group's vision in mind.",
  "David and Joanna have collectively produced and co-hosted hundreds of podcasts. That being said, episodes of the television show and of the podcast may not meet your specific standards. A sudden change in the television show's dynamic may have unexpected effects on the tone of our podcast. By backing us, you are acknowledging that this might be the case.\n \n Our schedules are also pretty tight and we may not be able to record recaps until significantly after the episode has aired on HBO. This Kickstarter is our way of committing to recording one episode each week, so while delays are possible, significant delays (e.g. longer than 1-week waits) are unlikely.\n \n It is remotely possible that either Dave or Joanna may not be able to be able to make the podcast for a week or two due to scheduling conflicts. In these situations, a suitable replacement will be found for that week and the episode will still be delivered.",

All parties to be involved are available and ready!\r\n\r\nObviously, with all the recording, editing, mixing, mastering, art direction and design, printing, producing, etc that must occur for an album like this to be produced, all those moving parts could potentially go awry.  But the totality of this funding goal will go towards studio rental, engineering fees, and album printing.  If we're funded, there's no stopping us!",

I am happy to answer any questions or concerns at any point in the process.",
  "We are committed to launching a 2nd hour of The Todd Huff Show, and we expect the biggest challenges will arise after the initial launch. But rest assured: we are preparing for those expected challenges as well.\n\nIn order for our show to continue to grow and succeed, we need to build a sales team. As it now stands, all sales are generated by me. And adding additional content to my plate certainly impacts my availability to secure new advertisers. \n\nSo with the creation of additional content comes the need for additional sales support. (And to a lesser extent, production support, which is also part of the next phase of our plan.)\n\nA sales team (and production support) will be funded through a combination of several things: \n* First, through continued growth in advertising sales. We're pleased to report that advertising sales have increased every year we've been in operation (since 2015). And those increases came in spite of the fact that I had a second business to operate until June 1 of this year. So we expect faster sales growth in 2020. We're seeing signs of this already in the 5 short months I've committed to exclusively working for The Todd Huff Show. \n* Second, through potential investors. We are currently exploring a couple of investor opportunities, and expect to have feedback on at least one of those opportunities during this campaign.\n* Third, through the success of this campaign and other campaigns. \n* Fourth, through ongoing sales of Conservative Not Bitter Party memberships, which we will continue to promote on our show, social media, appearances, etc. \n* Fifth, through an increase in awareness that naturally comes from the purposeful activities we are engaged in (media, promotion, social, etc) each and every day at The Todd Huff Show.",
  "I already know my following isn't all that big. The only way really for me to be able to reach out to fans of the show is that if you, the readers, are able to advertise this campaign to as many people as you could. Even more so if you know that there are Game of Thrones out there, please do show them this project of mine!\n\nAfter October 10 has passed and funding goal has been met, Kickstarter will charge all backers within a 14-day period and funds will be transferred to me shortly then after. During this time, I will begin production and updates will be posted from time to time.\n\nThis is also my very first enamel pin project and there will be some trial and errors here and there, so please bear with me in this journey to make sure I deliver and that I'm able to produce some products that will blow even my own mind!!",
  "We have completed prototype sequences viewable in the browser working with an early GoPro camera and Adobe Captivate. We intend to use an Insta360 Pro 2 and Unity for the final output. The project is scalable from 9 to 15 scenes dependent on time and funding.  Because of the extensive time spent on our pilot version, we also have a bank of footage we have already shot if barriers arise.",
  "Funding is necessary to complete the film. This budget will allow me to dedicate myself to the project full-time, pay my collaborators, master the audio, and make the production of the film and the physical assets the best they can possibly be. My goal is to finish the film by August, 2021. The release will include a film premiere + afterparty in Los Angeles, several screenings, and limited edition artifacts such as posters, t-shirts, original artwork, and soundtrack compilation album.",
  "One of my initial goals for this chamber opera project was to create an opera that could be performed in a wide variety of venues.  The small cast size of four singers, and flexible instrumentation (either piano accompaniment only or chamber quartet) make The Clever Artifice a very portable piece.  These are advantages, should the November performances have to be postponed due to cast illness or inclement weather--which can happen in Colorado in November.  Plan B will be an alternative date and performance space, if either of these circumstances should arise.",
  "The risks that I may be facing are the normal ones when recording a project. I am the sole artists on this project so I have to make sure I am well rested to be able to deliver the amount of energy that is necessary for this level of recording (professional, radio ready recording). My music has been played on the radio already, so I am aware of the process. \r\nAlso, it may take awhile to mix and master my recording so it is up to radio ready standards. I think the sound engineers I work with are very capable. Although anything can happen that may cause them to not be able to devote 100% to my project. This may delay the release date of the project. Once we get in the studio, it is only a matter of time. The sound engineers I work with also have colleagues who are on their level of expertise and can delegate their project to them if necessary.",
  "The risks for this project are the same every year. I am almost certainly mortal (untested) so it is possible I could die. Unfortunately I have yet identified a way to carry this podcast on past my personal expiration date, but obviously it's on the to-do list.\n\nAlso I could be injured in some non-fatal way that precludes me from ever speaking again. I feel like that would result in a whole lot of extra time on my hands though, so I like my chances at being able to find a replacement voice actor in this scenario.\n\nAfter 2 successful Kickstarters like this, I am confident that I have the vendors in place necessary to fulfill the rewards. If you backed last year, you can expect the rewards to maintain that same level of quality. I have all of these things hanging on my own walls, so I definitely want them to look as good as they can.",
  "The risks are that you don't get a poster now and have to pay $50 at the show :(",
  "The largest risk comes from the creation/manufacturing of the pins. We are working with a vendor in China, who has lots of experience in projects similar to ours. However, we have worked with them before and they do beautiful work. There is a chance that something may go wrong during the manufacturing process and if that happens it could cause a delay of shipping. We don\u2019t anticipate this being an issue, as our vendor has done MANY similar projects. If anything does happen, we will make sure to keep everyone informed and up to date regarding where we are in the process.",
  "This is my second Kickstarter! I'm super organized, obsessed with spreadsheets, and have already run a very successful enamel pin campaign that I ended up fulfilling a full month ahead of schedule. I'm familiar with shipping lots of small items to all parts of the globe, not only from my previous Kickstarter, but I've also been running an Etsy shop since 2015. I will be sending out periodic updates no matter what, and you'll hear about any issues that may arise!",
  "The production time of the pins and ita bags is completely beyond my control, because two different manufacturers makes the pins and ita bags for me. Normally it takes about 4 week of production, if there is any delay I'll let all my backers know.\n\nThere may be delay in production and shipping time because of the COVID 19 situation in the world right now.\n\nThe colors may change slightly once the pins go into production. If something in my design changes. I'll notifiy all backers.\n\nI'm not accountable for lost or damaged pins, but if the damage occurs under my accountability, I will gladly have a new pin send to you!",
  "The risks and challenges I foresee are few. I've assembled an amazing, passionate team. My rewards are all realistic, and i'm excited to deliver them. Once the film is complete we will be entering it into a number of festivals. The reception it gets I can only guess- that's probably the biggest unknown quantity. I know that this will be the first of many projects, each of which will be more remarkable than the last.",
  "We do not see any risks outside of a slight delay in production time. We expect them to ship 3-4 weeks after the Kickstarter ends.",
  "The supply chain challenges could possibly affect the delivery of paper to the printer. It could also slow the shipping of the books from Italy to Oregon. If this is the case, I will keep everyone posted as to the status of both issues.",
  "The designs could change subtly for multiple reasons, as far as possible we will try not to make changes (unless needed), modifications could be the colors, thickness, lines or size.\n\nThe delivery dates will be delayed for a few months due to COVID-19, to avoid expectations because there is a risk of delays, just as the rewards could come later than the estimated, they could also come earlier.\n\nAll shipments are made through traditional international mail, that means that the pins would arrive through your national postal service (USPS in the case of the United States) and have their tracking code. That means there is a possibility that the pins will not arrive or be lost on the way (although the probability is too low, I must mention it because it could happen) so once the tracking code is delivered, the responsibility for the delivery of the pins no longer corresponds to me, obviously I want everyone to get their pins, but this is a reality that could happen no matter how small the possibility is, so , if you want to insure your pins, I would appreciate if you would contact me to see additional costs for safer shipping by private parcel.\n\nIf for any reason you need a refund after the project has finished, I will do my best to return your money, but I warn you that I can only return the amount of money with the taxes already discounted so as not to affect the project, and of course, if the project funds allow me. Remember that you have the entire duration of the project to cancel or change your pledge.",

As soon as we reach our goal, we will be ready to get the rewards out as promised. \r\nBut with any ambitious project, there may be some delays in shipping as we work out the final supplies and numbers for this campaign. We don't anticipate any farm-related delays as things are growing and there have been no late frost issues this year. We think 2014 is going to be a great year!",
  "Organic fruit comes in seasonally to local organic wholesalers-buying in season at peak times increases prices but also guarantees quality-a good job that jam lasts once it is made and sealed into a jar!\r\n\r\nProduction depends entirely on the supply of fruit-bad crops/bad weather are obstacles that could 'crop' up (pardon the pun)\r\n\r\nHaving the cash to enable me to buy in bulk at peak times will ensure I have the stock to continue selling products and not need to hang around waiting for the next glut of Strawberries of Blackcurrants to come into season the following year.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about Jams and Chutneys though, is that soft fruits are not the only produce which can be turned into delicious jams-more hardy plants such as chillies, peppers, onions, tomatoes which are more readily available year round can be used to ensure a good stock pile\r\n\r\nUtilising local farmers is an aim of mine to ensure a reliable source, but many rely on wholesale purchases to survive themselves.",

In addition, I will be doing the directing, editing, fx, and a lot of the other post work.  All of this has to get done within the next month...\r\n\r\nTo manage this, we are keeping the production small and are being selective with our shots.

Without the funds, the production and launch of this podcast and overall brand can be delayed for months in order to gather up the amount necessary to launch the brand.

With a day job, it can definitely be difficult to find the time to work on a project like this, but I am dedicated to helping people make the valuable connections they need and will be able to get it done as long as I have some accountability. I also hope to hire someone to help out with some of the tasks in the future, especially when we start hosting in-person events.",

There is always the possibility of some slippage in the the schedule but I think it's completely realistic that I can finish the actual recording by the end of August 2013.

In the current climate this could be difficult, but we hope that including previously unrecorded music will help.  If we can't on this occasion release the CD on a label we will be looking to distribute and market it ourselves as effectively as possible, perhaps with professional help.  The benefit of this approach is that we will receive all profits from the sales, and maintain complete control of the look of the CD.  As well as selling the CD on our website and at concerts, we will be using the disc as a 'calling card' to promote the group widely to concert series, festivals etc.\r\n\r\nFor further information about the precise budget for the project please contact Emily Ashton - emilyashton1000@gmail.com",

  "Reward does not come without risk, but we believe our adaptable and diverse approaches provide a greater chance of success. We\u2019ve met so many challenges successfully at the onset -- securing FCC approval, building permits, studio establishment, initial equipment purchases, and community involvement -- that if this campaign is successful, paying our fixed expenses for 2016 and building additional studio capacity pose very few risks.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is always chance for the unexpected. Bottomline worse-case scenario would be if ever a crushing FCC violation came into play. As a small operation without sizable corporate funding (and, therefore, at our own personal financial risk), we are always cognizant of this, and so we take extensive preventative measures and reinforcement to ensure compliance throughout our wide-ranging programming. Our coming acquisition of a professional broadcast profanity delay will also help reduce this risk.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, perhaps our biggest risk would be a lack of community engagement and support -- as programmers, as listeners, as underwriters, as donors, or as friends of local arts and culture. That is the risk many in the community face, but it is with the committed belief in this project that we continue.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this fundraising campaign, we hold a great number -- and wide scope -- of fundraising events throughout the year. These events are often in partnership with other small local groups who play viable roles in the Rochester arts scenes, and are not only successful financially, but they broaden our range of engagement and inter-connection with the community at large.",

However, we have already standardized our turn-in procedure, so this is not a big problem any longer.\r\n\r\nThough a good portion of the planned budget is for our actors, and the actors that will join the crew later down the road, the rate that I have decided upon is very minimal, and does not give our actors the opportunity to work on the production full time.  However, I have already discussed this with our core members, and will be informing future members of this to prevent any confusion or delay in release.",

  "The beginning of the production was already faced with some difficulties, as some people were no longer able to be involved with the show, including my choreographer. I am fortunate to be working with some very kind and helpful people, so even if they are leaving they can suggest others who would be interested in taking their place. \r\n\r\nOriginally it was meant to be a live performance, but my tutor and published author, Mimi Thebo suggested it could work really well in a multimedia format, as I already had planned to use poetry and music within the show.\r\n\r\nWe're also going to be working outside and with the British weather in mind, this may change our filming schedule in some ways, but we are driven enough to carry on.",
  "Oh, no risks in telling people you're gonna make a SPOOKER film and develop it in horse poop.  :0 \u00a0\r\n\r\nActually - I make handmade \"Art Films\" all the time, usually one a month.

The risk that all artists take is in YOUR PERCEPTION of my work, once it's finished and presented. \r\n\r\nThe thought that YOU will view my work, and JUDGE IT for your self (and judge me and all my friends connected to this work) - fills me with a great responsibility.  It drives me to produce the very best that I can.  I may utterly fail in this regard. I think though, that a percentage may like it.\r\n\r\nAll my life I've told SPOOKER stories to my family at campfires while camping. Yes, young nieces and nephew who my sister says laid in their sleeping bags scared. In that crazy scared-but-safe-entertainment that Spooker stories are.

  "I used a Kick Starter campaign to fund a teaching trip to Ernabella, Australia in 2012. In addition to being a life-changing experience it was a great introduction to the Kick Starter community and fund raising process. \r\n\r\nDuring the beginning part of the campaign I felt the surge of excitement that comes with a new project. I thankfully reached my goal and set off on the trip. Once I arrived in the Outback I ran into my first set of challenges. The rewards for the campaign included collaborative pieces created by myself and the Pitjantjatjara artists that I visited. I had not anticipated the difficulty in shipping art from the middle of the Outback to the United States. Armed with that knowledge, I have planned extra time into the budget for my current Kickstarter campaign to deal with shipping. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge that I ran into was fund-raising fatigue. The beginning of the campaign was filled with encouragement and \"high-five\" experiences. Months later as the last of my rewards were distributed I was exhausted. To help counteract this sort of fatigue I have planned a gentler time line for this campaign. I now know how long it takes to fulfill rewards so I have readjusted my expectations. I think this will help me not to burn out early in the campaign. Fundraising is a lot like distance running. You have to start out slow so you can save energy for the final push.",

  "Our first and biggest risk will be to reach enough Kickstarter backers within the timeframe of our campaign.  It is essential to this concert that we meet our goal, for without the necessary funds this event will simply not be possible.  We strongly believe that working musicians must be compensated appropriately for their time and efforts, and we will do everything we can to spread the word of this campaign in order to meet our goal.  We also fully realize the importance of finding the best venue to suit the needs of our concert series, the mood of our events, and the size of our audience.  St. Paul\u2019s has been wonderful to deal with as our preferred venue, but without the appropriate amount of backers, we will not be able to secure the booking.\r\n \r\nAfter our finances are squared away, we will be faced with the challenge of reaching an audience for our concert.  As a brand new concert series, we will be almost starting from scratch as we start to build our audience.  Our past concerts have been held in a 50 person venue, but we are being much more ambitious with this concert, and will attempt to fill a venue that seats 300 people.  While we will not have a budget for marketing the event by traditional means, we will be working hard to increase our presence in the community, and hope that the high profiles of our performers and conductor may also help draw the attention of a new audience.",
  "We've been involved in numerous recording projects as musicians and producers, so we know how this works.  This recording follows a successful Kickstarter project we did for my first solo CD last fall, so we also have experience with working with backers and making Kickstarter fun and successful.\r\nThis project requires a lot of people to come together to create it, so there's always the risk that someone could have a personal emergency or a hurricane or snowstorm could postpone it, but we've put so many hundreds of hours into this already, that there's no way we're not going to make it happen.",

  "The only risk that we foresee is not reaching our funding goal.  We have set in place the infrastructure and manufacturing plan to begin production early 2020",
  "As this situation is still unfolding the timeline/budget may have to be adjusted as events unfold,  If such events should come to fruition we will plan to launch another campaign to continue this story as a part 2 addition.\n\nOur Team will be working remotely for the majority of this production with a small crew traveling to select locations for filming and interviews.  In the Event that travel restrictions tighten production may be delayed or the script may be amended to accommodate.",
  "To mitigate risk, I plan on having an agreement signed by the individuals featured in my videos. \n\nBy offering companies free advertisement within my video will help with the challenges that may arise of trying to convince local businesses to participate in my planned events. \n\nOffering an incentive of participating in my videos and promoting the videos across my social media platforms will help generate the buzz needed with people tuning in and viewing my videos which will help further my vision in creating a greater lasting impact within the community. \n\nThe risk of COVID-19 is minimal as the people I plan on utilizing for the creation of my videos are within my social bubble, and other are able to be reached through technology. With individuals featured in my videos, we will be adhering to the government protocols. \n\nI have a personal audience of approximately 1200+ people. Approx. 10%+ engage with my posts on a regular basis. I expect of that 10% to further cause another 3% impact within their social platforms. Which some are influencers themselves so that number is really hard to pinpoint. But within my general area we have approx. 7 million people\u2019s lives we can impact. And based off of the impact of the YouTuber MrBeast has 50 million people. \n\nThe budget will go towards funding the video, purchasing the microphone, editing software, and the compensation of the cameraman, video editor and any necessary costs associated in setting up and creating the videos. \n\nI\u2019m confident that I\u2019m able to carry out the timelines for the rewards. \nAs 7 out of 8 rewards are digitally executed.\n6 out of 8 rewards could be completed after 2 of my videos.  \nFor the top 2 rewards I already have a formal agreement in place. \nThe only challenging reward would be the one to be featured in my video as travel bans and COVID-19 being a deterrent, but if the backer is within my region and we adhere to government protocols, I should be able to complete it. The only way I see being able 100% to complete the featuring in my video reward is extending the estimated delivery date of the reward to the most allowed date available to give flexibility until the COVID-19 curve subsides.",
  "Without a camera or a more establish computer I will not be able to publish any video content. I continue to work a full time job so all T shirts will be mailed out on Friday from the week the donation was made. Which can delay delivery a few days.

  "Why i need the money? Well to be honest i'd like to rent a pinball parlor for a day of filming and need to take a trip to either Portland or Seattle for a weekend of filming. The money is just for travel expense and rental fees, without it i can't get the shots i need. i live on disability which allows for the time i have, but not for the budget of making a feature film, so far, it has been creative wit and perseverance that's made it work so far. All the money will be accounted for as i will post receipts of the money spent on my Jess Humel FB page.",
  "The main steps for this project to be successful are: the completion of the pieces, the rehearsals with the musicians, the organization of the concert itself, and the recording of the CD. Since we started planning this project a lot in advance, all essential pieces of the puzzle are pretty much in place: the composition of the pieces is already underway; scores will be delivered to the performers by the end of October 2012. The performers will have about a month to rehearse the new pieces. The concert is scheduled to take place in San Diego on November 30th, 2012. The venue is already booked (a very nice recital hall at UCSD), and the event will be free admission. The recording is also scheduled for January 2013. Allowing for another month and a half to finish up the production of the CD, the estimated delivery date is set to March 2013.\r\n\r\nHow are we qualified to realize this project?\r\nOne of the composers (Tania Lanfer) is a graduate student at UCSD and is taking care of concert promotion and organizing. All four composers have plenty of past experience with concert organizing: Tania has helped organize numerous events at UCSD; Bruno actually worked as concert organizer at CCRMA (Stanford University) between 2010 and 2012; and before coming to the USA, Fernanda and Bernardo helped organize a number of new music concerts in Brazil.\r\nAs for the recording: we have already arranged a professional recording facility for January 2013. The musicians will spend one or two days (depending on need) recording every passage as many times as necessary. The composers will finish the mixing in February and finally make the recordings available both in CD and digital download format in March 2013.\r\n\r\nIn summary: thanks to all the work already put into this project so far, everything is ready to happen. We just need to raise the funds to pay Gnarwhallaby for their work!",

  "Having already worked with the Das Karussell Orchestra at the Brucknerhaus, I feel confident that they are the perfect orchestra for me to record ORCA with. I have heard other classical albums made with this orchestra that have been recorded at Brucknerhaus and they sound stellar. We have taken all the appropriate measures to insure that the recording equipment and engineers used are consistent with achieving a recording of the same highest quality. Every recording session has it's list of challenges, but we've made all the necessary arrangements to minimize any bumps in the road. This will be a challenge, but a very manageable one that I feel very confident will be handled with the utmost level of professionalism. \r\n\r\nThe goal fund of $25,000 will cover the necessary recording costs of the actual session itself, but nothing else. From a risk/challenge perspective, this is our biggest one. Mixing and mastering will need to commence thereafter, and usually there are considerable funds that are required to make that happen. Fortunately, I have my own studio that will be mixing and mastering in, so I will be able to effectively manage costs associated with this process. Also, I feel very confident in my abilities to effectively mix and master the album as I have had plenty of experience in my studio. In fact, I just mixed my most recent full length rock album 'Harakiri', that has received great reviews for it's audio quality. Additionally, I will be working with the same engineer who helped mix my previous live album recorded with an orchestra, \"The Elect The Dead Symphony\". We have plans to mix and master the album upon our return from Europe after this concert on October 28, and the timeline that we have mapped out to complete the mixing is very manageable.\r\n\r\nWe are also working towards finding a well respected classical music label partner to up with for the official release of ORCA. This has been an ongoing process that is showing much promise. Since no official agreement has yet been made, there also exists a challenge here with respect to timeline of official release date of ORCA. However, I have taken this into consideration and have allotted for the appropriate tentative release date of June 2013 for the physical cd of ORCA to be delivered. If no agreement can be reached, I have a backup plan. Since I do have my own record label in Serjical Strike Records, I would self release ORCA myself. This is also a very manageable challenge as I do have years of experience releasing records and have the ability to produce and release my own music as physical products.",

I am not an influencer; I am a writer, comedian, and actor who understands directing and producing.

Also, there is always a risk of injury from building just about anything. We will minimize risk of injury by providing proper training to blue sky dreamers and carefully overseeing their work.",

  "Delivery time on the 3d printer is up to 4 weeks, to makes the timescale of delivery as small as possible all designs will be done on the computer in advance ready to go once the printer arrives and i will also order the printer as soon as my project reaches its target to try and get the ball rolling as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIf i exceed my target then the workload may get to a level when i have a backlog of pieces to finish off in the workshop so i will enlist a couple of extra helping hands to make sure items are sent out as soon as they can be without compromising the quality of each piece.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to turning this project from idea into reality, so I am very well prepared for it.",
  "The risks and challanges of this project are to stay ahead in fashion. Body jewelry has not made a big landig yet in the fashion industry but soon it will come. To stay ahead BodyGold Jewelz has already started her second collection wich will be for brides. The first notes for the third collection has also been layed on paper.\r\n\r\nAnother risk are the copycats louring around to duplicate a beautiful product. Stripping away it's unique identity and exclusivity. In that case BodyGold Jewelz will always be wearable for any size because of the option to have it custom made in your size.\r\n\r\nThere's also a risk that the jewelry that will be made in China won't turn out the same as the original example. In that case we'll have to think about changing the price and look for another supplier.",

  "Every project comes with its own risks and challenges. \r\nLike anything else, I think the biggest risk in investing in a brand new project is not having any returns at all. \r\nThe challenge here is to make sure people are aware that we are on the market, to give the project a chance and to make it grow into a success. We could have a potential bestseller in our hands but if you do not know how to market it the right way then it could also become the best flop of the year. \r\nThis is why, although we are a small team starting off, we made sure that each team member would have his/her own skills and knowledge to bring to the table. Melissa will be fully focused on Marketing and PR, while Charles will work on the Creative aspect of the game, as well as Customer Service. Kunjal and her 3 developers in the other hand will make sure that the game runs smoothly and will constantly work on new updates and bug fixes if necessary.\r\nWe truly believe that by combining all of our knowledge together we will rise to the top while learning throughout the process.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on about what ifs and all the potential risks that we could encounter but I don't think it would help much. In my opinion risks are pretty much the same for all of us that are creating a project on Kickstarter. \r\n\r\nThat being said, we did fund the whole basic game with our own savings, which is our way to show you how involved and serious we are about the project. The amount pledged in this project is to help us start working on updates to swiftly provide more content to the customers as well as having a professional game trailer done for us.\r\n\r\nProgress always involves risk. Dash or Die will become a great success story. Mark my words.",

  "Red Nebula is an ambitious undertaking. As a college thesis film it presents an exciting opportunity to flex our creative abilities and create something not just passable, but something we can always look back on with pride. The genre demands a level of creativity and imagination rarely seen in your everyday drama.\r\n\r\nSetting - Red Nebula takes place on the space shuttle Erebos, a derelict Earth shuttle carrying dozens of lottery winners to their new lives on Paradise. This means the building of miniatures, space shuttle interiors, props and some fancy camera work.\r\n\r\nStyle - To make it feel real we need the right equipment for the job. This means rentals for cameras, lenses, sound equipment, as well as aquiring props, costumes and all the little details that will bring this story to life.\r\n\r\nManpower - Everyday I wish I could just close my eyes and manifest this film. Yet I can't. It is going to take a team of people that I can trust and rely on to make this thing happen. People like my Cinematographer, Dylan Kaplowitz or my amazing Assistant Director, Pavlos Christou, and my stunning Producer, Alannah Fehrenbach. All of whom need at least a square meal a day.\r\n\r\nJoin us in proving my Professors wrong by making this film become more than just the dreams of a crazy Brooklyn College Film Student.",

Finding actors, signing locations, creating a great team; these are just the tip of the iceberg. Fortunately, we already have some resources in place, and we're experienced. Our goal is to raise $300 dollars to cover essentials. Of course, anything beyond that would be amazing, and would go to things like buying food, renting better equipment, etc. But we're not a business. We're artists and we're in this to create something meaningful. We want you to know that your contribution is meaningful too. We appreciate your support more than words can express.

  "As mentioned in the story segment above, it is possible that there will be shipping delays due to the holiday season and pandemic related delays. This delay can potentially affect production timelines but I will be using the order quantities from the first week of the campaign as a gage for how many of each design I should produce. With this I will begin productions within the first week of campaign launch so hopefully this will reduce the chance of any delays affecting our delivery times.\n\nSince I will be starting production before the campaign ends, there is a possibility that I will not order the correct amount of each size of rings and bangles. If this is something that concerns you feel free to reach out with a Kickstarter message to let me know what size you would like to order and I will take that into consideration. \n\nAll orders will be fulfilled on a first come first serve basis determined by when your Reward Survey is completed.

  "We've faced many challenges since the start of the development of this product. The primary challenge was finding a manufacturer. There were no U.S. manufacturers or engineers who felt they could design an ink pen small enough to contain a USB along with an ink pen and stylus. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we reached out to overseas manufacturers. After diligently searching we successfully found one. Then there was the language barrier. We spent countless hours and a lot of money on getting the desired results. Now we have a contact that is fluent in the language. \r\n\r\nWe currently have three patents, several prototypes and a small trial batch that we've sold out of. There has been many great reviews about the products and many want to purchase. However, with your support we can purchase more inventory for mass distribution and make available on the market at an affordable cost.",
  "Invisivision is a product entering a very competitive market place, in both film and advertising. Though there are a number of obstacles ahead, we are prepared to overcome them using a variety of tactics.  We have identified the niche of inexpensive visual interactivity which creates an avenue to engage viewers more effectively.\r\n\r\nHowever, the method in which Invisivision operates involves the use of a stereoscopic environment, effectively making theaters with stereoscopic-enabled displays a dependent variable in our success.  \r\n\r\nBeing that our primary target involves feature films, RealD, MasterImage and Dolby Digital are some of the major players in the stereoscopic entertainment market who become direct competitors of PipeDream Interactive and Invisivision.\r\n\r\nWe've secured strategic partnerships with established industry entities which have provided us with invaluable insight into the entertainment field.  Regardless, we still face the challenges of encouraging user adoption, solving technical issues such as \"ghosting\", and creating movement in an industry which can be notoriously slow to react to change.\r\n\r\nAll of these can be combated by convincing one Hollywood studio to produce a feature film for these glasses.  A key factor is that these eyewear are used in the right type of film - one that delivers the best content for the viewer.  We've already had requests from two major studios to show them a quality demo.  You can help us get there.",
  "Risks for this project are very low. I have already gotten commitments from the bilingual translator and most of the artists needed for full spread illustrations and covers.

I\u2019m still thinking about adding a Spanish-English sight words glossary, which will take more time and formatting. My goal is to have everything completed by the end of March.",
  "We're not new to this - and having previously taken a project successfully through Kickstarter, we are very aware of the numerous risks and challenges that creators face. \r\n\r\nAda is already at late stage in the development process, and we are working with experienced industrial designers and electronic engineers to help mitigate risk. As a company we have experience in manufacturing electronics in China, as well as the logistics involved in shipping to our tens of thousands of existing customers around the world. \r\n\r\nThat said, all projects face risks and challenges. These are some of the blips on our risk radar: \r\n\r\nFCC and CE testing. The devices have been developed to meet the emissions criteria for both FCC and CE marking, but until the final prototype is complete we will not be able to do the actual testing. This may mean we need additional revisions to the electronics to pass the tests, which could cause delays. \r\n\r\nSourcing. We have several quotes from manufacturers, but until we know how successful this Kickstarter project is, we can\u2019t get final costings and finalise our negotiations with the manufacturers.\r\n\r\nManufacture. We have extensive experience in manufacturing products in China: both our first Kickstarter products and our popular Triggertrap Mobile Dongle are manufactured there. However, manufacturing in the Far East isn't without risks. One key challenge is quality control. For Ada, we are producing fixtures that will extensively test the devices as they are manufactured. As manufacturing starts we will keep a very close eye on quality, both in person, and through experienced QC inspectors. \r\n\r\nFinally, we promise to keep you guys in the loop every step of the way, so you know how we are getting on!",

You may see some artifacts at the seam boundaries. The PanaCast camera is optimized for the 6-20 feet range. Outside this range, the seam boundaries may be more noticeable, and objects closer than that may appear to be cut off or incorrectly stitched.\r\n\r\nGiven the 3 years of development so far we see the risks as fairly low.",

  "I have been a machinist for many years; I am largely self-taught. I have always had an interest in the Luger; my fascination has more to do with the degree of precision required for such a utilitarian item. I started making wooden rubber band shooters when I was still a boy, and the Luger was a natural subject. The iteration in the photo was from a small production run of rubber band shooters that I was commissioned to build over fifteen years ago. Since then, my talents and abilities have grown enormously, and the advent of inexpensive, desktop CNC machines have made the required, repeatable precision much easier to achieve. \r\n\r\nThe challenges will be in working to tolerances of .001 in a material that is not stable, and prone to warping and distortion when machined to thin sections. I believe I have achieved a method to stabilize the wood to make such precision possible and repeatable. I will investigate the feasibility of creating wooden coil springs that are functional; this is something which no one else to the best of my knowledge has ever achieved. These are the risks and challenges that I will face when it comes to actually making the parts.\r\n\r\nGreater challenges lie with documenting and writing up my experiences into something that someone would actually want to read. I am not a writer, and have never published a book before, but those skills will be necessary to completing the project. The end goal is the construction of the physical object, which will be donated to the Joe Martin Foundation Craftsmanship Museum in California, and the documentation of the construction along with a coherent set of instructions and photographs which will live on for eternity in cyber-immortality long after I am gone.",

The result is occasionally I have to do more hand work or recut the pieces which can slow down the production process.\r\n\r\nI produce all of the materials myself, have access to two different sources for the same wood, access to two different plastics stores and one leather store all within 30 miles of my home. \r\n\r\nI own the laser that I use to produce my end products. It quiet, and I am able to cut without time restrictions. I built a large filter for it, so the emissions are kept to a minimum so as to not burden the neighborhood. If something were to break on the laser, I have a source in the USA where I can get parts for it within 48 hours. \r\n\r\nI have minimized risk as much as possible and will begin producing the rewards as soon as the minimum is met to expedite delivery.",
  "We have a short amount of time to find our funding, but with the support of our friends, families, mentors, and supporters, we think we can raise the necessary money to fund the trip for our students whose experiment and patch was chosen. The date of the launch is subject to change, so we must buy airline tickets with flexible dates, which is more costly. We will keep you updated on any changes to the schedule, and hope you will follow the progress as we get closer to our launch date and our campaign deadline.",
  "I've tried to account for supply chain issues in the timeline, but there's a slight chance it will take longer for fulfillment. If all supplies arrive on time, it's also possible the books/boxes will ship early.",
  "We are about 85% from getting this book to your doorsteps. Our number one priority is getting this book to you as soon as we can. We are currently in the design stage, then on to proofing and printing. We anticipate everything being finalized by the end of the campaign so we can send it to the printer immediately after the campaign ends. \n\nAs a backer, financially there is no risk. Kickstarter is an all or nothing crowdfunding platform, if I do not meet my Kickstarter funding goal of $15,000,  you will not be charged. If goals are met, you can expect the following:\n\n- Charge for your donation at the end of the campaign (mid- to end of February 2022)\n- Receive an email from Kickstarter confirming your mailing address for delivery or email for digital delivery\n- The book goes to the Printers by end of March 2022\n- Books should be in hand and ready for delivery Summer 2022\n- Updates regarding status of books and rewards\n\nBarring any sort of unfortunate printer meltdown, delivery stoppage or world-wide ink shortage, we anticipate getting books out by the summer.",
  "Low risk.  The only things remaining to complete the book are the covers, the title page, glossary, introduction, and the Backer's Page.  The interior pages are finished. \n\nThe printer of the book is already lined up and ready to go.   If funded all books and rewards will ship in February.",
  "There are major risks with owning an independent record label. That is one of the main reasons why aspiring artist signed to major record labels, because major record labels provide all of the necessities to have a major buzz such as such as promotion and distribution. But being that I was signed to an independent label at 18, I know the in's and outs of the business.",
  "Given how long I have been doing this, I believe the possibility of any risks are next to none. \r\n\r\nThe only challenges I would say is a personal one which is just making sure I appeal to my current and any new fans. Especially because the world is changing everyday! \r\n\r\nThere's a reason why I take my time and have held back on releasing anything major until I KNEW it was right. My confidence is through the roof and it couldn't be any better timing than this year. \r\n\r\nIve gone through plenty trial and error as a musician but now it's all about staying relevant and doing what I do best, continuously.",
  "I have completed two necklaces so far and I am already out of what I need to make more. So, the biggest problem is having enough supplies to complete my goal. Hopefully, by making and selling these necklaces I will be able to still afford to get the supplies I need to finish my goal.",
  "This type of project is low-risk. We have contacted Google in order to request permission to use their satellite imagery, with positive outcome. It is very unlikely that creators and developers will have problems.\r\nIf the project will be funded, backers will know its progress in every detail and at any time.",
  "With your support, we feel comfortable with the feedback, market reaction and potential partners that we will fulfill our goals.    \r\n\r\nTeam EGIIS feels we've covered our bases pretty well from research, mfg selection, QC, design, marketability and affordability. Rest assured we have been in the industry long enough to be confidant yet humbly realize that the unexpected is something that can't be anticipated.\r\n\r\nOur timelines have been buffered or padded with a calculated amount of time from past experiences. We have spent many restless nights checking and double checking everything. We can do everything in our powers to be fully prepared but the biggest hurdle we see is that unlike huge corporations, with our limited resources, we are not able to reach further in our marketing efforts. Part of your support will used to initiate more marketing to get the word out, to get recognized and to become an industry leader.",
  "One of the biggest challenges I face currently is my location! I have done all I can on my own given that I live on a small island! I am taking a risk by going big and mass producing because I know in my heart that Jartzy can make a difference not only for kids but for parents! I have realized that in order to reach more families I am going to need to mass-produce and I am also going to need more financial backing! I have the drive and I have been incredibly successful as a one-woman business thus far. But, I am ready to take a risk and help Jartzy to become a household name! I am willing to re-locate for the benefit of Jartzy if necessary! I am all in.",
  "I am working as a one-man-band for now, so I do not expect any hold-backs. If any would come my way, such as long hours at workplace, I think I'd need a big cup of coffee, because enthusiasm and the hard work is never going to leave this idea :)",
  "Challenges I might face after my pieces are done is actually getting them sold, but I am dedicated to doing whatever it takes to get my home decor sold, wither it be setting up booths at local events or posting them online, I will get my pieces done right and sold.",
  "There are two potential challenges that will need to be considered with completing this project. The first challenge is time. Like most Americans, I have a full-time job and hours that sometimes go beyond the normal 8-5 routine. I am extremely dedicated to this project and will be disciplined to work afternoons and on weekends to complete it on time. Maintaining a balance between family and work will be important though.\r\nThe second challenge will be budget. The amount pledged is operating on a very lean budget. To stay within the budget, I have planned on identifying and reducing the costs through careful evaluation of needs versus wants. Although materials for this project do not have to be the cheapest in quality and price, I can put effort into finding second-hand materials or clearance items to operate within the budget.",
  "Money and time.  These two things often equate to the same thing.  There are no unforeseen challenges in the actual creation and implementation of the hardware and software.  Marketing will be its own challenge for the next phase.",
  "We do not see any potential problems or issues. We actually have built the first edition of the Xtreme cam and have tested it and filmed with it for months. Once we get the extra funding we will make the cam even better then it is. We will not have any fulfillment issues because we manufacture them right in our own facility. We are ready to go.",
  "The primary challenge will be completing the project within a short time frame. There are so many technological nuances among the different smartphone operating systems that extensive testing is required. In addition actual road testing is necessary to insure the various systems actually work in practice, not just in theory.",
  "The only risk or challenge I know is not working hard enough to get good music out to the people. If a delay does occur do not expect it to be anything longer than a 2 weeks. Lakeside is my main and only major project right now and will take up the other half of my time besides school. Backers will be updated every week on the till release. you will be able to download Lakeside off of websites like Datpiff, Soundcloud, Reverbnation and more to be announced.",

Fortunately, we have the support of our friends at the print company since 2008.",
  "Our biggest challenge would be scaling the game up if we have an unprecedented number of players.  Fortunately, we have tons of experience in this sort of thing, and we'll be using AWS for the back-end database and API.\r\n\r\nOur second biggest challenge will be finding a way to determine whether or not players are drinking beer.  We're counting on Apple building this functionality into the iPhone 7, but if they don't, then this particular aspect of the game may be modified before the release date depending on the capabilities of available add-on hardware.",
  "We understand rather too well, that development of any game may be further complicated by extra expenses or unforeseen issues. All this may lead to delays, but not to the cancellation of the project. We accept all the risks and are willing to work seven day weeks, like we had already, to fully implement all our ideas in this project and bring it to you. With your support, we shall go the whole nine yards.",
  "The biggest challenge I've come across thus far, is inventory management, and counting on vendors to fulfill product and material orders. By planning ahead, I can help mitigate some of the potential risk in delayed shipping or production times.\r\n\r\nThe other obstacle will be automated billing within the e-commerce platform, but I believe I have some great options when it comes to either creating a module, or going with an off-the-shelf option for launch.",
  "There are slight risks and challenges to producing my Tesseltiles but nothing major as it is a very simple idea and easily produced once the finished moulding tool is approved and tested. All the triangular tiles are exactly the same shape and size and it is down to how they look after they have been through the moulding process which is down to me and the factory producing them. We are both confident however of achieving a highly polished finished surface to each and every tile which will be rigorously checked for any flaws or variances.",

  "Every film has its challenges, but when you have a great group of people with the same passions it makes everything easier. Some of the challenges we will face during this project are going to be the location and lack of equipment. We are an indy production company that is just starting out and we don't have all the odds and ends most filmmakers have. Most of us are just broke college students trying to live the dream. We will overcome our challenges with perseverance, hard work and pure passion. This amazing group of people are capable of handling every challenge that comes their way together we are unstoppable.",
  "The biggest risk facing this project is with regards to time and scheduling. The expectation is to shoot the film over a period of three months with most shoots taking place on weekends. If an actor is scheduled for a given weekend and cancels for whatever reason, this impacts the schedule. If this happens several times (with either the same or different actors) the schedule will be drastically impacted.\r\n\r\nThere may be opportunities to make up for the lost time. Options might include scheduling time during the week for actors who are available during the week. This is one possible way in which time can be made up, but the entire crew as well as Lee Lin must be present as well, which could be problematic.\r\n\r\nThe expectation that scheduling may have to be modified at a moment's notice is critical so that if problems arise changes can be made ensuring that each weekend can be used for a shoot during the three month window.\r\n\r\nTo help prepare for these issues, schedules will be established with up to three optional weekends for each shoot. If a cancellation becomes necessary (things do happen), optional alternative time frames will already be available so that communication can start immediately to try to rework the schedule and avoid as much lost time as possible.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some arrangements will be made for backup actors and crew, so that if there is a drastic cancellation there may be a tenable solution that can be developed relatively quickly. As further protection, an extra month (beyond the target three months) may be allocated for filming just in case things go wrong.",

  "The challenges I see are as follows: First, obtaining the proper patents. Next, we have to have someone like UL to independently test G.E.O.D for risks involving fire or shock hazards. Our next challenge would be obtaining a bulk contract with the parts manufacturer that I am established with that helped build parts for G.E.O.D. Finally, the last challenge that I see would be an anticipated demand for this unit which will lead into a mass distribution problem for this product because of high demand which may result in needing a distribution warehouse.\r\n\r\nHow to overcome these challenges? Simply put! All these problems can and will be solved by the proper funding. If I have strong backers, the project will have a strong foundation and mega strong appeal.",

Our Project Leader is in a close contact with the manager of the small spacecraft launches, so he can solve this situation.\r\n3. Since we are an additional device on a board of the launch vehicle, the launch may be postponed.

  "Kickstarter asks: How are we qualified to overcome any adversity of this campaign?\r\n\r\nMobile Recon Systems has dedicated a great deal of time and expense to bring the KittyHawk quadcopter project online. We have established gold standards for assembly and production of the KittyHawk units. There are strict guidelines in place to ensure supreme craftsmanship in every Kittyhawk we build.  Mobile Recon Systems has implemented buffers and margins to ensure that we can deliver KittyHawk units by April 2016. We have the experience of a successful KickStarter campaign.  Please refer to our previous success at: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2011448493/lens-guard-protection-for-dslr-lenses/description.\r\n\r\nWe have carefully selected our vendors and production facilities with redundant backups, many of these we have worked with in the past with major success.\r\n\r\nAlthough, events can happen that we cannot anticipate or control, such as postal strikes and natural disasters, the typical delays in a project are supplier and shipping related.  This is why we have identified multiple supply channels to enable us to adhere to our planned shipping date.  International shipments will be affected by the local customs regulations and schedules. \r\n \r\nWe will keep all of our backers up to date and send out notifications of parts arrivals, component progress, milestone events and shipping schedules. Our backers will have 24/7 access to a dedicated section on our website where they can view videos, updates and strategies combined with our scheduled backer progress reports. This page section will be consistently updated until the last Kickstarter KittyHawk is delivered. \r\n\r\nPlease be reminded, if we are constantly kept busy replying to questions that may or may not be pertinent to the situation or have already been asked and answered, we are then required to stop what we are doing and will not be able to focus on the task at hand.

  "Risks & Challenges\r\n\r\nJust like every project, there are risk and challenges involved. However, I'm a firm believer that the only obstacle in your way that can stop you is the one that you let stand in your way of success. People should see obstacle as an opportunity to prove why you have become better at resolving issues; dealing with, and resolving unforeseen circumstances that comes your way. \r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln once said; \"We Can Complain Because Rose Bushes Have Thorns, or Rejoice Because Thorn Bushes Have Roses.\" Everything in life is simply how you approach it. I'm fully committed to making sure nothing stands in my way of this becoming a reality sooner than later. I'm working very closely with the engineering and supply chain to ensure that production will take place and be completed as scheduled. I've overcame many challenges in my personal and business life so this will not be the first or last.",

We hope this will be the beginning of many exciting projects together. Projects that inspire, entertain, educate and enlighten.",
  "There are some risks in this project. This is a one-shot flight, we do not have another chance if the experiment doesn't works correctly. We are confident about our stabilisation system because we already tested it in nearly the same conditions as the suborbital flight pattern.\r\n\r\nFor the other systems, we did not have the opportunity to test them on a zero-G flight, and anyways, the weightlessness time given in this type of flight is too short to conclude beyond 20 seconds of time. We will make a lot of tests on the ground, to make sure that these systems will not fail on the suborbital flight. (these tests includes vibration, temperature and acceleration resistance)\r\n\r\nIf we raise enough money for this project, it is possible that we book a new zero-G flight to test the final experiment before the suborbital flight, if we have any doubt on the behaviour of the experiment while the suborbital flight. This zero-G flight can also be an opportunity to compare the results of the experiment with the results on the ground and on the suborbital parabolic flight.\r\n\r\none final thing, at the end of this whole text : Thank you !",
  "There are numerous risks associate with the project from a technology standpoint. Our concept may not work at all. That, in itself, will not disprove the viability of engineering gravity for flight, it will merely indicate that our approach was faulty.\r\n\r\nIn terms of delivering rewards to supporters we do not foresee any issues. All technologies to manufacture reward items are widely available from numerous suppliers. We have sufficiently complete engineering drawings to produce detailed version of the reward models. The startup cost of the project includes 3D printing technology for prototyping purposes so the larger models will be produced in-house.",

  "We have solved most of the more difficult challenges. Primarily the design stage is complete and we are very happy with the outcome. According to those in the aircraft design industry, the ThunderStruck X-2A ticks all the boxes. Our own spreadsheets indicate that this craft is sleek enough to stay supersonic for about half a minute and will reach Mach1.5. The craft will be about 3m long and it will have a mass of 15kg. The force on the nose cone will will be the biggest issue with it reaching about 35kg during the maximum deceleration due to thickening density of the air at lower altitudes. The craft will move to horizontal flight at about 13km altitude and it will slow to some hundreds of kilometers per hour. It will fly at about 200kph until it lands on a runway. A drogue chute will slow the craft and stop it from veering off the runway.\r\n\r\nAdd to all of this, the amazing team that Jason has around him. There are 10 advisers with everything from space experience, IT, Radio systems, 3D design, CAD, flight analysis, rocket systems and much more. I will be telling you about each of them in the regular updates. \r\n\r\nEven DSTO has offered us access to their test systems for our craft. We can shake it, bake it and test how to make it!

  "We have manufactured dozens of functioning Static Displacement Field Drives generating 10-500 Millinewtons of thrust. We have also manufactured some light-weight disks that will become the foundation of our Quadcopter Drive Kits.\r\n\r\nOur internal testing of these devices has been conducted on on custom-built equipment. We are in the process of arranging 3rd party testing at NASA. The risk is that these devices don't work when tested by a third party. \r\n\r\nOther \u201cbreakthrough\u201d devices that have been recently tested by NASA have failed to generate measurable thrust. These devices were predicted to have had thrust numbers in the micronewton range. Thrust numbers in this range are very hard to measure to a level that can't be rationalized away, just like the Electric (aka Magnetic) Scalar Potential has been rationalized away for the last 100 years. Our devices are producing thousands of times more thrust than these other devices. Thrust numbers at these levels will make it hard, if not impossible, to rationalize away the thrust that our devices produce.\r\n\r\nAnother risk is reward fulfillment. We now have been making these devices for over a year and we have our suppliers already making the components for these devices. The more devices that we are able to assemble, to fulfill our rewards, the cheaper these components are going to be to us. Plus, the more that we make, the easier it is going to be to get the bugs out of our designs. But this is no guarantee that we can make any more.\r\n\r\nWe currently have five Static Displacement Field Drives with thrust numbers between 100-200 Millinewtons. These five drives will be used for our third-party thrust demonstration test and will be the source for the first five drives sent out for the $10,000 level. These five drives are drives that make history, just as the Wright flyer did 100 years ago. Just think--if you had the Wright flier and how much it would be worth today. Any devices that are ordered beyond the initial five devices will be manufactured using the same process as the initial set. However, we may experience a delay in the manufacture of components for any/all devices manufactured after the initial set.",

  "As with all space projects there are risks and challenges far greater than for projects on earth related to the task of placing a house on the Moon. This is the normal state of things in space projects and a part of what makes them so fascinating. \r\n\r\n\r\n1.   Missions to space\r\n\r\nAll missions to space face the same basic challenges. The environment in space is very different to what we are all accustomed to here on Earth. On Earth the atmosphere blocks out radiation from the Sun as well as from deep space and filters out much of the UV-radiation in the light from the Sun. The presence of air tends to even temperatures out, locally leading off heat produced by machinery for instance and globally giving us the chance to enjoy a hot summer night also when the sun has set. How things behave under these conditions is well known simply because we have a lot of experience personally of course but also scientifically and technologically. Moreover, on Earth you have access to equipment that you use and have the possibility to fix things when they wear down from natural wear and tear or do not behave as you expected or wanted.\r\n\r\nIn space things are different, the sunlight with its unfiltered UV-content, and on the Moon the surface temperature can vary from 120\u00b0C (250\u00b0F) during daytime to -150\u00b0C (-238\u00b0F) at night. Under these conditions, with temperature variations stressing the structure, UV breaking down the surface materials and electronics unprotected by an atmosphere from radiation and when it is not possible to fix things that go wrong, equipment has to be carefully designed.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the house is of particular interest. The colour red has not been the colour of choice for space missions where white, black and and metallic surfaces dominate because of their thermal properties. Red is a particularly tricky colour to use in space, many pigments have a tendency to break down when exposed to sunlight. For this reason we are particularly glad to have Falu R\u00f6df\u00e4rg as a partner. Falu R\u00f6df\u00e4rg has 250(!) years of experience of exposing red pigment to sunlight as a producer of exterior paint for housing.\r\n\r\nAll of the above factors will be addressed using space proven materials and designs which include secondary systems for moving parts and electronics acting as backup. The Moonhouse technical team all have unique competencies in developing the house. \r\n \r\n\r\n2. The construction of the house  \r\n\r\nWith all the electronics and the mechanics \u2013 the house is in many ways a great technological challenge. Not least since this will be the first time a house \u2013 a self-constructing house \u2013 is placed on the Moon. This whole procedure will take between 5-15 minutes, until the house is fully unfolded. The process of self-construction is deliberately prolonged to eliminate the risk of unwanted surprises. The gravity on the Moon is one sixth of gravity on Earth, which is sufficient enough to allow The Moonhouse to stand and remain on the surface of the Moon. There is no atmosphere on the Moon, and therefore not a flutter of wind, which is why the house can remain still despite its light weight. \r\n\r\n \r\n3.  Running short of backers \r\n\r\nThe Moonhouse is one of the world's most ambitious crowdfunding initiatives. The goal is to fund 15 million USD from various crowdfunding venues before November 30 2014 to make sure that the house is ready for take off with Astrobotic in October 2015. If the project has not been funded by November 30 2014, all funds (minus applicable administrative costs) will be returned to the backers. But if enough people join, we will together have changed history in space and the understanding of what people can achieve when working together.  \r\n\r\nThe goal for this Kickstarter project is 250,000 USD for Prototype 1. If we reach this goal of 250,000 USD, but The Moonhouse fails to reach the overall funding goal of 15 million USD by November 30 2014, all backers will be reimbursed of their pledged funds, minus applicable administrative costs. This would include 5% to be paid to Kickstarter, and costs to be paid to Amazon as described at https://payments.amazon.com/help/Amazon-Flexible-Payments-Service/Creating-Managing-Your-Account/Amazon-Payments-Fees. \r\n\r\nIf we do not reach the goal of 250,000 USD for this Kickstarter project, all Kickstarter backers will be reimbursed their pledged funds, also less administrative costs. All proceeds generated via crowdfunding will accrue in full to The Moonhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Legal structure   \r\n\r\nMikael Genberg is the creator of this Kickstarter project. For handling The Moonhouse art project in the United States, Mr. Genberg has founded an American company called House on the Moon LLC. House on the Moon LLC is based in Washington, D.C., and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Luna Resorts AB, a Swedish company that is itself wholly owned by Mr. Genberg. The sole purpose of House on the Moon LLC is to realize The Moonhouse. While it may become necessary at a later stage to engage one or more paid employees, currently House on the Moon LLC is, and is anticipated to remain, staffed solely by volunteers.\r\n\r\nThis Kickstarter campaign has been initiated and will be executed by Mr. Genberg through House on the Moon LLC. In order to meet Kickstarter, Inc.'s administrative requirements, Andrew Skowronek, a volunteer employee of House on the Moon LLC, will act as House on the Moon LLC's United States contact for Kickstarter, Inc. (Mr. Genberg resides in Sweden). Mr. Skowronek is acting on behalf of the company in his capacity as a volunteer employee of House on the Moon LLC. All funding will remit to a House on the Moon LLC Amazon payment account, and, if the goals are met, to a House on the Moon LLC bank account, both of which are controlled by Mr. Genberg through House on the Moon LLC. House on the Moon LLC is solely responsible for all aspects of this project.",

  "The road ahead is a short one, and there are quite a few challenges ahead for the Helios team. The greatest being weather. All engineering feats aside, the greatest detriment to the success of this campaign is unfavorable weather conditions at our current launch site in Nashville, which is why we are asking you, the Kickstarter community, for help. \r\n\r\nWe will know within 5 days what the weather in Nashville will be, and there are several logistical hurdles to relocating the launch to a new site, including but not limited to relocating a launch team of nearly 50 people to and from the alternative site, reserving hydrogen gas providers, reserving cranes, clearing launch sites in advance, transporting the vehicle and getting the proper permits from the city, county, state, and federal level.\r\n\r\nWe have to plan much of this in advance to create as many redundancies as possible to provide the best conditions for success and safety of the crew on board the Helios. We believe given the collective experience of the companies involved in the Helios mission, that we are especially equipped to handle the challenges that lie ahead of us.\r\n\r\nThe other contingencies to a successful involve being able to test the vehicle, unmanned, prior to launch which we anticipate first doing in March (strictly an electronics test) and then a complete unmanned flight test in late June, early July. The information provided to us during these unmanned flights will give us the data needed to recreate worst case scenario simulations that will better equip our flight crew in the case of emergency or equipment failure. We acknowledge the risks of this mission and have created as many precautionary measures to ensure the safety of both the flight and the crew.\r\n\r\nHaving a team of international engineers with extensive experience ranging from prior work with NASA or other major industry leaders, and by pursuing a simple vehicle model, our team is able to avoid many of the hurdles and delays often afford from more extensive endeavors. We have stripped away all non-essential luxuries to remove any liabilities that would delay, ground, or endanger the flight or it's crew.\r\n\r\nSafety is our first priority.\r\n\r\nThe team behind the Helios has vast experience in near space and space exploration based projects. The most recent accomplishment by members of the Helios team was back in July of last year when when SATINS  helped launch and play a golden record into space setting a world record first.",

  "Every movie production is faced with a certain amount of risk, that's just part of the game. Having completed several projects in the past we know the importance of proper pre-production and a well thought-out budget.\r\n\r\nThis project\u00b4s biggest risk lies in the post-production phase as a large number of effects shoots needs to be completed. Being well versed with the whole production pipeline is crucial to meeting deadlines and keeping costs down. After more than 10 years combined in the games industry working on several AAA-titles we have a deep understanding of working in a creative environment and what it takes to lead a team through this kind of process. During that time we also built a vast network of incredible artists whose talents easily translate in to the movie making process.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest challenge is to create a believable and living world for the characters to inhabit in this movie as it is a very important part of the story. We want to create something unique with \u201cMutant\u201d and we don\u2019t want to get bogged down in the cliches plaguing this genre, we want everything to be rooted in reality for that gritty and brutal hard sci-fi feeling that we are going for.",

  "Outside of the normal risks of starting a business, safety shoe manufacturing provides several risks that need to be addressed.\r\n\r\nASTM F2413-11: Although these shoes already meet the safety standards required in their country of origin, Mexico. We must ensure these shoes meet the rigorous safety standards in the US. This requires a series of tests to ensure customers are properly protected. The three of us have much experience in adhering to standards because our day jobs require us to do so. With creative engineering, adhering to safety standards and maintaining style can be achieved.\r\n\r\nInventory and Manufacturing: Low inventory helps keep costs down. Shoes are challenging in this aspect because several sizes (including half sizes for proper fit), colors and models must be kept in stock in the event of a customer order. Reduction of stock can be achieved through working closely with the manufacturer and analysis of customer orders. We plan to keep our inventory low through advanced order analysis and working with the manufacturer to synchronize our needs and their manufacturing flexibility.\r\n\r\nMarketing: There are very few products similar to ours available in the US market today. We truly believe we have found a sizable niche market in the shoe industry. Our marketing strategy is simple. Begin selling by word of mouth. We all have exposure to many direct and indirect manufacturing connections. Approximately 4 months after our 1st official sale, we will use SEO to increase our online exposure (where we see a majority of our sales).  After approximately 8 months after our 1st sale, we plan to begin to attend trade shows. Our ultimate sales goal is to become a preferred suppliers of safety shoes to manufacturing plants, offering bulk discounts on our shoes after plant sells a predetermined quantity of shoes.\r\n\r\nShoes for Women: Our most common feedback we receive is \"When are you going to make women's shoes?\" We absolutely are passionate about developing stylish women's safety shoes. There are an enormous amount of women who work in industries where safety equipment is required. A quick internet search will reveal these women don't have much to choose from and we want to change that.",
  "Potential production delays:\r\n\r\nAs our shoes are made by hand at a small-town workshop, there may be production delays, even with small-batch orders like ours. \r\n\r\nThese may arise due to delays in procurement of leather or other components of the shoes or production bottlenecks. Our craftsmen are in high demand, thanks to their town's reputation for making great fitting shoes. That said, they remain committed to creating this capsule collection, and given their dedication to their craft, rest assured that your shoes are in good hands.\r\n\r\nHowever, as everything is hand-made, imperfections do occur and that is why we are applying strict quality control and will individually inspect each and every finished product to ensure that you receive pristine-conditioned box-fresh sneakers\r\n\r\nHence, we appreciate your patience if a little extra time is needed to ensure that the final product arriving at your door-step is nothing short of perfect. The delay should be no more than 3-4 weeks, and we seek your understanding on this.\r\n\r\nAt Shokunin Shoes, we seek to make you and your family happy with stylish, sleek, and comfortable shoes you want to keep wearing.",

  "Like all kickstarter projects, Pterofin anticipates a few obstacles along the way to revolutionizing the renewable wind and water energy industry.  Our team of engineers have been working on the design for the last three months and they expect it will take at least another three months until completion.  After the design is finished we'll need to perform Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to determine the materials, fine tune the efficiency, and maximize the run time for each working model.  Finally we'll need to narrow down our list of suppliers and chose a manufacturer to produce and assemble our products, followed with finding a safe packaging and shipping method.  Since reliability is essential to our happy customers, the primary focus on what ultimately gets delivered will be on quality.  We anticipate the larger working models may take an additional six to nine months of testing, to guarantee your investment with Pterofin and in our planet, make a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge Pterofin faces is finding new team members, who not only share our same vision, but also posses the time and talent necessary to add value.

  "haha... :)\r\nwell. there are always risks\r\nlast year i invented a new construction technique to build \"Caliban\" a sculpture of nearly equal proportions. I used materials and methods new to me and in ways which i think had not ever been used before. The process involved errors but succeeded. Knowing this , this project will involve much less risk. However , i am using a new computer program from the fantastic guys at \" make it \" to scale up the sculpture. Its very new, designed to make very small 3d printer models and i don't think has been used for anything of this scale so that is an unknown. However I have been using it now for the smaller scale versions and it has worked seamlessly . There will be new challenges i expect but i believe that 90% of the technical problems are already solved. \r\n\r\nThe biggest risk is undoubtedly time. Time is very short. Funding is essential if the large work is to be completed on time .The more cash the project has the faster it will go. The aim is to employ a team rather than do it on my own :) {Golly,  wouldn't that be nice !} One alternative option is to make 3 identical sculptures each being about half the size of the original proposed very large work . This triplet version is quite appealing  .",

  "-Technology\r\n\r\nTechnology is a tricky thing. It can be so empowering but also hindering. Over the journey of creating STORY with our developer, we have learned some of the restraints that technology has. Well, at least with our current funds. Specifically, one of these challenges is building a back end application server that can handle high upload content. This means, that a user can not upload 245 pictures at a time because of server restraints. In order to combat this issue, we had to cap maximum single upload to 15 pictures and 1 video at a time. We do, however, allow people to update Memories right away and as many times as they want. In the future, with continued funding, we hope to build a more efficient server that can upload more pictures even quicker.\r\n\r\n-Age\r\n\r\nSince the team is 20 years old and under, we have sometimes had people not believe what we are doing and discount us because of our age. This originally prevented us from partnering with our first app developer. But you know what they say, \"the early bird gets the worm\" aka we are going to get the worm. \r\n\r\n-School & Work\r\n\r\nWhenever each person joined the team, we have had to work around school schedules and work schedules in order for us to get work done. With four people, this was difficult. To say we have learned how to embrace Google Calendars and manage time would be an understatement.\r\n\r\n-Knowledge\r\n\r\nWe get it, we're young. This has sometimes hurt us because, even though we don't like to admit it, we don't know everything. In order for us to successfully move through this project with excellence, we have had to embrace the saying, \"It's not about what you know but who you know.\"\r\n\r\n-The Future\r\n\r\nOne of the questions we get asked often is, \"what if STORY doesn't work?\" and to that we say, \"we walk by faith and not by sight.\" One thing we have learned on this journey is that if you worry about the future, you'll miss the present. But if you are present and working, the future will take care of itself. So sure, it's a risk to launch a social media app but we firmly believe that we have a useful idea and a quality product.

In a couple weeks time I will receive a box from the factory containing the very first samples of the shoes - exciting! After a bit of work making sure they are looking  perfect,  I need to pay the factory for the second instalment of the fee. The money you pledge will cover the costs of the actual production run.\r\n\r\nI have spent every penny I have. I took a gamble in paying for the first fee counting on you guys to help me raise this second part. Your support will ensure my initial investment risk was time & money well spent.",

  "If the project is successfully funded (fingers crossed!), given that all shoes are painted by hand and made-to-order, know that they won't all rush out at once. Our pace at this time is anywhere between 10-20 pairs of shoes in a week. Once all of the customer input is received and Christmas rush orders are completed, we will organize a calendar of all Kickstarter pre-orders rationing one week for every ten pairs (just to err on the side of caution). We will then send you a courtesy email informing you what week your order will be painted, so you'll know exactly when to expect it, if not sooner.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience! We will begin fulfilling orders immediately after the Kickstarter end date and will do our very best to get them out as quickly as we can.",
  "In addition to user-testing, we've also done quality control on over 100 samples produced in hopes of eliminating any quality or sizing issues during post-funding production.   Our cardboard supply is located in South Los Angeles and the actual insole die cutting is done in East Los Angeles. The two small businesses regularly work together so we don't anticipate any challenges there. \r\n\r\nDue to the the timing of production we're aware there may be potential delays in shipping. We've allotted a whole 2-week period for shipping in anticipation of the holiday season, but we're well aware shipping delays are largely out of our control.  \r\n\r\nBeing new to Kickstarter campaigning, we're also concerned about hold-ups from backers in submitting their surveys containing size details. Submitting surveys in a timely manner will help us stay on track with our holiday production &  shipping schedule.\r\n\r\nIf any unforeseen delays do arise, we'll keep all of our backers in the loop with updates.",

Things like obtaining seed capital, budgeting operating expenses, reconciling overhead from this past summer, efficiency of domestic logistics, and keeping everything stable and recorded with regards to finances. \r\n\r\nBut The Atinga Project faces unique obstacles also. Some of our bigger plans include developing the supply chain and Atinga team.  As mentioned previously, a baseline study is necessary for accountability and annual reporting. This is currently being tested and developed under pro-bono consultations.  \r\n\r\nWithout going into detail, teaming up with the artisan-shoemakers of Kigali to make sure our supply chain is efficient, with standardized varieties and sizes of atingas, is the task before us. This is also our biggest focus. We still have many more strides to make before perfecting a custom fitting system. We want to offer custom fitting to all customers, in person or online. We are thankful for the advice we continue to receive in this area of product development. These are some of the reasons why we have pushed back our delivery dates of rewards, so as to be as conservative as possible.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting Atinga throughout this journey in their shoes! We would not have gotten this far without you; and without you, we can go no further.",

  "We don't foresee any challenges with completing this project. We have already sourced all the materials for the first batch and calculated improved margins with each production run. We already have a following of supportive buyers and local stores purchasing from the Wine Candle Lady. We also have extensive experience in selling CPG products on Amazon. Fulfillment will begin as soon as the project is funded. We already allocated the raw materials necessary to fulfill each order and have a pre-existing fully functional workshop, not to mention a top-notch candle maker ;-)",
  "I believe the most obvious risk is simply a lack of exposure. A great design or/and idea could die simply by not being discovered. On the aspect of challenges, finding a suitable manufacturer which can deliver on quality, quantity and timeliness is the main one.",
  "Everyone of you that have worked on a project or with business projects know that they take a lot of hard work, time and capital. We are a startup with few resources and that's why we have decided to go for crowdfunding campaign through Kickstarter.\n\nWe understand and we know that no project comes without risk and challenges. Despite our planning, there are circumstances that may be out of our control. If we encounter any of these, we promise to communicate with full transparency.\n\nEverything is ready for production and we are expecting to deliver all shoes on time. We have a great relationship with our supplier and we personally supervise quality control.",
  "MANUFACTURING COSTS: \n\nManufacturing costs during these times can be extremely high and the quantity to order may be high as well. We look to the best manufacturers to provide the best quality and that can sometimes be pricey.  That is why we are fundraising to ensure we have the amount we need to manufacture good products. Our goal is to have more than one manufacturer with great quality materials to ensure that our products last. \n\nSHIPPING COSTS: \n\nShipping costs, especially coming to and from different countries can be very high priced. Furthermore, we are also competing with big corporations for container costs and space. These prices get in the way of claiming product seats in shipping units. We are and will be doing our best to find the lowest shipping cost, so we can offer fair prices to our consumers.\n\nDELAYED ORDERS: \n\nDelayed shipping happens, even more so during pandemic times. Sometimes during  the shipping process orders can be somewhat delayed due to transportation issues. We will give a window for when the order should be delivered and if your order has not been received within that period of time we ask that you contact us, so we can see how far the order is or if you want to request a refund. We will personally deal with the issue as transparency is important to us.\n\nSTOCK ISSUES:\n\nCompanies face stock issues all of the time. To help ease issues with lack of stock, we'll have pre-orders available for when stock runs out and send out emails when their orders have come in. We're also looking into having more than one manufacturer for our products so stocking issues rarely occur.  Lastly  will try to have extra stock on hand to cover stock shortages. Our goal is that we want you to receive the product in a decent amount of time. Keeping every customers happy is a priority.\n\nThere will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you\n\nAny amount of funds donated gets us one step closer to our goal.  Please, help us get you into new stylish trendy gym boots and clothing by clicking \u2018Back This Project\u2019 button at the top of the page, or by helping us spread the word by sharing our page.\n\nFrom one shoe fanatic to all others out there, thank you for your support.",

Add in the current climate from the COVID-19 crisis and it becomes almost daunting.\n\nRegarding my new album, this Kickstarter campaign is needed to raise funds for its production. I feel awkward about this given that so many are struggling right now, but without touring revenues, I kind-of need the help. Many of you have already helped so much so please feel no obligation, but if you are able to contribute specifically to this album project, know that it's deeply appreciated.",
  "Launching an all-or-nothing Kickstarter campaign is always a risk, but we believe that Kickstarter\u2019s community of backers, the Ucross community, and all those interested in food, art, and place, as well as the High Plains and Intermountain West, will lift this project up and help us meet that $40,000 goal. Kickstarter activity and our ability to meet this goal will signal the interest in a Ucross cookbook, and whether there\u2019s enough demand to justify a print run of 1,000 or 1,500. \n\nThe immediate challenge is our ability to spread the word to interested parties inside and outside of the Ucross community. While we can reach many potential backers through social media, email newsletters, and word of mouth, we will rely on the Ucross community\u2014alumni, friends, donors, partners\u2014to share the link and point others to the project page. Can we build enough momentum to reach the goal and make this project viable? \n\nIn the end, if Ucross doesn\u2019t meet its $40,000 goal, we will re-evaluate the size of our print run, as well as our ability to absorb the costs without negatively impacting our general residency needs. That said, we have full faith that our community will rise to the occasion and help us launch The Ucross Cookbook by year\u2019s end.",

I'm confident in the technical abilities of myself and my audio engineer, and we should have the music ready to go well ahead of a projected Fall 2020 release. I also feel that the project has been budgeted well, and that I've given myself lots of time to deliver on all of the rewards that I have listed above.",
  "Since the app has already completed its development and approved by Apple, the risks associated are low.

Any bugs that our users find will be quickly addressed.",
  "My biggest risk right now is the production goal. I have to sell 7 pair of each design to get them into production. I have many designs, and have over 7 pre orders but not in one design. By the end of January I lose all of my progress. That's why i am looking for funding to complete 7 pair of 7 different designs. At 10 sales alive shoes gives pr boosting, getting your designs in the right places on the web, as well as in fashion magazines such as vogue. They regularly feature designs on the covers of many fashion magazines, this is the first step to success. At 50 sales alive shoes offers full brand boosting, not just on shoes butnclothing and accessories as well. This is the fastest, most risk free way of branding. 50 shoes at $200 on average is now no came up with production cost. That's what it will cost to get my brand started off in a quickly successful manor and guarantee fruition. At this mark my brand has no choice but to soar. Also each pair I sell puts $30 into my bank account, at 50 pair that gives me $1500 to put toward paying back investors. This will be deposited into the business account till production goals are met and it is time for investors to be paid back. I will take the 50 pair I now own and have them sold in person while the website generates and produces and ships everything automatically so I can focus on social media presence. I already have a Facebook page, and Instagram, with 40+ followers and it was started 3 days ago. I am doing a lot, I just need a little overhead to keep me from losing all my work.

Our team includes Kristina Horner, who has hosted and fulfilled multiple successful Kickstarter campaigns, so we are confident in our ability.\n\nWe do not anticipate any delays, but this is our first time publishing a book. The Kickstarter exclusive hardback version of Boys, Book Clubs, and Other Bad Ideas will be printed via a different platform than the paperback since it will not be for sale anywhere else; this requires additional coordination when fulfilling rewards. In the event of unexpected circumstances or delays, we\u2019ll keep you in the loop with our Backer Updates.",

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2022. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not deliver, but it does happen on occasion.",

  "Facets Kids is currently available in its Alpha version for iPads only. With a successful Kickstarter we will be able to enhance the app to Alpha 2, Beta, and eventually a completed app available on a variety of devices. With any development project, the risk and challenge would be a speedy process of improvement and updating, but since the app is already accessible, we do not see Facets Kids ever becoming unavailable to those who seek it.",
  "The risks and challenges to overcome with this app enhancement will include getting the developer to make the update as envisioned.  Sometimes during initial discussion certain functionality appears feasible, but may not be feasible once coding begins.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is to get the developer to adhere to the project time line as they can work on multiple projects at one time.",

We have also made many apps, so know how this magical code and art stuff works and how long it takes.\r\n\r\nThere is also a risk that Apple rejects the app.  However, this is extremely unlikely and we can probably tweak a few things at their request to get it into the store.  We have contacts at Apple, and the first thing we will do after successful campaign to get them to take a look at the concept to give us any tips before we start \u2013 but historically we\u2019ve always been fine and they usually just say \u201cWe can't wait to play it!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor backers who pledged at a tier that includes promotion, we will endeavour to do this at a time to suit you, however this may not always be possible.\r\n\r\nThere is a risk that download numbers mentioned are not reached.

  "There may be delays from Apple's launch dates for iOS 8, Swift, or the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nLast year I launched a successful Kickstarter project that included over 150 videos and 40 hours of content. After a year of producing content I have streamlined my process for creating new videos and supplemental materials.\r\n\r\nWith that said, it does take time to prepare, practice, record, edit, and upload videos. Along with each video I create sample code, which is easy to follow and I write articles to help highlight the key takeaway points. It is an involved process, but I believe that it's the best way to teach you.\r\n\r\nEven with experience with online teaching, there is the potential for hardware failure, sickness, or software issues that could delay launch date or daily materials.\r\n\r\nI have been teaching online for two years, and I understand how to overcome many of the challenges in online course production. I appreciate your support to design course materials that will enable you to create iPhone apps and games.",
  "I love singing and writing music, but I'm about as far from tech savvy as a man can be. I have never known how to take what the Lord has given me and get it to the world. But He has finally put people in my life that I love and trust, and their intention is the same as mine: to magnify the Lord and exalt His name together (Psalm 34:3). Stephen McWhirter produced \"INVITE ME INTO WONDER - Live at Iron Bell\", and the best word to describe the production value and quality of this record would be \"excellence\". Now we're ready to record a lot more music, and the only thing left is provision to pay for it. Between mixing, mastering, musicians, and the production team, a record like this one costs about $12,000. The more people invest, the more music we will get to make. I mean it sincerely when I say that I'm humbled by your gifts. Thank you for believing in what the Lord is doing in \"a wretch like me\".",
  "Risks:\nCompetition\nAt the moment there are no companies offering our services. This will most likely change, and we will keep ahead of the pack with 3D designers perfecting our models, material quality, and product choice development.\nTechnology:\nOur platform relies on smart phones with specific modern cameras. All phones for the last 2 years have these cameras installed, so from that angle we are future proof.\nWe use development partners who we have signed supply agreements with, and we will constantly monitor, update and upgrade the application as new software and options become available.\nSpeed to market:\nFulfilment capability will increase gradually. Hardware is expensive and producing the models take time (a few hours to a full day). But we will be able to meet demand by staggering Kickstarter rewards and pricing. We will then precisely target and advertise through online channels and websites. If demand spikes we can adjust our delivery timelines by a week or so and scale up production.\nRoute to market will be through online marketing and referral programs.\nProduct management:\nWe will have a technician onsite 24 hours a day monitoring production so we meet targets.\nShipping:\nShipping large, fragile things can be costly.

  "Manufacturers of scare props in the UK is a very niche industry with few competitors outside the novelty arena populated by Bristol Novelty, Smiffys, eBay, Amazon and supermarkets.  Large theme parks now employ their own theming artists to produce props however, Victor Creative is focussed on smaller venues and home haunts who have little resources and would like an 'off the shelf' solution.\r\nLocally, SIGA Creative FX, trading as Fear FX, is a competitor but they have recently made their staff redundant as they originally started as a manufacturer of scenery, sets and props for the likes of Butlins, Warner Leisure Breaks and Haven Holidays.  Dipping their toes into the scare industry, they grew too fast, neglected their 'bread and butter' customers, ignored individual customer requirements, concentrated on a handful of well known theme parks and consequently they 'peaked too soon' and burnt out.\r\nVictor Creative plans to challenge UK manufacturers by being the 'the man in the middle', ie: not focussing on large theme parks nor providing novelties at the other end of the scale.

I know that what seems like a huge thing to me, is so small for my God.  And I know obedience often means taking scary risks!! \r\n\r\nBut I believe God is in this, and so I am all in. I will continue to be disciplined, work hard, pray, strategize, wait on Him, and be relentless, as I am pursuing this call.\r\n\r\nThe main risk with a Kickstarter is that if I don't reach my goal, then no one gets charged and its as if the campaign never happened.  \r\n\r\nSo once again I invite you to be a part of my vision and journey!!

  "As with any product and early stage companies, there are a million things that should go hand in hand to stay on track. But this happens very rarely. There could be problems at the factory or workforce. there may be potential delays due to materials not reaching on time etc. While we make every effort humanely possible to keep on track and make your shoes, please be advised that there could be some delays. But, we will keep you posted and work hard to get  you your shoes.",
  "I'm raising funds to get 10 different proto-types of 10 shoes that will be launched in order to produce professional photos and modeling features. Two of my designs have already gotten offers to be used in photo shoots, 1 of which was offered to be featured on a model to walk in New York Fashion Week! Professional flyers are needed along with professional advertising here in Atlanta for Joyful Ink Image: The Official Shoe of Atlanta. $1000 will be used toward admission and travel to the next Fashion Conference in the great state of California.\n  Alive Shoes is an awesome help in branding and PR Boost but in order to succeed in this market I must take the necessary steps to get my brand out there to the world. These donations will help me advertise and build relationships and a following.\nAnyone who has achieved anything great will tell you the biggest challenge is getting back up after a fall. I'm here to tell you I won't go down without a fight and when they knock me down I will get up stronger than before. I've already started investing in Joyful Ink and if my backers lose, I lose, and I came to keep fighting until I win!\n\n  It's a challenge to enter a market that has been dominated by a group of brand names all my life. It's a challenge to be the new kid on the block designing shoes. It's definitely a challenge to get out there and be known as a designer but it's not impossible.\n\nGiving Back\n   One of my biggest goals and a huge challenge is to incorporate an affordable shoe line for children first. As well as give back to Atlanta, I want to give back alot of different places that have children in poor conditions. This is a challenge because many doors have to be opened in order to complete this goal.",
  "Launching a Kickstarter is a risk in and of itself- I mean, it's all or nothing! It's a scary thing, placing your fate in someone else's hands but that's when you just have to have the mind set of, this is either going to happen (if it does, WHOO HOO!) or it isn't. If it doesn't come to fruition through plan A, well, then there is always plan B... or plan C! \r\n\r\nAll the doors have opened to lead us to this place- asking for your help to get this single made at the hands of a team of professionals.

That's why I need your help- to get my music out there! \r\n\r\nI understand this is a risk for you as well, as you place your trust in me and my team to follow through with what we are proposing. Not only that, some of you may be backing someone up whom you have never heard sing and might be thinking... can this girl even carry a tune, what does her music sound like? Will this be any good to listen to? I guess that's where you have to decide whether or not to trust what it is I am trying to communicate here on Kickstarter. I am capable of this and believe in myself, and my team believes in me and I in them! I am hopeful that you are going to like what we produce! \r\n\r\nWith your donations you will be helping me kickstart the beginning of something really special. Will you join this adventure with me?",

We designed our app to be simple to use to take the burden off of development and place it more on marketing and customer service. Further upgrades will focus on user feedback and offer more client-facing options. In addition to these upgrades, we will seek funding to market the app and scale the brand of Handitova into additional cities.",

Delays can happen, and we've tried to budget and schedule carefully for that eventuality. We'll be sure to let you know of anything that could hold us up.",

  "With self-publishing, to deliver a quality hardcover picture book means to have it printed by a traditional offset printer. That requires a substantial amount of money to get enough books printed and shipped to make it worthwhile. This Kickstarter will help me get the word out about these books and help fund the initial print run. If the Kickstarter goal is not reached then no Kickstarter funds will be released. You won\u2019t be charged, and no funds will be received. You can help me reach my goal by spreading the word!",

I have a great team, an experienced manager, and amazing friends and family that are involved and invested in what I do and will help see that everything goes as planned.\r\n\r\nThe only problem that I can think of would be a \"time-line\" obstacle due to unforeseen circumstances.

If for some reason it gets delayed, I commit to keep my backer family informed so you know exactly what is happening each step of the way. Thanks again for your help",

  "We invented SHOEMOJIS\u2122 back in 2015 and\u00ad\u00ad have been working on the project since early 2016. Finally the patent is in pending status along with a V2 version coming in 2020! We have had some major challenges regarding suppliers and quality, these have now been overcome with vigorous testing and various supplier testing. For example the tension within the shoelace was a big problem to start with, it was either to tight or slack and the quality was lacking. After trying several suppliers we have now teamed up with a great supplier that consistently supplies us with high quality shoelaces. All SHOEMOJIS\u2122 are assembled in-house which includes bonding, designing, printing, sealing and packaging. We would use the funds to buy more industrialised equipment, such as a vacuum chamber and UV  printer to step up production to the next level.",

This project is held dear to these young creators' heart, as this will be their first big production with the help of many talented producers, directors, and a versatile team.",

I have limited the number of rewards available so that I can follow through on the expected delivery for each piece.\r\nA backer may delay the creation of their piece simply by taking more time to select a photo. That is okay and the choice of the backer. \r\nThe Evergraphs will be made in the order that photos are received for final submission.",

We value your help and greatly appreciate your support.\nAdditionally, as independent filmmakers, we get to keep creative control, and will be able to put 100% of the funds into making this film in the way we have envisioned. Which means that we'll be able to maintain a great deal of artistic integrity.\nOur biggest obstacle is crowdfunding on Kickstarter because if we don't reach our financial goal, all funds will be redirected back to their original owners. We MUST reach our goal before the end of our campaign but we have faith that our goal will be met! \nIf this project is one that resonates with you, we hope that you would join us in bringing this very important story to life.

Please keep checking back here as well as my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/samtratt913/ for updates and sound snippets. Thanks - Sam.",
  "I can assure you, this project is happening. But as with anything in life, challenges remain. Two primary challenges are:\r\n\r\n1. Getting the word out to get fully funded. Kickstarter is an all or nothing deal. If I do not reach my goal, then I will not get any of the funds that are raised. THIS IS WHERE I NEED YOU: You can help eliminate this risk by letting your friends, family, and social media network know about this project. It\u2019s a win-win. You get to be a part of this exciting project and they get the opportunity to have some new uplifting music. So PLEASE SHARE!\r\n\r\n2. As I mentioned before, this project IS happening, but unforeseen events and collaborative delays may cause all deadlines to not be met. A lot of planning, and coordination of many different people are a part of the studio album production process. THE RESOLUTION: The majority of the writing is complete, but in the event of unexpected setbacks during recording and production, I appreciate your patience and flexibility. That being said, if all goes as planned, I am confident that my production team and I have allowed for adequate time to complete the project by the listed delivery dates.",
  "The biggest risk at this point is trying to raise all the money we need to complete the project with its full potential. \r\nWe have already raised some money to handle the costs of rewards and shipping as well as begun to make connections with people that could do the highest quality of work at attainable costs. There is a lot of favor on the project already, but we still need all the help we can get so that the project can be fully funded!",

  "I'm not gonna lie.  The riskiest part is asking for your money!  \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge is getting this record, and the worship leader resources, out at least 4 weeks before the season of Epiphany as churches tend to plan ahead & the Advent/Christmas season is one of the busiest.\r\n\r\nWithout your help this record will be a fleeting Instagram post & a perpetual demo.

  "The design work for the calendar is complete, and I've been working with a local printer to produce them, and the prints are being done by a company that worked with Apple when it had its own printing business. While I do not foresee any production issues, when the ink hits the page, there can always be things to tweak and am confident they can be done in a timely manner.",
  "I think the biggest challenge that comes with this project is time.  In order to complete an album, I will need to spend months (not days or weeks) in a studio.  This means that I can not work or provide income while I produce the project.  I have made arrangements for this obstacle and although it will be difficult, my heart is 100% committed to the success of this album.  As long as I keep my focus on sharing the love of God, we can not fail.",
  "As with my last two projects, I don't anticipate a lot of risks or challenges, because I've already done most of the hard stuff. All the songs are written, and I'm about halfway done with the recording. I have all the relationships, connections and general \"know-how\" to finish the \"musical\" part of the project, just not all the funds.\r\n\r\nAt this point, since I've done most of the creative grunt work, I just need to complete the recording, then have it mixed, mastered, graphic-designed, packaged and marketed. I already have lots of those contacts (mixing and mastering engineers, designers, etc) and they already know what they're supposed to do. I just have to pay them to do it. I've done over a dozen records in my career, so I know how to do this. It's just tougher than it used to be to make any money selling music. Hence the campaign.\r\n\r\nObviously there are unforeseen things that always arise, but I'm fortunate to have a lot of friends and connections in my business who I can hire to get it done as long as the funding is available.",

  "The major challenge/risk at present will be gaining momentum within markets outside of the southeast region and keeping up enough inventory on hand. I believe the former will be an issue that will arise possibly within the next few years but is something that can be done. By building a strong support base here and the surrounding areas, I will be able to show stability and history to alleviate the hesitancy that may arise. The latter will be slightly harder to gauge due to not knowing exactly how much and how fast things will grow. I can say with assurance though, that I have a great support system in place to continue to motivate and assist me throughout the entire process. \r\nI do recognize that unforeseen circumstances might arise, such as, not receiving shipments in a timely manner, or being able to keep turn around times to minimum. Although these are just a few possible issues I might face, my 13+ years of selling and management experience will guide me through any hardships that may come my way.",
  "For all of our backers, we are certain that there will be no risk in supporting this project! In fact, you will not be charged until the entire campaign has been fully funded AND has come to an end. Although we do not anticipate any delays and as the world recovers from COVID-19, there could possibly be potential shipping or unforseen issues with the printing process. Nonetheless, I've made it my duty to minimize risks by using a trusted team to print and ship the books. Any issues that arise not mentioned above will be at the forefront of communication to all of our backers.",
  "It's always a risk to undertake any project.  We'll be fully transparent along the way.  We also have a full album project already under our belt.  We successfully raised money and produced a full album in 2009.  We're better equipped this time around, have great musicians ready to roll, and most importantly, we know what NOT to do!  We'll always keep you updated on the process, and ship out all prizes as soon as humanly possible! You're the ones making this dream come true alongside us, so we want to invite you to join in the journey through the highs and the lows. Ultimately, God willing, we'll come out the other side with a great Christmas project that people will enjoy for years to come.",

  "The world of audio drama has become more accessible and globally renowned than ever before, and this is amazing news for projects like J\u00f6tunn, as it makes them all the more appealing. It also means that the standard to which good audio drama needs to be produced is very high. We don\u2019t want to merely have a few voices tell a story with a little bit of music in the background. We want to create an entire cinematic world you can dive into every time you press play. That requires professional talent, high-end tech and innovative effects, and that therefore raises the budget for each episode to \u00a34k. \n\nReaching our target will allow the creation of an amazing world steeped in Norse mythology, a genre that has found a place of high regard lately, but uniquely, you\u2019ll be right in the centre of the drama.

  "There is little risk associated with this project, since we already have the tools in place to produce the candles. A manufacturer is lined up for the glass and a design firm for the packaging, so everything will go smoothly once the project is funded.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we will be transparent about where we are in the process and any hurdles along the way. Thank you.",
  "We are working very hard and doing everything necessary and possible for the Uufey supreme comfort line. We have prepared so far and worked as much as we can without going into production. The important elements to succeed are vision (passion), expertise and capital. We have established our working relationship with our suppliers from China for the right materials for production. We have also confirmed our manufacturers from India who are now currently making the mould and are happy to start production as soon as orders are confirmed. We are also establishing a working relationship with 2 major manufacturers in the UK, making the supreme comfort line readily available, versatile and meeting every necessary standard.\r\n\r\nThe funds raised through Kickstarter will enable us to take the next step in the process and go into production: manufacturing and completing the product we have put in time, effort and knowledge to bring to this stage. \r\nWe are driven by excellence and 100% comfort and satisfaction and want to keep our promise of making Uufey supreme comfort your first thought out go to brand for ultimate comfort.\r\n\r\nAs we understand that big projects have challenges, we have put this into consideration in every aspect possible and are prepared and qualified to take on all challenges associated with this project",

  "Budgets, timelines, resources, and app development are all hard. We've planned in advance for everything we could think of but let's be honest, surprises happen. We are committed to mitigating risks as much as possible, and in addition, we are committed to being 100% transparent with the current state of the project. Communication is key and we believe that you should be a part of the project at each stage, even the small ones. We\u2019ll let you know if we run into any issues and what our plan is to solve them.",
  "The app development and game development industry is famous for its delays and unexpected occurrences. \n\nDespite our ambition, will, and confidence in delivering the final product in time, there is always room for uncertain events, and delays as different parties are involved in the process.\n\nThe nature of the app has a positive side. Once ready and published - everybody receives it in a matter of minutes! \n\nOf course, the more interest and funding MyChild\u2019sLife will receive, the lesser the risks of delays. \n\nWe will demo develop and test the app as much as we can. But it is still possible to find minor flaws and errors during the early access stage of the app. When we find such an error, or if someone reports it to us, we will go out of our way to make sure everything is running smoothly and updated correctly as fast as we can.\n\nNext to that, all the gifts will be made by myself and a team of people with bigger and minor disabilities. This means the work can be a little slower, but it will be made with a lot of love. If we have to make a thousand packages, we might experience some difficulties delivering on time. But, we will try our best to deliver everything on time.\n\nWe are passionate about MyChild\u2019sLife and all the memories it will gift to people around the world.

  "I've experienced tremendous growth since the launch of my shoe line in August 2017! Keeping up with demand has become my biggest challenge, which in turn becomes a risk. I risk losing customers. I risk not meeting demand. So far I've put out 5 pairs of boots and business has taken off. Please keep in mind, I do EVERYTHING myself right now so it is very time consuming. I am putting out a 10 pair collection of all new boots on November 1, 2017 which I know will skyrocket! I NEED manufacturing. I NEED help. Manufacturing will help meet the demand and bring my costs to make down.",
  "This Kickstarter campaign has very little risk involved, the first four stories have been written in their entirety, three have been edited. Juniper's draft has begun and there is an outline ready for Lamplight. \nThe covers for Sapphire, Velvet and Bronze are also completed (as pictured above) with the artists already selected for Coquelicot, Juniper and Lamplight.\n\nThe printers we are working with are both printers we have worked with before so we know that their quality is excellent and their time frames are good.\n\nThe only likely risk in backing this project is that there may be delays in the production/editing/cover illustrating phases which will be communicated with backers. I have created several Kickstarters before this all of which have been fulfilled even if there were delays along the way.",
  "As with any project there may be deadline issues and delays but we will do everything we can to honor the due date.",
  "Finding skilled production workers in my area will present no problem: I live in a rust-belt area that has many skilled but unemployed production people. I know I can staff my business, from laborers to techies, with no problem!",
  "Our main challenge for this film is our time constraint. Our ambition makes it quite tricky to accomplish everything we want against the clock. In order to combat this challenge, quite a lot of work needs to be done in the pre-production stage so that during our shooting week and post-production stage we can be as efficient as possible. \n\nAnother potential challenge is making sure that the two worlds that revolve around the main protagonist are portrayed in a manner which is understandable to the audience.  With the help of editing and the art department we can make sure that Brian's perception and reality merge seamlessly into one film.",
  "Going into this project with all of the necessary equipment already at our disposal has really minimized our risk level. Even if the camera were to malfunction, we have back ups. This is an ultra low budget project so we are staying within our means to produce a fun film that is on par with the first movie.",
  "Nobody wants to see a good idea and product executed poorly. We have worked extremely hard to get Kicks\u2122 ready for Kickstarter, manufacturing and fulfillment. Everything in my head and on paper is planned out to the T however here are some unforeseen occurrences that might pop up-\r\n\r\nKICKSTARTER/ BACKERS: I hear Kickstarter could take up to 3 weeks before releasing funds to our account. Also when the campaign is successful and we collect the shoe sizes and colors from our backers via Kickstarter and email some might not reply back! Some forget they have to let us know what they want. And in order to get an accurate order into our manufacturer we need as many people to respond ASAP. However we do have a deadline and we will move on regardless.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING: We have never put in a large order with this manufacture before but we did do our homework on them and they can produce great shoes! They told us 60-90 days for manufacturing depending on how successful the campaign is and how much material/ shoes we make. We have great communication with them so if anything happens you will be the first to know.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS: Like any major shoe brand our manufacturing is overseas and with an order this huge it will be arriving by cargo/freight ship and going through US customs. We have all the paperwork and experts on this matter ready to go but things could get stalled if the U.S. Customs and Border Protection see any issues.\r\n\r\nFULFILLMENT/ SHIPPING: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. However we have great equipment, packaging, state of the art shipping label printers and software integrated with Fed-Ex or UPS. Domestic order in the USA should be fine. Internationals orders will take longer going back through customs to your country.\r\n\r\n Thank you for your help in funding our footwear startup! Please share this with anyone you know who loves shoes.\r\n\r\nEst. Now",
  "The risks are that the deadlines could not be respected since developing the platform may take longer than planned, depending on how the testing period will go. However, accurate estimations have been conducted. \n\nAlso will be a challenge to adapt slightly the interface for different cultures, as we know, gaming is global and is able to unite every type of people but is also true that building a comfortable interface for everyone would be better for everyone.",
  "To minimize project delay risks, the Alliance SOS team has heavily invested in the application\u2019s development.\n\nBy creating a distinct proof of concept, we were able to test the market and ask the end-users what they would like to see for improved user-friendliness and performance in Alliance SOS to avoid potential functionality complications.\n\nWe have staged out each step of redevelopment to minimize delays and bring Alliance SOS to the market within the timeframes advised.\n\nOur team looks forward to bringing this project to life with your support and continually updating the application with future instalments!",
  "Risk/Challenges\n\nApp Review on Apple:\n-Apple stores require dating apps to have limitations on how many swipes an account is able to use in a day. This prevents a spam quality to the app that will cause Apple to deny the app on their stores. Since its initial release in April 2021, the GeekELove team is working to create limitations in the swipe process. Our hope is to have this change implemented and the app available in September on Apple stores (app is currently available on android/google play stores). This date may be subject to change based on Apple's response to our changes.\n\nTiers with T-shirts\n-T-shirt printing through our current supplier takes about two weeks to be fully printed and ready to ship. Please be mindful when picking your tier that t-shirts will be mailed out after the kickstarter has been closed. \n\nSpeed Date Tier Benefit\n-Currently we are building out relationships for locations for speed date outings. We will be starting with our state of MD first and its immediate surrounding area. Over time we are hoping to push out to more state locations in the East coast, and so on. This process requires building business relationships and it must be stated realistically as a small business this tier will have more options based on state locations.  We are open to taking recommendations as well from users in different states that know of great geeke locations that could benefit from this particular tier.",
  "This film is on a greater scale than anything I have taken on before, and sometimes ambition and expectations exceed reality. For this project to be successful, it will require a significant amount of planning, discipline, and time management. I am putting my full effort and energy into making sure everything required is in place, but there are always uncontrollable conditions that can affect production, such as weather, illness, accidents, etc. These could interfere with the timeline and final result.\n\nAs this is my honors thesis and fulfilling a requirement for me to complete my undergraduate degree, there will definitely be something finished and submitted by June of 2019. Whether that is the product as I envisioned it or a different film that emerges from what ends up being shot and edited remains to be seen.\n\nThese roadblocks should not affect the promised Kickstarter rewards, which I will do my best to order and deliver on time.",
  "The obstacle that I face at this present time is the financial means to fund my business.  I would like to be able to purchase materials in bulk and be able to raise the money to open up my shop.  At this time, that is the only things that is holding me back.",
  "Whatever challenges come my way, I'll find creative ways and look up ways to fix them.",
  "We\u2019ve got a whole team of passionate experts working to deliver this project and have done everything possible to minimise the risks involved. We\u2019re already working with a host of artisans in Pakistan who have been crafting Peshawari Chappals for decades and have implemented quality control throughout the process (however, as each item is handmade our backers should expect slight variations). We want to work directly with the artisans and factories, but travel to Pakistan is expensive. Exceeding our Kickstarter goal will allow us to visit the factories and ensure product development is running to schedule. We\u2019ve calculated all of our shipping costs and fees in advance, so that there shouldn\u2019t be any unexpected surprises. However sometimes goods can get stuck in customs, which causes delays and increases import duty rates.",
  "If we do go above and beyond our goal with funding, it will unlock other collections. However, inventory may dry up in our most popular models (Highly Unlikely) The more we sell, the longer we may take to fulfill, but it is most likely to be delivered before September 2017. Our shoes may not fit if you have extremely abnormal feet, but the leather will tailor itself to your feet if you round down on size. You will have a sizing guide available on our site for you to use. Make note that Tennessee residents may be subject to a sales tax of 9.25% on top of the store credit.",
  "Some of the biggest challenges that come with completing my project is reaching the customer. I have addressed this problem by utilizing social media to initiate the initial phase of marketing by sponsoring ads on multiple sites such as Facebook and Instigram.\r\n\r\nI am not working on any other projects at this time. This project is the sole focus for launching and introducing my brand to the market. I have complete oversight of the company and require no other approvals or reviews before I distribute rewards\r\n\r\nI look forward to developing the company and releasing other original designs and brands and would like to thank everyone who believed in me and made contributions in advance.",
  "LUMA is growing quickly and we're certainly excited about that. Of course, jumping into newer and bigger things too quickly comes with its own set of challenges. We plan carefully and we're lucky that our audience is patient with us when we're trying interesting new things they haven't seen before.",
  "The big advantage of this project is that we are already up and running and we have an existing design tool. We work with skilled craftsmen and craftswomen who know their business. By backing our project, you can order high end shoes at a lowered price. You can even test the tool before backing, so you know what you are dealing with. \r\n\r\nSo, no risks attached. The only possible thing that can happen is a small delay in delivery, due to the made-to-order production process. \r\n\r\nOur biggest challenge is to fulfill your dream to wear your personal and unique shoe.",
  "The biggest challenge will be the launch of the app but i want to get to that budget as soon as possible so we can start making this!",
  "My first priority will be to get a high-quality book to you as soon as possible. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that there could be delays in production and shipping. At this time however, we do not perceive any true risks to the project itself. I will update you on this page regularly about the progress.",
  "Atthis Arts has fully delivered on 16 successful Kickstarter projects since 2013, and the text for the book is already written and reviewed in both languages and for sensitivity. The main risks for this project relate to the illustrated format. Without knowing the final funding in advance, we don\u2019t know how many illustrations will be included or what we can afford on printing, paper, etc. Please see the project Uncertainties section for more details. And of course, we never know what could happen with individuals involved in the project or (as we\u2019ve learned very well these last years) world events. In particular, printing and shipping has been inconsistent during the pandemic and could subject us to delays. We thank you for your trust and will do our best to honor it.",

  "EN : \r\n\r\nThis exhibition unites a new generation of contemporary artists and explores their different codes and languages.\r\n\r\nYour support will contribute to the following three priorities and challenges:\r\n\r\nTo help the artists we would like to:\r\nA. Produce new artworks during the residency at Les Moulins in August 2018.\r\nB. Create new work in their studios and transport to site.\r\n\r\nTo share with you and the widest possible public:\r\nA. Diffuse and communicate La Totale through a variety of media channels.\r\nB. Create surprise events for you when you arrive.\r\n\r\nFor your comfort:\r\nA. Facilitate a smooth and easy access to Les moulins by public transport.\r\nB. Hire a navette that will bring you directly to and from Paris.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s success depends on you!\r\n\r\nThank you from the team La Totale.\r\n\r\n\r\nFR:\r\n\r\nCette exposition mobilise une nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration pour jouer sur diff\u00e9rents codes du monde de l\u2019art contemporain.\r\n\r\nNous avons distingu\u00e9 trois priorit\u00e9s, trois d\u00e9fis pour organiser au mieux cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement :\r\n\r\n1. Pour les artistes : votre soutien permettra aux artistes de produire sur le site des Moulins pendant une r\u00e9sidence de deux semaines en ao\u00fbt. Notre volont\u00e9 est de les soutenir dans leur recherche artistique et dans la production de leurs pi\u00e8ces. Pour les artistes non r\u00e9sidents, votre aide permettra de d\u00e9velopper \u00e9galement la production de nouvelles oeuvres et nous permettra de les transporter sur le site de l\u2019exposition.\r\n\r\n2. Pour partager : votre collaboration nous aidera \u00e0 diffuser notre projet, en utilisant tous les moyens actuels de communication avec quelques surprises festives en chemin.\r\n\r\n3. Pour votre confort : votre contribution permettra de faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s lors de notre exposition.

  "There are no real risks. The book is finished! I just need the funds to make the magic happen. \"American Bug\" is my third book and this is my third Kickstarter. I've delivered before and I know what I'm doing.",
  "Any number of logistical things can go wrong with community partnership work, but in those situations I have always been able to use creative problem solving and to be flexible enough to carry through with the work. I will have a translator present in the workshops, but even without one... Art and Color are their own languages and the words really aren't that important!",
  "Being my first exhibition I'm sure there will be plenty of learning curves along the way, but I am confident with the support of friends and other creatives to help anything that does pop up will not be an issue. Now lets get pledging so I can get down to the printers.",
  "Risks and challenges may include shipping and the speed of the US Postal Service that may make the delivery take longer than expected. To mitigate that risk, I will be in contact with you throughout the shipping process.",
  "Kickstarter has an all or nothing model. So if the goal is not reached before the campaign ends in one month, you won't be charged for your contributions. The goal is set based on production of the book including illustrating (unless you want my stick figures), printing, marketing, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.\n\nIf you're not in a position to back this project monetarily, you can still help. Please consider sharing this project with your friends, family, and colleagues. Post on social media, send a carrier pigeon, and/or phone a friend. Thank you for your support!",
  "Illustrations are already complete and I am in the process of finalizing the book for the printers.  My number one priority is to produce a high-quality book and get it in your hands in a timely manner.  It is possible that COVID-19 could cause delays in production and shipping, but I will get you your books and rewards as soon as possible. If any delays occur, I promise to always keep you updated.  My mission is to get this books into the hands of those who need it as quickly as possible and I'll keep going until that happens! Thank you for supporting me on this mission!",
  "I'm hoping to see the design finalized by June. If I can get additional funds, I'd be able to invest in the marketing and translations. Regardless of the outcome, the book will be published by my birthday in August.",
  "The first year of a festival is difficult. It's hard to get the funding needed to pull off an amazing festival, unless you already have sponsors. I used all of my savings to try and put this together.",
  "On est nombreux \u00e0 croire en ce projet, \u00e0 s'\u00eatre engag\u00e9 pour lui donner vie.\r\n\r\nLe film est produit par Les idiots (Olivier Capelli) avec le soutien de French Lab Agency (Aur\u00e9lien Winterman), Studio MER-NOIR et No\u00e9mie Schmidt.",
  "The risks/challenges that come with this project are that there are still songs waiting to be written!  The good news is, we are halfway there!  4 out of 8 of the songs for this album have already been written and recorded/produced.  So that leaves us with 4 to go!  I have two talented and dedicated producers who have already committed to tackle these 4 songs with me, and are equally excited about what God is doing through this music.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe challenge is that music, like any other creative medium, is an art form, and doesn't always work according to our schedules.  My goal is to have this album completely finished in 2015 so that I can begin performing the songs at live venues as soon as possible.  If, however, we encounter any setbacks and the timeline needs to be adjusted, you as the backer will be the first to know.  This project is very near and dear to my heart, and I will continue to work diligently with God's help to see it to completion!  (Philippians 1:6)",
  "There are, of course, obstacles when it comes to starting a business. These obstacles can be even bigger hurdles when facing major footwear giants. \r\n\r\nOur plan on tackling this is simple: Raise awareness and Reach out!\r\n\r\nChicago is a sprawling city, and for anyone who has visited in the summer, you can agree that there are countless individuals outdoors engaged in physical activity. By raising awareness, attending events with kiosks, sponsoring events, runs, athletes, etc., we can avoid failing these obstacles!\r\n\r\nWe have a very motivated team ready to get this product in the hands (er, feet!) of everyone!",
  "There are 3 main risks and challenges associated with the project.\n\n1. Lack of people using the application.  This application can only be successful if the masses of people use it.  It has an market base of nearly all 8 billion people in the world, a unicorn of its own.  However, if it does not gain popularity, it will be nothing.\n\n2. Incitement of violence.  As images can spur the heart in any way, violence is a risk.  The fact that the users remain anonymous until they agree to exchange contact information is a safeguard (users cannot retaliate against the anonymous).  As the application grows, it is hoped that the department of defense and armed services in each country will be involved so that potential threats of violence can be curbed rapidly.\n\n3. Legal issues.  This application surely is not legal in all countries.  Lawyers will have to be hired to determine what paperwork and documents need to be filed such that Ghost Writer Alpha remains compliant with the law.\n\n4. Image stream does not present string of images that are meaningful or actionable.  This is a slight risk as users can still use the power to name the images...It is the thought that even if words are exchanged, it will lay the foundation for creating bridges across cultures.",
  "If the project raises enough money we are willing to develop the app in two months and prepare iOS and Android versions. App approval by the app store and google play services could take some additional time so the final app release may have delays. Just after the funding event finishes, we will contact all backers via email. If you have any ideas about the app please do not hesitate and contacts us!",
  "Though the film is pretty much complete, we have one last hurdle. We'll also need to dabble in publicity to make sure \"Lost Holiday\" is seen around the world.",
  "In any film endeavor, there will be risks and challenges along the way. Changes in schedules, weather, locations, production logistics, etc. Some can be anticipated and avoided, while others are unpredictable. We have a plan and a great team in place. Director Jerry LaMothe has a ton of experience in indie film making and is growing our team with individuals skilled to overcome any obstacle that is thrown our way. \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge is the stage that we are at right now. Raising enough funds to make the best film possible and to be equipped with the resources to tackle any challenge that we may face on the journey we are on. \r\n\r\nOnce the film is completed, distribution will be our next big challenge, but we think that if our vision is fully realized and people see this original tale unfold on screen, they will want to join us in bringing \"I am Maurice\" to the masses. \r\n\r\nYou will be the first to experience this story because it begins with you. This is all of our story and it begins now. We are very proud of what we have and what we know it will continue to be as it goes through this transformation and comes to life on screen. With your help, anything is possible. Thank you.\r\n\r\n- Wil & Bryan",
  "As with all work near conflict zones there is some risk involved, however because of the specific group we are working with we are taking extra special precautions to protect our students from re-traumatizing activities. We want to help them focus on their goals and visions for the future rather than painful memories from the past.\r\n\r\nThese kids have already been through so much and we intend on helping them in every way we can to build on the best in themselves.\r\n\r\nThe staff who are participating have extensive history of working in conflict zones and many have been trained specifically for this kind of work. We will take every precaution to ensure they are safe and understand the risks involved in such a project.",
  "A project of this scale has many risks and challenges. Bringing together aspects of construction, food service, and flames is not an easy thing on Playa. \r\n\r\nFortunately, we are veteran burners who have brought countless theme camps, performances, art cars, and structures to Burning Man. We are aware of the challenges and pitfalls involved with anything on Playa.\r\n\r\nConstruction Challenges: We will be pre-building our structure in San Francisco two months prior to bringing it to the Playa.  The takeout box has been designed in a modular fashion to quickly bolt together on Playa.\r\n\r\nFlame effects and burn safety: Members of our crew will take the Burning Man flame safety training course. Trained team members will be present during any open flame events. \r\n\r\nFood service and sanitation: We are applying for a State of Nevada health and food service permit prior to the event. Additionally our team will be cooking and serving mass quantities of dumplings at a small festival in July to hone our dumpling skills.",
  "The biggest challenge for this art installation that this it's our very first installation at Burning Man. Since it's located in the Black Rock Desert, there are many challenges that we are going to have to overcome such as the harsh weather conditions or the fact that its location is very remote. However David attended Burning Man and is well involved in different camps that can give a little help if needed. But we're optimistic by saying that we won't need any help and we'll make sure to honour the principle of Radical Self-Reliance.\r\nOther than that, Bertrand has a lot of experience with art installations. He already created and installed a working prototype of Aperture 11 in Paris, France, to see how it works and what are the possible challenges we may encounter. This will help reduce the technical issues in a significant way.",
  "With this leap of faith comes the risk we won't hit the financial budgetary goals at the timeframes when funding is absolutely essential between now and the Burn. Each structure has it's own material purchase deadline and build schedule. Much of our fundraising exists in events. We're taking a step back this year to fully focus on collaboratively learning this new construction and skill alongside Rob and his team. We're looking to online crowdfunding, to you, our community, to step up to move us forward. Bringing large art into a sound camp is not a usual marriage. With it comes a completely different timeline and budget approach. Alongside all of this is our normal operating budget need. Basically, we are doubling our operating budget and that is no small feat for people with day jobs who come home and work another 3-8 hours each night. We do this for the joy of doing it, for those smiles at sunset at a party like no other. We depend on our community to lift the evolution bar alongside us.",
  "The biggest risk I can anticipate is the public response to this project. While I haven't yet done a run of the performance outside of the relative safety of my college, I do plan on doing a run of the performance on either the June or July First Friday Artwalk. Outside of the context of the college I can most likely anticipate the participants being unsure of how to take the project and I expect a lot of questions about why I'm doing what I'm doing. I'm hoping that practicing on the First Fridays will help me to prepare for some of the questions. However, this piece is flexible and still developing and I am a student so I anticipate every experience performing the piece to be a opportunity to learn.",
  "Problems I can run into are that I may not have the full amount of funding in time, the budget could be too low, problems with the music, equipment malfunctions, music video shoot location is not in order, weather, and many unforeseen actions.",
  "There are really only two issues that could arise. \r\n 1) Finding the right company to tackle our design and give us a good quality product\r\n2) Getting the product out before it gets even later in the race! Though the summer is perfect flip-flop weather.",
  "Our first production batch can need some adjustments since we are working with a new machine.\r\n\r\nAdjust till perfect. We have two options for machines.\r\n\r\nWhen goal not reached.

  "1986 1994: Silver-Age del fumetto Marvel in Italia \u00e8 un prodotto amatoriale toalmente indipendente, realizzato da un piccolo ma affiatato team \"casalingo\" formato da quattro apassionati senza una struttura editoriale alle spalle. Il nostro obiettivo \u00e8 quello di mandare alle stampe, senza alcuno scopo di lucro, un libro in cui abbiamo messo il cuore e tutta la professionalit\u00e0 della quale siamo capaci.\nL'obiettivo di 3600 \u20ac sar\u00e0 pertanto impiegato totalmente per finanziare la realizzazione, la stampa e la distribuzione del libro. Nel dettaglio:\n\n- \u20ac 180 per percentuale del 5% alla piattaforma kickstarter;\n- \u20ac 500 per costi di realizzazione tecnico-grafica;\n- \u20ac 1800 per la stampa di 300 copie con copertina laminata in argento;\n- \u20ac 1000 per spese di imballaggio e spedizione\n- \u20ac 120 per spese di promozione\n\nATTENZIONE: la spedizione verr\u00e0 fatta con plico tracciabile attraverso Raccomandata Semplice delle Poste Italiane e dal momento della spedizione impiega circa una settimana per arrivare a destinazione, ma dipende anche dalla regione in cui risiedi. Le spedizioni potrebbero essere soggette alle restrizioni Anti-Covid, e il rischio \u00e8 che possano verificarsi dei ritardi di consegna.\nIMPORTANTE: il libro si trova ancora in fase di impaginazione, ma siamo assolutamente a buon punto. Al termine della campagna procederemo con revisione, stampa e successiva organizzazione delle spedizioni, ragion per cui la data prevista di consegna del libro ai sottoscrittori pu\u00f2 essere ragionevolmente fissata intorno al 30 SETTEMBRE 2021.\n\nCi teniamo comunque a ricordarti quanto segue: qualora ci fossero cambiamenti o sviluppi imprevisti, lo saprai tempestivamente, poich\u00e9 lavoriamo sempre in piena trasparenza mantenendo un dialogo costante coi nostri followers attraverso il gruppo e la pagina Facebook.",
  "This campaign, if successful, will fund the production of one print issue of the ERB and a full year of digital publication, paying writers, translators, local language editors, and illustrators. The risk for backers is low. There may be delays in delivering rewards, especially as the pandemic lingers, and in designing a robust and beautiful multilingual platform. And, of course, great essays are rarely written fast. But backers will receive what we promise.\n\nThe lifetime and eternal subscriptions mentioned in the upper reward tiers are, of course, aspirational. But in the longer term, we want to establish the ERB as an enduring institution: an independent platform and magazine sustained by subscriptions, both individual and institutional. Passing our initial crowdfunding target will further that larger goal, as will support from cultural foundations. In fact, success in this initial effort will help us garner support from those sources, as we demonstrate the power and necessity of an adventurous cultural magazine in Europe.",
  "The risks are minimal. The books have been assembled and fully edited. We are fully confident that the books will arrive on time. The only possible delay could be from shipping the print copies as the covid pandemic is still causing some postal delays.",

This first print will be handled by BookBaby, who are experienced in helping independent authors bring their products to life.\n\nThe only challenges we could face are USPS shipping and delivery delays because of the pandemic. But, rest assured that we will do everything possible to remain on schedule.",

  "Any creative project has inherent risks and setbacks, but the creation of the Butterfly and Pollinator Garden Habitat and butterfly raising and release is a straightforward project, and we are seasoned professionals. The two things that could keep from delivering are acts of nature (floods, drought) and availability of Monarch Butterfly caterpillars. We have both those issues covered.\r\n1.\tActs of Nature-Garden:  In the case we can not plant the garden this season we will move the planting date ahead by one year (2018) or until such time as we can plant successfully.\r\n2.\tActs of Nature-Butterflies: We are being advised by conservation professionals in the process for raising the butterflies. If any act of nature or disease befalls our butterfly population we will raise and release as many as possible in the coming years at the sanctuary.  We will be raising the butterflies in multiple locations on the farm as to not lose the entire population if the worst happens to one group.\r\n3.\tMonarch Butterfly Caterpillars Availability: We will be acquiring Monarch Butterflies from one or more University cultivation programs. In the event enough stock is not available this year we will move the Monarch part of the project ahead by one year (2018) or until we are able to fulfill all sponsored butterflies.\r\n4.\tButterfly Release Party and VIP Tea Party:  In the event of inclement weather we will reschedule the release at the earliest date that allows for a successful release and that would allow as many people to attend as possible.  We will broadcast the event with a LIVE STREAM for supporters regardless of their ability to attend or not.\r\n5.\tRewards: Together with my wife and business partner Jennifer, we have over 56 years of combined experience in creating and implementing hundreds of creative projects for our commercial clients at Brickhouse Studios Inc, many much larger and more complex than the reward deliverables such as greeting cards, jars of honey, flower seed packets, fine art prints and the creation of garden benches. We have outlined the project so that it\u2019s fully manageable with no major unknowns. There are always surprises, but we\u2019ve built flex-time into our schedule so that we don\u2019t promise more than we can deliver.\r\nWe\u2019re professionals so we will stick with it even if the going gets rough. All-in-all, we are very confident that we can get all rewards into the hands of our supporters in a timely manner, and at a quality level that we ourselves would expect.\r\n \r\nThank you for your support! \r\nJohn and Jennifer Churchman",

  "Film is a complicated business, and often unforeseen difficulties arise, causing budget and scheduling overruns. That being said, we are an experienced group and have successfully completed and released numerous short films. We have produced drama heavy projects in the past, and see no reason why we shouldn't continue to accomplish our goals. On the plus side, this film is largely complete. A great deal of the risk in the project has already been mitigated, and we are too far along to turn back and give up.",
  "There is always the risk that the production may fall apart due to a lack of funds, or unavailability of actors, etc. However this has never happened to us before to such a degree that finishing a project was impossible. This proof of concept will happen!",

Should we encounter any set backs such as factory production delays, we will be sure to let all backers know immediately and keep you updated every step of the way.",
  "The major risk that of which I'm fully aware is that the album may not sell very well or get around as much as it should because I simply don't have the time or ability to tour or perform much at this point in my life.  I plan to submit it to Oysongs, Jewish Rock Radio, iTunes, and other venues that people recommend to me, but since I'm a full time rabbinical student and not a full time musician, I'll be frank and say that I'll never be able to do the album justice in terms of marketing and publicity.  If you have any ideas, though, I'm always open to hearing them!",
  "This being our sixth year running PRHBTN we would like to think that we have worked out all of the kinks but there is always a problem or challenge that could arise. In the past we have dealt with last minute venue changes, travel visa delays, missing lifts, last minute paint shortages, lifts sunk in the mud, lack of proper voltage and more minor headaches than we can count. But we always find a way to make it work and we will continue to do so. There is no doubt about that!",

We\u2019ve learned a lot from our professional experience and working with similar projects, but sometimes forecasts don\u2019t always hit the mark. Should we miss projections, we\u2019ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible.\n\nSupply Chain Risk\nWe have a very capable experienced team who have created Phone and Tablet apps before. In addition, to the experienced professionals handling the product rewards. In order to minimize any potential problems we\u2019re working with manufactures that have a quality track record. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.\n\nPhone and Tablet App and Product Adjustments:\nAs we begin production on the TABU Art Phone and Tablet app, coins, and the custom items, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the products, allowing for improvements that will benefit you. We will keep you up to date throughout the development process.",
  "This is a passion project fueled by my need to create it.  The biggest risk I see that can affect the contributors would be a delay in production (e.g. due to conflict in cast and crew schedules).  Any physical perks (T-shirts, posters, storyboard panels) will be made and delivered on time. This includes the digital music download, which has already been created and is ready for delivery!\r\n\r\nDelays can happen for a variety of reasons, including scheduling issues, location conflicts, and other personal reasons. This project, however, IS on a timeline and deadlines are expected to be met. Any consequence of unforeseen delays will be communicated to donators (e.g. delay in receiving physical perks as well as screenings and online live viewing sessions). All issues and conflicts will be resolved quickly in order to ensure the project's completion and donor satisfaction!",
  "We have successfully run this convention three times before and have an experienced team in place. \r\n\r\nWe have learnt many lessons from previous years and have already met the key technological challenges.\r\n\r\nA potential issue is an inadequate venue and we have researched this meticulously, choosing a venue that has a good and solid track record and that has hosted conventions of this type. The venue is already reserved for us and we have access to the space over the entire weekend of the 2nd and 3rd September. An added bonus is that we used this venue for FantastiCon 2016 and as such have a great relationship with the staff already and an intimate knowledge of the technical capabilities of the venue.\r\n\r\nOur major potential challenges are technological. This year\u2019s convention aims to showcase at least one world first and as such faces the challenges that go with the transport and set up of complex equipment. We have an experienced and reliable core team in place as well as specialists in the specific technologies we are looking to showcase. Should the worst happen (via something catastrophic like a major cyber attack or power cut) we are confident that we can still deliver a superb event through backup contingencies and the expertise of our core team.\r\n\r\nDespite our relatively small size we were voted top convention in 2015 because of the comprehensive and entertaining experience we provided. This in large part is down to the range of things we offer and meticulous planning. The diversity of our offering is itself a safeguard against comprehensive failure. \r\n\r\nWith three successful years under our belt we are confident that this convention can deliver on its promises just as the previous ones have.\r\n\r\nOur previous KS project concluded successfully although we lost a key partner in our most complicated and expensive pledge gift at a late stage which caused significant delays in distribution. We do not have any pledge rewards of this complexity for this project and all our pledge gifts are in place and ready to be shipped.\r\n\r\nWe do not require any approvals or pre-market reviews from any outside companies or agencies prior to distributing our rewards.",
  "Learn Larp has run and fulfilled three successful Kickstarters, two for live-action role-playing and one for a printed book. This is a new type of project for us -- a printed game -- but we have the contacts in the board game industry for printing as well as options for domestic or overseas printing, depending on the number of games sold. \r\n\r\nGAME DESIGN AND PRINTING\r\nThe game itself is mostly finished! We've been playtesting it for six months, and incorporated a lot of excellent feedback. We've worked with some very experienced game designers to ensure that it plays well, and that the rules are clear and concise. The reason the time to fulfillment for this project is so short is because we are so far along in its development. \r\n\r\nDepending on the final number of printed games backed in the Kickstarter, we will decide whether to print the game domestically or overseas.\r\n\r\nFULFILLMENT \r\nWe'll also be using BackerKit for this project, which will streamline the shipping and fulfillment process, but is something we have not done before! Inevitably a few shipments will get lost or damaged, but we'll make sure backers get what they ordered!\r\n\r\nTRANSPARENCY \r\nWe're committed to keeping you informed throughout the process from pledge to fulfillment.

While organizational snafus are likely to occur, we hope to be able to recover quickly and provide as streamlined an experience as possible.",
  "The software for this is basically already done. This would be a social medium. Something like this can't just be tossed on the app store when the coding is complete. It has to have users willing to try it to connect with other users. Our aim is to have a set launch date with a starting user base that will be notified when it launches to try to get as many people on in order to facilitate connections to other users. If we can continually attract active users, not just downloads, this will be a sustainable tool to help form groups.",
  "Making any movie is a challenge, but it is one we happily embrace. There are so many moving pieces on the production of a movie - weather, the cast, the crew, equipment rentals, expensive gear and cameras, weather, and did we say weather? - that any one thing could mean a delay, an extra expense, or a change of plans. On a project like this, our shooting schedule is lean and mean, and, like Millie, we will have backup plans for our backup plans. Though there are many risk factors, we are an experienced team who are determined to bring this dream to reality - and are prepared to be deft, flexible, and crafty with our budget in order to do so. \r\n\r\nThough we are currently seeking the best actors possible, we have not cast yet, and we want to find a Millie and an Emma who are perfect for the roles - and to play sisters! Because of this important element, a major challenge is scheduling. If the actors we want aren\u2019t available at the same time, we may have to shift production to accommodate them. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge is post-production. We want to be able to spend the proper amount of time to get this film feeling and looking just right. Editing and finishing takes a long time, but, to our advantage, our team already has a shorthand and a history of working together under pressure and stressful deadlines, and we are confident we can rise above this challenge.",

  "Journey is an incredible game. The base rules were developed ten years ago and reliably create an intense experience for the players. With over 20,000 players all-time, Journey to the End of the Night is now one of the most successful street games in the world. It has been played in San Francisco, New York, London, Los Angeles, Berlin, Chicago, Venice, Washington DC, Vienna, and more. The core game has been tested over many years -- it\u2019s so long-lasting and widespread because it is such a strong game. We are confident in that.\r\n\r\nWe know how to make this game happen. Our team has as a lot of experience: we\u2019ve run over a dozen successful games of Journey to the End of the Night in DC, San Francisco, and other cities across the country. We\u2019ve been helping run games since 2008, and we\u2019ve been organizing the San Francisco game for the last three years. One of the original designers of Journey is on the team this year. We have done this before, so we know what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nWith 50+ volunteers already involved, even if a last-minute disaster were to take out one of our checkpoint leaders or staff chasers, we\u2019d still be prepared with backups. We\u2019re pretty confident in our staffing. Last year, 2000 players filled San Francisco streets for Journey to the End of the Night, and we were well staffed to take them on.\r\n\r\nWeather is always a potential danger, even in San Francisco. If it rains, we will still hold the game -- we\u2019re dedicated -- but it will be a much more challenging, sodden experience in which you might not want to play.\r\n\r\nWe really want to show that this game can be reliably funded and run, and this Kickstarter is our way of doing that. We\u2019re committed to make a fun, free game for everyone that is also free of corporate sponsorship by using grassroots methods. We hope you\u2019ll support us and be a part of making Journey happen this year.",

De kans dat dit gebeurt is klein, maar wel buiten de invloedssfeer van H.E.L. In het onfortuinlijke geval van afschaffing van de airsoft sport kiest H.E.L. altijd het meest vette en realistische platform dat binnen de regelgeving en wetten van Nederland toegestaan is. \r\n\r\nKortom, de beleving is en blijft dan nog steeds het beste dat er is in Nederland en omstreken.\r\n\r\nDaarnaast is H.E.L. afhankelijk van vergunningen van de gemeente.

  "Junior year is the first year in which the students get to spend an entire year on one project. At most, we would get a couple months to complete a project from beginning to end. Most of the projects were done within a few weeks, from writing the script to editing the entire project. Although these projects were not perfect, it was a great learning process. It was the best way for us to gain a lot of experience and to learn through our mistakes. Now, on a more realistic timetable for a much more ambitious project, I have to be able to adjust to such circumstances. I'm not used to such extensive planning and details, but it is something I've been excited doing so far in pre production. Organization is something I love doing, but I've never done it at this grand of a level. I just can't wait to see the payoff of this whole thing!",

  "As always film is a risky business.  One challenge that we may face is that  it will require more time and additional expenditure during the QC process.  WE believe we can mitigate this.\r\n \r\nA risk is that creative differences can arise among the key creative team. In our case, the key creative collaborators have known each other for a long time and worked together in various capacities, a significant mitigating factor. The project has a clear protocol and agreement about decision-making if such differences arise.\r\n \r\nA standard risk is \u201cforce majeure\u201d as unforeseeable technical mishaps, act of god or health issues.

  "The biggest hurdle that any musician has if he wants to be heard is being able to pay for recording time in a professional studio. Fortunately, we now have two studios that are equipped to do most of what we need. We have been recording and writing original music since the 80's. But, in the last few years technology has also allowed us to have a home studio that rivals pro studios! I've learned engineering and recording techniques from all of the engineers in studios that we've been in over the years and I have become a very good producer for music and videos with several projects already under my belt.   \r\n    The second biggest hurdle is exposure. With the record business now in shambles and record labels being as rare as purple unicorns it is up to YOU! You are practically now your biggest fan! By joining the Kickstarter community we can be exposed globally as it is worldwide! We also have access to a local company to print CDs and DVDs.",

  "We\u2019ve spent almost 3 years working on the Inner Mettle Earth Connect shoe, ensuring both the accuracy of our technology and the strength of our supply chain. The earthing technology has been achieved thanks to the hard work of our research and product design partners. The process from initial shoe concept to the final product is now complete. It involved numerous stages of research, prototyping and also user feedback. Since the Earth Connect shoe is a finished product, we don\u2019t have any risks on the development side, it has been completed successfully. \n\nThe greatest risk, or delay, to our project would be any disruption in our supply chain or logistics. We have mitigated risk by working with multiple manufacturing partners. If there was to be an issue we have a list of alternative partners available. Due to the unpredictability of the coronavirus pandemic, there is of course risk of manufacturing delays. If we are unable to fulfill all pledges by March 2022 we will offer refunds. \n\nAnother risk that we could face is a higher than expected number of pledges for the Earth Connect Shoe, making it more difficult for our team to fulfill orders as planned. In such a scenario we will do our very best to increase production so that all orders will go out as scheduled. All of our materials are sourced from reliable and experienced suppliers. We don\u2019t expect any delays but in the case of an unexpected event we promise to keep you updated. The production will only be impacted by 30-60 days in the case that we get higher than expected pledges.",

Finding artists from this community may pose as a challenge again for the fact that auditions are not constantly occurring in the city.

  "The global manufacturing and logistics situation has changed dramatically over the course of the past year, and continues to change monthly. Unexpected delays, shipping holdups, and problems at ports and with freight transport have become the norm. This is our 7th Kickstarter project and although we used to feel like a well-oiled machine, we can no longer expect our production timeline to go the way it used to. Both our eurypterid and Astraspis models are fully designed and ready to go, and the manufacturer is ready to begin production when we give the word. However, during these unprecedented times it is important to acknowledge that there may be risks or challenges we have not foreseen, especially regarding delays in fulfillment. To this end we have set our expected fulfillment date much later than usual. If we get them early, we'll absolutely send them out sooner.\n\nThere is always the chance for unforeseen delays in production, for items to be held up in customs, or for freight shipment delays. We will keep our backers updated throughout the process and the plushies will be shipped as soon as possible once we have them in hand!\n\nAfter funding, our largest project will come in the form of shipping.

Although they're currently entertaining our offers and reviewing the script as we speak (er, as you read) we still need them to say \"yes.\" So we are in conversations with their agents and managers to get this to happen. Signs so far are optimistic.  In the event of any setbacks (we hope they don't occur, but it does happen), rest assured that a Plan B for acquiring comparable, exciting replacements is in place -- other familiar faces that you will know and respect, but whose names we obviously can't promise at this time.

That is why we need your help.\r\n\r\nDustin's track record proves that he can gather and lead a team of professionals. On his previous short film, \"Valediction,\" he hired James Avery (Uncle Phil from \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" may he rest in peace) to star in a supporting role. Sam Page, known for his roles on \"House of Cards\" and \"Mad Men,\" starred as the lead. Italia Ricci, who now has her own show on ABC Family called \"Chasing Life.\" And let's not forget two-time Emmy Award winner Bonnie Bartlett, who also played a supporting role. \r\n\r\nPatrick's background is in professional writing and radio broadcasting.

  "Where will the books come from?\r\n\r\nWe already have plenty of books ready for the library, and we will seek out high quality books of all genres and age ranges in used book stores, thrift shops, and yard sales. Hopefully Library patrons will donate a book or three when they visit. We won't be shy about asking for donations from bookstores or letting the Library's facebook followers know of our needs. My family is committed to acquiring and maintaining terrific and plentiful Library content.\r\n\r\nWhat if someone objects?\r\n\r\nFirst of all - who objects to a library??? Seriously, I can't think of a single reason to object to a Little Free Library.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the LFL will be placed on our property. There are thousands and thousands of LFLs in the front yards of private homes. There are front yard LFLs in nearby communities like Oak Park and LaGrange, and they don't seem to bother anyone.\r\n\r\nLittle Free Libraries have been proven time and again to be of great community benefit, and a powerful tool to promote literacy. There's no downside! In the unlikely event of a problem, we will do everything we can to get permission to host the LFL. If, for any reason, we cannot host the Library on our property, we will work with the City to place it in a safe and convenient public place. \r\n\r\nLittlefreelibrary.org states that although objections to LFLs are extremely rare, they have, and will, contact government officials and do everything they can to help potential LFLs become realities. \r\n\r\nWhat if a local artisan or woodworker agrees to build the Library, but they don't follow through?\r\n\r\nThat might happen. We are not going to pay anyone for labor or materials in advance, so if a builder gets too behind schedule or must abandon the project, we will purchase a library from the Little Free Library Organization, most likely this one: http://littlefreelibrary.org/shop/library/amish-two-story-brownstone/\r\n\r\nWhat if someone steals the books?\r\n\r\nWell...the books are there to take. They can't really be stolen! In addition, anyone taking books in order to resell them will have a hard time. Library books will have a stamp or special bookplate on the inside front cover, and generally, used book stores will not buy a library book. People who abuse the honor system are either earning some bad karma for themselves, or have extreme need - either way, they have our pity.\r\n\r\nAren't you afraid of vandalism?\r\n\r\nYep. Hopefully, it won't happen. According to littlefreelibrary.org, incidents of vandalism are rare - communities that have Little Free Libraries are often very protective of them. Our front yard is well lighted all night and we may install additional solar lighting just for the Library. We have lived in Berwyn for 12 years now, and our home has never been vandalized except for spray paint ugliness on the garage once, and some flowers picked from the garden. If the Library is damaged or destroyed, we WILL rebuild it....bigger, better, stronger. \r\n\r\nThe best way to stop vandalism (and ignorance, and apathy, and many other things) is to drown it in books!",

In addition, we have reached out to a number of Taos arts organizations, and the potential for collaborations is growing. The Taos Center for the Arts, the Harwood Museum of Art, and the Taos Artists Organization have all expressed interest in working with us on making this truly a townwide event.

  "Shoe making is a complicated business.  I once worked for the former CFO of a major airline, and I remember him telling me that it takes longer to make a pair of shoes than an airplane.  \r\n\r\nBut I understand this industry inside and out \u2013 and better than most people.  I've also assembled a best-in-class team to help me deliver your shoes on time and hopefully just the way you remember.  Collectively we have deep and broad experience covering the entire supply chain and the connections with retailers who are excited to bring you your beloved Famolare shoes again. \r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING: The biggest issue new shoe companies face when it comes to delivering product is meeting their factory\u2019s MOQ\u2019s (minimum order quantity).  We\u2019re hoping that we will meet our MOQ\u2019s just with our Kickstarter orders and can begin production within 90 days rather than 180.  Though we have the moulds, and know they work with the machines where we plan to produce the bottoms for samples and production, we still need to confirm that the lasts will work with our factory\u2019s equipment.  If they don\u2019t, we will need to open new lasts, which may add a couple of weeks to the production time.  We also need to go through fit trials, and then order the dies used to cut the leather uppers for each style. \r\n\r\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost.  Those things could cause a delay.  We will be working with manufacturers and component suppliers who have years of experience delivering excellent products.  There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our knowledge, expertise, and connections with an overall goal of delivering your Famolare shoes on time.  \r\n\r\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal of bringing you the most comfortable and coolest shoes you\u2019ve ever worn.  You can make it happen by clicking the \u2018Back This Project\u2019 button at the top of the page, and by helping us spread the word by sharing our page with your friends and family.

Problems do arise, but we are a strong team and think quickly on our feet. \r\n\r\nShooting home in Connecticut, where Victoria grew up, has already proven extremely beneficial as Victoria's hometown and community have come together to ensure that Gold Star is completed and supported.",

Even with all of our preparation, there is an aspect of discovery here as we try out different approaches to integrating the AR interface, and figure out what works and what doesn't, both visually and narratively.

  "We are aware that with the high street there comes certain challenges:\r\n - Hiring: in the near future after the shop opens we will have to create a team of individuals to share our vision and help keep the shop open as often as possible.\r\n - Security: unlike the usually tight-knit communities of LARP events or conventions we will have to make sure that we are aware of the perishable aspect of our stock and take precautions.\r\n - Perception: though LARP and the geek world in general is becoming more mainstream, we must work hard to create a professional front that moves away from certain unfortunate stereotypes. \r\n - Shop availability: though it is unlikely as the high street is unfortunately consistently full of a smattering of shops to rent; as we intend to make sure that the space we use is as close to perfect as possible, it could take some time to open.

We consult sales and marketing specialists when necessary and have done a great deal of research about affinity marketing, sales funnels, and more. We understand the need to strongly integrate these concepts into our business as a necessary part of success.\r\n\r\nPart Acquisition\r\nWorking with overseas manufacturers for parts is difficult. It can impact timeline and quality, and we\u2019ve been working on improved sale forecasts and better communication with our vendors to stay on schedule and to keep costs tight.\r\n\r\nShipping Cost\r\nIt\u2019s not cheap to ship Spider Disc Games or UberDarts.

  "Some difficulties could arise due to working in a community that does not have previous experience with shoe making.  However, in order to maximize our success we have decided to approach job creation through a 2 phase process.  \r\n\r\nPhase 1 will be utilizing the expertise and experience of an established shoe factory in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.  With the help of our \"sister\" shoe factory, which Jamie has visited 3 times and who made our prototypes, we will begin manufacturing with experienced artisans.  A handful of people from Roatan will join the artisans in San Pedro Sula and begin a 4-5 month formal training process.  Once they are thoroughly trained and are confident and capable of executing every task needed to produce a high quality sandal they will return to the island of Roatan.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 will begin when our well trained locals return from San Pedro Sula at which time they will begin training others while producing minimal orders.  Slowly we will move the sandal orders from the established factory in San Pedro Sula to the new factory in Roatan.  Within 1-2 years we will be manufacturing 100% of the footwear on the island of Roatan with \"new\" but well trained artisans.",
  "The only risk for the implementation of the project, could relate to the difficulty in the rapid dissemination of the App, through previous work, we managed to get positive feedback from Tomtom; Frotcom and Veriflot, who plan to download the App to their onboard devices as an additional service for their customers.

The biggest challenge the app will face is getting people to understand that this is not just another repeat social media app it is so much more, the basis and general idea of social is what the app concept was built upon and we tend to keep it that way. it's not about how good you make your life look it's about the best moments throughout your life remembering them and letting people see who they were shared with. that's the message will want to promote.",

  "As with any business, there are risks for Back 9. The bar and restaurant industry is known to be highly risky, with many independent establishments closing within their first year of business. How can we avoid this failure? Learning the most likely causes and taking steps to prevent them. While there are many details that come together to create overall success, below are some of the biggest issues bars and restaurants face and how we plan on avoiding or mitigating them.\r\n\r\nFirst, how many of these businesses actually fail? In 2005, researchers from Cornell University, home to one of the most well-respected hospitality programs in the country, proved that the \"90% failure rate in the first year\" for restaurants cannot be accurate. Using statistical modeling and based on the 3-4% growth rate in the industry, they concluded that a 30% failure rate is more likely in the first year. This is good news for us, because statistically, we're already moving in the right direction! (http://pitchforksoptional.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/restaurantsfail.pdf)\r\n\r\nThe same study from Cornell, along with a few other resources, have listed being undercapitalized as a huge problem for bars and restaurants because they are unable to handle unexpected costs and delays. (http://www.nightclub.com/operations/reasons-why-bars-fail) \r\nTo mitigate this issue, we have built many financial cushions into our projections. We need your help to finance our startup costs, so that we can be a stable business with the resources to overcome obstacles.\r\n\r\nWhile proximity to competitors can help bring in customers, the inability to differentiate from those competitors can put a business under. (http://www.growthink.com/businessplan/help-center/how-to-open-a-bar) We addressed this issue by clearly differentiating Back 9 from local establishments with the self-serve tap system and the fun competition of mini golf made with adults in mind. Back 9 is unlike any other bar, mini golf, or entertainment venue in the city, and it will become a destination for locals in our target market.\r\n\r\nAnother hurdle is including the right people with the right knowledge areas to support your business. I'll never pretend to know everything about opening a bar or mini golf course, but I have brought in people who do to help me. I've included two business advisors, a bar owner, a restaurant supply expert, an architect, a broker, and a sports league manager on my team to help me make this business operate smoothly and become profitable.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll spend resources on the things that help provide a memorable guest experience, like quality products, a well-maintained facility, and exceptional customer service from properly trained staff. (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-10-reasons-bar-restaurant-failure-5-solutions-tim-borden) This will create a solid base of return customers who will help generate more business through their use of social media, online reviews, and word of mouth.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, though, there's no way to guarantee success. I wonder: Will people show up? Will they like it? Will they come back? I've prepared and researched as much as possible, and I'm confident that this business will become a premier nightlife spot in Pittsburgh and maybe even expand to other cities.",
  "One of our risks and challenges is being small at first.\u00a0That is\u00a0probably the biggest challenge we will face in the beginning. As such we will meet that challenge head on and smash it with our marketing strategy. We have several ways to do so,\u00a0such as many big marketing events and using social media to our advantage to get our name out quick. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge for us will of course be competition. The way we plan to beat out our competition is by offering a new and exciting experience every time guests come in, building and furthering our equipment technology and finally by offering memberships to guests that will give them\u00a0more incentive to return\u00a0to us.\u00a0\u00a0",

  "The biggest challenge we have faced in the history of teaching art/education workshops is funding. Typically the school districts that need and can benefit the MOST from the program simply do not have the budget to support this sort of venture.\r\n\r\nMajor challenges we have encountered in the past include securing funds PRIOR to beginning the project. Oftentimes even when a school or organization has the funds there are many roadblocks before we can get paid and begin. Often times I have to personally front the money for travel and materials and get reimbursed after completion. For a variety of reasons, this is becoming less and less a viable option.  Our partnership with Kickstarter aims to eliminate this issue entirely.\r\n\r\nWeather has sometimes played a role with outdoor workshops. We plan both indoor and outdoor options as a preventative measure.\r\n\r\nCommunication and support from the community we work in is key.

  "With any new business or startup the biggest question is, OK, what is this  going to take? Right off the bat the biggest obstacle is getting aggressive pricing locked in. In the Disc Golf world the more you buy the better your cost. What we have elected to do is partner up with our future customers and offer Pre-Purchasing incentives to help us increaseing the size of our initial order, qualifying us for the most aggressive pricing then relaying those savings directly to the customer.\r\n\r\nThis will help us offer quality pricing, quality service and a great foundation to build on. One of our main focuses is going to be educating the younger crowd in the area. Very similar to the Yo Yo man in school we want to visit local schools, churches, and after school programs to educate the kids on this incredible sport. Provide them with more information to take to their parents, in hopes that they come together and can spend time growing in the sport and as a family.

  "Our biggest challenge to completing this project is raising the funds necessary. Our script is complete and polished, our cast is talented and prepared, and our crew is experienced and adaptable. However, that doesn't preclude us from the natural logistical volatility of filmmaking. As any filmmaker knows all too well, Murphy's Law tends to rear its ugly head at the worst of times. Filmmaking is about problem solving, pure and simple. It's having the work ethic to craft a perfect plan but also the experience and resolve to adapt once your plan inevitably blows up in your face. It's about putting the time in, asking questions, and learning from your mistakes. Our team has done that.\r\n\r\nWe understand the challenges we face to get this film made, but we are resolute in our efforts. Making art always involves risk. That's the fun of it. You can pitch your movie to one guy who decides if it will get made or to thousands of backers online. Both cases involve you letting go of your work. We understand that filmmaking is a collaborative, expensive medium and many things have to come together to get a project like this off the ground. \r\n\r\nTo put it simply, we are in your hands now, but there's nowhere else we'd rather be.",
  "We are making this LP completely on our own with no backing from a label or any sort of music industry management. Not only can marketing and distribution get really pricey, it is also very demanding when you are doing it yourself without the help of a team. However, we believe if the fans are willing to put their own hard earned money into funding the recording, they will be more than willing to share a link on social media to help spread the word. Word of mouth is a powerful tool that we plan to lean on.",

I am versed in requesting permission from the air control facilities, so I anticipate a successful endeavor.",
  "Sea Song will stand over 15 feet tall, and including the base plate, will weigh about half a ton. Due to construction happening on the premises, we will not be able to build it in the garden, but instead build it elsewhere and then install it. Therefore, we are currently setting up public build sessions throughout the Rockaways which will allow residents to participate in the construction of the memorial. Transporting the work-in-progress will be no small feat, and is a large reason for our need to fundraise for this project. We'll be needing to rent trucks, mix cement, obtain art materials, tools, and hardware, publicize our project, coordinate a large public event, and ensure the longevity of the piece against the elements.\r\n\r\nWe are confident about our ability to build, transport, and install the piece. We're experienced artists, welders, and builders, and are getting expert support from people who have worked on many large scale installations in the past. We also have experience engaging communities in creative processes where everyone has a voice. One element of this project that will allow for very broad involvement is the creation of \"resilience flags\" that will be suspended from the top of the sculpture. Local high school students have already begin to create these flags and we will invite many more residents of all ages to create these and other art objects over the summer. The unveiling ceremony will also be a time where many community members will be able to contribute their talents and experiences.\r\n\r\nLarge, tight-knit grassroots networks of aid and solidarity formed in response to Superstorm Sandy. It is our connection to these networks which make it possible to engage in a community endeavor of this scope.",

  "One of the biggest challenges facing MISS INDIA AMERICA is the utilization of our social media campaign to bring a wide and diverse audience to the project.  With your support of our Kickstarter campaign, we are not only raising money, but also raising awareness of the project, and building fun new ways to engage with the story beyond the film.  We want you to be a part of this as much we are, but we can only do it with your help.  Distributors and exhibitors look to see if a project has support beyond the filmmakers, and one of the metrics used is how much of the social media is being engaged around the film.  If our social media campaign does not catch fire, we are still going to make an amazing film and get it out there through more traditional channels.  We have a team in place that has swam those waters before and can do it again. However, we hope to utilize new tools and methods to get the message about the film out there, and we plan on making this story as fun outside of the film, as it is inside of the film.",
  "Once we reach our funding goal, the only thing left to do will be the construction and implementation of the project itself. Part of the nature of Quarter Collective's larger project is working under extreme time constraints. As was the case in Part I: The Laundromat, we will have access to the installation space for the 24 hours leading up to the show itself. Because of this limitation, we will have everything planned in detail long before construction begins, but remain flexible in terms of the translation from concept to physical installation.",

  "Currently, our biggest issue is finding volunteers and buying the materials to make masks. As I've mentioned before, within the past few weeks, more facilities are requesting our face masks so we are in need of more students to help out make masks and more money to buy up fabrics, elastics, and sewing machines as quickly as possible.\n\nWe need to scale up production quickly to meet the growing demand of hospitals. We hope that donations online will provide us an opportunity to do so.",
  "Ok, we all know there will be some risks and challenges:\nFirst is that if we don't reach the goal, I will not have any funds from you and consequently you will not receive anything from me, apart from my everlasting gratitude for trying...\nSecondly, please be aware that it could take a fairly long time for me to process and deliver your wheels to you. This is simply because I am alone in this project, and crafting a set of 4 wheels takes about 10 hours and then needs 7 days curing time before they are safe to be used. Then of course there\u2019s delivery time which doesn't depend on me, but I promise I will try my best to fulfil every single order in the shortest amount of time possible. All I need is your patience, but I know you have a great one, as you guys probably waited a couple of months for your board to be delivered to you.

I believe it is, as it\u2019s totally changing my experience with my board making it much more fun and enjoyable, but, it\u2019s always possible it could not meet all your expectations. I'm trying to be as clear and honest as I can presenting my work to you, so if this happens I apologise. I hope you understand this is a truly homemade, handcrafted thing and is not perfect, in fact you are contributing to help me make this better and perfected.

However, we are confident that once Fairies start sharing uplifting videos and stories, others will take notice and have greater interest and faith in our app.\n\nOur plan to overcome this challenge is to initially pay Fairies to go out onto the street and begin creating profiles and informing homeless individuals about the app. This is part of the reason why we deiced to ask for a bigger investment for the early stages of development and advertising.

  "There are several potential risks typically associated with a project like this, but we\u2019ve done everything we could possibly do to mitigate them! \r\n\r\nFirst, restaurants can be risky enterprises. However, The Lucky Well is already a successful and proven concept that has been in operation and delivering consistent quality since 2013. Instead of launching a new restaurant, The Lucky Well Commissary is an extension of a successful concept.\r\n\r\nChef Chad Rosenthal also has a strong, established personal brand, a large social media following, and a passion for converting customers into loyal brand partners. \r\n\r\nThe other potential risk is the challenge of working with low-income and homeless populations. While The Lucky Well team is familiar with launching and operating successful restaurants, they've not worked with a high-risk population in this capacity previously. In order to ensure success of this model, they\u2019ll be leveraging strategic partnerships with local shelters, service organizations and community leaders who will serve as advisors by providing guidance and expertise throughout the planning, development, and launch of this concept. \r\n\r\nStrategic partners will advise The Lucky Well on the best outreach, hiring, training and retention models, common challenges and barriers to opportunities, and crisis communication training. These partnerships are essential to ensuring a positive, supportive and effective employment experience.",

We will also be in much better location if we are able to secure it soon.The place we have picked out that is available now is perfect! Also our new product is amazing and we know exactly how to set it up.Another problem new restaurants face is help.We trained many of our family members and can get all the help necessary to get up and running.We will teach them the new system and they will be glad to help! They have a lot of experience \r\nand can handle and have handled super busy situations.Also our process will be much easier then our old one so training new workers will be fairly simple once things are up and running.Some people that open restaurants don't know the best places to purchase their products.We know all the distributors and we know exactly where to go for all the things we need.Not to mention 7 years of restaurant experience owning managing and cooking .",
  "Why are we destined for success against all odds?\r\n\r\nTo date CRAVE Magazine has been an out-of-pocket venture on behalf of our publisher. Our growing online presence is the product of countless unpaid hours on behalf of our editor. Together, this entrepreneurial duo has more than 20 years of combined experience in the creative industries.\r\n\r\nAll of the content that has been produced thus far in print and online has been thanks not only to our managing team, but in greater part thanks to a collaborative effort on behalf of our community. Countless artists, writers, photographers, graphic designers, legal consultants, local businesses, community leaders, state representatives and general art enthusiasts have jumped on board and contributed their efforts and support to help make CRAVE Magazine what it is today.\r\n\r\nIn short, we've already laid the groundwork and CRAVE is finally gaining momentum at a fever-pitch. So when it comes to producing our next issue, it should go without saying that we've researched our printing costs and shipping costs, and we know how much work it takes on the creative end and we know how to make this a successful endeavor.\r\n\r\nIn this way, our greatest challenges and risks are not necessarily in the details of how we will fulfill our Kickstarter promise but more so in how we will continue to grow and share CRAVE Magazine as a whole in the distant future. \r\n\r\nUltimately CRAVE is much more than just a print publication or an online presence. We are more than sum of our parts. We're here now because we know where we stand, we know what we need to do to move forward and we know that with the help from the greater art community, we can get there.",

Similar to our Buccaneer skillet, our knives, the Wigbold and two earlier cookware campaigns, we\u2019ve run a pilot production round with a manufacturer who meets our high-quality standards and produces pans like ours on a large scale for premium brands. Our crowd tested The Tasman and now we have confirmation: the Dutch Oven and grill is ready for mass production.

The best approach for this is film festivals...the downside to this is festivals don't want your film if its widely available. That being said, festival screenings may cause delays in fulfillment. \n\nSustainability: \nWe here at Static Age Productions believe in being good stewards of our planet, and as such we strive to be as environmentally sustainable as possible. This leads to some aspects of fulfillment, like physical media, being a bit more complicated to create. We do everything in recyclable packaging with as little plastic as possible.

We\u2019ll also be updating you through the whole process so you know where in production we are and when it\u2019s going to get to you (all orders will be shipped with tracking numbers).\n\nTaking into account the global pandemic, we may face delays because of factories having to work with smaller teams to minimize the risk of an outbreak.",

  "The greatest challenge in this endeavor is the amount of labor involved. The Journal has published 25 issues, totaling 89 articles and 44 book reviews.

I'm calling for help to achieve my goals as I push towards the ultimate goal, a store front in LA, and hopefully many other locations in the future! \r\n\r\nThis is my first business venture and while I'm new to most of the challenges that come with owning a business, i also am very determined to see my plan go through. Raising initial funding to have our custom griddles made for the cakes is a major hold up due to the expensive nature of Aluminum casting, but once we have the money needed we can truly make the desserts that i know people will love and crave. Im completely confident in all our recipes and flavor combinations that have been phenomenal in their own different ways. I feel confident in gaining the exposure to promote and sell the Peezas, but need the funding for the initial start of something great.",

  "Opening a restaurant is full of risks: location, overhead, lack of traffic, long leases, high rents, running out of cash before renovations are complete, not being able to get licensed... OOH, I just scared myself! But nothing worth doing is risk-free and sometimes you just have to jump off the cliff and hope your parachute opens (at least that's what Steve Harvey said). \r\n\r\nWe're confident the time is right to give Lukes' Soul Food Cafe a home. The cost of opening a restaurant in most cities is high and DFW is no different. So our mission was to get the best possible location for the least possible expense. First, we participated in an incubator being planned by our city of Desoto and bought marketing materials, did a pitch and PowerPoint presentation in June and got in! Unfortunately, we were told the incubator building would open on July 1st, but it's been delayed until (maybe, possibly, could be) October 1st and we really think it's going to be next year or longer. So we've decided to skip the city politics and delays and try to make our restaurant happen on our own, well, with your help.  \r\n\r\nThis is why we've had to be smart about the how and the when. We retained the services of a commercial real estate agent in July and started looking for a building that would work for our needs and was affordable. We wanted to keep overhead low so we could keep our prices as affordable as they have been. We knew we couldn't afford to do a restaurant build-out which is basically taking an empty shell and turning it into a restaurant; ain't nobody got time (or money) for that! \r\n\r\nWe told our agent we were open to \"fixer-uppers\" because we were willing to put in the sweat equity and elbow grease needed to make this happen so we could decrease costs further. We've been fortunate enough to have \"patient capital\" invested by our parents (thanks PawPaw & Mama!), but there's a LOT that goes into opening a restaurant, let me tell ya!\r\n\r\nSo, as you've seen in the video, we found a restaurant in Mesquite that used to be a Sonic and negotiated a very reasonable lease amount and term. As you can also see from other videos, the place needs some serious TLC and that's gonna cost more m-o-n-e-y. And then there's the equipment that we need because ain't no frying fish without a stove or deep fryer! My wife, the accountant, is a for-real-for-real accountant and she is CHEAP (all caps)! We're looking for used everything, even stuff that I have to tinker with to make work again (I'm handy like that)! We want to make sure we spend our coins wisely. We know that we set our funding goal low but we're really (really, really) hoping that you, the best family ever, will push us way past that so we don't run out of money before we buy trivial things like, oh I don't know, a commercial stove.\r\n\r\nIt took time to get to this point and we're going to be cautious and take our time as we scale up for growth. With your support, we know Lukes' Soul Food Cafe can be a successful part of the community and, eventually, create jobs in the community! We have big plans for our brand, including making sure you can find some of your favorites, like our delicious chicken tenders, right in your grocer's freezer! \r\n\r\nWe know you can't wait to come sit down and enjoy a great meal BUT we have to walk before we can run, so one of our ways of being frugal and getting the best deal on a lease is we're going to start small and grow into a dine-in restaurant space LATER. Y'all we talking pick up and delivery only, come get it and go, for now! Once we gain some momentum, we will definitely be getting y'all a drive-thru window, but baby steps. Show us some love and we'll show it right back by growing bigger and bringing you along with us!\r\n\r\nThis is a labor of love to pay homage to our heritage and our beloved family members who taught us everything we know about cooking good soul food. There's going to be plenty of blood, sweat, and tears to make this happen; plenty of hard work and hard decisions; plenty of sacrifices and long hours. But it'll be worth it in the end because there will be plenty of good food and good times, plenty of laughs, and plenty of love too. We're ready if you are! We're going to share it all with you every step of the way and we might even need your help with some of the tougher decisions; we're not finna (that means \"fixing to\" or \"about to\" for y'all good folk not from the Dirty South) get caught out here in these entrepreneur streets with no guidance! We don't know how it's going to turn out but we DO know two things: \r\n1. the food will be awesome\r\n2. our customers will be treated like family because, to us, that's what y'all are! \r\n\r\nIf you're down to ride with us and see our hustle, then buckle up and let's go get it!",

From the scouring (washing) plant in Bradford to the weavers in Lancashire who have been in business for over 150 years, I know they will always do their best to deliver a high quality product.

  "When it comes to dealing with goods, there are always potential risks and challenges. There may be issues with manufacturing, time frames, delays, not enough funding to unlock certain items, etc.\n\nI have made various products such as enamel pins, vinyl stickers, magnets, and more. I have reliable manufacturers for my products to ensure a smooth production process and quality products and will communicate with them and continually update you on the process.\n\nManufacturing: While I will communicate with the manufacturers as carefully as I can, there is the possibility that the product outcome may be different than anticipated. These include pin quality, faulty pins, minor or major mistakes that may require the manufacturer to remake the product, which can take a lot of extra time. Some designs may be edited slightly when the manufacturer proofs the images. I will be sure to check the quality of the pins and other products before I ship them to backers. If the products must be remade, there will be a delay in shipping time and I will communicate this with all of the backers if that were to happen.\n\nShipping Delays: There is the possibility of delays or damaged products during shipping. While I will package goods in the safest way possible, I can't control what happens after it is shipped. If backers receive any damaged products, please contact me so we can sort things out. With shipping delays, there isn't much that could be done beyond being aware of COVID-19, unforeseen weather issues, international shipping delays, etc.\n\nFunding: Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing funding platform that gives creators a shot at paying for the production of merchandise while allowing backers to receive rewards for helping fund their project. There may be the risk that this campaign does not meet all of its funding goals, meaning that if you pledge in hopes for a product that is never unlocked, you will not receive said item(s).\n\n*Note that refunds will not be issued under any circumstances once production has begun, as funds go directly into production.

  "Even once we're funded, one significant challenge in creating this magazine will be continuing to find enough high-quality content and contributors. We know a lot of funny people and we've already gotten a lot of interest in being involved. We're confident that our commitment to actually paying people for their work will further attract the talent we need. We believe that once people see a full issue of Paperweight and understand its potential, we'll hear from a whole new set of excited contributors.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge for Paperweight is born out of the fact that we're aiming to explore the possibilities of comedy on a tablet.  If we're doing our job correctly we'll be building some things that have never been built before.  The prospect of solving new problems is tremendously exciting, but it also puts some additional pressure on us to choose the appropriate platform or framework to help us bring this project to life.  We need to be able to create content quickly with a reasonable amount of effort, but not at the expense of interactivity and flexibility.  We've put a lot of thought into this already, but still expect to lose some additional sleep over it before all is said and done.\r\n\r\nMaybe our biggest ongoing risk is that people won't actually be willing to pay for content and Paperweight won't be sustainable for the long-haul. We're hoping you'll help us prove that's not true. We believe that comedy, joy, and an innovative interactive experience are worth paying for. We hope you value people who make you laugh. In the words of Marco Arment, a developer, writer and thinker we both admire, we \"support writers in the most basic, conventional way that, in the modern web context, actually seems least conventional and riskiest: by paying them to write.\"\r\n\r\nOne final risk is that the upcoming new season of Arrested Development is really good.

We\u2019ve learned a lot of valuable lessons on the way and partnered with some fantastic horologists and manufacturers to deliver the best product and service we can.

However, the world is a different place from what it was two years ago. Supply chains, manufacturing and shipping services are still feeling the effects of the global pandemic. We therefore have a responsibility to warn you that unforeseen minor delays are a possibility.

  "Risks and challenges\n\nOn time in full delivery.  One of the reason I chose to focus on pins is that, right now, shipping anything too large worldwide, its a bit of a challenge. So, whilst things are taking a while, I have found stickers and pins get through the system easily and quickly, I've learnt how to package them not to snarl up the machines. I get disappointed when things I order don't arrive on time, so that's a big deal to me. I have the experience to deliver to you, if there are problems and delays, I'll be proactive and communicate to you, keeping you in the loop.  Quality of product.  The most important thing to me is that my products are right first time, every time. Quality of products is one of the biggest challenges when upscaling production. I have been digitally art working for production and manufacturing for over 10 years. I've handled every kind of difficult vendor. That said I have worked with this manufacturer for a long time, they have never let me down. If the unthinkable happened, I have secondary manufacturers I could call on to rescue the project. I personally inspect and pack every single pin. I'll be the one handing them to the post office. You can trust the quality.  Production Delays  Unforeseen circumstances happen, but I've pre-empted some of the most common problems to keep things running smoothly. We have already worked with this manufacturer before and we've already had the artwork pre-approved. If we do get any holdups, we'll communicate out to supporters. I've built the timeline with a fair bit of flexibility.  Overwhelming Orders. In the exciting situation we receive and exceptionally large amount of orders, our manufacturer has assured us that they will be able to fulfil production. We will fulfil orders first come first shipped. If this causes delays later on, we will communicate.\n\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter\nQuestions about this project? Check out the FAQ",

  "Having now made short films, a horror movie and FIVE feature-length documentaries about the ZX Spectrum/retro computing, interviewing nearly fifty video game veterans, programmers, game developers, artists, musicians and publishers, we have this one in the bag. We have a brilliant line-up of existing and new people, many who are now great friends, we have core film-making equipment and experience of making over 12 hours of finished documentary films. The risks are extremely limited, the challenge wonderful!\n\nBeing realistic, lockdown has made future timings a little unpredictable, although I have still carried out some recent interviews (with Clive Townsend and David J. Pleasance of Commodore, for example) so things are looking good! . I will release regular updates on progress to backers. :-)",
  "Making any film, particularly a doc, has inherent risks in ever being finished, finding a home in a great festival and later locking in distribution or broadcast.  We are so lucky that if we pull this Kickstarter off and get the  funding we need to finish we will with no question be ready to submit to next years festivals on time.  \n\nWe have an extraordinary team and a fully shot and almost completely edited film.  Because I have self funded for so many years we are way closer to being done than most projects when they Kickstart.  \n\nSophie and The Baron is such a beautiful story, we just need this final push and with your love and support (even with sharing if you are unable to donate) I am completely confident we will achieve all of our goals!",

  "At the beginning of the project we find several challenges to overcome such as:\r\n- Reach the consumer\r\nThe challenge is to solve it in the best way with advertising in social networks, promotions and discounts, with competitive prices, but above all with quality in the product and quality in the service.\r\n\r\n- Expand the business\r\nAfter overcoming the challenge of reaching the consumer, the next step is to expand and improve it. How do we do this? By investing part of our profits in improving our facilities better suiting our customers and their needs, And later looking for new places to expand the franchise, doing a good market study.\r\n\r\n\r\nAl empezar el proyecto nos encontramos con los desaf\u00edos tales como:\r\n\r\n- Llegarle al consumidor\r\nEl desaf\u00edo es resolverlo de la mejor manera, con publicidad en redes sociales, promociones y descuentos; pero sobre todo con calidad en nuestro producto y nuestra manera de servirlo.\r\n\r\n- Engrandecer el negocio\r\ntras superar el reto de llegar al consumidor el siguiente paso es ampliar y mejorar el mismo. Como hacemos esto? Pues invirtiendo parte de nuestras ganancias en mejorar nuestras instalaciones adecuandolas mejor a nuestros clientes y sus necesidades y posteriormente buscando nuevos lugares para expandir la franquicia, haciendo un buen estudio de mercado.",

  "The potential risks in creating a project like this cannot be overstated; thankfully, I have already invested \u00a32500 of my own capital in order to bring this film to life, meaning my backers can rest assured that their pledges ONLY go towards paying for the licence fees we need in order to be able to release the film. The day after this campaign closes, all funds raised will go directly to the BBC, and a post will be made on this page showing our backers exactly where their pledge has gone. \n\nLastly, I\u2019d say that both as a filmmaker, and as someone who has backed an extensive number of crowdfunding campaigns in the past, It always comforts me knowing that the filmmakers have put even a small amount of their own money into bringing their project to life. If you know that I\u2019m willing to take a risk in putting my own money into the project, you can rest assured knowing that I believe in this project enough to see it through to competition. \n\nIf we DO NOT meet our target, I will continue investing in this project in order to ensure that it one day sees the light of day. However, being able to raise this money to immediately finish this film is so important to me, and getting it out into the hands and minds of the people in Mansfield as soon as possible remains of paramount importance.",

  "The most prominent risk would be a batch of mead going bad but that is why instead of brewing it all in one giant batch i will brew in several small batches at a time (about 400 gallons monthly maybe more as demand increases) so that if one batch does turn to vinegar ( have not had it happen yet but is always a possibility) the other batches will still be drinkable saving waste the other risks go along with any bar or pub type establishment bar fights and damage to establishment but that's what insurance is for right the brewery will be separate from the actual guest space itself so no risk of health code violations.

  "Now for the risks and challenges... There is of course this virus that is affecting everything, but I believe that it won't be a huge issue as this isn't a performance but a recording so there won't be an audience.\n\nAnother risk is that I don't have enough money to pay for a videographer but in that case I will do the videos myself! :)",

  "The process of making a movie is always accompanied by risks and challenges. In regards to this project in particular, the primary challenges we must overcome are in regards to scheduling and travel. Not everything can be shot locally and will require us to travel (Boston and potentially New York). This could be rather costly considering we are college kids and only work part-time jobs. As well, we are also working on another senior thesis film so scheduling to shoot may be difficult down the line during production.",
  "During the launching of 5 campaigns, the most significant challenge is to breakthrough the mindset from old ideas and not be limited to it. For this new product, we have brought a fresh image on tote bag and hoping to give our backers a new perception. Apart from new features, we have kept the signature style of our bags collection, keeping it small, strong and stylish. We believe our experience accumulated so far will build up the maturity of our campaign , which brings our backers a smooth delivery and experience.",
  "Times of productions and shipping are strongly varying due to the global changes we are all suffering. Even though I will try as hard to keep our schedule. I always try to keep you updated about all the changes and progress the project is getting.",
  "The real risk relies in the amount of Monochrome prints that will be funded. Given that Press Printing is all carried out by hand and requires lots of effort coupled with an unlimted number of Monochrome orders I will required the support of a printing shop with several press prints in order to cope with the demand. \n\nI have already found a traditional printing shop here in Milan to have enough capacity to satisfy the potential demand.",

  "There are challenges which come with starting any new business. Fortunately through the testing of our products and the repeat customers we have had in the past year we have gained some valuable experience in this field. We have build a network of suppliers with integrity, and have gained experience in quality control and managing expenses. The fact that we are familiar with the communities we will serve, the laws and the languages also comes in handy.\r\n As we mentioned previously we have tested our products and we know it works. \r\nHaving a brick-and-mortar and the fixed costs it comes with means that we will have to grow quickly, spend a lot of time and energy growing our customer base. As this is a project we are passionate about we are well prepared for any challenges that may come our way.",
  "I understand that with responsibility & this new business endeavor, also comes many obstacles and challenges. Some of these challenges include financial responsibilities, staffing, building renovation, and customer service. I know that I can overcome any of these challenges because I am willing to work my tail off to get past the speed bumps. I am so passionate about this business and what it stands for, that I am willing to do anything to make my business successful!",
  "We need to raise at least $1,200 to begin the promotion of this compelling movie that shines a light on the future of our relations with one another. There is the risk that we would not raise enough. Yet, we will continue to do our best to promote this movie through public relations, word-of-mouth, funding from friends, relatives or concerned persons or organizations who care about relations between Mexico and the United States... and about the well-being of humans in our shared world.",
  "I am working with an engineer named Riccardo Pasini who lives in Italy. We have to communicate back and forth via email on multiple revisions of the songs, across timezones. This can be a slow process and the album may take longer to complete than anticipated, but the fantastic work Riccardo does is well worth the wait to me!\n\nShipping delays are possible, especially considering COVID-19 regulations that may slow down the process.\n\nRewards ordered may be lost or damaged.\n\nI will do everything in my power to ensure that everyone receives their orders as quickly as possible, and in one piece!",
  "We very much will not want to have any problems through out the duration of creation of this project all the way to the conclusion. unfortunately we do live in the real world and we anticipate obstacle, nevertheless we are a team that is good at meeting deadlines and before you know it you'll be listening to our music every where and proudly say to yourself i was part of making this possible.",
  "Budget: Our start-up costs are minimal, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to keep it that way by efficiently using resources and getting creative. That being said we need a little help from our friends to reach our goal. $4,750 will cover everything from initial food costs for quality ingredients, licensing fees and a home for Adwey (Organic) in the Emory Point in downtown Atlanta. In exchange for your help you will receive waves of gratitude, hand crafted rewards, and a new tasty dining option.  The Breakdown: food costs- $1000 rent/utilities-$3000 licensing/insurance- $850 equipment - $850 kick starter fees/rewards- $550 marketing/events- $700",
  "Challenges:\r\n1. Marketing to all the various levels of the demographic will take a lot of creativity.  It is important that it is relevant to all of them.\r\n2.There is always a risk that a new business will not support itself. We've done our due diligence and this reduces risk, but doesn't dismiss it altogether.\r\n3. Another challenge will be discerning when and how to partner with different entities to best help our community.  Not every outreach is relevant for our community, nor is it good business to just give away product or space without some measure of accountability on both parts.\r\n4. In addition to having a great product and customer service it will be challenging to maintain and acquire more local resources to grow with the customers and their needs.",
  "Like any other new business there are risks and challenges but rest assured, we are prepared:\r\n\r\nIf our Kickstarter campaign is unsuccessful, we'll still serve wine and beer at our restaurant. Just not as much. And you won't be able to enjoy it in an awesomely-renovated space.\r\n\r\nThe Market: While wine not may be new to Cadiz, there is not a \"wine Bar\" within the region: Consumers' tastes are changing in favor of domestic and foreign wines.  The Wine Bars industry has enjoyed a stellar run over the past five years and has taken advantage of an evolving hospitality landscape. The industry, which consists of bars that primarily serve large selections of wine rather than draft beer and mixed drinks, has comfortably outpaced the Bars and Nightclubs industry as a whole.\r\nPlanning: As a military mother and past Director of Operations, Debra is no stranger to strategic planning. She has left no stone unturned: from the cost of local wine and beer to the appropriate foods to serve, to the service expectations- we've done our homework.\r\n\r\nThe Team: Our staff will be carefully selected and trained to make your visit to our establishment perfect. As a woman-owned and -operated establishment, we will pair our professionalism, attention to detail, and work ethic with a the highest level of service.\r\n\r\nIntegration: We will strive to partner with other local businesses to provide, entertainment, marketing, and a venue for the entire community to enjoy. We believe in supporting local business and will use as many locally-sourced ingredients as possible in restaurant and Wine Bar.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, your support, and we'll see you in the New Year!",

  "It is important to understand that although I am nearing the end of this project, with the last hurdle being the artwork, the artist I am working with must also balance this project with her own work as a Teacher, and allow time for herself whenever she needs it, be it for her own projects or for her own personal agenda. As such I am doing my best to not leave her overworked which means it will take time for all of the artwork to be completed and this book published. The earliest estimates I have for the completion of this project is the summer of 2022, though more realistically we may be looking at early 2023.",
  "Since this project was generously funded in part by the MusicNL Press On initiative, money raised with the preorders of this book helps to fund printing costs.",
  "Again, our biggest challenge and hurdle is printing and shipping costs. Without your help there will be a huge delay in production. That said, there's a possibility of not releasing the issue, nor the next. But we got faith. We trust in the universe.  (;",
  "This is going to be my 17th Kickstarter campaign so suffice to say I have a bit of experience. But what's coolest about this one is that is 100% risk-free. We are using Kickstarter as a platform to help us distribute the remaining units of a book we've already produced and is ready to ship.\n\nThat's right, Funagain Logistics will start fulfillment as soon as funds and shipping addresses are collected. They already have the books in their warehouse and as soon as we organize everything on our end, rewards will ship out.\n\nYou will notice we have a pretty low goal, just two different tiers and no add-ons or Stretch Goals meaning we are designing this campaign to be fulfilled ASAP.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to reach out via e-mail at cagno100@gmail.com but bottom line is we are ready to rock this!",
  "Though things are slowly starting to look up there is still a possibility of delays being caused by the coronavirus, especially when it comes to production or increased shipping times. I've tried to take this into account in my timeline, but things can still be unpredictable!\n\nEnamel pins are hand-made items, and as such it is possible for batches to be flawed. I have worked with this manufacturer before, and am very pleased with the quality and communication they offer. Because of this I have faith that communication will be no issue if I do encounter problems with the production of the pins.\n\nPrior to the kickstarter I've already sent off the artwork, and requested samples from my manufacturer. I hope to be able to show them towards the end of the campaign!\n\nI aim to keep any backers in the loop through frequent kickstarter updates, as well as social media, and strive to be as transparent as possible.\n\nPlease take into account that the end product can differ slightly from the mock-ups presented in the kickstarter.",
  "While I want this album to be released as soon as possible. I cannot begin this project with your help. The sooner I can achieve my goal of $1000, the sooner I can start allocating the rewards and put the album into the world.",
  "We've spent all our money on traveling and motorcycles and printing obscure travel memoirs and paints and musical equipment, so unfortunately we don't have the finances to fund this independently. People have expressed a real intrigue though in this project, so to do it right and cook up some quality rewards, and make sure we get it all to you before it gets too cold, we've come up with a pretty streamlined budget that's just a little less than what we're asking for.  \n\nAnything over that would go toward more content; a proper website, more videos because they're fun, and a curated outlet of the explosion of work coming out of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and all types of service from around the world.\n\nWe've projected it as a bi-annual periodical, so a 2-year subscription would consist of 4 issues.",
  "El riesgo ata\u00f1e a la periodicidad de las impresiones. Colocaremos la revista en puntos de venta estrat\u00e9gicos, realizaremos campa\u00f1as de publicidad en redes y realizaremos presentaciones permanentemente a efecto de tener cada vez m\u00e1s suscriptores.",
  "The risks and challenges are very slim with this project. I would say that there is a greater chance of this project failing because it wasn't funded to begin with. I need your ideas and your help to get this project going. And if there are no supporters, I am still going to continue and follow this dream.",
  "I am confident in my ability to produce high quality pins (check out my customer reviews!) based on my past experience. Unexpected manufacturing issues or delays may arise and I will keep the campaign up-to-date on the progress of manufacturing. It's possible that factories are slower than usual due to the pandemic. Final colors may vary.",
  "This is my biggest project yet, so it will be challenging. However I\u2019m very optimistic!",
  "- The possibility of minor changes in details on the pins if they don't translate well to the actual product. But I will try my best to get it as accurate (in terms of sizing and details) as I can to the original design posted here.There might be slight variation in the color of pin(Pantone colors may not display in the same manner on your display screen).\n\n- There may be delay in shipping if more stretch goals gets unlock. As the production on number of pins increase. more time might be needed to produce them.",
  "We have spent the last year and a half developing the first volume of Devo Journal, and our team has been working day and night to perfect the design and layout, production, and logistics.\n\nWe've developed a relationship with a world-class journal manufacturer and went through several rounds of iteration and testing. We couldn\u2019t be happier with the end product and feel very confident in the quality of the production. \n\nWe understand that no campaign comes without challenges\u2014from the manufacturer to the ports to the freight forwarding trucks.  We promise to communicate with transparency and to work around the clock to ensure your expectations are met.\n\nThe primary challenge we foresee is timing following the demand that arises from the Kickstarter campaign. We will do everything in our power to get every Devo Journal to its final destination by the Fall.\n\nWe will be providing updates every step of the way to keep you fully informed.",
  "This is our 4th Kickstarter project, and needless to say; we've learned a lot during the past few years. Making hardware is almost always a difficult process. We've overcome many obstacles, and solved problems that will save us a lot of time for this project. Making products that bring value to our customers is the key to all things we make. Since Flick is the first of its kind, and since there is nothing similar to it on the market, it could potentially lead to delays in manufacturing. However, we are confident about the capability of the product and possess deep knowledge of all the fundamental components.  That being said, Flick is a complex product and we hold ourselves to incredibly high standards in terms of quality and experience. We won\u2019t ship unless we are confident we have met or exceeded these standards. \n \nWe've done everything we can to set ourselves up to be ready and on time to solve unanticipated delays. If something does come up, we will be forthright and transparent about it. Having done 3 successful Kickstarter projects before, we know that we have a very capable team that can solve all different kinds of problems that come our way.",
  "The only risk that I can think of is just the public overall will not like it. Or that they all love it so much I cannot keep up with the demand of it. But those that have tried it so far like the different taste. It is a little costly but then again it is in a 16oz jar right now and a little goes a long way. \r\n\r\nBut why will it work because I still took some old school ways and ingredients and added them in here with some of the newer ingredients and removed the cheap fillers which gives you an incredible and very unique great taste like nothing else.",
  "The more we raise, the less we will need in loans, and the greater our success and impact. This project will be our flagship with your support.

  "We came into this project knowing their were changes and updates to be made to many of the building systems such as installing a brand new roof, redoing most of the plumbing system, installing up to date annul systems for kitchen, repair HVAC units, redoing the facade of the building to bring it  to code and update it for heating and cooling efficiency. Also deciding to install new walk in food and beer fridges for maximum storage and cooling effeciency.  Little by little everything started to add up but we made these decisions as an investment in the building and our business to have the best possible systems and equipment. We wanted to start the next chapter of Maura's Kitchen on the right foot to operate as best and efficiently as we can.",

During the course of this campaign I will be finishing up writing and formatting the Guidebook as well as designing the Altar Cloth. \nMy goal will be to get all rewards shipped to backers during the month of September 2021 though it is likely that they will be ready even earlier. The deadline of September will allow ample time for the production of the decks and other rewards and also accounts for length of time it will take for the decks to be shipped to me and for me to package all orders. Of course production and shipping may experience delays due to stress on shipping from coronavirus or other complications. I aim to keep everyone updated every step of the way!",

  "In total we have successfully raised 75% of the budget we need to deliver both the theatre-making element of the project and the film-making element.  This Kickstarter campaign could help us to raise \u00a33.5k out of the remaining \u00a310k we have to raise in order to send the project through post production.  We are confident that we can raise the remaining \u00a36.5k through business sponsorship. \n\nAs with all documentary projects, its value and its risks have the same source: because the project will be adapting to the real ideas, voices, whims and events that arise.

The augmented reality app for use with Guidance Internal and our Art print cards is available today for iOS and Android. \n\nHaving successfully authored a best-selling book on Timelapse photography  (print, PDF digital, and Kindle), we believe we can minimize the challenges related to the design, printing and distribution of a physical/digital book. \n\nThere are always challenges when planning live events, but we are planning far in advance.

One challenge for the future is not getting this project off the ground fast enough before I have competition in the market. Generating sale could be a challenge, but I have connected with a few international trade shows that are ready and waiting for a product to display. So I guess the biggest challenge is the financing to get production off the ground, this is why I am on here and exploring all my options.

  "We are in an industry where print media is on a constant decline. We are confident that with the lack of support to the male demographic by publications like Maxim ( who have entered the men's fashion market) We are the only U.S. outlet for upcoming models to be showcased. We couple our print issue with a very large digital campaign ( Social media, digital issue, Apps etc.) We think the perfect combination of print and digital media can recapture the attention of men between 25-60 years old. A big mountain to climb in regards to this is publishing. We are seeking capitol to aid us in maintain print for the next few months to attract advertisers and eventually self sustain our company by publishing ourselves. \r\n\r\nPrinting Cost - 3 months at 40,000 copies per month = $96.000 \r\nMarketing Campaign - This covers costs of a 3 month marketing campaign (social media, TV commercials, Subscription based marketing) $54,000 \r\n\r\nGiven the proper funding, we have all of the tools in place to drive a campaign to put Modern Men's Magazine on shelves across the U.S. !",

  "Last year, Contrivers\u2019 Review published a pilot issue. We learned a lot from the experience. We navigated the challenges of online publishing and clarified our vision for the journal. Over the year, the underlying web technology on which the journal is built has improved markedly. We\u2019ve published several top-notch essays on topics like the labor market in universities as well as reviews of new books of popular and scholarly interest. Now Contrivers\u2019 Review is poised to move forward. We\u2019ve learned a lot from this process and are excited to use our network of writers and thinkers to address the question of technology.\r\n\r\nThe primary challenge to any publisher is economic. The industry is at a crossroads as established brands attempt to monetize their digital presence; meanwhile small, independent magazines\u2014like Contrivers\u2019 Review\u2014are appearing everyday funded largely through charity. The realities of the market put us in competition with many other worthy claimants for your donations. And our commitment to paying writers a fair compensation puts additional pressure on our long-term fundraising. Such concerns are broader than the scope of the project outlined here, however, and our project is deliberately limited to avoid the existential questions that plague the publishing industry. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge of this project is in highlighting the intersections and overlapping dynamics of diverse fields. Finding someone to write about a topic for which they have a great passion is not a problem. However, we envision a diverse and vibrant set of voices contributing to our conversation. We're taking steps to broaden our network by recruiting more editorial staff and reaching out to other communities and online clearinghouses. Then, we, the editors, will be responsible for asking writers to sculpt their arguments in productive, dialogical ways.\r\n\r\nIn addition to long-format essays, Contrivers\u2019 Review publishes \u201cresponses\u201d meant to continue and enlarge discussions with new voices and ideas. Remember that Contrivers\u2019 Review is digital, and while the technology issues will be published as a piece, the conversation around those articles will continue to grow over time.",

Any and all issues will be overcome in the most efficient way possible, using the help of family and friends who have graciously offered to stand by my dream.   I have come so far, and once people taste my cookies, the project should absolutely speak for itself.

  "The goal of printing this first edition of TRANSGRESSOR: SELECTED WORKS is to not only create a beautiful object that celebrates people who push boundaries, but to also provide Transgressor with a modest revenue stream.\r\n\r\nEvery dollar we make selling this printed collection will go right back into the project. If it's a success, we will continue to print a collection every third digital issue. If the printed collection doesn't fly off the shelves, we will continue to make the digital magazine as we have been, and keep thinking of other creative ways to support the work.\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU'RE HELPING TO COVER WHEN YOU DONATE:\r\n\r\nPrinting costs:\r\n\r\nPrinting is expensive, which is part of the reason why Transgressor began as an online publication. With TRANSGRESSOR: SELECTED WORKS, we want to shoot for the moon on our printing process, while staying true to our grassroots approach.\r\n\r\nWe plan on making a first-run of 1,000 copies of TRANSGRESSOR: SELECTED WORKS 1-3. At more than 200 FULL-COLOR pages, the collection will be printed on high-quality matte paper and perfect bound. It\u2019s important to us that we create the most beautiful printed object we can.\r\n\r\nProduction + Design:\r\n\r\nWe believe that it is important to pay people for their time and talent. Even though this is a collection from previous issues, there has been and will be many hours spent making this book. From brainstorming the best design concepts to researching the right paper, everything that has been done so far has been for the love of the project. We are putting a lot of thought into the creation and presentation of this collection, and it will show.\r\n\r\nDistribution:\r\n\r\nA large part of why we chose to bring this project to Kickstarter is that it functions as a pre-order system, the idea being that people who are already supporters of the online project get to be the first ones to get a copy of the printed collection for as little as $25.\r\n\r\nBut we are also really excited about the idea of the printed collection being on the bookshelves of our favorite bookstores. While we\u2019ll hand deliver the collection to Farewell Books here in Austin, we\u2019ll have to mail it to Printed Matter in NYC. At 200+ pages, the collection is substantial, so shipping is a real cost that we have to consider.\r\n\r\nAlso, Amazon and Kickstarter each take a bite, so we had to factor that into the whole as well.\r\n\r\nGrowth:\r\n\r\nWe also have plans to revamp the website to create a more flexible, dynamic home for everything that Transgressor represents. We are also going to add an online store so that you can buy the collection - as well as work by our contributors - from us directly.\r\n\r\nEvery dollar from this campaign and the sales of the printed collection will go directly back into the project as a whole. We\u2019re currently hard at work on the fourth digital issue of Transgressor, which we are making with no budget to pay our talented contributors.\r\n\r\nThis campaign is just one step we are taking toward being a self-sustaining project that doesn\u2019t rely solely on the enthusiasm of our contributors in its creation.",
  "No Kickstarter project is without risk, but we've worked hard to assemble the right team and sourced the best possible suppliers to mitigate any unforeseen challenges that may present themselves along the way. Still, here are some potential risks that are out of our control and our thoughts on them.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN. Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. Sometimes we get the wrong parts or materials in. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products.\n\nMANUFACTURING. Creating a wetsuit involves a lot of craftmanship. Compared to other textile products, wetsuit production requires many man-hours and can\u2019t be fully automatized with existing technology. We also aim to deliver a high quality product, so we take care of every single unit produced. This takes time and the real lead times might vary. That is why we prefer setting a realistic delivery date instead of promising unfeasible shipping dates. \n\nFULFILLMENT. 2 wetsuit colors. Women and Men models. 10 sizes each. The add-on. Several Rewards. This can potentially be a hell of combinations to prepare all orders. Anticipating this challenge we have partnered with experts in the matter. Nonetheless, delays on receiving all order items might push back the shipping of your order.\n\nSHIPPING. Global shipping and warehousing logistics are mind-boggling. Hence we outsource that stuff to experts. But even the experts aren't immune to weather, port congestion, the Suez Channel being blocked by a vessel and other uncontrollable factors.\n\nPANDEMIC. These days is harder than ever to make accurate estimates. The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted any well planned project. We are slowly getting better worldwide, but we can\u2019t, unfortunately, promise things could go backwards anytime.\n\nWe will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our beloved customer. \nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal. Join our journey to protect the oceans by clicking the \u2018Back This Project\u2019 button at the top of the page, or by helping us spread the word by sharing our page.",
  "WhiteClouds has created two projects on Kickstarter before the 3D Marscape campaign. The two Kickstarter campaigns were both fulfilled on schedule. We communicate with backers at least once a month through regular updates. We take our backers' commitments incredibly seriously and have since we launched our first campaign in 2013. While backing a Kickstarter will never be totally free of risk, backing a WhiteClouds Kickstarter is as close as it gets. \n\nThis project is unique. We will need to make some critical investments in machinery and training to fulfill the campaign; however, these investments will be sufficiently covered by the funding goal we've set. The designs and production processes have been exhaustively planned and tested by us, and the dedicated craftsmen who will be carrying it out are trained and ready to go if the project is successful. All the manufacturing will be taking place here in the United States at the WhiteClouds manufacturing facilities.\n\nWork has already been done to source materials. As the project goes on and we can determine the scale, we'll begin finalizing material procurement and placing preliminary orders as we're able. We have planned for success and do not anticipate any issues sourcing hardware, lumber, packaging, or any other materials.\n\nWhiteClouds has its own in-house shipping department. We have been shipping delicate 3D printed materials for eight years and have learned all of the tricks-of-the-trade to reduce any shipping problems. Final delivery will be handled by standard couriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc.). With the challenges of COVID, we will do our best to make sure your package arrives safely and on time, but many times that is entirely out of our control. \n\nMarscapes is an unprecedented project for us, and we believe it to be a game-changer. We've done everything we can to set ourselves up for success. The most considerable remaining risk is wholly out of our hands -- whether or not our funding goal is met and the project is successful -- that part is entirely up to you!",
  "This is the first ever kickstarter project for us. We knew what it will take to bring this project to a successful completion and has worked tirelessly in the last months. \nAt Freemax, producing top quality products is the foundation of our work. We take sustainability seriously. We don\u2019t like that products get replaced year after year. We think that products should be purchased just once. So all our products are designed to last. With that said, We have vigorously tested each part to ensure that our product holds up under the mostrigorous industrial settings. It is a time-consuming and expensive process but we wanted tomake something exceptional that could be passed down for many generations to come. We create tools and products that empower people to take charge with the simple turn of a wrench or twist of a screwdriver. We want to move tools forward, and bring about the next generation of useful instruments.\n\nThe only risk we foresee would be shipping a little bit later than the estimated dates shown if the project is extremely over-funded. We have planned in extra time but if a production or shipping delay happens, we will update everyone know about it ASAP.

I also machine the body of the wallets and assemble the final product in house, so that is entirely in my control and I have the process streamlined.\n\nHowever when scaling anything there are risks and challenges.  The first production run was fairly hands on and time intensive.  The production method for fulfilling the Kickstarter orders will be more hands off and automated.  The only risks and challenges will be in automating the manufacturing methods - CNC machining multiple wallet bodies at once rather than one at a time, and bending the covers with a press brake rather than a hand brake.\n\nI have experience with both of these techniques, so any challenges I face will surely be overcome with some thought and effort.",
  "Please help me acheive my goals and help me reach my dreams the best way possible. For me its nearly impossible making it to the big screens espically comming from a place where im from which is known as \"Evergreen\" in Santa Ana City. Its been a tough road and a lot of obsticles i have fight and learn to survive street wise with me, myself and i. however, i do get support from some of my close friens and my mom sometimes gives me cash but rarely. My family gives me very little support besides my mom since she is the only person I have at this very moment. My father past away back in August 6th 2012 from lung cancer. it was weird because it all happen so quick, i remember the doctor saying he only had a week to live and 2 hours later after telling us that he had only one week it actually bacame 12 HOURS to live. i dont think people understand whats that is like to hear that being told to all in one day.Now it's August 7th 2015 and its been really tough not having a father figure to guide me the right way...one thing that i got to achieve before he died was that My father always wanted to me to graduated from high school and he wanted to see my diploma and that its real so thats what i got and show him i work hard and earn it myself by going to school from 5:00am to 6:00 pm just to make up for all the missing credits i had to make up for during senior year. I'm proud that i made him happy and showed him that i at least listen to him. However, graduating from the high school (Century HIGH SCHOOL) where i went to was nearly impossible for many students during my years because of all the bad stuff that was going on during my years in school and all the teenagers bad habits such as ditching school, not doing HW or Project assignments and stupid trends like dropping out of school before senior year..Well all i could say is that im glad i mange to graduated and got educated because its actually paying off now with all my liturature skills that plays a big role in my writting and rapping that im doing. Anyway yea everything is getting harder and tougher without my dad help and  now its been about 3 years without him and its difficult managing to take care myself and my mother which is currently still smoking too and on top of that my older brother which is death and mute so for me i got a lot on my plate being the man of the house i have to make sure each day and night theres no problems for the next day. For me to get money i have to sell random things on craiglist and Ebay since i dont have a job besides working at home but lately it hasn't been working out so great. The reason why I choose to work at home is because my mother is getting older and im afriad the same thing will happen to her like what happen to my dad. Also my brother also needs a helping hand around the house too and outside the house because there are people that thinks he isnt handicap and fools around with him and i have to make sure nobody robs him or tries to do anything stupid towards my family. I do have a girlfriend but she is in jail.. I'm afraid for my mother sake because I live in a well known neighborhood full of gangsters and cops everyday and most times they think im gang affliated so they pull me over and question me for the stupidest reason but im not a gang member and i dont know the answer of anything that they ask so they get me confuse for somebody else most of the time. thats why i try to avoid problems by wearing skinny jeans and also because i like wearing skinny jeans. im not a faget or whatever its just my style and i try not to discriminate anybody in anyway. im the most harmless person anyone could ever meet in life.",
  "RISKS - Apart from the immediate risk of impending bankruptcy and selling my virginity online, the main risk is with ending up with a half-a**ed productions due to a lack of funding. Like Sinatra at the end of Von Ryan\u2019s Express - So close yet so far.\nI\u2019ve done this before. I sold a kidney to fund an album, Antidote,  years ago, and it was just horrific as I was then an amateur using a gifted amateur. (I feel sorry for the songs. \"Why did we get him?\", they cry.)\nI was then scammed in 2017 when I was conned by a fake producer in Shikoku, Japan who said he was had a world-class recording studio. In the boonies.  He had no online presence or credential but I convinced myself he was eccentric genius living in the great outdoors as I was so desperate to finish songs for the 10-week World Tour that summer... but he turned out just to be a kid's English teacher in a one-horse town. His world-class studio was a bedroom with a cardbox box sound barrier. he then made me hire a mountain cabin so we could \u201crecord 24/7\u201d but then invited his family to stay for holiday while we were there. A  total scam. I would advise anyone to really do due diligence correctly when recording,\nI lost all band funds but learned a hard lesson and  have since only used real bonafide world-class pro studios and musicians:\nKarma Studios (Jamiroquai, The Libertines/Babyshambles)\nKrabi Road Studios - Incognito\nThe producer of Time to Live Again hired John 'JR' Robinson ( called \"one of the most recorded drummers in history\") who played drums on Michael Jackson tunes. I mention this solely to show we are mot messing around and think the song deserves the best.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robinson_(drummer)\n(Disclaimer: Apart from a nice voice, a golf glove, and the above, this is all I have in common with MJ. Ouch! Sorry MJ. You were a true natural)\nSo I am convinced I have the right sound this time. If you listen to the three finished demos above then you will see what I mean. Once they are mastered they will be ready for airplay.\nCHALLENGES \nMain challenge is not having enough money to master then market music correctly. The music business is pretty much a closed shop, a monopoly, where only the signed artists get airplay. We used to get only  get 1% of the music out there played as it is run by the music industry. Spotify has evened the playing field so with good production and some marketing it is possible to get some traction if not signed.  However, you are still up against the machine - For example, at one pro studio, a huge band came in with an entourage of about 20 people, took one night to set up drums, did 8 takes the next day, done. Total cost about 5000 USD - for a single drum track. Another band spent 100 000 USD on album recordings and were just a mid-level band famous in their own country. Not made it internationally. If you are not signed it is like playing the PGA with a baseball bat. Not an excuse, but when you are up against top producers, massive budgets and marketing campaigns, inside contacts, it is hard to get to the sunlight. Even small things like instruments count -  a 5000 USD guitar is literally gonna sound than a 500 dollar one. All I have on par is what I can control - my voice and my lyrics - so gonna use them to the max, and which I why I put my heart and soul into my music.",

  "Every documentary carries risks and challenges, \"The Great Whale\" will take at least 18 months to complete and could take longer if we find there is more to the story or Michael's efforts need a bit more time to come to fruition.

For those also new to Kickstarter: You will NOT be charged before the end of the fund period. If the project is funded you will be charged on October 30th. However, if the goal is not reached, you will not be charged anything but also won't receive any of the pledge rewards! So feel free to back the project since you can always choose to remove your pledge if you wish to do so. Fortunately, I have a manufacturer that I have worked with before, so I am confident about the quality of the pins that you will be receiving. Of course, if any problems arise along the way, I will be in contact with all of you.\n\n\u2606 If you don't complete the survey at the end or send your mailing address you will not receive your pledge reward and will have to reach out to me via email.\n\n\u2606 Designs for the pins may not look exactly like the mockup.\n\n\u2606 Colors may look slightly different on screen than in person.\n\n\u2606 Some packages from the manufacturer may include some defects causing a need for more orders. delaying shipping.

  "REWARDS\nThe final pins may vary slightly from the designs shown here.  Every single pin is handmade, there is expected to be minor defects or flaws. Standard grade pins will be used to fulfill pledges and these pins may have minor defects that are only visible under extremely close inspection. Pins with more noticeable flaws are lower grade and will NOT be used to fulfill pledges. Actual color or size of the pins may differ a little from the descriptions, but I'm confident that any differences will be minimal. I am working closely with a established manufacturer, to ensure smooth fulfillment of all the orders. \n\nTIMELINE\nDelays in shipping and production of pins may occur when creating enamel pins. This may happen because of production errors and manufacturing defects. If there are any delays, all backers will be immediately updated! \n\nFULFILLMENT\nI will update here on Kickstarter and Instagram so that backers have an idea when their rewards will be shipped out (you can change the shipping details if needed up until then). Please double check your address to reduce the chance of a package being lost! Once a package is mailed, it is out of my control but I will do my best to assist and accommodate for any lost packages for TRACKED shipment. We always encourage you to upgrade by adding TRACKING to the shipping with a small fee for peace of mind.\n\nADDITIONAL FEES\nBackers outside of the SG are responsible for any and all customs fees, import taxes, VAT, GST, or other additional costs associated with importing goods into their country and those costs are NOT included in their pledge or shipping cost.\n\nREFUNDS & CANCELLATIONS\nOnce the campaign is complete, refunds or cancellations will not be issued for any reason. Please fully read over the campaign, and only pledge if you understand & accept the above estimated timeline and risks!",

  "My name is Larry Williams, the CEO of Camel Gang. I was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. I grew up in a neighborhood of North Memphis known as New Chicago. It consistently ranks in the top 10 most dangerous neighborhoods in America. It is a poverty stricken neighborhood overrun with gang violence and drugs. One in eight people living there will commit a violent crime or go to prison. I attended Manassas High School and was a part of the high school football team, which gained notoriety in the Academy Award winning documentary \u201cUndefeated\u201d. I graduated from MHS in 2011. I had no real means to attend college, so I decided to join the military.\r\n \r\nI joined the United States Army in 2011 at the age of 19. I was deployed on my first tour to Kuwait in 2013, leaving behind my girlfriend and newborn boy. On my first tour overseas with eight months passed and three months to go, I was feeling depressed and home sick. I missed my girlfriend and my son drastically. My son was only a few months old when I was deployed. The dry sand of Kuwait and the intense heat, over 130 degrees some days, began to wear on me. On the 10th day of July, 2013, my squadron leader gave us the word that we would be escorting a convoy of trucks through the Alseen Desert back to the Forward Operations Base.\r\n \r\nWhile out on the mission, we came across a single shepherd who had been herding camels across the desert. Each camel carried a load of about 70 pounds on its back. The shepherd told us that they had gone several days without food or water. He then began to praise the camels. He explained that the beauty of a camel is its ability to endure what\u2019s around it and to keep going. The camels never give up and \u201ccarry the load\u201d no matter what conditions they encounter.\r\n \r\nAt that moment, I began to look at my life differently. I realized that giving up is not an option. That I had to \u201ccarry the load.\u201d I had to keep going as the camel does. I realized I needed to continue the pursuit of my dreams by making the right decisions in my life. As soon as I got back to base, the camel was still on my mind. To help me remember, I had a camel logo embroidered on all of my personal belongings. I had my socks, caps, t-shirts, polos, and everything I had embroidered to keep me focused.\r\n \r\nMy whole unit decided they wanted the embroidered camel also. At that moment, we became the Camel Gang. I have since spread the word through the Camel Gang line that in life we all must \u201ccarry the load.\u201d Most of all I am proud to offer The Camel Gang line of Apparel. \r\nWe serve to honor the millions of men and women of the US Military and the millions of under privileged people who are out their trying hard everyday to \"Carry The Load.",

The daily news website is being funded on our own dime, which when coupled with a magazine with illustrators and contributors gets rather pricey. But we're doing this out of a love for the genre and gaming in general, which is why we've gone on for as long as we have without funding.\r\n\r\nWe may not get the subscription numbers to maintain this magazine over the long-term. As with all things on ARPGamer, we're doing this because we love the genre, gaming, and writing. Without adequate subscription levels, the diversity of our content may faulter and the magazine could potentially just become an ARPG guide book. Which, as fun as that still sounds, we'd prefer to keep with our current diversity of content.\r\n\r\nGamers may simply prefer the daily news website over the magazine. Simply put, it's cheaper and makes more sense to just visit our website to get your daily fix of ARPG news. To address this, we're trying to generate more unique and exclusive content to warrant the expenditure of a magazine. People obviously won't buy the magazine if it has no standalone value that the website doesn't already address. But we're pretty confident that the magazine will create value that complements the website without duplicating the same kind of content.\r\n\r\nOne final risk is that too many ARPGs are set to be released in 2013 and we'll get caught up playing them all. Let\u2019s face it, a lot of good game titles are coming out soon and there are only so many hours in the day for us to choose between playing and writing.\r\n\r\nOkay, fine, if you insist, we\u2019ll keep writing when we could be playing.",
  "We've truly grown over the past year and a half and are excited to expand Off Switch Magazine in 2013. While we still have a ton to learn about the process of creating, publishing, and distributing a quarterly magazine, we feel confident in our ability to make it happen. Trial and error are inevitable and so are mistakes, but by being honest and forthright with our backers we intend to keep lines of communication open and things running smoothly.\r\n\r\nIf for unforeseen reasons we raise the necessary money but are unable to print our spring 2013 as planned, we will notify all backers and readers right away. In this situation we would hold on to the money and use it to print the summer volume.",

  "The Artist\u2019s Challenge: When I asked a professional in the business directly about making an album, this is what I got: \"Do one song at a time. Make this album like it's your first and your last, don't hold back. Have a deadline, but don\u2019t rush the process of creativity.\u201d It costs $2,000 to $10,000 to produce a song (the average budget is $200k from a major label). \r\nFrom an artist\u2019s standpoint, I think that money does guarantee quality: the Challenge is getting the best performance from the most talented people, from their Hearts, not just showing up and thinking that it\u2019s good enough when it can be better. Interpretations, what I hear and what others hear in their imaginations, they are not the same. This is a challenge that I hope will manifest itself above and beyond what we can imagine just as individuals. As an artist, a big challenge is finding that new sound without swaying to the industry\u2019s demands of Their sound and images, of becoming something I\u2019m not. Which means finding out who I am is a part of the journey.\r\n\r\nThe Challenge of Quality Distribution is no small feat. Nationwide physical distribution is the next step after creating the album.\r\n\r\nThe Risk: Not doing it. Not ever hearing these great songs fully produced in a professional manner. Not moving on to the next level as a professional. There\u2019s always a risk when someone dares to change, to grow, to dream. This path for me is a huge risk in my life and my future. It\u2019s all about the music, because creating music is a life style that's different than a working class hero\u2019s. It\u2019s always a risk in being different, and there's always a risk when you want to be real, when you want to just be you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget\r\n\r\n(Bare-bones minimum)\r\n\r\n$2,000 per song    x 10 songs  =  $20,000\r\n$2,500 mastering the songs\r\n$2,500 initial CD distribution\r\n$2,000 copyright, legal, IT- social network media\r\n$2,000 videography\r\n$1,000 promotions\r\n$1,000 artwork & graphic designs\r\n$4,000 fulfillment of pledge rewards + fees (Kickstarter, amazon, etc.)\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nTOTAL  :  $35,000",
  "Touring Europe in 2015 is a very different equation! Times have changed significantly with the economic challenges most countries in the world are facing. This affects touring internationally with rising transportation costs as well as a variety of other expenses including the \"backline\" required for most USA bands to tour including the rental of instruments like acoustic bass and drums. Traveling by air makes it impossible to bring these aforementioned large instruments on the airplane. Another considerable challenge is housing particularly on off days. Now a days the bottom line is what comes in must match what goes out, and meeting this requirement can be VERY challenging indeed! Fortunately, there is a bedrock of support provided by my company \"Cultural Odyssey\" which at least guarantees a decent fee for the musicians in order to tour. If the expenses are greater than the income the musicians do not suffer! Cultural Odyssey takes the hit! This is an important policy that myself and my company, Cultural Odyssey, is and always will be commited to! Take care of the artists first and everything else will follow! Help us to meet the challenges stated above and it will be very much appreciated!",

  "As this episode has already been filmed there is very minimal risk - if any - to it not being completed. Any potential risk may be found only in the continuation of this project, as we seek funding from grants and organisations to begin producing more episodes in other locations. The goal of this campaign is to enable us to complete a pilot episode as we feel this is essential in securing further funding. However, if we were to exceed our target significantly, this could allow us to move on and begin producing future episodes sooner.",
  "Funding! This is really my biggest problem when it comes to making the zine. I plan to release it in both physical and digital form both with a few differences between the two. The digital form should be cheap to maintain but I want to photocopy physical issues in the tradition of punk zines which can get a little pricey. I want to distribute them freely as I don't care to make money off of it but the reality is I work a minimum wage job and pay for college out of pocket so funds are scare. I plan on limited runs of either 50 or 100 for the first few issues until I can get a financial foot to stand on. This kickstarter is meant to make sure I have enough funds for the launch and I'm hoping to have enough funds to self-publish the rest for the life of the zine. If the kickstarter isn't fulfilled in time I still plan to release the January/February issue, but it'll be as they're requested.\r\n\r\nAs I'm a retro gamer I also plan to start an in-house library of retro-games to be lent to fans. Think of it as gamefly for the N64. Any excessive funds(funds after 200$) will go towards getting this collection going.",
  "The main risk that we may face during production is centered around the effect of the pandemic on our suppliers. For example, we recently had to change sourcing due to our previous supplier having been impacted by the crisis. We have a contingency plan to address any such situation should it arise. \n\nFurthermore, to mitigate risks associated with the delivery schedule, we have attributed additional time for each step of production, to account for any possible delays.",

  "Our biggest challenge is how do we produce a great documentary about early football with a relative paucity of moving images to help tell the story? The simple answer is a) we produce a presenter-led film which sees us visit historical places of interest, and b) we get super creative and resourceful with the plentiful still images we have, which includes some of the oldest football photographs in the world, some of which are being exclusively colourised for the film.",

  "As this is our first enamel pin project, we'd like to make sure the designs are manufacturable. We have already received the samples of the poison dart frog and the White's tree frog, and the other designs have been sent to the factory for quotations as well. \n\nTo better represent the appearances of the frogs, we will use silkscreen printing to depict their colorations, so there will be no awkward metal outlines to hold in the enamel colors. However, there might be unwanted displacement in the silkscreens. We have ordered 10 samples of the White's tree frog to see if this will potentially be a significant issue in mass production, and we assure our backers we will ship out only the satisfactorily manufactured pins. In unlucky circumstances where the silkscreens in most sample pins are unsatisfactory, some details, specifically the highlights around the eyes and the mouths of the frogs, may be removed. \n\nThe colors of the actual pins may differ slightly from the designs. Delays in manufacture are also possible. Though, as we have already begun the manufacture of the poison dart frog and the White's tree frog, we have built a trusted relationship with the manufacturer. We are confident in resolving any issues that might come up.\n\nLastly, there might be delays in shipping due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

  "As with any project, the completion of this documentary isn't without risks.  In Guatemala, there are concerns about safety and security. Travel using public transportation is complicated in the rural areas and insecure throughout the country. In locations where competition for resources and  opposition to outsiders is strong, we risk attracting negative attention by arriving with a camera and crew.  To mitigate these risks, we will travel using private transportation, always accompanied by community members, local officials, and/or security.\r\n\r\nAnother risk to the completion of the problem is that the community members either aren't interested in talking about the subject, don't see the trash as a problem, or are fearful about expressing themselves on camera.  These issues are always a risk when filming a documentary but we believe we are well-placed to overcome them since we will be working through people of confidence to the communities and will never arrive alone or without precedent.\r\n\r\nFinally, the biggest risk we face, has nothing to do with the production of the documentary but about it's reception. Upon screening the documentary, we risk negative attention from companies producing single-use products and from the government who has yet to assign financial resources to the problem.

As the design is sent to my manufacturer, it is sometimes requested that slight changed are made, this is to allow the final product to be the best it can be.

There are two people behind this project: God and the Editor-in-Chief, who is also the photographer, writer, graphic and web designer, marketing coordinator and publicist. Thankfully, schooling and achieved degrees in these areas made wearing the many hats a bit easier but COVID made the success of getting the product in hand challenging. Creating an entire magazine of 100+ pages without a large team is complex because there are a LOT of moving parts with steps that can't be missed and expenses that can't be ignored. This project is a necessity for the Black community and the challenges ahead will never stop the goal to get message out! The biggest challenge is finances to pay for legalities, digital marketing and promotions, production, future contract employee salaries, community donation projects, etc. These challenges aren't setbacks but they are hiccups that need community funding support.

  "The Post Office trial is due to begin on 5 November 2018. Even if this kickstarter reaches its target, I will make a loss. I am just about capable of swallowing that loss through my savings and/or by taking on professional commissions around this story. I am hoping to get over-funded.\r\n\r\nIf I can't raise the target funding every penny pledged returns to my backers. As a result I will not cover every day of the trial and will need to fill my diary with non-Post Office related work. That's why I'm running the kickstarter to 15 October rather than the start of the trial. If I fail to raise \u00a33000 before 15 October I've still got a couple of weeks to find alternative paid work in November.\r\n\r\nIf, thanks to your generosity, this kickstarter reaches its \u00a33000 target, the risks as I see them are this:\r\n\r\n1) The trial does not happen. \r\n\r\nThis could be because the Post Office might settle before the trial starts or the subpostmasters could withdraw their claim. If either happens before the fundraising period ends, you will not be required to honour your pledges.\r\n\r\nIf the trial collapses or the claim is settled between the end of the fundraising period and start of the trial, I will refund any honoured pledges in full and cancel the requirement to pay all un-honoured pledges. I will swallow any fees imposed by kickstarter to ensure everyone gets what they donated.\r\n\r\n2) The trial is postponed. \r\n\r\nIf the trial is postponed, I will attend the trial during the rescheduled dates and report it accordingly. I currently have nothing in my diary which can't be moved to accommodate this.\r\n\r\n3) The trial starts, then collapses or is settled. \r\n\r\nEven if the trial collapses or is settled in its first week there should be enough evidence (both written and spoken) put into the public domain to write daily blog posts throughout November. I'll also investigate the aftermath, speaking to the key players and widening the journalistic reach of the project by interviewing participants, legal observers, interested parties, MPs and other influential figures in the story. You will get your money's worth. In this way all backers at every level will have their rewards fulfilled.\r\n\r\n4) I fall ill or suffer a family emergency and am unable to fulfil my commitment, partially or wholly, in person. \r\n\r\nIf I am required, through illness or any other unforseen circumstance, to absent myself from court for one day or more, I will arrange for a trained journalist to attend court on my behalf and compile a court report in my absence. I will then ensure that court report is published on www.postofficetrial.com. If I fall ill before the trial starts I will arrange for a trained journalist to attend the trial on my behalf. If I fall so ill I am unable to communicate or I die, I have arranged that you will get your money back. No one can predict the future, but if it helps, I haven't missed a day's work for several years.\r\n\r\n5) Legal restrictions stop the reporting of the trial. \r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that the judge may order some elements of the trial not be reported. This is extremely unlikely. It is almost impossible to imagine a situation whereby the proceedings of the whole trial would be deemed unreportable. If this happens it would arguably be a bigger story than the trial itself, and I will honour the rewards in the same way proposed in point 3) above - covering the story as fully as possible.",

The team is confident we have taken the right steps to mitigate risks such as shipment delays or product defects. Over the past 9 months we have been prototyping, testing and refining to make sure the final product we deliver to our backers far exceeds expectations. The team at Zootility Health will update you regularly on progress. If there are any issues, we promise to communicate with you every step of the way!",
  "We're confident in our ability to operate a successful business. However, these are some potential hurdles we anticipate:\r\nBeing full-time college students, it's difficult to accumulate the sufficient funding to cover all necessary expenses (hence Kickstarter). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're happy to answer questions!\r\nContact: greekstreetmadison@gmail.com",

  "As a student film, we are working within a relatively modest budget to bring our artistic vision to fruition. Adventures & Outings is a program that is close to the hearts of our crew members. We would like to be able to tell the story of Lori Gray and the group to the best of our ability and with the help of our backers (you!) we believe we can.\r\n\r\nThere are risks in any filmmaking project; losing footage, commuting long distances, equipment failure, and technical difficulties are only a few. However, the Adventures & Outings crew has extensive previous filmmaking experience, and we are confident that we have taken appropriate safety measures and have the knowledge to successfully make this documentary as professional and efficient as possible.",
  "The truth is there are any number of fluke things that could come up and complicate this project. There could be be hurdles in getting the piece booked at venues in the US and abroad. As with any project, there could be some unforeseen legal complications. I am a determined and tenacious person though. I have been making films for almost 20 years, and I've also made several other live documentaries before, so I am confident that I could overcome any reasonable challenges that might arise.",
  "The biggest risk would not be getting funded to the basic 20-30 minute film. Kickstarter is an 'all or nothing' crowdfunding platform where if I don't raise my goal, then I won't get the funds. In the worst case scenario that I'm not able to raise the funding goal, I would still try and produce a 5-10 minute film to get something out to the public.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I do believe that we'll will meet our goal, and beyond. If our stretch goals are met, then there will be risks of traveling internationally to the third world with expensive camera gear and hard drives. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, biggest challenge will be to compile all the footage into a compelling narrative. However, I believe that the filmmaking team and the stories are more than up to the challenge, and trust in faith that the project will be a success.",
  "Keeping the project going on once we are done with the first edition is our major challenge. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, reaching other international locations, getting in contact with freelancers and finding external financing suppose other important obstacles.",
  "The limited time we have to ask for your help means that we are still looking at a few cart options. There is a slight chance that none of the three owners will sell their cart to us, although we believe that to be unlikely. In this case, we do have an option of renting a cart for the The First Annual Champaign Craft Beer Festival. Backers who have chosen hotdog party packages will have an option of another type of catered event (bbq, ramen, etc.)\r\n\r\nAlso, we are still negotiating a contract with the The First Annual Champaign Craft Beer Festival and in the process of completing our proposal to the Champaign Urbana Public Health Department. The chances of us not attending the fest are possible, but once again we believe unlikely. In this case, we will still purchase the hotdog cart and the rewards to our party package supporters will be satisfied; however, the half-off ticket holders will be given a voucher for any future event.",
  "Defending such a groundbreaking visual experience (that dates back from a 1956 film so you can see how new and innovative we are trying to be) wasn't a piece of cake. Nowadays most interviews are what we call \"talking heads\" (someone talks to you sitting on a chair and archival footage comes to illustrate his or her points) and that didn't seem very entertaining to us. But because we chose a more original take on things we hit a few setbacks trying to locate international vendors and distributors who couldn't really envisioned what we had in mind (i.e. a technique that has been around for at least 60 years). That means even if we can finish the film by December, we might not be able to release it just yet. Though we will try our best to get it to you before anyone else.\r\n\r\nThe other challenges are obviously related to filmmaking. Exterior locations need permits, good weather, and are subject to a long list of hazardous problems that could ensue from equipment fails to misplaced crew. Though this crew has more than 500 filming experience combined (200 from the director alone) so we know our stuff. We know how to prepare and how to get back with the images we have in mind. And that's exactly what we'll do if you support us.",
  "Imperial probe droids. Bounty hunters. Hutts. The galaxy is filled with risks and challenges.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we're a seasoned production team with a decade of documentary filmmaking experience and solid production record under our belts. \r\n\r\nTiming is always the biggest challenge for micro-budget projects, the less funding we have, the longer it can take to get things done. So while we hope to keep to our production schedule, life and budgeting can find a way to throw a hydrospanner in the works. We'll keep supporters posted on our progress so you'll always know what's going on.",
  "We know how much we need to pay the music rights people, which is the biggest hurdle, and we have negotiated reasonable rates. Once funded, everyone will be paid, we will enter some festivals and have the DVDs made. Aside from the DVDs and Tee Shirts (which we'll order when we know sizes and numbers), all rewards are in hand and will be delivered as promised.",
  "We\u2019ve both been in the restaurant business since we were teenagers, so we are intimately familiar with the risks inherent in this industry. Challenges to the success of our project include truck performance issues, weather conditions, location limitations, customer preference, and customer awareness. \r\n\r\nTruck Performance-\r\nWithout the truck we can\u2019t serve food, so keeping the truck up and running remains paramount to our operation. Our truck will undergo regular preventative maintenance to maintain consistent performance - no surprises. We hope to invest in a truck that can run on biodiesel in warm weather to reduce emissions and expenses.\r\n\r\nWeather-\r\nWeather effects all food trucks. We love barbecue because it is truly a year-round cuisine - just as good on hot summer days as on a blustery winter night. Working with tap and cocktail rooms ensures year-round customers, and we plan on sending Toph inside to get orders and deliver food right to the table so our customers can stay warm and dry (just another step in top-notch customer service that sets us apart!). \r\n\r\nLocation limitations-\r\nThe food truck industry is still relatively new to the Twin Cities, and it is possible that public opinion could sway and lead to more strict zoning, which would impact our ability to operate consistently. This is why we will focus on partnering with businesses, taprooms and cocktail rooms with private parking lots for the majority of operating days to avoid the race for the few street spots in Downtown Minneapolis (and the associated risk of tickets, fines and lost business). We will become members of the MN Food Truck Association and join other food truck operators in advocating for zoning and legal statutes that support mobile food vendors in Minneapolis and the greater Twin Cities area.\r\n\r\nCustomer preference and awareness-\r\nWith so many options for food trucks, how will Bark and the Bite stand out? We know no one else is doing the kind of craft barbecue that we bring to the table - our processes, experience and passion set us apart. Our menu features vegetarian and gluten-free options to make barbecue accessible to as many people as possible. We will use social media extensively to share specials, promote our menu and share our location. Partnering with local breweries and distilleries will allow us to build regulars, create unique and one-of-a-kind pairings and operate year round. We will also be available for catering and special events.",
  "Fortunately, with the truck being already secured and in use as a food truck, there is little work to be done. The Health Department loves the truck. Although there are a ton of great events and markets in NWI, it may be a challenge finding outlets for the truck. The truck is a little older, but it's in great shape. If, in the unfortunate event that we lose the truck (accident, malfunction, etc), we hope that we will have in that time built up enough of a following to either acquire a new truck or fix the existing truck.",
  "Considering this is a QuickStarter (shorter and simpler version of a normal KickStarter campaign), we minimized the risks involved throughout this project.

We have already manufactured functional prototypes and developed a sound schedule in collaboration with our production partner. As soon as our campaign\u2019s funding target has been achieved, our production partner will launch production. At this time, we cannot rule out shipping delays due to COVID-19.\n\nWe will keep our supporters informed with regular project updates.\n\nPlease note that if you live outside the EU, you will be liable for any applicable customs fees and VAT.\n\nThank you very much for your support!

Your donations will make it easier to drop everything and capture authentic moments in real time.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I've found various folks along the way, from filmmakers to editors, to storytellers, and production managers, who are excited for this project and happy to help me see it to completion.

  "This is our 6th Kickstarter project, so it\u2019s safe to say that we know we\u2019ve got what it takes to bring this project to successful completion.\n\nThe only risk we foresee is the chance of shipping a little bit later than the estimated dates, due to the project being extremely over-funded. It\u2019s not a bad risk to have! So we\u2019ve factored in extra time to account for this, as large-scale productions involve considerably more planning.\n\nWe\u2019ll provide you with regular project updates, so should any production or shipping delays occur, we can let you know about it ASAP.\n\nPlease note that the flashlight shown in images and video on this page is our functional prototype, and we reserve the right to make minor design alterations to all elements as needed. The dimensions may need to be adjusted during mass production to ensure we produce the best flashlight we can, for everyone.",

  "This isn't our first rodeo. Our team has been in the apparel business since 2013 and with our production partners, we have decades of experience bringing high-quality outdoor clothing to market. Our factory partner is ready to go, with capacity booked on their line waiting for our order to start production. We've gone through a full sampling and testing process with these pieces to ensure the final product will be to our exact spec.\n\nWhile we've done this before, and we've done our best to prepare, there can still be delays in production from things like fabric getting held up in customs and delays at the factory. At his previous company, our founder created the customer service processes and he prides himself on being transparent and helpful to supporters. We will be straightforward with any delays and do our best to be communicative and supportive through the process.\n\nWith your support, we can make this happen and continue a brand focused on creating high-quality clothing for people who want to own less!\n\nCheers,\n\nThe LIVSN team",

Of course, funding is tight and there's a lot involved with making this possible, but I am committed to making this work accessible and inspiring.",
  "The main risk is not getting it published, but a successful kickstarter should help. Not finding 100 people willing to participate is a potential risk, but unlikely. Not getting enough funding could mean the book is just the hopes and dreams of 100 people local to me, which won't be as good as if there were more international participants. Other than that, the other risk is ensuring all backers receive their rewards and are happy!",
  "All the illustrations are complete, I have a reliable printer in place and have already received a sample deck. All card images are of the sample deck. So excluding any totally unforeseen issues, there should be no problems with production. \nThe only potential issue will be with the shipping and the global corona situation. Decks are only due to ship in June/July, so we should hopefully be through the worst of it by then. The worst case scenario I can envision is that shipping is delayed a month or so because of the postal service having issues with the virus. That said, all international backers will have their decks sent tracked and local UK decks will be Signed For delivery. So again, I can't see there being a problem.\n\nPlease be aware, as screens vary, deck colours may differ from how you see it in the photos on your device.",

  "As with my last successful Kickstarter project, I will provide all backers with a monthly update that includes progress and highlights, as well as any challenges or anticipated setbacks.\r\n\r\nThe two most difficult areas of this project are the nature of participatory storytelling and technology development.\r\n\r\nI believe that if this Kickstarter is successfully funded, we will have a critical mass of wine enthusiasts, content creators and wine producers to tell a comprehensive story of a year in American wine.\r\n\r\nMy biggest concern in this area is not having coverage of all American wine regions, which I will attempt to overcome by working diligently with established wine associations for American wine regions and making the cost to participate fair and affordable for everyone.\r\n\r\nThere are always risks when working with technology: multiple devices, operating systems or other unknowns that are constantly changing. These risks will be mitigated by using widely adopted technologies (i.e. HTML5) and established standards for accessibility (i.e. W3C validation.) \r\n\r\nBy using existing platforms like Instagram, Wordpress, Vimeo and Twitter to submit content, we'll be reducing our technology cost burden while ensuring accessibility and ease of use for anyone, anywhere.",
  "History and Myth\r\n\r\nProfessor Buzzkill\u2019s greatest challenge is to show people how myths and misunderstandings about history are not just inaccurate. Myths can serve a useful purpose by providing an intriguing and entertaining way to examine the bigger issues in history connected to them. We can overcome this challenge by relying on our extensive research training in history, our vast network of fellow historians willing to help, and our charismatic style and approach to history and new media.\r\n\r\nTechnology\r\n\r\nThe second challenge is technical. We need professional help promoting the blog and getting it in front of the eyes of the right people in the media world. We also need help with the sound engineering of the podcast. We have plenty of media experience, but it\u2019s been on the speaking side of the microphone, not the production side. To overcome this challenge, we have already lined up some of the best podcast engineers and promoters around.

  "Similar to other websites, our website faces security related issues that impacts user experience. As the website\u2019s visibility has increased, hackers have made the platform a target for numerous and continued attacks and our goal initially is to hire out a security firm to increase security on the website.\r\n\r\nA secondary risk is being drowned out by other organizations with larger budgets, which will impact our contributors who seek a broad audience for their work. The challenge is marketing and reaching as a wide an audience as possible on a shoestring budget.

  "After walking around the Salton Sea, training missions, years of interviewing, filming and events, many film challenges (hard drive and drone crashes, wet & salty equipment, bug bites, blisters & heat exhaustion)... are luckily behind us. Throughout this process, the local residents have been so kind, helpful and determined to help us achieve our work by reducing many of those that came our way.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, we face significant risks regarding the Sea-to-Sea walk from the Sea of Cortez to the Salton Sea, following a path through Mexico and the Laguna Salada. This is a very remote area, and any accident this far from civilization could be serious.\r\n\r\nIn addition, starting January 1st of 2018, significant amounts of fresh water will be transferred to the Pacific coast - expediting the impending ecological, health, and economic disaster. \r\n\r\nThe challenge will be to get this film and the word out to as many people as possible, especially governing bodies and leaders throughout the southwest in order to pave the way for a sustainable future.

  "As our first international project it is a challenge to engage with a broader audience and hope Kickstarter will help us achieve this. We want to bring together as many individuals and organizations to the problem of construction in the tropical forests of the world.\r\n\r\nOur major risk is that the communities would feel threatened by us, as foreigners. To avoid this possible reaction, we have formed alliances with local NGOs and institutions that will guide our visits. In Cameroon we are working with the NGO CADAC, in Honduras with Mopawi and in Indonesia we are working with Architecture Sans Fronti\u00e8res to define a collaboration work with the Parahyangan Catholic University.\r\n\r\nWe know this project is ambitious but believe this documentation and research is necessary for future development projects around these sites. We are proud to be organizing this work from Peru, a developing country that is currently facing very harsh problems in terms of preserving our forests. \r\n\r\nThe timeline for the documentary film is one year of production with a film crew composed of six professionals working as volunteers.

  "From the moment I actually started this project, I have been met with challenges on a different level I've never experienced before. One significant challenge has been securing the funds to infer as a downpayment. Learning what I've been told from lenders as to what they expect to already be available in cash coming from me was a bit overwhelming at first; I happen to be a single, child-less Black Woman working in a male dominated industry that normally pays a little above minimum wage, and I also completely support myself without any outside assistance. On top of that, it seems that asking for monetary support from others is especially hard right now, due to the most recent global events of the past 3-4 years. I want people to believe in me and my product. I want people to know that whatever I receive from them as a donation and pledge will not just be received with the utmost gratitude, but that it will pay off for them as an investment long into the future. I offer the rewards that I do as proof of my confidence in my product, but more than physical compensation for pledges, I want people to know that my Food Truck represents more than just making money selling Sliders just to pay bills. It represents a dream of a future where I have the ability to give back to my family, friends, and community in ways I have never had the power to do before. It represents being able to make someone else's dreams come true, just like I am attempting to do. It represents what true hard work against all the odds can accomplish.

Equipped with a small grant from the Regional Arts and Culture Council, I am able to push toward the completion and am confident in the timeline I have created for 2017. \r\n\r\nWhile aspects may change, I am dedicated to completing this project this year. I am also required by my RACC grant to finish this project within 2017, which makes me accountable outside of my own desire to complete this film. \r\n\r\nMy composer, Andrew Klein, has been hard at work creating a score. The only pieces left are the sound design, color, and then final premiere (and all the marketing that comes with building an audience for that premiere). \r\n\r\nMy plan is to premiere the project in May - and if unknown obstacles arise, than this premiere date may get pushed into the summertime. That is the largest change that I can foresee to this film and I will keep everyone updates on the progress both through kickstarter and the film's facebook page.",

  "Folks, the book is written and in final stages of editing.  We have a reputable Australian based printing house and once editing is complete we are ready to go.\n\nThe major risk is shipping.  Australia Post is our national mailing service and as much as we love Aussie Post... well COVID-19 has put somewhat of a dampener on delivery times.  We have set the delivery date as May 2022 with this in mind.",
  "This is my first book, and thus it is entirely possible there will be unforeseen difficulties. Additionally, supply chain issues are everywhere right now. No matter what happens, I will communicate with all backers if the timeline needs to be adjusted.",
  "While $10,000 is our goal, we'd love to earn more, especially since inflation is looming last and prices are still getting higher for equipment. So, at this point, budgeting is approximate, but could get higher.",

  "",
  "Producing this book is a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal). I believe it can happen. The ideas have been kicking around in my head for more than a year, and each experience I have seems to point toward making it a reality. Because I will produce all pieces of this project, and because I haven\u2019t previously had time to devote to this large task, my goal for completion is the end of 2022. I plan to spend the bulk of my time designing, photographing, writing, and editing this book. To achieve my goal of getting high quality photos of EVERY PLANT in a range of aspects, I plan on having a dedicated day in the field each week for photography, after which I will organize shots into folders by plant, allowing for a library to build up throughout the seasons. \n\nI have created this challenge for myself because I truly believe this book is needed. As a supporter, you will be helping to provide the time and space for me to meet this challenge. Part of the fun for my supporters will be getting updates along the way, and witnessing the evolution of the book. Let\u2019s get after it together!",
  "The biggest challenge we might face is hiring ... from writers and editors to videographers and advertising managers.",
  "This is my second crowd funding campaign, and I have calculated ample time to order the decks and then send them out, I will keep you update on the process throughout, and of course everybody will be notified if there should be any delays.",
  "The print shop is definitely found and the offer stands. This printing company provides a high-quality offset printing (like my two artbooks before). I thought my project seriously and do not see any risks.",
  "Having a production always involves a risk. But I've tried minimizing the risks by setting the max capacity on 400 decks - to secure, that I can handle the production, ensure a high quality and deliver as scheduled.",
  "Updated: We secured a local printer who expects to have the first shipment of books for early bird backers by the first week of December. Remaining book rewards are expected to ship later in December. This will be ahead of schedule which is a relief. \n\nWe noticed a trend in fulfillment to overseas backers around fulfillment and tariffs. To minimize risk factors, at the moment we will only ship to North America, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nWe are looking into options for shipping the physical book to more countries. Updates will be posted soon. In the meantime a digital option is available.\n\nShipping has been a challenge since Covid. To protect the books and rewards we are taking extra packing protocols.",
  "Since the book is already done and the suppliers / collaborators are secured, I don't foresee a lot of risks for this project to be completed within the stated budget and timeline. The biggest risk will be delays with the typesetting process as well as delays with the printing / shipping during the holiday season. However, I am planning on shipping after Christmas anyways in order to avoid the congestion. If we end up being ready to ship before Christmas, I will update backers and proceed with the best course of action in light of holidays and shipping.",
  "While the written book is finished, publishing a book can be a lengthy process with many potential snags. Printing and shipping issues may delay receipt of the paperback and hardback copies, and formatting issues may delay receipt of ebook copies.\n\nAudiobook recording is a long process that must be done to rigorous specifications. It will take a long time for me to record and edit it, and even then it has to go through a testing process to make sure it sounds consistently good throughout. There may be snags along the way that I'm not aware of, so it may take even longer than I anticipate to get the audiobook done.\n\nI'll keep everyone posted on production and any potential hiccups that might come up. But, in the end, at least the book is finished!",
  "My only real concern is the timeline, getting the book printed and out to you asap. I would like to get it to you before the end of the year, but it all depends on how long the printer takes. So I've estimated that I will have it to you be February 2022. \n\nAs I write this the book is finished, I'm editing and finalizing the text and layout. So once this campaign is complete it will be ready to go to print. Any delays there after I will keep you updated on.",
  "The path to finishing this documentary and distribution on American public television is clear. My previous successful Kickstarter campaign has only funded a fraction of the overall cost, and I've made up the difference out of my own pocket. Thanks for your support, monetary or otherwise!",
  "No risks, the book's complete!",
  "Tout projet contient sa part de risque et d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements inattendus ! S'il devait arriver un petit \"couac\" (par exemple la production qui met plus de temps que pr\u00e9vu initialement) je te tiendrais inform\u00e9e ici et sur mon compte Instagram. Dans tout les cas, mon but c'est que tu aies tes petits tr\u00e9sors entre les mains au plus vite, alors compte sur moi pour \u00eatre r\u00e9active !",
  "A potential risk is that I might not be able to create the website until I have access to the money so now I am working on free website landing page. This will change as soon as I have the predispositions to create the full digital magazine.",
  "The results of all survey research are subject to \"sampling variation\" which means that the results should not be treated as exact. This applies to both the private surveys I intend to execute and the surveys run by government agencies that form official statistics. A consequence of this is that the data released from this project will not be an exact predictor of the data with which it correlates. There will always be some level of \"tracking error\" which is essentially random month-by-month. In addition, the project is contingent on third party services which may change in price or availability and if such changes make this project economically unviable it will be terminated without the return of used funds.",
  "There are inherent risks when printing anything but I'm confident in the shop I've chosen to do the printing.  They have a great track record of making nice books in a timely fashion.",
  "The biggest risk is the amount of time it will take to produce the rewards and deliver! All the artwork is already completed unless we reach the bigger stretch goal, which I gave myself an extra couple of weeks to complete if we do reach it.\n\nI'll likely be working with my main printing company that I've used for my last 2 books, and there haven't been any problems in the past. I've also selected suppliers for the rest of the rewards already.\n\nIf any hiccups come along, I'll be sure to update right away.",
  "The biggest challenge I have had with my Kickstarter campaigns is the time for rewards. If this project is funded like my last MAKE 100 I will email everyone with adjusted timelines. I have set the reward dates back quite a bit for this Kickstarter... but the hope is to get the art to you sooner!!",
  "The risk involved with this is weather.  If it is a cruddy weather day, people won't be on the lake.  If its amazing they will.  We plan to maximize the nice weather days.  We also plan to stick to a daily budget.  Plan for so many meals per day and once we are out we are out.  This will likely keep us from being stuck with unused inventory.",
  "The risks with this book, is that because the emotion is so raw, I think it could offend some people. But I want people to look past that and for them to learn from Sheree\u2019s story, from her words and the actions she took for her daughter and her whanau.\n\nThis book has definitely had it\u2019s challenges and has been quite the labour of love. It has taken me over a year to put together. I found it tough to read the hurt and pain that my friend was going through, then having to ask her for photos and sometimes I was worried, that I might be causing the feeling for her, perhaps, reliving the pain.  \nI would read parts of the blog, sit back and really be thankful for what I have, you just never know what might happen, so be thankful and know that there is love all around.\n\nLet us trace the steps of Azalia's journey right alongside Sheree.",
  "The film already has a TV distribution deal in place with Point du Jour International who have represented Carine and sold her films for many years. If we are successful with this Kickstarter we will be able to start the edit and get it in front of TV commissioners. \r\n\r\nHowever, we will need to raise at least an additional 20,000 euros from TV pre-sales or additional crowd funding to finish the edit to a TV ready standard. \r\n\r\nWhatever happens, even if we do not get that second phase of funding, we are committed to still finishing the film, albeit on a more lo-fi budget. We will then submit the film to festivals and international documentary workshops to make sure the film still achieves distribution, and backers will still receive online copies.",

  "We have done our upmost to mitigate the risks and challenges involved in a project of this kind. A lot of groundwork has been done to ensure that what we present to you today is something we can deliver, and in a timely fashion too. We believe communication is key to the success of any project, and we will be maintaining regular contact with our backers throughout the process. We have already delivered one journal to great acclaim, and we aim to do the same again this time.\n\nWhilst we hope we have seen the worst of things in 2020, we are still feeling the effects in 2021 and the most likely impact is the postal service. Delays to countries outside of the UK seem to be returning to some semblance of normalcy, and we're doing all we can to keep costs low whilst also delivering the level of service that we would expect ourselves.\n\nUltimately, our team is whole-heartedly committed to this project and open, honest and transparent communication will see to it that we achieve all that we set out to. Should any problems or delays occur along the way, we will be in touch.",
  "The main risks to this fund raising will be the time to print the book. We're in the publishing process and have completed the collaborative part of the work.",
  "The goal for the release of Dirty Girls Renewed is September 13, 2022. The biggest challenge to releasing it on time ... is time. One of the main reasons for this campaign is to raise funds to help support me while I take time to write. If the funds don't come in, I will still write Dirty Girls Renewed (that isn't changing!) but it may take longer than the projected timeframe. The good thing is I already have a strong outline prepared and have been thinking about these specific revisions for years. Writing will be the easy part of the project as long as there is time in the day to complete it. \n\nAnother challenge is a personal one\u2014my husband and I have been walking through infertility (which in itself isn't a cheap process) for two years. Between treatments and the waiting, it is a stressful experience. If I get pregnant sometime in the next year, that poses challenges too (though one I really want). I am ready to take on whatever God has and appreciate your support along the way.",
  "The risks for this project are pretty low! As I've run three similar projects already I have the framework to create this project more efficiently, and once the project has been funded all that needs to be done is production, printing, and delivery!",
  "Having worked on numerous independent films, we understand that there are risks and challenges. Luckily, the filming is wrapped and the editing is going smoothly, but we still have the hardest and most important piece to complete. We still need to reach our audience and that is where your generous support comes in. With your backing, we can secure the financing to finish the edit and get the film festival ready. \r\n\r\nThis film can make a real impact and open up the conversation about the hardships facing working mothers, but only with your help. Please donate and spread the word!",
  "The biggest challenge is hitting the goal deadline on Kickstarter. I am passionate about my food and I live for making people smile with my Mac & Cheese. As with everything else going on with COVID-19, the biggest risk is not being able to run my food truck due to quarantine, or health risks. What I've learned throughout this pandemic, is that the fear of the unknown is temporary, and that adaptability is key. That being said I will always pursue my dream of owning my own food truck, even if that means postponing the grand opening.",
  "We plan to be different. We want to be the only one out there selling what we sell.",

  "Karen Kring here: I've been conceptualizing this speakers series since May 2018. I've talked to numerous people to gain their perspective on this project--a mayor, numerous non-profit executives, community leaders and neighbors-- and have gotten much moral support. The challenges I'm currently anticipating include\n- Not picking a big enough venue for the first speakers night. I'd imagined 40-50 people attending, but it could be more. To address this possible blessing, I'm doing my homework to find a venue that could seat a small number easily, but expand to accommodate more people comfortably.\n- Not attracting the most diverse audience possible. This project aims to include people from all corners of Evanston, IL especially, but also neighbors beyond those city limits who would appreciate and be impacted by this conversation. I'm working on seeing that that does not by forming a host committee of neighbors from diverse backgrounds.\n- Not seeing what is in my blind spot. Sometimes I think some things should happen easily, but they don't. If I'd had my way, this would have happened in fall 2018. The good news is that I'm consulting with numerous community leaders with vast experience at pulling together projects more complex than this. I'll will continue to be in touch with them as I work out various wrinkles.",
  "\u2605The colors of the actual products may vary slightly due to phone or monitor settings\n\n\u2605I will select the best quality possible but some may contain minor imperfection such as  light scratches, tiny specks, dots or air bubbles, slight imperfections on the side or back of pin, minor under-fill in enamel, slightly misaligned screen-printing.\n\n\u2605Delays might happen since the pins are made overseas due to production and shipping.\n\n\u2605Backers will be notified if any of those situations occur.",
  "The main risk and challenge would be the pandemic of COVID 19 this country is currently facing. Competition in the market is another risk but by believing in your product and having the confidence and being determined to get through the challenges that lay ahead, the business will thrive. My product not standing out to customers is the ultimate challenge so by having a unique menu and using the best meats in town I can avoid that.",
  "The main challenge is funding my time away from my work (I work full time for my production company) to continue with this work in progress. There are a lot of photos and prints to scan and art to photograph, as well as 30+ vhs tapes to digitize, with TAN on them. All of this before working on the finished edit.\r\n\r\nSteps: (revised from first KS)\r\n1. KS v.2 - raises $750-2500 or more. Complete Official 10 min mini-documentary / Film Trailer - Apply for additional arts foundation funding or patrons. \r\n2. Travel to NYC and Phila.; finish 3 more key interviews.\r\n3. Completion of the Feature Documentary Late 2017, early 2018.\r\n4. Enter in Film Festivals heavy in The Arts.\r\n\r\nOther challenges: working with the archival footage (SD) and photos and audio vs the since 2006 SD and HD content. \r\n\r\nLicensing of music and additional content I use in the film.\r\nI would like to obtain the news footage of the car crash Nov 1st 1991.\r\nOtherwise I will re-enact it with images and narration.\r\n\r\nThe last biggest challenge is remaining objective and excited thru the tears while editing the story of what was and what might have been.

  "We face risks every day in life.  However, our confidence stands with an obvious need for a quality dessert experience on Maui and the decades worth of experience in the food and beverage industry and business smarts from our support team.  The greatest risk is reaching out to our community for support.  The greatest challenge is not reaching our monetary goal.",
  "We have some risks but nothing to big that we can handle.",
  "One of the main risks for fulfilling this Kickstarter is the limited capabilities of my current laser cutter, which can only cut so fast and for so long. The majority of the funds to meet my target goal amount will be going towards a better laser cutter that can cut faster, with even greater precision such that I can release more of my designs and ideas I have in my head or want to prototype. Having only just started my own company, this is the first product I have finalized and released to see how much interest there is. \r\n\r\nIf necessary, due to large quantities requested, I will have another manufacturer help with producing these boxes for you...but this would be a great problem to have!",
  "This project is just about ready to be launched, and most of it is already finished. We have suppliers ready to go to order the materials and supplies needed. The only things we don't have lined up is the exact brand, weight and material of T-Shirt and T-Shirt vinyl we are going to use. However, we have many samples and will be nailing this down after a little bit more testing.\r\n\r\nWe have prototypes of all of the products, and have been beta testing all aspects of Decal production with real people. We've used an outsourced T-Shirt manufacturer for prototyping the T-Shirts, and investigated several techniques before deciding on the heat-pressed vinyl method. This method produces the highest quality result. It also happens to be the most economical for us and allows us to reuse existing equipment and processes, with only one additional piece of equipment needed.\r\n\r\nAs a web developer with years of experience, I don't foresee any issues with finishing the development of the website. I have designed it with scaling in mind and should be able to handle thousands of users easily. That said, every website has it's own unique growing pains and there may be some hitches that I will certainly address as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge, which is nice to have, is this project being overwhelmingly popular, and having a lot of interest from backers. This could cause a delay, but we will be able to forecast this easily as the campaign runs. Our campaign goal assumes a certain number of backers, and we will be able to easily handle 4-5 times that many without needing any extra help. If it ends up being too much, we have resources we can pull in to help with manufacturing and fulfillment to hopefully minimize any delay. The final products are manufactured entirely in-house, so once we get the stock of vinyl and t-shirts, we're good to go, and won't be waiting on any third parties to fulfill orders.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU for your support!",
  "The beauty of this project. is that it is fairly free of risk. The funding that is being requested, is going to initially cover traveling and production costs. As the show garners more viewership, it should be self sufficient in terms of acquiring local and national advertisers to support the funding. \r\n\r\nTo ensure long term success, the show is going to launch in the Nashville Area and gradually branch out across the country as funding permits the costs of the longer travel distances.",
  "Our main risk is not getting any advertising income or selling courses online to cover our monthly costs and have to close down someday in the future. We need to increase our circulation and audience.  We hope that the revenue from advertising will be huge because niche websites will soon be the only viable place for crypto projects to advertise.",

  "The challenges of completing this project include having to compete with major sports media distributors like Bleacher Report and ESPN.  SportsAsToldByAGirl, however, is more than just another media outlet.  This project is to help one woman change the landscape of the media world for many other women.  According to the 2012 Associated Press Sports Editors Racial and Gender Report Card, women only represented 9.6% of all sports editors.  (Morrison 2014) \r\n\r\nThis project already has an established following that can help regulate these numbers.  Currently, SportsAsToldByAGirl has thousands of followers across multiple social media platforms.  This was created with just hard work, good quality and effort.  \r\n\r\nWith your help, we can increase those numbers by putting more money into our monthly marketing budget.  We can reach new readers who are looking for a fresh perspective instead of the same established analysts constantly being pushed by television giants like ESPN and Fox Sports.\r\n\r\nAs Melinda Gates said, \u201cWomen speaking up for themselves and for those around them is the strongest force we have to change the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile the operating basics for SportsAsToldByAGirl are currently low, we are hoping to expand to more than just a website.  We have already begun creating merchandise that we are hoping to make available to the public.  Currently, we would only be able to produce one garment at a time which is a very time-consuming and expensive practice.  With your help, we are hoping to be able to mass produce clothing items that we can ship to all of our readers around the world. We are looking to create multiple items and eventually have a full online store that includes everything you need for game day including team color hats and tops, sweat pants for those cold game day temperatures and of course drink holders.\r\n\r\nAll of our writers are open to helping promote the cause.

Participating cooperatives are housed in secure work spaces to ensure that raw materials are safe across the value chain. \r\n\r\nAs with any cross border enterprise shipping the products can spring up unwanted delays. However, the size and weight of the Black History Kits and other rewards are easily shipped via air from Johannesburg to New Orleans. From Napoleonville, Louisiana orders will be packaged and mailed to you.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to reaching and exceeding all expectations. AlovesB is thankful for your support.",

You can jump right into HTML with mom right away - and be part of it as we make the updates throughout the duration of this KickStarter until we complete the update before  January, 2016. \r\n\r\nIf something happens to me( knock on wood)  Mom will send out all the passes ;)",

  "The major challenge is funding the main components of the company: the website.\r\n\r\nI'm currently forming a team to help develop the website and server to accommodate the anticipated traffic, provide an easy to use and familiar interface, as well as seamless operation.\r\nSecurity, accessibility, and ease of use are the 3 major essential conditions we have in mind in designing our website. \r\n\r\nMost of the money raised will go to this single challenge. \r\n\r\nAdvertising is a close second, but with my faith in my media advertising director, your money will be well spent getting the word out to other users to help further our discussion.\r\n\r\n3rd biggest challenge is legal due diligence.  It's of utmost importance that everything done with Keystone is legal, to prevent any potential copyright infringements, or violations of any law of any kind. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe money raise will roughly be spent mostly on web design, advertisements, and legal fees.",
