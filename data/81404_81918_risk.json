  "Nat\u00fcrlich gibt es bei kreativen Projekten immer Risiken: Ausfall von Crew oder Schauspielern, Schlechtes Wetter - all das hat Auswirkungen auf eine Filmproduktion. \n\nWir beide haben jedoch im Laufe unseres Studiums und dar\u00fcber hinaus bereits viele Erfahrungen mit Produktionen gesammelt und sind uns sicher allen Herausforderungen strotzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Zusammen mit unseren Betreuern und kompetenten Helfern, haben wir ein Team, das allem gewachsen ist. :)",
  "At this moment, I'm still talking to few galleries/curator that are interested in exhibiting this show, but since I've never done any previous art show before, this proves to be the biggest challenge so far. I'd really appreciate it if you can also contact me if you know anyone with a gallery space. Thanks!!",
  "While we have worked hard to ensure material supply and production readiness, there is always a chance external factors will impact on our timeline. Covid has hugely impacted Australian textiles production, bringing many brands back onshore for their production. Demand on local materials has also increased. While this is great for the industry as a whole, it is putting stress on the local factories and suppliers who have remained small due to those same brands going offshore in the years prior. Smaller brands like Peak Oil Company may be temporarily put off by suppliers and the producers while they work to cope with the stress of larger orders. We have mitigated this risk by drawing out a longer timeline for our small orders. If we unexpectedly go over our estimated orders, we may have to break production into two periods, which could mean some people don't get their anorak by December 2022, but a few months after that. We consider this scenario highly unlikely, though we're prepared for it if it does come about.",
  "The greatest challenges faced by 1958 have been the indecisiveness of the bureaucracy at both municipal and provincial levels...don't need commercial stove, then suddenly you do, a grease trap will not be required, then mysteriously it is, the floor will be OK as is, then later tell us the back area needs a new floor and on and on. For every challenge there is always a solution, the issue for 1958 is these challenges require money to resolve and I am all out of cash. Risks are obvious as in any start up, how long will it take someone to walk through the door once we open it, will there be enough revenue stream to offset expenses, will 1958 stand the test of time, will we do a good enough job etc. Our market research says we will be fine on all fronts. As \"they\" say, whoever they are, the proof is in the pudding. Please sir, may I have more...",
  "There are so many short films made every year. Thousands. How do you rise above the noise? You can't learn from your film until you have an audience for it. Making the film is the fun part. Marketing and promotion are the not fun part. It's a whole different skill set. That's part of the reason we are entering film festivals. So people who can help us get to know us. We just have to keep reaching out. We are learning more about that every day.",
  "The only risk is that I don't hit my target sum. The album is ready to be pressed to vinyl. If I don't hit the target I won't be able to send it to get pressed.",
  "At this time, the primary risk in this project is the risk of not reaching our funding goal, which would seriously delay completion of the renovations and may lead to a decision not to proceed despite our investments to date. However, the overwhelming outpouring of enthusiasm we have received from the community for The Wild Hare makes us optimistic that we will easily surpass our goal.\r\n\r\nWe're far enough along in this process that we think we've identified the remaining challenges, which are primarily the electrical and air handling upgrades. However, until the doors open, there's always the possibility of encountering other difficulties including additional unforeseen remodeling challenges (though again, this is unlikely). If the project is funded and we encounter additional remodeling challenges, we anticipate continuing the project, though it may result in additional delays both in opening and in delivering rewards.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant business is not without operational risks including uncertainty about competitors, uncertainty about prospective customers, and other factors that cannot be completely controlled when developing a business plan. Again, we believe the enthusiasm from the community as well as our unique menu and atmosphere will translate into a strong and loyal customer base and a long history of success. In the event that sales do not meet our projections, we will consider changes to the menu, service structure, or other factors that may improve our chances of success without jeopardizing our commitment to use fresh, local ingredients and provide a quality experience for our customers.",
  "The biggest problem I've run into on any set is a lack of planning and communication. I have made it a point to keep my crew members in the loop all throughout preproduction, and I made it a point to fully schedule the project as early as possible. We have dates for rehearsals, shot lists, production, foley and post-production set through October 15th of this year. I will also be rehearsing tougher scenes with my actors to ensure they are all comfortable with the material and with each other. I hope through a clear line of communication and planning that we will be able to cross bridges as they come rather than tackle mountains.",
  "Its always a risk supporting an independent artist, but I have completed two Kickstarter's with Thunder and Rain and one for my first EP successfully! I had a lot of experience with this platform, and I've always gotten everyone they're rewards! Also my EP is already mastered and ready to go, so this funding effort is to help me get the promo and production costs necessary to get it out in the world!",
  "Word on the street is there is a global shipping delay and I've heard there is a bit of a back up at the vinyl pressing plants.  I do believe everything will be delivered in a timely manner but there is always risk...it's not my first rodeo tho, so with experience, professionalism, and time-tested care for my fans getting the best possible experience, you can feel safe pre-ordering the fun here on Kickstarter!",
  "The biggest challenge is getting the art series and musical album marketed and available for the public.  I will be uploading the musical album to accessible areas like Itunes, Spotify, etc.. If we are able to finish the album with the success of this kickstarter some advertising will go into promoting the album and art series.",
  "We've overcome most of the difficulties at this point. We're pretty sure we can handle getting the books in the mail. But we'll need your help getting yourself to the venue for the release party in August.",
  "The album is on its final stage now, we will finish the production and real use it very soon! If I achieve the goal I will be able to pay the entire cost of the CD and video \"Chiaroscuro\"",
  "The biggest risk we will likely see is with scheduling. Small town Minnesota is not the ideal place for a full time job as an actor, and because of this we will likely need to work with the cast and crew to form the schedule around their jobs.",
  "We are entirely dedicated to finishing this renovation. Even if it means adding features later on. The shop will open by December.",
  "If there are delays due to construction or permitting or other unforeseen issues, your juices, packages and parties may be delayed a bit. But we are committed to delivering everyone's rewards as soon as possible after we open (or before we open in the case of the tasting parties).",
  "We have done our homework on the two projects we'd like to complete, but that doesn't mean things will happen in the time frame we'd like! We know what it is going to take to complete the outdoor patio and the kitchen upgrade. However we are still at the will of the contractors. We anticipate that we can complete the patio in about two weeks from breaking ground, and we have estimates approved for all the costs. While there is a possibility that the job may take longer due to unforeseen circumstances (weather, conflicting schedules of contractor vendors etc), the cost is set in stone, so we know it will be finalized with the funding we are hoping to raise.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this we have already done some work on our space and have very reliable contractors that know what they are doing. They are also great at getting work done when our cafe is closed to minimize the affects on our day-to-day business.\r\n\r\nWith the kitchen, we have also fully evaluated the installation of a hood and stove. There is already a gas line to the kitchen, and since we are lucky to have a large kitchen area, the disruption to regular business for the process of adding these things will be minimal, and it will definitely be an improvement that everyone will enjoy!",
  "All of the kickstarter incentives have been produced, the show opening on January 14 at Howl Happening: An Arturo Vega Project is being handled by a very professional crew, and PUNK Magazine, Inc. was reincorporated in 2001 and has published several new issues and produced a pretty cool book (The Best of PUNK Magazine by Harper/Collins imprint: !T Books). \r\n\r\nAlso, Godlis, whose book of his wonderful photos he took at CBGB, has been an unofficial advisor on this kickstarter project. \r\n\r\nWe don't foresee serious obstacles, unless someone breaks a leg or something. This is, after all, New York City, site of Hurricane Sandy, several blackouts, many riots, and other crazy things (like punk rock).",
  "We have set October 2022 as the delivery date. We are well-placed to meet this date thanks to our first-class manufacturing partners and incorporation of a one-month buffer. The production of a watch is a highly complex process that involves many parties working together. As with all complex projects, there can be unavoidable failures or delays - even if all parties are professional in nature. Delays may also be caused by political developments or the still ongoing pandemic.",
  "This is our 7th Kickstarter campaign so we know enough to know that we face some risks and challenges. This same experience will be invaluable in overcoming any challenge we might face. Let's talk through some of the possible challenges.  \n\n1. Transitioning from prototype to full-scale manufacturing. Currently, we have fully functioning prototypes from the same factory that will make our full production run so we anticipate manufacturing to go smoothly. Furthermore, since there is no major tooling required, it mitigates many of the major unknowns. However, full-scale manufacturing is always different than making a small run of prototypes. We have a well-respected manufacturing partner, and they have been responsive to any feedback we've shared.\n\n2. Global supply chains and logistics. This has been an ongoing issue facing many industries over the past year. During our most recent campaign, we experienced increased container shipping costs, slower shipping timelines, and continued risk of lockdowns in countries like China.  There is the risk of additional lock-downs in the countries we manufacture in.  \n\n3. This is a project and we're using Kickstarter to create something new! That means that things such as design, features, accessories, and any/all aspects of the project are fluid and a work in progress! We've done our best to present our project transparently and honestly - and it's our full intention to deliver everything as shown on the campaign page and video. However, as creators, it's ultimately our job to bring the best version of the project to life - both for backers and for us. That means things can change throughout the campaign and after.   \n\nLessons learned from past campaigns:  \n\n1. Keep it simple. This has probably been our #1 biggest lesson learned and one that really impacted our most recent campaign. As a creator, there is always a temptation to try to do everything - add more features, more accessories, more add-ons, more, more, more! This can make for an exciting campaign, but the fun quickly evaporates post-campaign. That's why we've made neon buffalo as minimalist as possible and kept the weight variations to three options. Simple.  \n\n2. Underpromise and overdeliver. We're optimists at heart - it's essential for us as creators to have a positive and hopeful attitude. However, we've learned the need to balance that mentality with realistic expectations. Especially when setting deadlines and communicating with backers.  \n\n3. Communicate more than you think is necessary. We always strive to be transparent and keep our backers updated. However, in our most recent campaign backers seemed to want more communication. We'll communicate more frequently during this campaign.  \n\nWe hope that sharing these risks and challenges gives you more confidence in us: to be honest, transparent, and ultimately bring this project to life in the best way possible. We are excited to get going!",
  "The past few years have taught us that the global supply chain is fragile. We are confident in our manufacturer, and in the wide-spread availability of materials required to make cord 1. We look forward to tackling the unknown challenges that inevitably arise when making new things.",
  "Nuestro primer reto es que no act\u00faen, que sean como son.  Si son libres en el rodaje tendremos historia.\nPero el desaf\u00edo mas importante es sobreponernos a la falta de energ\u00eda, la que se necesita para atravesar todo el proceso y muchas veces somos nosotr@s mismos quienes nos apagamos la energ\u00eda. Finalmente nuestro mas feroz vampiro lo tenemos guardado dentro.",
  "The main challenge is to raise enough money to finish my project. Any support for the costs incurred by equipment, production, location, music, software, etc. is greatly appreciated. Let's make this film together!!",
  "I feel the biggest challenge is going to be pulling people in. I have so much raw, and original material, but this pilot episode will need to woo a wide crowd, This Pilot is going to be created as a \"Teaser\" per say. I want to introduce my shows Main characters, and prove the story is worth following.",
  "Timeline is a big unknown right now in terms of recording and live music in the age of COVID. I am recording at a studio, and COVID does have the possibility of pushing out the timeline, if I am unable to safely collaborate with musicians.",
  "Our vinyl will a double LP and is going to take a while to produce. If you order a vinyl from us it may take up to 6 months for us to get it you. \n\nWe may run into some difficulty as far as keeping all shirt and hoodie sizes in stock. We'll work hard to keep everything available but please understand that cost-wise it is tricky for a small organization like us to keep all sizes available at all time. \n\nThank you for believing in a group of nerdy guys from Cooperstown. Believe us once more when we say, this is only the beginning. \n\nx. H A N Z O L O",
  "Risks and Challenges: Due to the size of this installation and its scope it will have to conform to the space that is made available. With any large project it requires time, planning, space, and a lot of creative work. Working with other artists and craftsmen has its benefits and challenges. Space won\u2019t limit the effectiveness of the project, but it could alter its appearance somewhat by location. \r\nMy long history in art, construction, building and design as well as having done large art work and projects shown in museums gives me the confidence that I will succeed. I feel that the consequences of global warming are huge and that motivates me to try to make a change, however small, to mitigate its consequences.",
  "Expenses that we have financed already:\n-Recording studio & sound engineer\n-Editing and mastering\n-Graphic designer & photographer",
  "Restoring a building is an unpredictable task. This historic structure is especially complex because it requires dedication and cautious decisions to ensure the history is not lost in the process of securing and developing its future. This project has only begun, but it is just the next step in our eight-year history as a gallery, and we have been working with architects, the city, our committee, and our artists to put the plans and permits in place. This Kickstarter campaign is an important piece in the puzzle, not only for making the restoration happen, but in demonstrating the kind of support needed in an area such as ours, where the importance of art is, at times, lost and forgotten.",
  "One of the challenges that our group faces is finding a group of people or company to install the bench and sign.  We are willing to assist in installation, but lack the knowledge regarding concrete bases.  \r\n\r\nAnother challenge we face is the production time for the bench.  After speaking with the representative, I learned that it will take roughly six weeks to receive the bench after it is paid for.",
  "Challenges. To the idea of challenges, I respond; DETERMINATION.\r\nI had a mentor, who, through a very subtle and innocuous style of instruction, gave me the ability to discover my gift of problem solving.  I refer to the innate ability to foresee the finished product as naturally as I breathe. The idea of problem solving is exploited in my stone sculpting. While the stone leaves no room for error, careful planning and keen foresight are crucial to my existence.\r\n      Some other facts about me; I am a Marine Biologist (BS from South Hampton College:L.I.U.), and worked at Mote Marine Lab in Florida, I am an accomplished musician and attended Five Towns Music School to get an amazing education in music.  Among some other schooling throughout the years, I have been an administrator and instructor for a nation wide education curriculum enrichment service called \u201cScience Adventures\u201d. I could go on and will if requested. I do not wish to blow a horn, just assure you this will happen! I would have to die first before it was a miss, and even after death, my support group would still make it work! \r\n      I have overcome obstacles which have made most shudder, as well I have been broken to near exhaustion by my pursuits.  The main point is I get back up with the same ferocity with which I was hit.  I never quit! I may miss a mark on a rare occasion, but never give up!  \r\n      I have worked within the art world as a Professor\u2019s assistant, I was a master clay maker for a prestigious college, worked at the Wyland Gallery in Florida, successfully run my own personal gallery both in store and online. I have taken every art course known to man, I am a Master stone Sculptor as well as Master Gyotaku Artist, I mean business. \r\n      As an artist, my goal and ultimate life energy comes from this deep seeded need to connect, communicate, and understand! \r\nMy passion for art\u2019s dance, as it leads me around the \u201cballroom\u201d  of experience and education, communication and acceptance, love and fear, is the magic which I crave in my limited existence  here with you.  I want to share my magic with my new tribe, my new friends and family, you who have trusted me and allowed me to flourish and enjoy the Cosmos to the fullest.\r\n         I will honor my words to you that I WILL complete my mission! The integrity and character which I hold with a iron grip, unwilling to let go of, my very truth of being,relies on the successful completion of this task.  \r\nIt has been said, \u201cDo or do not. There is no try.\u201d",
  "This is a faith based film, we want to honor God in this film and all throughout the production from acting to the crew. Challenges we may face are the unnatural challenges and traps that will try to crush this production.  Some incidents may happen, maybe some change in schedule or even change of heart from cast or crew..   \n\nSo this is where God comes in, we plan to pray and stay strong and committed throughout this short but important production. From start to finish, we will see the works of prayer and God as we get to say those final words:  IT'S A WRAP!",
  "I am the type of filmmaker that likes to work with the same people. So it will be cost efficient in that respect. However, \"Beyond The River Bridge\" is a period film set in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's. So the set decoration and costumes must reflect those time periods. This can become costly. In addition, I would like Julia Garner (Ruth in Ozark) to play Mary Faye, and her salary as well as any other big name actors salary can be steep. I'll make the movie without them if I have to, but having popular names attached to my project increases the chances of success. \n\nRest assured, every dime sent to us will be used to produce this film with a guarantee of completion by the end of 2019. I set our goal here at $50,000 but in reality that's not even a third of what we need to make this film great. I think a budget of $300,000 is optimum. Anything helps.",
  "After 3 1/2 years of planning for this project, we're quite certain that, given the resources, all shall come to pass.  Up to this point, all of the improvements to Sam's have been achieved with our own \"4 hands\" (Mike and Rhasaan's), and with the help of our friends.  This hard work has earned us a sense of confidence - one that's got us chomping at the bit to finally bring the Cabin to it's full potential.\r\n\r\nALSO, with the funding we hope to achieve here, we would love to enlist the local community as these projects take shape.  Many of you that frequent Sam's are skilled in various trades.  Let us know if you'd like to get involved in any way.  \r\n\r\nA place built BY the community, FOR the community, will create a unique environment that is much more than just a restaurant.

  "The Warehouse space is very large, and will require a lot of fixtures, and large art pieces to fill it.  My team and I have spent months planning and preparing for this rave, now it is up to us to execute our mission to turn the space into a wonderland.  We will absolutely make this Rave into nothing that Savannah has ever seen before!",
  "There are no risks,since the models are made in advance. We take a responsible approach to our work. Each model is carefully moderated. We are open to everyone. You can always ask us a question. We thank everyone who takes part in our project. We ask everyone to support our project in any way. If you can't support our project financially, just tell your friend about it. Any recommendation helps the project move forward. My 3D Studio has already released many projects on kickstarter. You have no reason to worry about any risks, as our Studio not only values its reputation, but also strives to achieve excellence in each of its work. For our Studio, creativity is not just a job. It is a goal and a way to achieve excellence in art. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your support is invaluable! We are improving every time, we understand that people do not like to use support in 3D printing, since the need to use support forces people to spend significantly more time preparing a 3D model for 3D printing, so we try to create 3D models with the minimum number of necessary supports. You must understand that in some cases, it is impossible to refuse support in principle, since the shape of the 3D model dictates its own conditions in order to get a satisfactory print result on most 3D printers. Our 3D models were tested in 3D printing before publishing them on kickstarter and are regularly updated and improved throughout the funding period here. If you have any questions, you can always write to us so that we can help you. You don't have to worry that you won't be able to download the 3D models you bought from our Studio, because we store the entire collection of 3D models on Google drive, which guarantees the safety of your files for a long time. However, we strongly recommend that you download your 3D files in the archive prepared for you within 3 months after the end of funding for our project on kickstarter from the moment of publication of the link to Google drive from where you will be able to download the archive. We will send you a link to your email address and duplicate the link to your archive in private messages on kickstarter within 3 weeks after the project is successfully funded. You should understand that the print quality you get depends on the system you use. All our high-resolution files allow you to get excellent results on high-end SLA machines. While the same 3D models will be produced with lower resolution on standard FDM printers. Nevertheless, the 3D models have passed the necessary pre-printing test and have been pre-tested on SLA and FDM printers. We received a satisfactory performance and were satisfied with what we did especially for you. If you want to achieve the highest quality 3D printing, we recommend using SLA printers with a layer height parameter of 60 microns. We will try to divide our 3D models into prefabricated elements so that our 3D models can be printed on printers with a small print area. Large parts require a minimum of 220*220*250mm. Which is the approximate standard for the famous entry-level 3D printer Ender-3. 3d models are tested and cut using absolutely free software \"Cura\". We recommend this program because it is available to everyone, time-tested and proved to be a professional tool for working with 3D models for 3D printing. You can count on our support! Dear sponsors of this project have the right to change 3D models as they want at their own risk and solely for their own personal use. However, if a user has purchased one of our commercial licenses, they have the right not only to sell models in their original form, but also to sell them in any modified form! All rights of this project are protected by copyright and are subject to conditions that allow us to change and improve our 3D files in all available ways throughout the entire period of funding in order to improve the quality of 3D printing. We thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts who did not remain indifferent to our favorite business. Your help here is the key to the success of our creativity! You are the best! We are always happy to hear your questions and suggestions! Send us your question or suggestion, and we will answer you as soon as possible! admin@3dfortress.art Thanks!",
  "Risks and challenges\n\nNo project is without risk, but we have worked extremely hard to mitigate all unforeseen risks in the development, manufacturing and fulfillment of the ExBar. First, unlike many Kickstarter campaigns that are raising funds to produce the initial product, we have already received multiple prototypes which we tested rigorously and tweaked to deliver the ultimate fitness performance. We have manufacturing, freight and shipping in place and ready to go at our call. At Ex Fitness we have an outstanding team of designers, engineers, and fulfillment experts to ensure the entire process from design to manufacturing to fulfillment is executed without a hitch. If a problem arises, we are confident that we will solve them. \n\nLastly, there are still risks in the global economy at this time that can be out of our control. These include lockdowns, closures and unforeseen freight delays. We have accounted for some of this in our fulfillment schedule. Should any delays arise, our team will keep you up to date every step of the way. \n\nPlease carefully read Kickstarter's guidelines about what exactly it means when you back a project.  We're excited to implement our manufacturing and fulfillment plan immediately after the campaign and aim to fulfill on time to each and every backer.",

  "In starting any new business, there are obviously risks involved. For Hello Donuts, one of our concerns is consistency. We love our desired location more than anything, but the tourism there fluctuates with the season. A risk to think about is keeping consistent business all year round, so we can deliver the best products each and every day to everyone!\r\n\r\nWe are still looking for a concrete location, and as you'll see in the video, we would love to find it in Southwest Michigan, where we grew up! We're using this Kickstarter as a way to really secure a perfect location for our shop, as well as being able to fill it with all things necessary for awesome donut baking!",
  "Our plan with this film is to create a story that people love and can connect to, and to portray a Sirius Black that hasn't yet been shown before. This project has been in the making for over 2 years, and so we have spent no shortage of time to make it as good as is in our power to do. Please do your part in contributing to this project to allow us to complete our goal of being able to give this film to the Harry Potter fans around the world! Thank you so much!",
  "Small, independent music making is an arduous task. Most of the work that goes into a living, touring band is done by the band itself. That which is not is done by other independent artists and craftsmen, on whom we rely to get a work of art from our imagination to yours, and who we like to treat with the financial respect they deserve.\nIf we do not make our goal with this campaign, we will be completely self-financed. We know and accept this risk because we are committed to our art before all other considerations, however difficult that may prove. Your support is an essential part of a musical and artistic ecosystem that permits us, and the people we work with, to go on doing what we do best in the best possible way, and so we may get back to working hard to bring you more. \nTogether, you and us, we rise to the challenge of making this album happen, on time (by september), and land on our feet so we can go on making more music.",
  "Most of the recording is already complete and while this campaign is running, the mixing process is underway. Possible risks we face are delays in the mixing/mastering process or with the physical production of the CD.

The initial target is \u00a310000 and we would go ahead for a target of \u00a3100,000 as we want to give pure cinema experience. \r\n \r\n It's not easy to shoot in the Arabian sea for long, that is one the biggest challenge for us to keep going, but we have managed to get the right people on board. We have also got the Government on board and they are more than happy to help in making the film and we will try to get the Indian Navy as well. \r\n \r\n We really need your support to make this film get on screen, and we promise you will get the best experience and cinema.\r\n\r\nWe have a powerful script, budget, schedule, and crew. Now we need you. We're crowdfunding because financing an independent feature film is a challenging proposition for investors and we want to offer opportunities for people to get directly involved with the project.

  "We took learnings from our last two campaigns and localised the customised parts of the production in our home country, Belgium. Like this, we will be able to visit our suppliers even if travel restrictions are put in place. Secondly, we have designed a product which is very compact to ship and therefore can be sent easily around the world with low costs. Lastly, we have been intensively testing and using the bracket over a period of 3 months (this was not a task as we are using the product everyday anyway \ud83d\ude00). The tripods have been in use for the last 3 years. We will pay special attention to making sure that the screen is perfectly horizontal and that the right bolts and tools are included in the box.\n\nAfter serving over 150 Kickstarter backers on previous projects, we believe we are well suited for the job.",

  "I am confident in my ability to follow through on this album. I produced and released North Branch River without any outside funding, simply by moving slowly and paying for studio time as I could afford it. \n\nThe learning edge for me in this process will be managing rewards. I think I've set reasonable expectations for myself, but if there is any delay in delivery of rewards, I will communicate clearly with all my backers.",
  "The challenge for this project is finding the right funding so we can get out there and network. That's why this is so crucial to us. Also we will be on the road, so we have to be ready for anything in case of an emergency.",
  "A common risk and challenge we face is getting financial support to do the work we desire to do. Many people believe in the mission of English language liturgical worship in the American Orthodox Church, but finding people willing to financially support this vision has been a struggle for us. Please, help us to spread our work and continue our mission of providing high-quality Byzantine chants and compositions in the English Language.",
  "The actual box construction was incredibly difficult and costly. However, the biggest challenge I face will be gaining the trust of my patrons. It is a tall order to ask someone to step inside a 7x3\u2019 box, disregard the world, and really let it rip. With the right resources, I can successfully create a safe space that will not only encourage them to let go, but to want to come back.",
  "There is always the danger that the printer used can not provide a quality desired. If this turns out to be the case, an alternate printer will be chosen and the project will go forward, as planned. All will be informed as to any glitches in this phase of the project via email or social media.",
  "The only risk is the fact that we'll likely lose a lot of money on this recording due to a limited audience market in Savannah.",
  "Our challenges have included completing the album while we were on a tour up the coast of California, Oregon and Washington. We recorded the songs at 5th Element Studio in Kansas City before the tour started. Paradiso did most of the mastering while we were on the road. It is complete as of 10/25/18, and our beloved Gary Miraz is also expected to finish the CD cover art today!\n\nAll that\u2019s left is printing and sending the CDs when Kickstarter is successfully completed, and our experience with our previous 10 albums (and 3 successful and on time Kickstarter projects!) gives us every confidence that this one will complete on time as well.\n\nAll we need now is to raise the $2K minimum to pay for CD manufacture - and YOU can help us do that with your pledge and share! Thanks for reading, and for whatever support you are led to give. :)",
  "This project is almost done, all songs are recorded and these funds are  to help offset the costs of mixing, mastering and manufacturing. The biggest challenge I am facing is to meet the \"all or nothing\" Kickstarter goal so that these costs are covered. Being a collaborator comes with rewards and I thank you all for your support. \r\nI'm confident that this community of people can make this happen! \r\nPlease be sure to contact me by Direct Messenger on facebook or email at: vincemaccarone@gmail.com with your contact info, so any early rewards get to you. \r\n\r\nThank you so much !",
  "With every project, there comes challenges that we must face, Forever Loved is no different. While money wont fix every problem that comes our way, it will most assuredly help us get through the process with greater ease. Funding film permits, locations, props and wardrobe do not come cheap, especially in LA., but with your help, the money earned will help, not only the film, but also prepare use mentally and financially in order to execute a great short film that you would be pleased to see.",
  "We have a very aggressive timeline for buildout completion with hopes of our grand opening being Feb 2022. Our lease begins on February 1, 2022.  The sooner we open the sooner we can serve our community.\n\nWe are seeking buildout funds as well as cash for reserves and permitting/licensing fees. \n\nWe have hired a team of professionals that have over 60 years of combined hospitality and restaurant backgrounds that will assist in every aspect of the restaurant.\n\nThey are providing the expertise needed to make Scrum-did-dly-ump-tious a huge success. They are responsible for:\n\n\u25cf Making Recommendations for Restaurant Buildout, specific to daily operations for staff\n\u25cf Human Resource Plan (hiring/training staff/identify key hires)\n\u25cf Brokering Vendor Relationships (food and beverage)\n\u25cf Develop and Implement Audit and Inventory Control Systems\n\u25cf Pricing methods and policies (Menu item pricing for optimal margins)\n\u25cf Permitting and Administrative (support and assist current processes)\n\u25cf Bar Program/Menu Development\n\u25cf Develop Business Plan and SOP (Manuals)\n\u25cf Implementing Food Cost Control System\n\u25cf Kitchen and Bar Equipment \n\u25cf Implementing Safety and Sanitation Systems (COVID-19 Specific)\n\nWe are in phase one with our team of Architects and Interior Designers who have designed the space and we are ready to move onto phase two to bring in the Kitchen Consultants and MEP professionals along with the General Contractor. \n\nWe are in constant contact with the City and County, who have been extremely helpful with outlining the necessary steps to take with realistic timelines for approvals. We are aware that hiccups and delays that may occur due to sourcing available materials needed to complete the buildout. We have began ordering supplies in advance to avoid any delays but have been taking into consideration the possibility. \n\u00a0\nWe have archived a Covid Response Plan in efforts in the event of COVID numbers rising once again. \n\nWe have discovered that the growth of takeout and delivery has skyrocketed, Scrum-did-dly-ump-tious will already have a pick up window but in the event that dine-in service must halt temporarily due to a surge in COVID-19, we commit to dedicating more space for cooking and preparing orders to go.\u00a0\n\nScrum-did-dly-ump-tious will also roll out a weekly series of family meal kits offered for 2 or 4 people.\n\nScrum-did-dly-ump-tious will offer curbside pickup\n\nScrum-did-dly-ump-tious will host online cooking classes\n\nScrum-did-dly-ump-tious will push gift card sales with discount incentives\n\nCommunity\n\nDespite the difficult circumstances that the restaurant industry continues to face during the pandemic, chefs and restaurant operators were quick to come to the aid of those in need in their communities. Scrum-did-dly-ump-tious looks to support our community during this time by providing meals to our frontline\u00a0workers through\u00a0donations.",
  "The primary risk is securing the premises. Whilst we have found the perfect one for us, it won't be guaranteed until the crowdfunding is successful and the legal process complete. \n\nWe have the majority of our team already in place and -- providing this is a success -- plenty of funding to get us launched and running.",
  "We have to hire contractors to complete the build out of our proposed space in the Geist area.  There could be some construction delays due to the shortage of supplies and labor.  We plan to handle as much of the build out as possible.",
  "Making movies is very challenging and risk because you never know when your actors, DP, might quit on you.  But we are working so hard and very professional to deliver the final package as expected. \r\nThank you for putting your trust in us and we're kindly appreciated your support.\r\nAgain Thank you.",
  "If 2020 taught us anything, it's that plans are subject to change. Every dollar raised will go to this project, but we appreciate your understanding and flexibility if for some reason our recording session ends up being delayed due to another pandemic. We're seriously hoping that's a joke. But for real, how can any of us know?",
  "I hope I'll be able to respect the delivery deadline. The world situation being complicated, it also depends of deadline of the company that is making the vinyls.\n\nAlso, I'm discovering the crowdfunding world so I still have some uncertainties but one thing I know is that if I reach the goal I will go until the end and you will get them well packed as soon as possible! :)",
  "Every recording project is complicated and difficult, and there's always the chance that unexpected things will come up. We have completed several professional studio recording projects as members of other bands, and produced an EP as Countercurrent, so we are confident in our ability to keep the project within budget and on track.\r\n\r\nKickstarter is an all-or-nothing platform. That means that if we don't make our goal, the album won't get funded. However, if we can get enough people involved, we can make this happen without anyone needing to give more than they feel comfortable with. With that in mind, please consider sharing this with your friends, family, and anyone you might know who loves traditional music and independent artists!",
  "The recording should happen before the Crowdfunding is over, during May 2018.\r\nWe are planning to release it at the end of the year 2018.\r\n\r\nAside the music part of a record, we will need to deal with various actors whose temporality might differ from our plan such as : label, booker, sound engineer, bureaucratic slowness etc...\r\n\r\nBut the songs are ready, and we are confident that everything will go without complications.\r\n\r\nRiesgos y desaf\u00edos\r\n\r\nLa grabaci\u00f3n debe ocurrir antes de que termine el Crowdfunding, durante mayo de 2018.\r\nEstamos planeando lanzar el disco a finales del a\u00f1o 2018.\r\n\r\nAdem\u00e1s de la estrictamente musical de un disco, tendremos que ocuparnos de otros varios aspectos cuya temporalidad puede diferir de nuestro plan, como: discogr\u00e1fica, booker, ingeniero de sonido, lentitud burocr\u00e1tica, etc.\r\n\r\nPero las canciones est\u00e1n listas, y estamos seguros de que todo ir\u00e1 para delante sin infranqueables complicaciones.",
  "Given that I'm a dad of one, and soon to be two children, the biggest challenge is going to be the balancing of finishing this album, with dadding it up (and being sleep deprived). But given that my parents are stoked to help with babysitting, and my partner is 100% in support of this project happening, I feel confident that I can do it.",
  "I have recorded the majority of this album and am very close to having all tracks ready for mixing and mastering. However, there are some financial challenges that I will need to overcome. As a result of Covid, I haven't been able to continue to fund the project, so I decided to go for this Kickstarter. I am continuing with the project even though I have these financial hurdles, but I will be able to be ready by 1st of December 2021 if I am successful. I am currently working with collaborators and so it looks like I will be ready in time for this release date. A big thank you, go raibh m\u00edle maith agaibh for your help and support along the way.",

  "It is always risky and tough to decide to make a quality album for the world to enjoy. Everything around the music and messages behind the songs are very important and necessary to achieve our goal. Even though we are working very hard and timing is looking good, without these Kickstarter funds, our album's release will have to be postponed. \r\n\r\nBut we are confident that we can all make this happen if we come together as a strong loving community! So let's do it!\r\n\r\nESPA\u00d1OL\r\n\r\nEs siempre arriesgado y duro hacer un \u00e1lbum para que todos puedan disfrutarlo. Todo lo referente a la m\u00fasica y los mensajes en las letras es muy importante y necesario para cumplir nuestro objetivo. Aunque estamos d\u00e1ndolo todo y vamos bien de tiempo, sin los fondos de KickStarter, la presentaci\u00f3n del \u00e1lbum tendr\u00e1 que posponerse.\r\n\r\nPero tenemos confianza en que todos podemos conseguirlo si lo hacemos juntos, Si se puede !!",
  "The one thing to keep in mind when you back this project is that the delivery date MIGHT be pushed back a couple of months into the summer. We've budgeted ample time to record, mix, master, press the album, and create the rest of the rewards, but there are always unforeseeable bumps in the road!",
  "Gr\u00e2ce aux fonds amass\u00e9s par cette campagne, nous serons en mesure d'assumer les frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'enregistrement de l'album:\r\n\r\n- Location du mat\u00e9riel et d'un espace\r\n- Ing\u00e9nieur de son\r\n- Mixage\r\n- Mastering\r\n\r\nVotre aide nous est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cieuse.

  "We are confident that if we collect the necessary funds to release this album that risks and obstacles will be few. We have a good relationship with our mastering and CD manufacturing contacts as we have done business with them before.\r\n\r\nIt is possible the vinyl LP's may take a little longer than expected. Because of the growing demand for vinyl records and the limited amount of pressing plants in the country, there are usually long wait lines to get your order pressed at all plants. Rest assured though, we will expedite as much of this process as possible, and get this LP into your hands as soon as we can.",
  "Depending on the success of the campaign, getting all of the rewards together could prove quite a challenge. But it will be fun and absolutely worth it.",
  "The challenge here would be trying to do this without you, because that'd be impossible. I've worked hard to make smart, economical choices in the production of this album, and seeing the release through in the right way is only going to happen with your help. You can rest assured that your hard earned money will be spent thoughtfully, and that your rewards will arrive at the time promised, in advance of the album's release. Thank you, friends.",
  "The greatest challenge we currently have is the real estate market.  It is ever changing.  We are needing a location that is open, has room for a drive through, and has a safe flow of traffic to allow our guests and employees to get into and out of our facility with ease.  This market is ever changing in their pricing and availability.  We have an excellent commercial real estate broker that is committed to helping us find the perfect location to maximize our business plan while addressing the liability of needing larger parking spaces to accommodate accessibility for each of our Champions.  This may delay our open date as we search out the perfect location for our business. \n    Another challenge we have is for this kick starter is the limited merchandise available at one location.  We have multiple print shops to accommodate the large amounts of shirts, cups, stickers, and art print jobs that will arise, however, we may have delays in getting products shipped as we wait on our products to be made.  Any delays in fulfillment of these orders will be communicated with donors directly.",
  "We are countering the risk that we have set the break-even point too low and will therefore not achieve profitability.\n\nIn addition, we could lose a major source of income due to the exit of important restaurants",
  "I'm taking this project one step at a time.  Right now, funding illustrations is the only obstacle I have to overcome.  I can then move on to submissions to publishers/agents.\nAlso, I have worked in a few different school districts (Bay Area and SoCal), so once I'm able to get this published I can reach out to them as a potential audience.",

I feel like many of you folks who listen to my music and have come out to my shows are like me - you enjoy having something physical to listen to - a CD or a vinyl. I've always felt like the listening experience is different. You create a space for the songs and hear things that you wouldn't hear out of earbuds or in the car. Will these songs be released if I don't reach my goal? They certainly will see the light of day in some digital capacity, but they would never be released on vinyl or CD.",
  "Risks & Challenges:\nWe have already overcome many challenges, such as navigating through COVID-19 as a new business to create a sustainable, scalable business model during a pandemic. While there is still the risk of not meeting our Kickstarter campaign goal, we fully trust you, your friends, and the community to come together and help us make Harlem Biscuit Company\u2019s first storefront a reality.\n\nWhile there are risks and challenges with every new project, we believe in Harlem Biscuit Company\u2019s success because of the brand, our personal experience, our respective industry expertise, and the overwhelming support we have received up to this point. We have conducted extensive research from outside sources, received counsel from many professionals, and projected conservatively. We have earned the trust and support of many individuals through this process and hope that we will be able to earn yours too!\n\nHere's a look at our short and long term goals. \n\nShort Term Goals: \n- Opening a beautiful space where we can serve our product.\n- Continuing to build community and connecting with Harlem.\n- Become a renowned and respected biscuit shop in Harlem NY.\n\n\nLong Term Goals: \n-Multiple store-fronts starting with Harlem and beyond.\n- Become a globally, recognized biscuit brand with product on grocery store shelves and in freezers.",
  "This will be the first time we've released an album on vinyl, which offers its own unique challenges in terms of mixing, mastering, and printing. We're also releasing almost all original music, which is new for many members of the band, and offers its own risks in copyright and registration.",
  "It has been a challenge for the Greek Music Ensemble to use creatively the emotional attachment, the positive bias that we have with the music of some of the monumental figures of 20th century Greek Art Music, such as Manos and Mikis. Most of us have been raised, with their songs always around us since, in Greece of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, it was mostly the music of those artists that was widely played on the radio, TV, concerts, and other public and private events.    \r\nAnd now, residing in the US, not only do we find ourselves listening to this music but also performing it, arranging it, re-interpreting it in the context of 21st century performance practices \u2013 in other words re-living it.",
  "Everything is lined up to make this project happen, so it's really about making sure we have the funds to proceed. That and a resurgence of Covid shutting the studio down, but that would only delay things.",
  "We are looking at leasing either a brick and mortar take out location or working through a commercial kitchen.  If funding is not procured, this will delay the process",
  "Production time on CDs and vinyl may vary due to the post-pandemic period, but we will make our best to get our music out as soon as possible.",
  "Covid is the most likely risk - our events will be held largely indoors - we are using the lovely old Town Hall, the Courthouse, the Masonic Lodge, the old Wesleyan Church and more - so numbers may be restricted, and restrictions may suddenly change. Our watchwords for year one of CresFest are 'manageability' and 'moderation'. We will bring a great event to our town in the safest and best way we can.  If the festival has to be postponed due to Covid we will roll over or return your investment - according to your wishes and best practise in the performing arts at the time.\n\nOther common event risks include:\n\n* last minute changes or drop outs by performers (we will call on our vast network to fill any gaps)\n* not selling out (we are budgeting for 80% capacity)\n* inclement weather (we have back up venues to move outdoor events indoors)\n* lack of support from local traders (we have a part time co-ordinator funded by the Besen Family Foundation who is working with the committee to secure their support\n* street disturbances (we are working with Council, local police and private security to ensure safety for our punters and local community)\n* lack of interest from local population (we are working on community engagement projects that culminate at the festival, as well as providing many volunteering opportunities to people from teens to seniors)",
  "We've spent a long time dotting the I's and crossing the T's on on this project.

  "Filmmaking presents plenty of challenges and unforeseen circumstances. With a professional crew of experience ranging from 5-10 years in both the creative storytelling and business financing industries, we are taking every precaution to well-equip ourselves for the obstacles that may lie ahead. The challenges of crafting a story that takes place in Scotland with talent local to that area, and a crew flying in from overseas, are in the travel costs that it takes to get on location for the duration of time needed to produce the film. Our main character and the events that take place over the course of his story were written for the Scottish Highlands and all that this location has to offer. It is an adventure worth challenging ourselves to and only leaves us further inspired and passionate about this project.",
  "The most difficult challenge is finding funding for a film. I spent countless hours working for months gathering enough while still attending school. It's been a long road, but I'm close to reaching my goal. With your contribution you will help make a dream a reality. You will help me take a big step on this long journey, while also being a huge part of this emotionally conquered experience.",
  "We have to secure the star of the show and get him to Phoenix for the shoots. We have to come up with some up-front payment to a production company if all of them make that requirement. We have to secure an athletic facility in Chandler. We have overcome such hurdles before in completing the episodes currently available on Amazon. We believe will deliver this important episode to America.",
  "The big risk with this project is of course the house move itself - although I am usually back up and running in a couple of days, there's a lot going on so I've allowed enough time after the move to get settled in and complete the drawings if I don't get chance to do the work before I go. The print company I have worked with several times before and I myself have run several successful projects already so it should otherwise be smooth sailing.",
  "We cannot see any risk in that project. We are already prepared with mastering and cover. The last thing to get done is to make a physical product. Since the vinyl became more popular it might take a few months to produce an LP but don't worry - we will keep you updated at all times.\r\n\r\nThe only challenge for us is to infect people by our passion and love to the art. We would love to see all the crazy people turning with us in one positive vibrated community. We believe everyone who appreaciates art and loves music will see the energy and work we put into that project and that's the thing we hope will encourage people to stay with us.",
  "If we reach our goal, the only challenge that worries us, is being able to get all of your rewards to you as soon as possible. For that to happen, we need to have an open line of communication.  \n\nOnce the Kickstarter campaign is completed, we will reach out through email and gather the information needed to get your rewards to you.  We will do our best to keep you up to date on the timelines.  \n\nThis will be a difficult process that requires a great deal of organizing and coordinating, but it will most definitely be worth it for all of us in the long run! \n\nPlease be sure to read all emails we send your way and communicate back to us as soon as possible.

  "What I love about Kickstarter is their care with donors' dollars. If this project doesn't reach its goal, your money won't be wasted.

  "Since I\u2019m primarily a studio artist\u2014I do not tour, and rarely perform live\u2014it can be quite difficult to promote my work. Due to a day job, my limited free time is used solely for what I love to do: creating music. Your support in this project will allow me to continue doing just this!\r\n\r\nWhile I am only asking for $2,000, the actual cost of this CD is considerably higher: About $2,000 for CD replication costs, $1,000 on mastering, over $1,000 on audio processing software costs, $500 on cover Art, and about $500 for promotion and shipping costs. (Believe it or not, recording costs are not included, as I recorded every note in my Brooklyn basement studio.) As I want to successfully reach the fundraising goal, I have decided to lower the asking amount. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, surpassing the goal will help compensate the musicians. These musicians, who happen to be very loyal friends, were only paid a small amount, and were supplemented with lots of dinners and recording favors. I am grateful for their generous support and would love to be able to give them added compensation. \r\n\r\nI am hoping you will contribute as much as possible to help get this project near or over $7,000!",

  "Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform. If we don't reach our goal, we will not receive a cent. Your credit cards won't be charged and no rewards will be sent out. Because of this we tried to be a bit conservative. While we have budgeted $6000 and we are confident we can make our record for that amount, there are often unforeseen obstacles that may change the budget or the timeline. As a donor you can rest assured that we are working constantly to make this a reality, but it's good to be aware that plans sometimes change and we may need to set a stretch goal or push the timeline back a bit. We don't think this will be likely, though!",

All while donating a portion of all sales to ending hunger & poverty.\n\nPeople and Partnerships\nCurrently we are operating as an online business utilizing on demand printing & dropship services. Eventually we would like to purchase a property on Route 201 that will allow for warehouse AND kitchen space plus a working restaurant. At that time we\u2019ll be hiring for a multitude of roles from maintenance to accounting. We could do many of these jobs ourselves and probably be pretty darn good at it, but that doesn\u2019t create jobs now does it?\n\nOur professional relationships span the country, though mostly New England based, and transcend our industry.

Finding a play-writer and novelist that share my vision and can bring some perspective to my work. Now I plan on having 3 different endings. The play should have one, the novel another but the movie may be a blend of both the play and novel or something completely different. Finding the 3 endings will be a challenge. A fun challenge, but a challenge none the less.\r\n\r\nOnce the money is in place and the scripts are complete, finding the actors to fill the play and films role, paying the actors and negotiating pay, booking the locations for the play, getting the word out, promotion, marketing, buying the wardrobe, renting the equipment and finding men and women to operate them. The novel will need a good publisher, paying for the prints. Copy-writing all 3 projects, building the interest through social media, local word of mouth, YouTube. Those are just some of the challenges that come with this project. \r\n\r\nI know what you're thinking. What makes me qualified? The truth is I am  not. This project is my passion and I will make a lot of mistakes in the process but the money will not be wasted. I have and associates degree in business administration and a passion for film and art. My creativity has led me to this path. This project is just the beginning. After all three stories have been produced the revenue from this will full the other projects that are in the works. The end game is to open Blue Journal Studios. This company will create opportunities for other artist, musicians, actors, directors, producers, etc. My goal is to make movies, music videos, commercials, TV Shows, books and any other form of art. My goal is to bring new forms of art to the world. To break the mold and destroy what is defined as the norm. My true challenge is to bring the world fresh perspective!",

  "Actors volunteering their time could mean availability issues during production. We have screened our actors in the audition process, and have confirmed their availability. Should they not be available for the filming dates, we have the option to work around their availability, or cast a more available actor.\r\n\r\nCostumes are largely a work in progress. We have contact with a large medieval costuming group based in Perth, and are hoping that with the help of a costume designer, we can use significantly more realistic costuming for the film.\r\n\r\nWeather could become an issue, heading into the winter months in Australia. Some rain may enhance our production, however if we are washed out, we have two weekends of filming scheduled, with a third available for emergencies.\r\n\r\nAs students, most of the essential film making equipment is available for us to borrow. Cameras, sound equipment, lighting equipment, grip gear, etc. is all available to us. We would ensure that it is booked in advance so there is no issues of availability.\r\n\r\nWe truly believe that we have explored our potential in making the proof of concept trailer, and that we have highlighted areas we would like to push ourselves further for the production of the film.

In our past year of operation, we have gained the knowledge necessary in order to be financially successful through mentorships with restauranteurs, business consultants and hands on direct operation of our company. Our success with underground dinner pop up's and parties landed us the opportunity to run a daily operation out of the Market South R&D Test Kitchen. At the R&D, we spent several months expanding our demographic fan base and pushing out some innovative treats for the ever expanding culinary scene.

Acquiring funding for a full-length album on top of raising funds for the book project has also been a challenge.  \n\nAlthough we are faced with many difficult barriers, we are working hard to make sure that our work gets out to our audience. We are collaborating with local businesses, networking with newfound connections, and we have been preparing our marketing and promotions strategies since day one.

This will also raise awareness of the cafe.  \n\nOur final challenge is dated kitchen, that although already in working order, needs to be updated for use in a commercial setting.

  "As many of you know, the risks and challenges associated with an independent start-up business are many. At this point, being terrified is not an option. In the beginning, my immediate challenge is to bring in enough business to keep the business going. Not only to sustain it, but to grow it with many new expenses I didn't have in my home. Which brings me to my next forseeable challenge of growing without compromising the quality of the product. Both these challenges will be addressed head on as they come with hard work and integrity.

  "The hardest part is over. I've composed all the songs (and then some) and chosen the cover songs. The album art and branding is conceptualized and cover art completed. \r\n\r\nRecording will not only be an immense pleasure, but will also serve to bring you more content (\"making of\" content and future content like music videos). Obstacles that may be unavoidable will be scheduling issues between me, the musicians, and the studios. Everyone in LA is busy and getting my pic of players to all be available at the same time that I am and a studio is...well, it'll be challenging. But it can be done. But I have all sorts of plan Bs: alternate musicians and studios will help to accommodate scheduling issues and alternate production approaches could help with both scheduling and budgeting issues that might come up. \r\n\r\nIt's also possible that more creative development will be needed on some of the songs. For instance, a new horn, string, or vocal arrangement might be needed and the need only revealed after the initial recording of the rhythm section. These things are normal and usually born out of the amazing life energy that a group of musicians breath into a song when recording together. \r\n\r\nThis is the only and most important creative project I'm invested in at the moment, but I have my studies, gigs, and students to juggle as well (and sometimes I sleep and do some laundry and clean the house :-).

  "We foresee a couple of possible risks: \n\n1. Printing time\nWe\u2019re working with some wonderful printers for the magazine, postcards and art prints. An unforeseen incident at one of their establishments could cause delays in the printing. \n\nHow we\u2019re planning for it: We will be ready to order the prints on 20th October, giving the printers as much time as possible, and we\u2019ve chosen printers who specialise in quick, short-run print jobs. \n\n2. Shipping time \nDecember is already the busiest time for postal services everywhere, but combine that with the consequences of Brexit, COVID-19 and the transport crisis, there may be delays in the shipping time. \n\nHow we\u2019re planning for it: We are buying ourselves a little extra time by sending the magazines to print in October, so we can get the assembly, packing and shipping started in the middle of November. This should ensure that even if all the magazines aren\u2019t received by 15th December as planned, there should be time for everyone to receive it by Christmas. \n\n3. Illness, emergencies and unforeseen events\nAs we are a very small team, any unforeseen events can cause trouble.  \n\nHow we\u2019re planning for it: \nWe\u2019re keeping healthy, wrapping up warm, taking vitamin C and being extra careful. \nAll the content and layout will be completed by day 3 of the Kickstarter campaign, so we won\u2019t be dependent on both of us being on top form to send the magazine to print. \nOur editorial assistant, Hannah, has been part of the project every step of the way and is ready to spring into action should something happen. \nWe have a number people ready to help with packing, shipping and fulfilment, so we are not dependent on any one individual being available.",

  "The Money\r\n\r\nOur budget ?\r\nWe have calculated \u00a330,000 would get us in and operating. Here's how...\r\n\r\nTimeline - We are looking at opening in approximately 6 months time pending licencing and planning approvals.\r\n\r\nLocation - We have our sights currently set on one of the units under the railway arches. This is in centre of Stalybridge with close proximity to rail, bus and road networks. However we will look at what properties are available at the end of the fundraising period, It will certainly be Stalybridge for sure. \r\n\r\nPledges - Your funding will help us make the following happen.\r\n. Building lease, licensing, and planning.\r\n. Kitchen and Bar fittings (including appliances and infrastructure)\r\n. Improve current toilet facilities to include disabled access\r\n. Initial Stock and Produce\r\n. Seating and dining areas\r\n. Decor and lighting.\r\n\r\nWhy Crowd-Funding?\r\nAlthough this may seem a big ask right now but we hope that with your investment we are able to create jobs locally as well as provide a space you can be proud of supporting from the very beginning. As this project will be built around our shared values we believe it is the very essence of community which is so prominent in Stalybridge.\r\n\r\nStalybridge is a town sandwiched between the Peak District National Park and Manchester with many transport links its is a perfect location to bring our vision to life and help add value to this town we love so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at business loans from banks we see a trend of short term investments. Banks and building societies often operate on a 3 - 5 year turn-around. Placing a lot of pressure on businesses to have that initial investment paid back. This often causes business to have to cut corners and under invest back into the business.

  "The first and most important part of this project is the digitizing, and there is ample money in the budget to accomplish this. There will be snags -- tapes will break, some material may be lost forever -- but getting it into digital form is the immediate goal. We have lined up several different recovery specialists, and failure by one will lead to hand-offs to another.\r\n\r\nThe greatest risk is that we experience more problems than expected with the analog tapes. In severe cases, the plan is to try to locate alternative sources. There are thousands of ex-Hip Pocketeers scattered around the world, and one of them may have the cassette of a show that otherwise is taking too many hours to digitize. This Kickstarter project will have the added value of exposing our predicament to all of those performers, stage hands, audience members, and backers that will now have a central focus -- recovering this material -- and we may receive many tapes from people with whom we've long lost touch. In other cases, we'll have to settle for fragmentary pages -- for example a show that has no audio record other than the original piano rehearsal tape recorded by Doug in his home studio. Making these choices will be the dominant activity by those of us immediately responsible for this project, and, of course, we will keep every one of our backers notified as we discover the state and demands of a given show.\r\n\r\nLoss of material by having to ship tapes is another obstacle, so we have selected local specialists for most of this work. We also will deliver the tapes (now secure in air-conditioned storage) in small lots to prevent unexpected loss due to theft, fire, incompetence, or other contingencies.\r\n\r\nAfter digitization, there are two major hurdles: first, the material must be annotated, labeled, and organized. Second, the website must be brought up. Much of the former is an act of love (read: no charge) by those who know this material well. But we must pay someone to organize and coordinate the tagging and final labeling, the metadata, cross-referencing, and the uploading. There is money in the budget to accomplish this if we're careful, but the contingency in the event that this task is underestimated is for each of us on this project to chip in the extra that will be required to get everything upload-ready. Luckily, once the material is digitized, this activity will be safer -- we'll be working from copies, and the digital version will not be degrading like the analog tapes are doing.\r\n\r\nThe final part is the website, and this requires technical skills (i.e., a webmaster) who can develop an effective and accessible website using content-management software. The domain names are already purchased, but there will be server costs (this is a lot of audio and video) and development costs. All of this is budgeted, but unexpected setbacks could delay the work. In such a case, we plan to go to our backers and ask their indulgence as we bring up a subset of the website -- something that they can see and touch and hear -- while we complete the rest in phases.",

  "The biggest risk at this time that I am facing is time itself.  The lease on the space runs out at the end of the month. It will take time to get the backing to fund for the purchase.  When I get the backing and I'm funded I can proceed with the purchase, pay the landlord for September and October rent and then start the process of pulling permits to start the renovations, apply for the required licenses, hire the contractors for the renovation and  installation of new equipment.  While that is taking place more time will be needed to recruit the kitchen staff, bar staff and wait staff.  Training will need to take place on the Point of Sales system, what is expected of the kitchen service, what is expected of bartending and waitstaff.  The purchase of stock can then begin to restock the bar, the kitchen and the kitchen staff can start working on their culinary skills to put out all the dishes on our menu.  We're going to have some well fed employees that week.  But I'm fearing the lease expiration may put me in a bad position, but then again, if my kickstarter can come through in less than 20 days, I'll be the proud new owner of The Fiskdale Tavern!!

  "Since nine original compositions are already recorded and the five additional are already written, this project is mainly about recording the last five songs and maybe a few of the nice previously recorded tracks.  Then it's about doing mixing, mastering, creating artwork, manufacturing and duplication. And promotion - if we surpass the $5,000 goal!   Based on years of experience in music recording, this process is very familiar to me.  \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge will be getting your rewards to you on time. As you might have noticed, the date displayed under each reward is an \"estimated delivery\" date. There may be changes in the schedule or unforeseen circumstances that may cause a delay in you receiving your reward, but we promise to do all we can to get your gifts delivered as close to the estimated delivery date as possible!\r\n\r\nThe actual fulfillment of the rewards will be somewhat of a challenge.... Although - we hope that we'll have a lot of rewards to fulfill - because that means we've done well!  Since my passion is to play music - anything involving playing music will be easy!   And I love painting - so that's an easy one too.  Cooking dinner will take some time - but I've enlisted great friends to help.  The biggest challenge will be anything involved in going to the post office....

  "There are two primary challenges associated with this campaign:\r\n1. Getting the C.D. printed in time for the C.D. release party.  This is always a concern based on the complexity of getting these projects through the assembly line of production in a timely manner.  We have given ourselves about a month to complete what usually takes 2 weeks.  Hopefully that will be enough of a cushion.  If they do not come in time, they will go out as soon as we get them!\r\n\r\n2. Getting Pandit Saha to Ann Arbor safely and in time for the C.D. release party.  Of coarse it is always a risk when you are dealing with international travel, especially when professional musicains are involved.

If things go wrong and he can not make it for some reason, we will most definitely reschedule and make it up to you!",

We ironed out all the unexpected kinks when we made Dear Lois Issue #1.

  "Any publication project runs the risk of delays and missing deadlines, which is why this Kickstarter campaign is being launched only two months before our projected release date, June 8th. To avoid some of the challenges we faced in Issue 1 (including pushing back our release date multiple times), we have scheduled our design and production phases more fastidiously, improved our responsiveness and organizational skills, and already communicated our specific needs and timeline to our printer.\n\nWe are currently working to diversify our funding sources for this project. We have a three-pronged approach: private donations, institutional and foundation grants, and publication sales. We have geared our crowd-funded goal towards pre-orders and merchandise, and intend for our tax-deductible patron program to ease the burden of these kinds of campaigns.",

  "We expect this to be a long and fun project for us.  Of course there will be difficulties along the way.  With my experience in running a real estate business and obtaining a bachelors degree in business, I feel that I can overcome these obstacles.  Of course I also have the help of my wife which is a huge bonus for me!  I don\u2019t know where I would be without her.\r\n\r\nBuilding from the ground up is our goal but depending on available funding we may rent a space which would be perfectly fine by us.  Barriers to entry is always an issue but I feel that as a business major (Bachelors Degree) I can overcome and properly market our brand.  As for startup costs, I have an idea in mind but there is always the risk of unexpected costs which could be a speed bump.  We would also need to obtain certain licenses from the city, I do not see this as a major problem since I have done it before.",

With that being said, we understand there are always risks - pin shipment being delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, the current economic climate, or manufacturing problems, etc. Though these occasions do occur in pin printing we assure you if any problem does occur, we\u2019ll make sure to update all backers right away and work diligently until the problem is solved and corrected.",

  "\"Miracle Year\" is in the home stretch, carried along by the enthusiasm that comes with creative binges. We're finally at that scary birth moment as we set out to present this music to a broader audience.\n\nThe risks and challenges come in various forms, both practical and artistic: \"Will there be the necessary money on hand to pay the inevitable expenses?\" \"Will this project matter to anyone besides us?\" \n\nHere is where we have to gratefully acknowledge Kickstarter for hope and assistance with both these questions. The money part is obvious: Kickstarter is providing a platform for this fund raiser by connecting us to you. The cool by-product of doing this fund-raising campaign is the formation of a little community of people, each with a wee stake in the project. Both these factors are comforting: we're not operating in a vacuum.\n\nThe other big challenge at this stage of the project is getting through the maze of indie recording issues, making sure we're dotting all the \"i\"s and crossing all the \"t\"s with publishing, distribution, royalties and the legalities involved. Having done this once before, it's not as daunting this time around. \n\nThen come the great musicians who play on \"Miracle Year,\" an international cast from Denmark, Wales, France, Portugal and the US.  Finally, the good folks at CD Baby and Bandcamp, the patron saints of indie music, will again be our one-stop shopping site for getting the album out there as a physical CD, digital download and stream-able music. \"Miracle Year\" is in good hands.\n\nOf course, the one risk that no one can insure against is whether this music will make it beyond our circle of friends and family. Even with that, I am comfortable in the knowledge that this project has been, from start to finish, a labor of love. \n\nThank you for your support and your advocacy of independent art!\n\n~Jim Gilkeson",

  "I have worked the costings out (including full insurance) and I only need 100 people to invest to get this off the ground, then just another 100 contributors for each following magazine and after that I have printers overseas organised to print and deliver with landing costs figured in, and Australia post organised for delivery. Then I think it will grow from  word of mouth and exposure online. There is no way to actually lose money on this project if you invest or for me as the publisher as it is a pre order pre paid orientated business set up. The times for delivery included an extra 2 weeks grace in case of a production problem or delivery delay also.",

  "Once the digital projection is obtained, the work begins to bring in first-run movies, web-based entertainment and sports broadcasts.  The challenge will be  to create an incredible offering for our community and for visitors to the North Fork Valley so that we can fill the theater's seats once again.\r\n\r\nWithout the digital upgrade the theater will go dark and the community will lose a very valuable asset and \"a chunk of our small town soul.\"",
  "Both the author and the executive producer/lead photographer have had prior book publishing experience. In fact, the author headed a publishing company and has authored multiple books. The photographer/executive producer published two similar high-quality illustrated books.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that the content to publish the book will be ready to hand off to the publisher by this September. Once the images and text have been submitted to the publisher, the design, editing, printing and related production activities are scheduled to be finalized by late 2016. Much of the photography has been completed. It is estimated that when the Kickstarter campaign concludes, about half of the stories will have been written. \r\n\r\nAs for the printing/production phase, the publisher intends to print the book in the United States, thereby avoiding any possible shipping and other production delays abroad.\r\n\r\nMany of the reward items for our donor partners are in stock and ready for shipment. A couple of the items will need to be printed soon after the actual required quantities are determined.",
  "Hardware\nWired BrakeAce sensors have been used extensively over the last 6 years around the world. Wireless sensors have been prototyped and will undergo improvements before going into production. Due to strategic partnership with proven power meter manufacturers, we are able to streamline wireless upgrades.

  "Yes, digital cinema is already on its way to Lewisburg.  An eight screen multiplex is being built a couple of miles out of town that will be fully state of the art, with all of the latest gadgets and accoutrements.  Though this definitely creates some challenges for us, it also opens the door for creative problem-solving.  Even with the prospect of eleven total screens operating in our area, there are still more than twice that number of feature films released each week; we might need to do more research and advertising on non-mainstream films to make sure we are providing our audiences with the best of what's available, but we can handle that.  Beer and wine will soon be added to our concession stand, for those of legal age, and we'll still be the most affordable entertainment around.  Being downtown, close to all of the amazing hops and restaurants that Lewisburg has to offer, is another bonus and makes dinner and a movie an attractive option.  We'll continue to show the movies our loyal patrons ask for at the lowest cost we can make available, that is a Lewis Theatre Guarantee.",

  "Two of the biggest challenges we face are making sure we have funding to bring these twisted visions to life and that we have enough time to do it well. In the haunt world, time is of the essence and building begins months before Halloween, as does hiring actors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe plan to begin building on May 21st, giving us just four and a half months to complete at least three buildings and go through the audition, hiring, and rehearsal process. We\u2019ve already been offered donations from previous haunts and have been using all our connections in and outside of the haunt world to bring together an amazing team of builders, designers, technicians, actors, and make up artists.

In reality 90% of them will say no. But there is 10% that will say yes. I just have to find that 10%! Law of averages are always an obstacle but I am determined and believe in my work, those who helped me on this. This is a great way I can reward them as well is to put a published copy in their hands as a big thank you!",

  "This is our second Kickstarter project, and we successfully produced and fulfilled our first Kickstarter campaign, the Low Poly Sharks. Thus, we guarantee that your rewards will arrive in a timely manner. However, some unexpected production delays or challenges out of our control may occur. For example, due to printing limitations, colors may change slightly from pictures depicted in this Kickstarter campaign, and some cards may not have perfect registration. In addition, shipping delays out of our control may occur, due to the ongoing Covid -19 pandemic. We picked a relatively conservative estimated delivery date, so it should take into account any unexpected delays in the production of our playing cards. If the project has not reached fulfilment by the estimated delivery date, we will continuously update backers with the situation. Please also note that any international backers, those living outside of the United States, are responsible for any and all import fees that may arise, though we will try to minimise these fees.\n\nWe plan to frequently contact backers through updates and offer assistance as much as possible throughout the entire process. However, we hope you understand if some complications arise along the way. If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact us by messaging us directly through Kickstarter, emailing us at unrivaleddecks@gmail.com, or messaging us on Instagram @unrivaleddecks.

  "DMAC styles are fully vetted, fit approved with production facilities, warehousing, fulfillment and customer service pieces in place. While the best laid plans sometimes go awry, we are confident that the delivery date will be met as we are leveraging 15 year factory relationships in cooperation with an established knitwear manufacturer.\r\n\r\nSizing \u2013 DMAC styles are a European or athletic fit, i.e. they are more trim than a typical American. With that in mind, if you're on the fence size-wise, it is suggested that you size up as the fabric does not have much give to it.\r\n\r\nFabric \u2013 The styles shown are a boiled wool/poly blend. The fabric is fantastic and is very structured (i.e. stiff) with little to no give. It has a \"wool\" hand, meaning it may feel slightly scratchy to some with sensitive skin. Some pilling should be expected, which is normal for wool. Please be aware of this as you commit.\r\n\r\nRewards \u2013 Specific sizes and colors are limited to stock on hand. In some cases we may need to provide an alternate style or color.",
  "We are ready to roll!!! The Downtown Dirty venture is not our first rodeo. We have successfully launched products on direct retail television: The YOU Fragrance Collection by Matt Titus on HSN and are about to launch FITNATION\u2019s FlexCore8 on QVC. \r\n\r\nWe also have been able to generate massive PR for our products, such as a feature of the YOU Collection by Matt Titus in Page Six of The New York Post, as well as a tweeted endorsement by Idina Menzel. We feel that our overall social media presence and our ability to feature new brands on all forms of traditional and new media will give Downtown Dirty a great chance at success!\r\n\r\nOnce we decided to move forward with our first collection, we met with a professional seamstress who has worked in the trenches of NYC factories for the past 5 years. Her knowledge and connections within the industry proved to be invaluable.  She created the dye lines and secured a pattern maker for the first run of samples. \r\n\r\nGaining access to Maker's Row, a portal for manufacturing that allows limited quantity orders for start-up companies entering the fashion industry, enabled us to cost-compare locally-sourced factories, fabric wholesalers, digital labels and secondary packaging. Shipments will be handled internally or through a 3rd party vendor to ensure the highest level of customer service and delivery of goods. Our packaging will come from a factory that utilizes 100% recycled materials, which is part of Downtown Dirty\u2019s initiative. Samples have been made. We have an NYC factory specializing in undergarments that will be handling all of our manufacturing once our campaign is fully funded.\r\n\r\nWe GOT THIS!!!",

  "As with any business endeavour, although we have received plenty of support from the local community, ultimately the success of this project depends on its appeal to locals and visitors alike. \r\n\r\nEthnoastronomy, or the study of astronomy in culture, has gained quite a following over the last decade, the same as the tourism industry on Rapa Nui, which is set to welcome 110.000 visitors this year. Although the island functions as a giant open-air museum with several monumental archaeological sites, there are few activities offered for the evenings or as an alternative for cancellations due to rain showers. We have talked to local travel agents, all of whom are interested in adding the planetarium to their programs. \r\n\r\nOur planetarium is built to receive 15-20 guests per viewing, and we can function economically as long as we get a minimum of 15 people a day. At first, we will show a documentary we designed specifically for the planetarium, which showcases everything we know about Rapanui archaeoastronomy, within a regional and local context. The Bishop Museum Planetarium in Hawaii is also supplying us with one of their films. Initially, there will be four showtimes, two in English and two in Spanish. Later on, we may add more languages, and with a greater budget, we may also add our own films about specific subjects such as Polynesian navigation, or the Rapanui annual cycle of activities.  \r\n\r\nRegarding our commitment to education, co-founder Barthelemy d'Ans has supplied 8 UNESCO planetarium videos directed at students of specific age groups.  These are to be viewed for free. Local teachers are excited at the prospect. Hopefully, other community members will become interested in the planetarium once they learn of its existence and will pay us a visit or two and/or bring other family members and friends. \r\n\r\nAs for the research, the same as with any scientific investigation, we can only theorise what the results will be, nevertheless it is already quite clear that evaluating the collected data within the context of a digital planetarium (permitting the review and identification of alignments between astronomical phenomena and sites of observation as if viewed in situ and in the pertinent chronology) together with photogrammetry/3D-modelling of astronomical devices, are techniques that offer a new and more precise line of research. \r\n\r\nOur team is composed of very talented individuals, each with ample experience in the capacity that they are providing for the planetarium. We are confident that the quality of our product will be able to \u201csell itself.\u201d We have already received offers from astrophotographers who would like to do workshops for the planetarium, as well as free publicity in different Chilean magazines, and a great deal of support in social media platforms. \r\n\r\nAll who pledge will receive a copy of our budget breakdown as proof of the transparency of the Pacific Islands Research Institute and we will answer any questions regarding our expenses at any time.\r\n\r\n**Photo of the Milky Way at Anakena beach by Yuri Beletsky**",

  "In its current state, the circuit board is near final. The only adjustment planned is one minor update to make it more robust against outside static shocks. The case you see in the photos is from the molds I plan to use in mass production. There are still some minor adjustments I plan to make to the molds to make a few of the parts fit better. The keypad is a custom design, and I believe it to be final except for possible color changes. I have selected a screen supplier. The software is fully functional, and I have no known changes planned, but I have time in the schedule for some updates if people come up with ideas to improve the software.\n\nIn general, I have suppliers for all the parts needed and have price quotes for the range of quantities I might need. Overall, this product is far along in development, and I believe I should be able to deliver it at the price and timeframe I've set up for this Kickstarter.\n\nThat said, there are risks that could cause this project to be delayed or even fail. I have a lot of experience in manufacturing and shipping. I know there can be delays for both. Current world events have created shortages in many items. The biggest shortage affecting this project is shortages in many electrical components. I have talked with my suppliers and incorporated their current lead times into the schedule for this Kickstarter. The delivery timeframe for certain electrical components is many months longer than it would have been in normal times.  The long lead time for certain electrical components is the primary reason I put such a long time until delivery.\n\nIf you look at my previous Kickstarter campaigns, you'll see I have a good track record. That said, I will delay shipping if a major issue with quality is found. I would rather delay shipping than ship a defective product.",

  "This is our tenth Kickstarter campaign, during these years we\u2019ve gained the expertise and know-how to confidently produce high quality games the way we envision them.\nNonetheless we\u2019ve also learned production, quality control and shipping are delicate phases that can bring unexpected issues that may take some time to solve. For this reason the delivery date, March 2023, is an estimate. While we will do everything in our power to meet this date or even anticipate it, we are aware that slight delays are possible for reasons outside of our control. Also, exact delivery dates could vary depending on where you live.\nIf you have any question, concern or issue write to support@tabula.games and we will be happy to assist you.\nBy pledging for this project you accept the following terms:\nGeneral Terms:\n- This is not a pre-order and the final product may be subject to changes and improvements from what is presented here to ensure smoother production and logistics. This includes every aspect of the game, from miniature design to artworks and layouts.\n- We will only answer to support requests from our backers. If you got the game somewhere else (reseller, friend, group pledge, etc.) you will have to contact us through them.\n- After 30 days from the delivery date to your door, we will not accept complaints related to the game box contents of this campaign (missing components, damaged components, etc.).\n- After 6 months from the shipment date, we will not accept complaints related to the shipment of items of this campaign (damaged package, lost or missing contents, etc.).\n- After 12 months from the shipment date, we will not accept any complaints related to this campaign.\nRefunds:\n- An order can be canceled and fully refunded before the end of the campaign by clicking on the applicable button on Kickstarter.\nAfter the end of the campaign, the order can still be fully refunded (fees included) within 14 days by sending us an email with your cancellation request. Please note that if you request a refund after this time window, it will not include the processing costs and Kickstarter fees, which will be deducted from your total. Apart from the cases specified here, the order is considered valid and is not refundable.\nCommercial invoices for retailers:\nFor fiscal reasons, the commercial invoice should be requested at the same time of the order, by providing your complete company data to \"retailers@tabula.games\". European retailers should also mention their VAT number.\nShipping:\n- It\u2019s ultimately your responsibility to respond to our post-campaign survey to claim your rewards and to give us information about your shipping address and add-on choices. If you ignore our Last Call notification for more than 4 weeks we will consider your pledge a donation and we won\u2019t be able to ship you a reward.\n- We will communicate the Address Lockdown date in an update and on that date we will lock all your addresses and forward all delivery information to our fulfillment partners. This means we will be unable to make any kind of change to your address. If you think your address might change during the delivery period we advise you to have the game shipped at another address you trust (friend, relative, workplace, etc.).\n- If the game fails to arrive because of your mistake (wrong address, recipient absent, failure to pick up at courier/postal warehouse, etc.), any additional shipping/warehousing cost for us to re-send/re-deliver your game will be your responsibility. This also includes the costs associated with returning the game. If after investigation it becomes clear that the error was on our part, we will resend your package at our expense.\n- If the package is lost, destroyed or damaged, the carrier will be held solely responsible. Any customer claim to the carrier needs to be made at the time of delivery, not later. If the package seems damaged, please ask the postal carrier to make you a receipt \"accepted with reserve\".\n- Please note that we will not reship any game without first investigating what happened to the first shipment.\n- If your game arrives with missing or damaged components, provide us with proof and we will substitute them once we have verified the damage.\n- We currently have agreements with our fulfillment partners to ensure that no custom taxes will be charged for shipments in USA, EU, UK, CA, AU. However if between the end of our campaign and the start of fulfillment governments decide to impose new tariffs or taxes about imports we might be forced to adjust to the new policies.\n- If you live outside of the USA, EU, UK, CA, AU customs taxes may be added. Please check your country's rules and regulations as this aspect will not be our responsibility.\nIf you are not comfortable with these terms, please do not participate in this Kickstarter Campaign.",

I want to make sure you receive the highest quality products so we need 3 months for manufacturing, especially with the complexity of the styles. This time also allows us to order our fabrics by giving our mills lead-time to produce yardage to be used for responsible American manufacturing. \r\n\r\nFULFILLMENT: Because we are manufactured in the USA, we are eliminating the risk of shipment and production delays by being able to communicate directly with our vendors.

  "The event is scheduled on 16 May, Saturday - the most popular day of the week for the events. This risk is that I might not have enough time to book the place. On the other hand there are might be issues with flight booking for artists.\r\nIn any case, I will not give up my ideas and organize an event as soon as possible, in the most favorable time.",

  "The MiniDisc format is a new one for me, but one I am happy to explore. The music, creative writing, and j-card layout are complete and ready and I've already been in touch with the MiniDisc manufacturer. The risk this time around is specifically the MiniDisc itself; having never made one before, I don't know what hoops I may have to jump through to properly pull this off. I think everything is covered, but weird things can happen. I'll share updates and info throughout the manufacturing and fulfillment process.",
  "This album is low risk because the music is already recorded and at the very least can be delivered digitally. It may be a bit more experimental than some of my listeners are used to but at its core it is an excellent traditional vocal album that remains accessible.",

  "One problem I can see occurring is that I do not raise the money I think I will need to fund this project.  I think I will need $200,000 to make a high-quality movie that can do well in the movie theatres next year.  If this happens, I plan to keep seeking the funds until they come in so we can make the best movie possible.\r\n\r\nAnother problem I can see happening is having a tough time having actors commit to this film or to have have family members of deceased actors commit to be a part of the film.  However, I don\u2019t see this being too big of an issue.  One acting coach I know has a son who has had a lot of success in Hollywood and I am sure both of them will be more than happy to be a part of this film, once it gets started",
  "The first thing we are trying to accomplish on our new trail are 3 walking bridges. The challenges are we have 3 creeks that run in different areas that we can't get around. So before we can build any scenes, the bridges have to be built and completed. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge is that one of the ditches that needs a bridge over it is 4 feet deep and when it rains it floods and that's why a bridge is needed.",
  "Storage:\nWe want creators to publish beautiful images, videos, and more without the worry of compression hindering what viewers see or hear. Storage would end up being very expensive if we let everyone upload unlimited uncompressed files. To combat the risk of running out of storage, we will be limiting the amount of storage users have each month. It will apply to all files until we develop an on-site compression feature. Purchasing a subscription will increase this monthly limit\n\nUsernames:\nUsernames are so wonderful but can be frustrating when you can't grab the right one. This initiated our idea for a username alternative, the Distinctive Origin Tag (DOT). When you sign up for your first Dive service, we will generate a random four-digit alphanumerical code in place of a username. Usernames are so mainstream we are aware that this risk may turn away new users. We hope to turn over a new leaf where short, memorable codes will work just as well as custom usernames. Display names will still be modifiable\n\nImpersonation:\nBy default, everyone will acquire a randomly generated DOT to share their profile with others. If, however, a user on the platform is in a place where others are likely to take advantage of their identity, we have a verification system that will give the user two benefits. First, they will receive a verification badge, similar to what you might find on another social media platform. Second, they will receive a custom DOT, helping to distinguish their authentic profile from fake ones",

All fabric is ordered and scheduled to arrive in mid-October, just as the campaign finishes. Factory time at a reputable New York factory familiar with producing for Kickstarted brands is already scheduled and a deposit for the time has been paid. \r\n\r\nWe feel confident about our timeline, but there is always a risk that deliveries from our multiple, international vendors don\u2019t make it on time. These possible delays could affect our production schedule. If we run into any problems we promise to communicate with complete transparency and honesty. \r\n\r\nWe will do our best to help you select the correct size. If inventory allows we will offer exchanges but you will have to pay for the additional shipping. We will not offer refunds on Kickstarter rewards. \r\n\r\nWe are serious about taking good care of you, the people who believe in us enough to help us launch The Willary and are happy to answer any questions about our product.

  "Although I have direct experience in self-produced CDs (Farewell to Ireland, 2011), I have not worked with CD Baby before. I hope my high expectations and particular preferences will fit with this company to produce a high-quality CD album. A further concern I have is that, since the audio tracks were recorded live 15 years ago and mixed on the spot, there is no opportunity today for adjusting individual sounds of the different instruments: what you hear is what you get! However, some fine-tuning is possible to adjust overall sound quality and I am thrilled to have discovered the Everest Witman studio which will be using state-of-the-art sound equipment and direct experience in mastering contra dance music.",
  "This is our third Kickstarter and we have a pretty good handle on what we're doing. Unlike many publishers, we ensure everything is as close to 100% complete before launching a Kickstarter. This means that our backers tend to receive rewards significantly more quickly than with other Kickstarters. \n\nThat being said, there are some risks that are out of our control and could impact our desired delivery timing. These include: Shipping, Customs and Production delays. By far, the biggest concern for us are shipping and customs delays. The global supply chain is still catching up and we are seeing lots of packages getting stuck in customs for weeks and sometimes months.   We work with Fulfillrite, one of the largest fulfillment companies in the world with expertise on getting packages to destinations globally so, we're ensuring everything has the best possible chance of reaching its destination quickly.",
  "Crooked Dice is a successful manufacturer of miniatures and rules, so we have over a decade of experience of designing and producing models. This will be our tenth kickstarter - with all previous campaigns delivered successfully.\n\nCasting of all pewter figures will be completed by Griffin Moulds and resin pieces by Model Display Products, both who are renowned for the high quality and ability to deliver on schedule, and have strong and established working relationships with Crooked Dice. STLs have been tested and run on multiple FDM and SLA printers and production of any physical products will be done by Proteus3D.\n\nWe have allowed additional time for delivery to account for the current COVID-19 pandemic. While the situation remains uncertain, all figures have already been mastered to ensure the highest quality standards, and are ready for production casting as soon as the campaign closes.  \n\nIn the case of any delays outside our control - please be assured that your money is in safe and professional hands, and you will be updated regularly as to the situation.",
  "I've got three big projects successfully delivered now, and each has taught me its own lessons! I'm pretty happy managing project delivery at this point, so the general running of the project isn't particularly daunting.\n\nThere are two big things to raise, though:\n\nFirstly, as with previous projects, this project will primarily be delivered by individuals and small teams. This is great\u2014we support small businesses and friends, and they help us make a better product. However, it also makes us really susceptible to illness and other disruptions, as we don't have a lot of backup options when things go wrong. Outside of something really disruptive, I will always choose to support my fellow creatives and makers rather than look for a last-minute alternative. I am at peace with this trade-off, and I hope you'll understand if things take longer than expected to get delivered.\n\nSecondly, this is the first time I'll be printing part of the game in another country. I don't think we'll face any huge hurdles here as we're not looking at freight shipping or anything of that scale, but it's something to consider. I've baked in some extra time to account for delays with customs, and I'm also considering my options for EU-friendly shipping since the decks are being produced within the EU.",
  "We will make every effort to ensure that the constructed sign stays safe and sound for as long as possible.  However, we cannot assume the risks of possible damage or total loss of the PEACE sign and accompanying elements of the structures due to the actions of government authorities, natural disasters, military action, regular illegal actions of third parties, or changes of law directly impacting our project on which the PEACE sign is built.\r\nWe will provide technical support for the project until the Google Maps photo appears, but not for more than two years; however we cannot guarantee that satellite photos will be taken of the area during that time (although judging by statistics the probability is close to 100%). At the same time, the sign structure itself could potentially exist for decades. We also cannot guarantee that there won't be clouds or other interference at the time the satellite photo is taken where the PEACE sign is (although now the satellite maps discard photographs with clouds, and such probability is very low).",
  "Establishing a circus arts training space is exhilarating. However, we also realize just how much work is involved. We have spent hundreds of hours of our time establishing membership,safety, and insurance policies. We also have been researching organizations with similar nonprofit models, as well as handling much of the physical labor ourselves. \r\n\r\nEven though this task is challenging and sometimes even daunting; we are confident that we can handle all of the hurdles that lie ahead of us.  We are confident that FlightMotion Studios will grow and become a staple in the Omaha community as well as a thriving nonprofit.\r\n\r\nTo avoid falling behind on rent utilities, we have implemented a system that produces income from three sources: class and workshop rental space, club meeting rental time, and individual training memberships.\r\n\r\nIn building the necessary proper flooring we have found volunteers and professionals in the fields of safety and carpentry. They will help us install triple padded hard wood flooring that will be less harsh on the ankles, hips, and knees.\r\n\r\nIn addition to having a overly generous amount of crash pads and safety knots we will also be establishing a structural engineering review that will allow for safety rated aerial rigging.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, we seek to acquire top-notch circus arts training insurance.\r\n\r\nWe cannot stress this enough!

  "There are a lot of challenges when creating Cosplay. Specially when making your own. It takes time, effort and hard work. There can be delays in ordering specific things, also trying to brainstorm what and how you want your Cosplay to look. People like myself seek perfection, if I don't think it's 100% then I've failed. I always push my limits because I know I can do better. Another delay can be photographers; searching for the right photographer and once the photos are done you have to wait for them to finish.\r\n\r\nAfter my project is successfully funded, I believe the only challenge is waiting for certain things to arrive in the mail, and getting the right photographer and when for my photos to be edited, and printed.\r\n\r\nIf there is any setback then I will let everyone immediately if I know there will be a problem.

  "Kickstarter goal. \nWe set a funding goal aligned with the manufacturing MOQ. Based on our interactions with the community and the following we have created so far, we feel this is very achievable and expect to reach funds raised a multiple of our goal. Our theme might be perceived as not \"typical\" for board games, but we have experienced the energy transition has actually become a very hot theme, which people are well aware of. Also, it makes for a very exciting game play! \n\nTeam. \nCreating a game is a lot of work, before, during and after a Kickstarter campaign. We realize that. Ensuring continuity and delivering on timelines is crucial. Therefore, we are currently working with a team of 7 from various backgrounds to ensure this project will become a great success. Next to this core team we are supported by group of volunteers that help us on specific topics, such as the presence we had at Spiel and Spellenspektakel. \n\nArt. \nArtwork is an essential part of the project. Therefore we have an art director in our team, supported by specialists in, e.g., DTP. The art is already very close to its final form, although before going into production we will still incorporate learnings from the Kickstarter community and feedback we have received during playtesting, for example at Spiel and Spellenspektakel. We realize that making all designs print ready requires serious work. We already manufactured a series of 20 prototypes, which we are currently using for reviewers, playtesting and marketing purposes, where we went through the full process of making all artwork print ready. \n\nGame Experience. \nWe have playtested the game well over 300 times and we will continue doing so until and during the Kickstarter. We are very happy with the positive feedback we keep on receiving. By now, any possible issues regarding unclarity of rules, edge cases and balancing have been identified. These are already within acceptance, but we will stay open to suggestions for further improvement. \n\nManufacturing & Fulfilment. \nCurrently, there are obviously global supply chain challenges in most industries and the board game scene is no exception. We see this as a serious challenge and will do all we can, to be prepared for any raw material or supply chain issues and have open discussions about this with our partners. In our pricing, we have left some room for raw material price increases that might happen between the Kickstarter launch and the production order.\n\nWe have done a thorough research of the whole manufacturing process and all the major manufacturers. Local (European) production and sustainability where key metrics in our choice for a manufacturer (see also the paragraph on \u201cSustainability\u201d). In that light, we are very happy to announce that we have chosen Ludo Fact as our manufacturer. Ludo Fact has made sustainability a priority. Next to that, Ludo Fact obviously has a wealth of experience and they continue to guide and advise us on the whole process. Thanks to that, we believe the produced games will live up to the high quality expectations we set.\n\nFor the fulfilment of our product we will choose an experienced partner.

  "With over 40 years of experience performing death-defying escapes, I have faced and overcome challenges of every sort.  I have been locked, hanged, tied and submerged in countless ways.  As a result, I have come to learn to be exacting in my preparation. Failure to do so could have a drastic consequence.\r\n\r\nWhile rare, specific risks and challenges include: re-casting roles in the event of illness or unexpected necessity to be absent for the performance, re-designing the set/rigging/costumes due to unforeseen complications or limitations of space, and changes in venue or date.\r\n\r\nMy personal pledge to you, however, THE SHOW MUST GO ON!!!",
  "The greatest challenge for our project will be attendance at the event.  Our target goal is for 100 attendees to join the conference.  This number ensures we have the resources to host two more conferences within a year and will create sustainability for the life of our non-profit.  \n\nThis is another reason we have focused on a state-specific conference.  Texas, under SB-11, requires schools to develop Threat Assessment Teams and support students in crisis.  The topic of our first conference will be: Evidence-Based School Violence Prevention & Preparedness.  Targeting a Texas audience with a topic related to current state mandates will allow Academe Grove to increase conference attendance and exceed our goal.",
  "We have tried to eliminate as many risks as possible by working hard on the designs and making sure we have samples looking and feeling the way we want them to.\r\n\r\nOne risk might that we are moving into a congested apparel market but we feel we have got a nice edge to our designs with a niche passionate market.\r\n\r\nWe have over 10 years experience in sourcing and manufacturing and we have applied these skills and planning to this project.\r\n\r\nYou cant eliminate all risk but we have planned for contingency and reduced the chance of surprise.",

  "The challenge with any independent artist who hopes to create art of depth and diversity is that it simply will never be born.  Record labels and money for projects have dwindled; streaming services pay fractional, antiquated rates, CD's are mostly dead, and vinyl is still a collectors market.  The middle-class vanished in the music business world long before it was walloped in the economy at large.  And in the last decade alone I've watched my longtime record label Red House Records go bankrupt, watched dozens of my friends sink countless hours and resources into passion projects that never got off the ground. I've seen many artists I know simply have to quit pursuing a skill and trade they devoted their lives to furthering because they bear the burden alone; I've also witnessed first hand the triumph of people rallying behind an artist / record, and enabling that art to transform the world in ways both big and small.  \n \nFor a songwriter, bearing the full financial weight of recording, paying musicians, paying engineers, mixing the tracks, mastering the tracks, paying visual artists fairly for record art, paying videographers, directors, and photographers fair wages for their contributions, and finally paying for the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of a record is staggering.  And this is just to get the product made, like the farmer harvesting his crop; the journey of a musician from field to market, however joyful and nourishing, is often dangerous to the point of life-threatening.  (15 years of winter touring & travel and dozens of close calls will attest to this).\n \nDebt cripples the artist and restricts their ability to contribute in meaningful ways, and without the support of people like you it will eventually leave this profession to the very, very rich or the very, very lucky.  My accumulated debt from my last solo record was upwards of $25,000; an extremely hefty burden that I have the need to assuage and ask for help with this time if I am to remain viable. \n\nEvery single person who is involved in this project has I know for a fact in their musical career been taken for granted, lied to, chumped around, under-paid, not paid, and done countless favors for the music and the ones they love.  I would like to change that narrative, and spread resources around that all my collaborators can benefit from.  This record is evidence of passion, and of keeping your heart intact.  If you can find the room and time enough to make a contribution to this record, I will use it to lift up this musical community, to finish this record without creative compromises, and to channel this spirit of activism and protection into the places where people fall in love with music and each other.",

  "With Kickstarter, if I don't meet the minimum, I get nothing, so to be safe, I set my goal at the lowest possible number needed to continue Folded Map and start its website. Since last year, I have made significant financial sacrifices to create Folded Map including going part-time at my full-time employment as well as borrowing video and audio equipment from my friends at City Bureau plus having my wonderful friend, Juliet Dervin, donate her videography and editing services. PLEASE, DON'T be discouraged to pledge just because I hit my goal. Many other Kickstarter projects go over their funding goal because people believe in them & what they will do. If YOU believe in me and the continued impact of Folded Map, don't hesitate! I will greatly appreciate all the *extra* help I can get!",

The dance groups also have those who are able to fill in, already knowing the dance routines.  \r\n\r\nFood preparation:  We have recruited more volunteers than potentially need for food preparation and serving.  We realise that it is close to Christmas and we need to have those who can step in should others need to cancel.  \r\n\r\nExcellence and quality of show:  Out performers tour and will be performing shows that they know very well.  The 'Christmas is Painful' will be the final event for 2012 .  We will need to ensure artists' momentum are high and that they too have all the support needed.

  "We are so excited about our plans for a National Tour and the opportunity to share our message with people all across America that we don't want to even think about the prospect of not reaching our goals; but like all well thought out plans we have to take our challenges into consideration and hit them head on.  The biggest challenge we face is securing performance space in the cities in which we plan to perform so if we are unable to secure space at the large theaters we have built a network of college contacts and plan to contact the theater departments to secure performance space.  After all, the show must go on!!!   Another challenge is travel expenses, because we are  dedicated to the show we are willing to use our own funds to get to a show.  We practice at least three to four times a week for three hour sessions; so we are no stranger to hard work.   We will appreciate every dollar you donate to support our National Tour.  \"The Secrets of Naci-rema\" can come to a theater near you; just gather your friends and tell them about  The Truth Urban Theater Group",
  "We are confident that we are very well-prepared. Our first Aeon Trespass campaigns, Aeon Trespass: Nymphs and Aeon Trespass: Eschaton, were great successes. We managed to deliver them in record time, even though we had to produce a considerable amount of stretch goals. We even provided a better shipping solution than the one we initially offered. Our giant Kickstarter campaign for Aeon Trespass: Odyssey, just as the rest of the industry, has faced unprecedented challenges due to the ongoing global COVID pandemic, lockdowns, container logistics crisis, the energy crisis and the instability of the paper materials market. Still, we prevailed, streamlined our processes and packed even more content than promised! We have already delivered its wave 0 and are set to deliver the Core Game in the coming weeks.

  "Project: \r\nThe main challenge with this project is time. For once, and as I have found, it can justifiably be said that time really is of the essence when capturing the stories and memories of people in later life. But that\u2019s what Remarkable Lives is all about. Another more practical challenge is the requirement for me to travel to my subjects (I can\u2019t really ask them to come to me!), but this is another reality of the project I\u2019ve built in to the timeline.\r\n\r\nRewards:\r\nThe designer and printing house are in place and are local, which will afford a more manageable and of course sustainable process. There are many stories already recorded which provide a solid foundation upon which to add the new Remarkable Lives. So the main obstacle to overcome is the funding. If I raise over \u00a315,000 then production of the rewards is guaranteed to go ahead.",

No complicated rewards, no overreaching stretch goals - just the game and a few bonuses that only rely on me to deliver.\n\nBut that said this is my first card game and first Kickstarter campaign, so I'm learning a lot, and I'll probably make mistakes. Luckily I've got incredible support from colleagues who have already completed successful Kickstarter campaigns as well as the fantastic community out there that I've pestered so much with my questions and requests over the past year. \n\nBut if you've got any questions or worries, please get in touch!",

  "Film as we know, is a tricky business and we want to give you peace of mind that Black Mass will be made. But as Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform, we need to hit our target goal if the film is to head into production. But we are confident that with your help, we can smash our goal and bring this film to life. \n\nOnce we meet our target, we go straight into production, with our shoot pencilled in for mid-April, so there is absolutely no chance that this film doesn't get made if fully funded. We've put a lot of work into Black Mass so far, and we want to see this film come to life more than anyone. So we will continue to put work in night and day to bring you this ambitious project.\n\nThe perks. Some of the perks such as social media shout outs and behind the scenes content will be delivered straight away. However you will have to wait a little longer for those awesome DVD bundles and download links, reason being is post production on Black Mass is going to take a good few months with all the editing, grading, music and VFX we need to put in to ensure we deliver the best film possible. We will aim to deliver all perks by the dates listed, however in some cases we can't guarantee that we will make the delivery dates suggested. This may be for several reasons, for example, should we be selected for a top genre festival, (and we are aiming for the biggest!) we may have to hold off a little longer before sending out the completed film due to Premiere regulations.\n\nHowever, we PROMISE we'll do everything in our power to get those amazing perks out on time and we will absolutely keep you updated every single step of the way. Our backers, supporters and fans are our number one priority and we will ensure we deliver you the best possible horror film we can. A film we promise you'll be proud to be a part of.

  "We need a great deal of help from cast and crew to make the film come alive and there are plenty of challenges and risks to overcome. Shooting the film in Derbyshire is a challenge as we are London based (as are most of the cast and crew), so travelling up North for a succession of days with our team is something we've yet to have dealt with.\u00a0\r\n\r\nShooting in the forest with a cast, crew and camera gear / lighting always has its problems, but as with SHELL (2017) \u2013 shooting in busy streets, on the London underground etc \u2013 we are confident we can overcome any obstacles as not to affect our shooting schedule and the making of the film.\r\n\r\nFinally, we are reliant on the cold (snowy) weather of the North of England for the shoot, so cannot give a definitive shoot date for the project and therefore no definitive date for the Premiere screening (as post production can be a slow process\u2026), but we are aiming to shoot Feb 2019 and fully complete the film for a screening around early Spring 2019.",

We\u2018ve tried our best to minimize risks, though; and we\u2019re pretty sure we\u2019ll manage to deliver a result that will satisfy all our backers (and all genre fans).\r\nFinancially, we\u2018re on the safe side. We\u2018ve put in a few tens of thousands of personal funds, stemming from inheritances as well as from years of working hard. We\u2019ve also managed to find a handful of private investors who decided to give us loans. \r\nAnd, probably most important, we\u2018ve convinced federal German HessenFilm to support us with a substantial grant. Therefore, principal production of DEATHCEMBER is 100% funded.\r\nArtistically, we\u2018ve taken precautions. We've commissioned not 24 but 27 short films. Thus, should any of our 24 first-chosen directors fail to deliver, we will have 3 films ready to jump in and replace theirs. \r\nWhat\u2019s more, we've already accumulated quite a bit of interest in DEATHCEMBER in the worldwide film market. Two world sales companies and a number of acclaimed international film festivals have signed letters of intent with us. \r\nJust like us, they can\u2019t wait to see what our finished movie will look like.

They are arguably the best company for independent releases like this, and they manage everything from CD production to digital distribution, registration, and more. \n\nThe shirts will be manufactured by a reputable screenprinter, on soft shirts in various sizes.

We want this thing to be a \"by Edmonton, for Edmonton\" project we see as a love letter to our hometown, and anything that arises will be overcome by our sheer love of Edmonton. \n\nAnd as we all know, taking a risk is The Most Edmonton thing you can do. \n\nThanks for all you support!",
  "As most of the images for the project have already been taken, there are only two small risks the project may become delayed and not ready by late March or early April 2015. One risk is that as more people are interested in being part of the project, I try and include everyone who wants to be included. To counteract this, the person who will professionally design and put the e-book together, will have negotiated deadlines for me to submit all photographic images and content. Anything submitted late, runs the risk of not being included. \r\nThe second risk is that the person who is professionally designing and creating the e-book, will be delayed with other work commitments. We have sat down and put together a conservative timeline for the book to be ready, which takes into account how busy the designer can be. I am confidant that our conservative approach will mean that book will be released on time, if not sooner.",

  "HOW YOU CAN HELP\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a lot of work and a crazy journey, but Itsy Bitsy is almost complete. With all of the movie shot and finished the film now has to go through the costly process of postproduction, which includes editing, sound design, and coloring, just to name a few. Having been a postproduction specialist before Micah knows the importance of these processes and the hard work that goes into them. After that comes costs associated with film festivals, distribution, and other things to make sure as many people as possible see (and are terrified by) Itsy Bitsy.\r\n\r\nThis movie has been more than a decade in the making and it\u2019s so close to being finished. Micah and the creative team just need a little bit of your help to make it happen.\r\n\r\nPlease join us in finishing up the journey and share our love for classic horror movies and creature features and support independent film, young filmmakers, and, of course, Itsy Bitsy.",
  "Recording projects have a great deal of moving parts, and timelines can easily be shifted if someone gets sick, if someone in the chain of various engineers falls behind, if hired player schedules don't line up, etc. Furthermore, Chris and the crew have incredibly high standards for themselves, and will not cut corners on the capture of great performances.\n\nThat said, I've made some records, I've learned from accomplishments and setbacks alike, and I'm really confident that this one is going to be my best work to date. My studio is running on a brand spanking new Mac, with a Universal Audio interface, and whisper quiet HVAC. Nick Gunty is a truly excellent audio engineer and producer, and his work on the Frances Luke Accord albums has been nothing short of outstanding. We have Betsy King on design and branding, so the product is going to look and feel GREAT.\n\nShould any timelines need to be adjusted, we will be prompt in communicating with our listeners and supporters.",
  "As with all creative and culturally sensitive/important projects this one is not without its risks. We are working hard, and drawing on our pooled experience, to mitigate against these risks such as locked-in printing quotes and a simple distribution plan. \r\n\r\nOur biggest risk is that funding is not secured.

It takes a huge amount of organising, and a lot of what we do happens on the road, working out all of the little details that make our songs so special. There's a lot to be done, and we usually find ourselves doing it in very short, intense bursts! We've worked really hard to keep the band going through difficult times and long distances, and we've been so incredibly grateful for the support we've received in doing so. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge for us is making sure everything is done in good time.

  "The only challenge to this project that comes to mind is the timeline.  I am ready to go at a moment's notice unless, of course, there comes another round of lockdowns due to Covid elsewhere in the world.  That, and perhaps, any international situation (such as the current problem in Ukraine at the moment of this writing) that may affect travel to African and Southeast Asian countries.\n\nIf issues such as those arise, the project may need to be delayed until later in 2022 or even early 2023.\n\nI'm triple-vaccinated and will jump at another booster if it's deemed necessary.  I'm in fairly good health and actually thrive when I'm challenged by a mountain or a charging hippo...\n\nLet's hope, for all of our sake, that this pandemic is finally starting to wind down!",
  "I've run a successful Kickstarter for The Seers Sanctum so I have a pretty good idea of how things are going to go.  Shipping delays are being felt everywhere, but I have padded the delivery estimates to try to account for this. Our printer hasn't communicated any significant delays yet, but I will keep backers informed if anything changes.",
  "This is our first Kickstarter.  Covid and global shipping delays may cause some hiccups in fulfillment but we are planning  generous time to handle such issues. Additionally we have consulted with Matt Sanders on fulfilment and Orpheus press on game design to ensure the finished product is amazing.",

  "I don't feel like this is a risk at all, since we are just asking fans to pre order.",
  "Asking for money isn't fun. We like to focus on writing and performing.. But the way the music industry has changed over the past decade, selling CDs is a thing of the past. Most everyone streams now and for better or worse, we need to go along with the changes. We must ask our fans to support us BEFORE we go into the studio in order to fund the project. \n\nEven though we've had 3 successful Kickstarter campaigns between us in the past 5 years, this time around, we can not even so much as SET FOOT into the recording studio unless we meet our goal. This is a project we believe in SO MUCH that we are asking with our hearts on our sleeves: Friends, Family, Music Enthusiasts, Fellow Musicians, Jewish Communities, Clergy and folks with some extra coin- we need you to make this album possible.",
  "Along with raising the funds the biggest challenge will be to get the album recorded the way that I want it to sound. That is why I have chose The House of David for its all analog gear and for the space its self. The studio has a great vibe and the history as well, really makes it feel like home.\nCurrently I work four jobs so being able to open up time to get pre production completed will be challenging but also rewarding because I will have an album to shop afterwords and will be able to sell it at gigs and use it to do radio promotions and tours.\nI am so excited to bring this album to life with the help of the musicians that will be performing on it and you! Lets make something amazing together!",
  "The risk is that people will say, \"I'll listen to it on Spotify.\" The truth is that this album won't get made without a Kickstarter and it won't make it to Spotify. Kickstarter is the most effective way to support independent artists. Your support is much appreciated to bring the music of resistance to a new generation.",
  "The challenges of finishing this shoot is mostly in finding the time to shoot it. I believe that everyone working on this short film has enough of a drive to see it to completion that we'll find the time to make it. There will be many long late nights but we're young and we'll survive.",

Our hope is to get everything done and shipped out so you receive it by pride. but with the way shipping has been lately we can't guarantee this. That being said we will be completely open with every step of the way.\n\nWe will obviously be trying our hardest to get as close to proper colors as possible by sending the manufacturer pantone numbers for every color.

I have worked as an electrician in the film industry for the last 13 years and helped make over 75 films in Winnipeg. This experience and production savvy will give me the confidence to create something of my own again. With the industry professionals and friends who have committed to making this film I cannot see an obstacle other than money limiting this project.\r\n\r\nI have successfully raised $12,000 of the total proposed budget of $20,000 for this film. My girlfriend and I threw an amazing fund raising Halloween party and the supportive local film and arts community of Winnipeg has got this project to this point. My hope is this last bit of fund raising is successful making production possible without breaking the bank.",
  "The biggest challenges we have faced have been \r\n\r\n(1) Models canceling without notice. This slows us down because we have limited time for photo-shoots and we miss out on other models who could have participated by saving space for no-shows. To address this, we have started requesting phone calls with models to confirm their interest in the project. \r\n\r\n(2) Lack of funds to complete transcriptions, update equipment, create mock-ups, hire formatters, rent more accessible studio spaces, etc. That's where Kickstarter comes in. We will be using this funding to complete the interview and photography process and to produce the books, postcards, and bookmarks. At the time that we are beginning the Kickstarter, we have already photographed 3/5 of the models we need for the first book.",
  "I'm pretty flexible (and it's an art show) so I don't foresee any serious problems, mostly minor issues such as which photos to display, cost of framing, etc.    I already will be in Bangkok in June and July working on my next photography book, so my airfare and accommodations are already paid for.",

  "One of the challenges we face is that we are one of several theatre companies in Cache Valley.  We plan to make our theatre company a unique staple in the valley by producing shows that are not typically produced in the valley.  The content of these shows will include some more mature content that is also fun and appropriate.  \r\n\r\nOur goal is to be different and to offer a unique perspective.  We will also focus mainly on performance quality and interesting spectacles for a smaller theater that will surprise and thrill our audiences.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we face is that we will be one of the only for profit theaters in the valley.  This makes it a bit more difficult to raise money due to our inability to apply for non profit grants.  To alleviate this problem we plan to establish a partnership with a like minded non profit organization that can act as a Fiscal Sponsor for our company and help us propel our company into the future.",

We have a detailed plan in place for how we will do this. We can't guarantee that we will make the delivery dates suggested on the rewards \u2013 for example, should we manage to snag an amazing distribution deal, we might have to wait a little longer before sending out the movie. But we CAN guarantee that we'll do everything in our power to get them out on time and we will keep you in the loop throughout the process with plenty of updates. You, the funders, are our priority and we want you to have the best experience with us on this film.

We have booked production slots a few months after the campaign ends, and we are quite confident that we can meet the delivery dates unless something really bad happens.\n\nWe will work to post updates at least once every month after the campaign ends. As we are a small indie publisher, sometimes we might not be able to meet this goal, but we will do our best to let everyone know how production is moving forward.",
  "As with everything, there's always some risk involved. Delays can and do happen, and more recently, parts scarcity and the increasing cost in producing the physical rewards.

  "Obstacles and challenges are to be expected and are welcome to when filming the Witch of Evansburg. They are welcome? When people overcome obstacles that is a way in which they grow and learn, which is a goal for anyone working on the set of this film.The director and leading actress live in Chicago and the film is being shot just outside Philadelphia, so this can obviously present issues, however, the precise film location is where the director grew up, so it should not pose too many problems. The biggest aspect to overcome is how might everyone will respond when the energy of the filming is not going smooth. And it could be for whatever reason; weather, inability to get a certain shot, technical difficulties. Anything can go wrong at anytime. The big deal here is how everyone responds to it, especially the director. He is confident though, that he can identify an issue, create a solution and move forward. Honestly, the biggest obstacle is when it is all over. Okay, it is shot, edited and ready to go and nothing is happening. That is the real test of strength and commitment. What happens if it doesn't win at the festival? What happens if it is not distributed? That can very well happen. It is a possible reality, but people are bound to see it and those who were involved in the film are going to grow from it. That is the purpose here, to learn, to grow and to inspire.",
  "At this point there are no risks.",
  "Challenges We Have\r\n\r\nThe challenges we face is finding people willing to invest time and efforts into at risk teens. Most people feel at risk teens are kids that can't be helped and belong in the juvenile court system. Our goal is to show that these youths can be reached and give them a way to express themselves. Creative arts will give at-risk teens a way to express themselves without causing harm to themselves or anyone else.",

We'll also do everything in our power to deliver the rewards before Christmas.\n\nAs a team with a strong emphasis in engineering, we have already been able to create a device which is optimized for factory mass production. Our team has also secured signed agreements with the factories who will produce the NOTA at scale.\n\nThe largest risk factor at this point comes down to shipping volume and accurately predicting delivery dates. However, we will stay constantly in touch with package tracking and shipping challenges.",
  "As of now, we have only been making the T-shirts in small batches to give to small groups of people to test the product and provide feedback. Scaling production to keep up with higher demand will be a challenge, but its something we have planned for and we are confident we should be able to handle it.",
  "Although Look Ahead, Idea Store, and Needless Alley Collective will be advising the participants over their finances; there is a risk that the participants will spend their seed commission before planning for the arts and community festival is completed. In order to hinder that from happening, we will work on budgets with them, set up guide lines for spending (ie. that they need approval from their fellow participants before changing costs on the budget), and help them connect with sources for extra funding before they need it- in order for them to have a safety net for unexpected charges.",
  "The biggest challenge of the shoot will be the special effects of Act 3.  It is crucial to have effects that look realistic, while at the same time give that over-the-top \"gross out\" gore effect.  We have been in contact with several recommend effects artists and will be working hand-in-hand for blocking out the shots and effects before shooting.  We have worked with effects in the past, but not to this degree. With the right effects team we are confident that Act 3 will look great. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge includes long distance scene locations - one of our shooting scenes is over an hour away from Los Angeles.  We will be coordinating the team getting to and from site and being far from any conveniences.  We are already planning the shoot to the smallest detail, but we will be extra vigilant for this particular day of shooting to ensure nothing is forgotten.",
  "Naturally, not having enough funds to complete the project is always a risk. Recording an album is an expensive project, however, we have found it necessary to have new material when we go out touring, and it keeps it fresh and fun for us, too.\r\n\r\nAnother risk is always time. Although we've scheduled plenty of time to reach our deadlines, well, life happens and you never know what curve ball gets thrown at you. We feel confident in our timelines and believe we can handle any unforeseen blips.",
  "We have editors, sound designers/editors, color correctors, and composers on stand-by waiting for us to fill our budget so we can get started.  So there's no risk in us not having that talent ready to create a great film.  \r\n\r\nThe only risk we face, is time - of course.  Barring any unforeseen emergencies or catastrophes, we should be able to have a completed film ready to be sent out by Christmas.  Now - the only way we'll have to delay this, is if the distributor that picks up the film decides to fulfill these orders instead.  But that is unlikely and if it does happen, our backers (that's you!) will be the first to know!",
  "Principle photography for The Woman Without a Face is already completed, so the biggest hurdle has already been overcome! From here on out, it's all just about making sure we have enough money to finish out post-production and produce the best movie possible. \r\n\r\nOur director has already produced four horror shorts during his time at Northwestern.

  "This is our 50th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is June 2023, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees. \n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. \n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active. \n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund your pledge if you contact us after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. Unconfirmed pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed. We may, at our sole discretion, refund and/or provide credit against future Kickstarter campaigns, in whole or in part (less expenses), upon request.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required). If you open your game and see that something is missing or broken, our customer service team will work hard to get you replacement parts and make things right.

  "Risk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for M20: Lore of the Traditions is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise over the past few years, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to plan for those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we've become much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.",
  "The core tiles are finished and have also been test printed in the same fashion as the final releases will be. \n\nI went with The Game Crafter due to them being within the US and the overall simplicity they offered with their services. They may be more expensive but where they shine, is HERE, by lowering risks as communication with them is clear and quick making challenges manageable. Your tiles will be directly delivered from The Game Crafter where they will be fully produced.\n\nDelivering on time is certainly a big factor not to be overlooked, especially if the box contents grow due to Stretch Goals. Hence a large timing bumper is proposed with a personal goal of hitting the delivery date sooner.\n\nFunding/money management will be an ongoing observed and measured practice. The boxed tile set really will be as much bang for your buck as possible without us losing money. The prices and funding goal are set in a way to make backers the most happy while giving us a small return for safety. \n\nCore set digital tiles have been completed and should ready for download shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. Depending on if and how many Stretch Goals are unlocked and how many new tiles need to be finalized, the download availability may be moved a little to accommodate for the extra production.\n\nAll in all there will be no (bad) surprises. The RPG tiles have been handled, played with and proven to be a wonderful addition to tabletop gaming.",

  "There are many risks and challenges when it comes to making this project. One big one is lighting. It is a very common challenge for filmmakers.

Between design, certification and manufacturing, the cost of building a new charging station is huge - but the more we produce, the lower the end cost of each station.\nOur main concern is the different regulations in each country.

Any request for a refund after more than two weeks has passed, if accepted by us, will be subject to a 10-20% cancellation fee to account for KS fees and our administrative expenses. Please note that, anyone that does not complete the pledge manager by our required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund for any reason, including the assessment of additional shipping fees for expenses related to the delinquency of the backer completing their survey information.\n\nAbandoned Pledges\n\nWe require that our pledge manager and/or survey be completed in a timely manner so that we can process orders efficiently and on time. Completing your survey late at any point beyond the deadline we communicate AND/OR failure to pay shipping in a timely manner when the surveys are (re)opened, could result in significant delays in receiving your rewards, additional shipping expense, duties, taxes, or other fees to be paid by you, and you will not be eligible for a refund for any reason. We give plenty of time to complete the survey, so please do so in a timely manner to avoid any inconvenience or delay. Any survey that is not completed within 30 days from final fulfillment (defined as the last date of shipping of KS rewards for your region) will result in your pledge being considered abandoned and any amount pledged will be considered a gift in support of the project.\n\nBy pledging to this project you understand the risks, challenges, and pledge terms we have laid out here, and agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not pledge for this project and wait for the possibility of the game to become available direct or in the retail market.",

  "I've shipped 5 out of 5 Kickstarters on time so far. The last one was a few years ago, and things have changed due to Covid. One risk is the general disruption of the supply chain, which is why I've added more buffer time for delivery than on my previous Kickstarters.\n\nAnother risk is the physical components. While we have the most experience with cardboard products, we have done specialty manufacturing before (the awesome poker chips for Pandante and the engraved gold coins for example). On this project, the gems and the scepter are extra challenges. I've had prototypes of all gems and the scepter made before the Kickstarter to reduce the risk there. These prototypes are almost production-ready, so we're just tweaking the final details. As simple as it sounds, the plastic trays for the gems are also a challenge because we haven't worked with manufacturers before on plastic goods like that. Luckily the challenge level is pretty low on those because they have a simple design.\n\nThe card sleeves are a risk to the schedule. The good news is that we don't see much risk in the quality of the sleeves. We manufactured card sleeves before to go with the Codex campaign, and we did have quality problems. This time, we're partnering with UltraPro so they can manufacture high-end sleeves, which they've done a million times before. So the risk here is in the *timing*, not in the quality. We need to coordinate two separate factories to combine their output so it can be sent out to our shipping hubs around the world. This is harder than it sounds logistically, and it could potentially delay our fulfillment by a months, which is why we're keeping a very close eye on this and doing our best to keep it on track.\n\nRefund Policy\n\nAll pledges are final upon the completion of the funding period, however, we may, at our sole discretion, refund your pledge in full if the request is made within two weeks of the end of the campaign. Any request for a refund after more than two weeks has passed, if accepted by us, will be subject to a 10-20% cancellation fee to account for KS fees and our administrative expenses.

  "Shipping Delays: In a previous campaign, Forged in Frost, suffered a 2-month delay in shipping. This was partly because of COVID and partly because of the extensive process involved in forging the dice. This project, while intricate and intensive, is more manageable for our factory partner. We anticipate a speedy turnaround for this project. As hopeful as we are, it is possible that the global climate could change (weather or health), shipping channels disrupt, or any other factors outside our control. We will do our very best to mitigate those concerns.\n\nIn the most recent campaign, Deadly Skull Dice, production and shipping were lightning fast! We did encounter an ongoing issue with shipments to NZ and AUS. This has resulted from directives from those countries which forebay International First-Class Mail. All backers have rewards waiting on proper clearance. This is an example of issues outside of BrycesDice control. Your rewards will be made and are prepped for delivery, waiting solely on your destination countries limitations. \n\nQuality: The metal dice will be consistent with the Deadly Dragon Dice. Extremely high-quality brass properly forged to be nearly identical to those pictured above. Any issues encountered will be rectified to the best of our abilities. That said, we do not anticipate any overarching quality issues in the dice. . Even with that heightened quality, there are still chances for issues. In any of those instances, we are prepared to field concerns and work with all backers to ensure the best possible experience.\n\nColor: As stated previously, this is not our first rodeo! The pictures seen above were taken in-house. The video was created with the idea of showing the dice in their true format.  Our aim was a near-perfect representation of the dice as you would see them in person. What good would it be to airbrush them and saturate their colors only to deliver you a lesser product? No! That has never been and will never be the goal in our process. I foresee no issues delivering on the colors listed above. That said, please take into account the fact that these dice were placed in a well-lit environment. We darkened the images slightly to reflect a more subdued environment. Note that the black dice set is by far the dearkest. All other sets are high visibility.",

  "There are no risks,since the models are made in advance.\n\nWe take a responsible approach to our work. Each model is carefully moderated. We are open to everyone. You can always ask us a question. We thank everyone who takes part in our project. We ask everyone to support our project in any way. If you can't support our project financially, just tell your friend about it. Any recommendation helps the project move forward.\n\nMy 3D Studio has already released many projects on kickstarter. You have no reason to worry about any risks, as our Studio not only values its reputation, but also strives to achieve excellence in each of its work. For our Studio, creativity is not just a job. It is a goal and a way to achieve excellence in art. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your support is invaluable!\n\nWe are improving every time, we understand that people do not like to use support in 3D printing, since the need to use support forces people to spend significantly more time preparing a 3D model for 3D printing, so we try to create 3D models with the minimum number of necessary supports.\n\nYou must understand that in some cases, it is impossible to refuse support in principle, since the shape of the 3D model dictates its own conditions in order to get a satisfactory print result on most 3D printers. Our 3D models were tested in 3D printing before publishing them on kickstarter and are regularly updated and improved throughout the funding period here. If you have any questions, you can always write to us so that we can help you.\n\nYou don't have to worry that you won't be able to download the 3D models you bought from our Studio, because we store the entire collection of 3D models on Google drive, which guarantees the safety of your files for a long time.\n\nHowever, we strongly recommend that you download your 3D files in the archive prepared for you within 3 months after the end of funding for our project on kickstarter from the moment of publication of the link to Google drive from where you will be able to download the archive. We will send you a link to your email address and duplicate the link to your archive in private messages on kickstarter within 3 weeks after the project is successfully funded.\n\nYou should understand that the print quality you get depends on the system you use. All our high-resolution files allow you to get excellent results on high-end SLA machines. While the same 3D models will be produced with lower resolution on standard FDM printers. Nevertheless, the 3D models have passed the necessary pre-printing test and have been pre-tested on SLA and FDM printers. We received a satisfactory performance and were satisfied with what we did especially for you.\n\nIf you want to achieve the highest quality 3D printing, we recommend using SLA printers with a layer height parameter of 60 microns. We will try to divide our 3D models into prefabricated elements so that our 3D models can be printed on printers with a small print area. Large parts require a minimum of 220*220*250mm. Which is the approximate standard for the famous entry-level 3D printer Ender-3.\n3d models are tested and cut using absolutely free software \"Cura\". We recommend this program because it is available to everyone, time-tested and proved to be a professional tool for working with 3D models for 3D printing. You can count on our support!\n\nDear sponsors of this project have the right to change 3D models as they want at their own risk and solely for their own personal use. However, if a user has purchased one of our commercial licenses, they have the right not only to sell models in their original form, but also to sell them in any modified form!\n\nAll rights of this project are protected by copyright and are subject to conditions that allow us to change and improve our 3D files in all available ways throughout the entire period of funding in order to improve the quality of 3D printing.\n\nWe thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts who did not remain indifferent to our favorite business.\nYour help here is the key to the success of our creativity!\nYou are the best!\n\nWe are always happy to hear your questions and suggestions!\nSend us your question or suggestion, and we will answer you as soon as possible!\n\nadmin@3dfortress.art\n\nThanks !",

Though these problems may arise, to me they are not really problems as I am ready to take these happenings head on with an open-heart and acceptance to move past it and continue on my journey.",
  "One of the main risks of this project is traveling with expensive equipment. I always travel with a backup and am equipped to produce imagery with multiple sources.",
  "There are almost no risks involved when it comes to our backers. Our team shall be in close communication to ensure a timely delivery of the products only in the case of unforeseen delays. \nDue to intermittent COVID related lockdowns in India, there might be a slight delay in shipment, which will be communicated to our backers. But as of July 2021, we do not foresee any unexpected delays. \nWe have a strong partnership with our manufacturing facilities who helped us with our first prototypes.  We just need your support to kickstart this revolutionary product serving the luxury fashion industry.\n\nLaviver has been evolving over the years with a solid experience of producing 150 plus designer leather prototypes in the luxury fashion business.\n\nWe are just waiting for the total number of orders and as soon as we are confirmed with total number, the manufacturers are ready to go ahead with production.\n\nPositioning the brand in the luxury fashion is a challenging task and we are moving forward with the best of our efforts to accomplish it.",
  "Every business has their obstacles to overcome.  We have seen our product be well received by everyone.  We struggle to find reliable people, who are mobile and available for the events we attend.  We have traveled all around the east coast over a wide area.  Many people have busy lives and would prefer to stay closer to home.  We have also seen some similar competition as well.  We will overcome this obstacle by allocating the funds received to research and development.  We want to expand into new products, souvenirs, and even edible images for birthday cakes!",
  "The project is pretty much done. With your help we can RUSH this to the printer to we don't waste a month. I have done this before, on Kickstarter. So i know exactly what I am doing AND how to get it done. You're in safe hands.",
  "The only challenge we face are those who enforce heteronormative gender roles in our society. If we can educate them about gender we can change their perspective and effectively change the global point of view surrounding gender.",
  "Getting a location can be a risk considering where filming is taking place but we are willing to rewrite the script while giving you the same feel that we are trying to portray.  :) Also, time itself is a risk because we're doing it so close to film festival season but I know we can pull through and get this done just in time to reward ya'll with your rewards and get it out to film festivals. I believe in us and I hope ya'll believe in us too. :)",
  "Our risks and challenges include getting all the funds we need in a timely manner! We need to get this film finished quickly so we can complete postproduction and get this out to the MANY FANS!",
  "The biggest challenge we expect to face is the extremely busy lives of the musicians (Bethany, Olivia, Pete, Ben, Caitlin, Liam and George). Because everyone involved is unbelievably creative, we all have various jobs and projects as well as this one which may - reluctantly - cause a few delays in the process. (Ben, our guitarist, currently lives in Berlin. As we currently lack teleportation powers, this means our jam sessions are not as frequent as we'd all like them to be.) \r\n\r\nHowever, we've booked a week in April to record, and we hope to turn it around as efficiently as possible. During that week, we'll be recording everything live to tape. On one hand, there's a concerted logistical effort to get everyone in the same room (and country!) simultaneously, but on the other hand, the relative simplicity of the analogue recording process should streamline the time needed for mixing, editing and so on. This album is written as a snapshot of real life, in pain and the sincere relief that follows, so there will be no doubt be mistakes in technicolour detail on the record - and we welcome them. We aren't all professional recording artists, and for us this an experimental and intuitive adventure which we hope is reflected in the character of the songs and the techniques we're using the document them.",
  "Not enough money to pass it on to a professional movie director.\nThe scp fans not being on board with this idea",
  "Time and talent has already been set aside for this recording project. I think these two things can be obstacles without proper planning and a team in place! I love that I will also be recording in Nashville, which gives me more flexibility than working with just one studio.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I have already laid the groundwork down for 4 of my songs gives me peace of mind that my team and studios are working for me already.",
  "Every crowd-funded project has it's own set of challenges. You might ask yourself, \"What risks are there in contributing to this campaign?\"\r\nTricia and Howard have carefully worked out  every detail of this project, from budgeting, to recording, artwork, and printing. Spencer & Rains have run several successful kickstarter campaigns and feel confident that, with your help,  this one will be a success, as well.\r\nThe biggest risk to you is a late delivery date on any rewards. They are, however, working hard to get everything done and have every expectation that rewards will be delivered by June.",
  "Extra production time might be needed if we reach more stretch goals and more items need to be produced. The pandemic might affect shipment and production but I will definitely keep everyone updated and in the know at all times.",
  "Human error is possible in any situation, whether this is material or shipping delays due something as unlikely as a Pandemic, or general issues with photo quality of requested pet originals! One thing is certain, I am committed to making this project a success and bringing you all pieces of art you love. I ask for your patience and understanding as I am a young artist pushing forward into an exciting but different future. I love chatting through all aspects of commissions, so always drop me an email.... let's chat colours!!!!!!\n\nDue to the pandemic the jigsaw company I hope to use for the quality wooden jigsaw is not producing custom cuts until August. If there aren't any hiccups then this should give us plenty of time, however there is the risk that I am reliant on another companies restrictions to meet any deadline.",
  "I will start working on the drawing once I receive pet photos from the backers. I allow myself three months to work as I set September as the time to ship out rewards and the time allowance should be sufficient. Having said, there might be possibilities of delay in shipping due to the pandemic worsening in certain regions.",
  "Spring and Summer are the BEST times to knock out oil paintings.  Due to the nature of oil paintings (time it takes to make and dry each) and some of the orders (filming, editing) we have limited the available quantity.  On days where there is no sun to expedite the process of drying, we use fans.  It takes a few days more but it gets the job done all the same!",
  "Our supply chain is considered essential and has seen very few delays outside of shipping. We are confident we can ship all rewards in a timely manor as we've proven in previous projects due to our strong relationships with suppliers, all of which have the materials and stock on hand to fulfill orders.",
  "None, really. The project is complete and my team has been hired!  YES!",
  "I don't see much challenges in fulfilling terms and rewards of this project, except that the new works that you can reserve to buy through Kickstarter may not be as good as the ones you see in the examples. Art is subjective, so you may not be as happy as you could be with some other work of this style.\n\nI am not good with painting small sizes as I will be for this project, so we will have to see what the quality of the outcome of the project would be. I will try my best, as always.",
  "I am currently funding this from my own pocket and have spent over \u00a31000 on equipment but for a feature length  I do need more.. However if I don't secure the budget I will get creative\nTime is another obstacle as people work full time jobs so there will be a lot of late night shooting and weekends away from my family to shoot the scenes",
  "Our biggest risk and challenge is not being able to film and produce the film if we don't reach our goal. The movie industry is volatile and tricky so there is always the chance people drop out or lose interest in the project but since this is an independently funded picture, the risk is far less.",
  "We create music; it's what we do, and that will never change!  But to express it to as many people as possible, presented as well as possible, is work, and it's expensive for independent artists!  We've taken a leap of faith and started recording in a fantastic studio with an amazing engineer and producer because we feel the music we're making deserves a chance to be expressed as well as it can be.  The risk is that it is put onto a hard drive and that's as far as it gets. With help, we can present our songs to new audiences- and you as a backer will get a physical disc and/or other premiums, as well as the knowledge that you were an integral part of filling the world with new music!\r\n\r\nWe've been through this process before at a smaller scale.  Our first CD, Blue Sky Earth, was recorded at home, on a laptop, learning how to use the software ourselves, writing all the songs, playing nearly every note, every instrument, mixed ourselves, distributed, promoted, etc.  It took many months, and help from a lot of friends, but we did it!"
