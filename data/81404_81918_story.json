  "Social Credit System? Darunter k\u00f6nnen sich leider die wenigsten etwas vorstellen. Doch was genauso gut aus einem dystopischen Roman stammen k\u00f6nnte, ist in China leider bereits Realit\u00e4t. Der Staat ermittelt an Hand deines Verhaltens einen Punktestand. Dieser ver\u00e4ndert sich mit deinem Handeln zum positiven oder negativen und entscheidet dabei ma\u00dfgebend \u00fcber dein Leben. Ob man ausreisen, \u00f6ffentliche Verkehrsmittel nutzen oder zur Universit\u00e4t gehen kann, h\u00e4ngt ganz vom eigenen Credit Score ab. Dabei werden nicht nur moralisch oder gesetzlich falsche Taten als ausschlaggebend f\u00fcr die Verschlechterung des Scores aufgef\u00fchrt, sondern auch der Konsum von zu vielen Videospielen o.\u00e4., da dies als nicht f\u00fcr die Gesellschaft produktives Verhalten angesehen wird.\u00a0 Auch andere politische Meinungen werden diskreditiert und sanktioniert. Private Chats werden analysiert und auch der Kontakt mit Personen, die einen niedrigeren Punktestand haben, wird bestraft.\u00a0 Die Realit\u00e4t geht in diesem Fall noch weit \u00fcber die Ausma\u00dfe der Black Mirror Folge hinaus, die sich mit einem \u00e4hnlichen Konzept besch\u00e4ftigt. Zuschauer der Serie mag das ein gewisses Gef\u00fchl f\u00fcr die Ausma\u00dfe geben.\u00a0 WARUM IST DIESES THEMA RELEVANT? In China sind derzeit \u00fcber 170 Millionen Kameras im Einsatz, die rund um die Uhr laufen und mit neuster Gesichtserkennungssoftware und Gangerkennungssoftware ausgestattet sind. Die B\u00fcrger werden so f\u00fcr die Regierung zum gl\u00e4sernen Mensch. Kaum kann man noch auf die Stra\u00dfe, ohne dass ein System dieses registriert und vermerkt.\u00a0 UND? \u00dcberwachungsstaat? Nicht bei uns. Zumindest nicht, bis die EU die gleiche Technik zur Terrorismus-Pr\u00e4vention einsetzt, wie unser Freund im Osten. Die EU macht derzeit Pl\u00e4ne eben diese Technik auch bei uns Einzusetzen. Falls es dazu kommen sollte, dann ist die NSA-Aff\u00e4re und Snowden mehr als nur Schnee von gestern. Privatssph\u00e4re w\u00fcrde komplett ausgehebelt. Alles zum Gute unserer Sicherheit. Doch ist dieser Preis es wert, die komplette Kontrolle \u00fcber das eigene Leben in die H\u00e4nde des Staates zu geben? China zeigt uns bereits die Abgr\u00fcnde und M\u00f6glichkeiten die sich f\u00fcr die Person hinter den Kameras auftun. Wie weit, darf \u00dcberwachung gehen? HANDLUNG DES FILMS Wir haben uns das Social Credit System, das bald in ganz China eingesetzt werden soll, n\u00e4her angeschaut und daraus die Idee f\u00fcr unseren Film gesponnen:\n\n In naher Zukunft hat auch die EU sich dazu entschlossen, die SCS-Technologien unter dem Vorwand der Terrorismuspr\u00e4vention einzusetzen.\n In dieser Welt arbeitet unsere Hauptfigur, Oli, als Ermittlerin f\u00fcr die Regierung, bis sie bei einem Ihrer Auftr\u00e4ge Ben, den Anf\u00fchrer einer Widerstandsbewegung, beschatten soll. Im Verlauf der Geschichte taucht sie immer tiefer in seine Welt ein und muss sich den moralischen Fragen ihres Jobs und des Systems, f\u00fcr das sie arbeitet, stellen. ZU UNS Wir sind Jana und Nico! Wir sind beide Studenten an der Hochschule Rhein-Main. Wir sind beide im 6. Semester, Media Conception & Production! Aktuell befinden wir uns aber Hals \u00fcber Kopf, in unserem Abschlussprojekt.\u00a0 UNSER ZIEL Der Kurzfilm soll Aufmerksamkeit auf ein Thema lenken, dass so aktuell ist und trotzdem so unpopul\u00e4r. Es liegt uns sehr am Herzen mehr Menschen dazu zu bewegen sich auch mit den negativen Entwicklungen von technischem Fortschritt auseinanderzusetzen.",
  "\"I'm actually scared to see how this installation would come to life..I'm scared of how the metaphor would\nactually work and reminds me of those days that I sit next to her hospital bed, watching..hoping..praying to\nGod..that she would open her eyes and wake up from her coma \u2013 which deep down inside I knew would never\nhappen\" \u201cTransfusion\u201d is an interactive conceptual installation that serves as an ode to the artist\u2019s mom, who died\nof a rare blood disorder called AIHA in 2011.\nThe installation encompasses a white gallery space as the foundation upon which hundreds of black flexible\nrubber channels containing linear LED lights traverse the space, sprawling from wall to wall and across the\nceiling. The channels intersect, overlap, and meander - transforming the environment into an intricate circulatory system of\npattern and light.\nVisitors are encouraged to touch sensors on the wall located underneath each channel, activating a red LED light\nthat slowly fills the channel, flowing from one end to the other, simulating the transfusion of blood through\na vein. The more visitors touch the sensor, the more \u201calive\u201d the whole vein becomes. Through this interactive element, the artist is inviting the audience to complete the artwork, breaking down\nthe divide between the public and the deeply personal to arrive at an experience that illuminates the\nconnections between us. The artist begins the artwork, but the audience in some way completed it. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "Now for the second edition of the waxed canvas anorak, as well as introducing the wool coat / anorak liner. This is for those who missed out on an anorak last year, and those waiting patiently for the wool coat / anorak liner to release this year. Both will be delivered in November.\u00a0 For those new to Peak Oil Company and our waxed canvas anorak, please review our initial campaign from 2021 and the comments and reviews there. You can find more images and reviews on our Instagram and Youtube. Please head to our website to find out more about The Wool Coat / Anorak Liner and place your order for delivery in November 2022.\u00a0 We wanted to launch The Wool Coat / Anorak Liner as a separate campaign here in Kickstarter (to simplify ordering, fulfillment and data), but it turns out Kickstarter doesn't allow two campaigns to run at the same time. So, we've decided to list The Wool Coat on the Peak Oil Company website to take orders for the coat.\u00a0 Regarding the sheepskin vests, we're still having trouble finding an Australian factory that can take on sheepskin garment production. The ones we knew of have closed down, leaving the few remaining factories at full capacity for now. We're looking hard and it will be put up here for orders sometime around August. In short, we're making extremely hard wearing outdoor clothing and equipment in Australia, using Australian materials that are free of plastics, petro chemicals and fluorocarbons.\u00a0We develop products with early adopters, then bring them into production through Kickstarter. Our producers are accredited by Ethical Clothing Australia, and operate at the highest standard possible in our region. After the success of the 2021 campaign, we're increasing the production target to 200 anoraks. 200 anoraks affords us some efficiencies in scale to help sustain the business and develop more products ready for production.\u00a0We hope this is a realistic target, after delivering 170 anoraks from last year's campaign.\u00a0 The design of the anorak remains mostly the same. We're changing the zipper a little, only because we've found a YKK brass zipper that is still made in Australia. This new zipper also helps us simplify production and the anorak's function. We're doing 4 sizes this year, for the anorak and the wool coat. The following measurements are of the wearer's body, not the garment. Measure yourself wearing what you would likely wear under your anorak: During this campaign, we will post updates with photos of people with their measurements and size they are wearing.\u00a0 After you place your order and the campaign ends, we will contact you to confirm your size. Here are some photos and reviews of the anorak 2021 edition. Many thanks everyone, your encouragement, support and orders are greatly appreciated by our team. You're helping to keep high quality garments and materials made here in Australia. There are a lot of people affected by your choice today, so thank you.\u00a0",
  "Why do we need kickstarter you ask? I allocated the maximum legal withdrawal from my pension fund and am \"all in\" but have come up short. The moving target regarding upgrades to the space with both the City and Province has been, although enlightening, costly beyond my business plan.\u00a0 1958 is a project that has been in the planning stages for almost half a century. It is a restaurant offering always fresh, always local and sustainable food for the entire community. The restaurant is located in West Broadway, on the fringe of Wolseley and is part of a diverse, eclectic neighborhood where homes valued at over half a million dollars and gated communities are situated in close proximity to rooming houses and apartment buildings providing housing for those less fortunate.\u00a0 This business model is based on my belief system that simplicity is elegant and less is definitely more. Our offerings will be based on recipes that have stood strong for generations and are based on the flavors brought by quality ingredients and love. We will offer daily specials prepared with fresh, local, GMO free ingredients sourced direct from farmers or purchased from local purveyors buying direct from same. There is nothing trendy or pretentious here, you will not find menu item descriptions with truffle oil or chocolate treats adorned with edible gold, no\u00a0molecular gastronomy, no sous vide or liquid nitrogen, what you will find is good old fashioned cooking...we are not about the bling, just the bang!\u00a0All takeout packaging etc will be made from recycled product and be recyclable and/or compostable with no exception.  If we meet this fundraising goal our opening will be January, 2015...a new beginning in a new year. Should we come up short and ultimately receive no funding, as kickstarter is an \"all or nothing\" funding opportunity, we will not open. The Dream: For me, living the dream is being able to do what I love and share the bounty with those around me.\u00a0This is not a get rich quick scheme and the dream has nothing to do with amassing \"fat stacks of cash\" or shiny new toys. There are no illusions of grandeur at 1958, we have no desire to build an empire, we are not interested in growing to become Stella's or WOW Hospitality.\u00a0Over the past 4 months while doing renovations at 1958 I am regularly engaged in conversation with passers by who are all excited to have this restaurant join the community and are looking forward to our eventual opening. We have definitely created a buzz and are raring to go. The Plan: As in any solid business plan, we have crunched the numbers, done the market research and associated due diligence. Our plan is simple...work hard, have fun, make new friends, pay the staff, pay the bills and be happy.    This restaurant is about food, family, and community.\u00a0Leftover prepared foods, soups, days old breads etc will be donated to local organizations in need...nothing is wasted or needlessly thrown in the trash, ever.\u00a0 The Hope:\u00a0Our hope is to give back to the community through various offerings, such as teaching those on a budget how to feed a family of 4 people for under $10 a day; offering a fun day school lunch on occasion for a modest donation and provide adequate \"extra\" portions so no child goes without; ensuring everyone who walks through our door is fed something, regardless of their means.\u00a0A portion of any monies raised over and above our goal will be shared with the community through goodwill offerings of \"share packages\" with baked treats and prepared foods for those in need, no charge community bar-b-ques, taking it to the street initiatives etc The Space: Our building has no natural gas service, so all appliances and fixtures are electric, including the heat which greatly reduces our carbon footprint. Our humble space at 761 Westminster Avenue with 12 seats, take-out and catering is more than enough to reach our goals, sustain and live the dream. The Now: what we have; refrigerated prep table, commercial cooler, ice cream freezer, stainless prep table, stools, tables and chairs, cabinets, dishes, flatware, most smallwares, shelving, pastry display case, vintage Coke cooler, signage, registered name \"one nine five eight\" with the Companies Office, most renovations complete (some plumbing yet to be done), all electrical complete, recipes, menu design, domain name, customers waiting in the wings and the desire to excel. The Future: what we need; your support through donations and of course, being a customer, commercial grease trap, flooring upgrade in prep kitchen area, commercial cooking appliance(s)...stove or convection, counters, permit and license fees, start-up inventory. Although tight, this fundraiser, if successful, will get us open and the rest will be up to us. Thank you for considering 1958. Together we can make this happen!

  "This film is about parents and children and it is purposefully ambiguous. A father goes looking for his child. Is he really her father? Does she believe he is or does she think he is deranged? If he is her father will they ever be reconciled? Ultimately it is about how love shapes our behavior and the strength - or weakness of blood ties. We need money for three things. Film festival entry fees, to put it on IMDB (International Movie Data Base), to pay our actors and to fix the sound. OK four. We plan to do a festival run (submit it to festivals) for at least 6 months. This will gain us visibility and credibility. Get our work known. After that it will be distributed in some form. Some of the festivals we want to submit it to are the Palm Springs International Shorts Festival. the Tribeca Film Festival, Slamdance, New York Lift Off Festival, Big Apple Film Festival, Manhattan Short Film Festival, Indie Boom Boom Film Festival, Taos Shortz Film Festival, Brooklyn Film Festival, and Katra Film Series. That's a starter list. There are literally thousands of film festivals you can submit your film to and they all have entry fees ranging from $30 to $100. Who is the audience for our film? Everyone. A little more specific? Parents and children. Divorced fathers. African Americans. We have an African American director and an African American cast. And it is nice and short. 7 and a half minutes. Anyone who loves short. The director is a black man who is prolific and creative. Talent like his should be encouraged. You can be part of his journey, a man who is bursting with ideas.\u00a0 Come join us. You will be helping talented people to find their voice in the world.",
  "Hi, I'm Rhian Brooke a poet and spoken word artist from the UK.\u00a0 I have created a spoken word to music album called 'We Met On The Stairs Of A Bungalow'. The album combines spoken word poetry with music and includes collaborations with fellow poets, hiphop artists and musicians.\u00a0 My dream is to release the album on 12\" vinyl. \u00a0I am a huge vinyl lover but you don't need a record player to enjoy it. The LP will come with a digital download code so you will be able to access the album digitally as well as receive a tangible record that you can either play or use as a cool piece of original artwork for your home. There are also 'add on' opportunities for you to get yourself a ticket to the launch party which will take place in London in 2022. This party will be a fantastic place to mingle and network with poets, musicians and creatives. \u00a0Some of the best spoken word talent in the UK will be performing on the night and there are even 5 exclusive open mic slots available if you would like the chance to perform. My target sum is purely to pay for the vinyl pressing and kickstarter fees. \u00a0All design and production costs I have covered myself and am not looking to make a profit, just to realise my dream of having my album pressed on vinyl. The album itself has been a labour of love and I have worked incredibly hard to produce it. It includes collaborations with outstanding poets, musicians, hiphop artists and music producers. The premise of the album is a journey into my subconcious and tackles issues around mental health, relationships, social injustice, creativity and personal growth. It symbolises both closure and new beginnings and I'm deeply proud of it. \u00a0I really hope you can get behind me and help make my dream a reality but mainly I hope you enjoy the album and love it as much as I do.",
  "THE WILD HARE - A New Type of Restaurant for Arkadelphia Our \ngoal is to create unforgettable food with fresh, local ingredients and \nprovide a welcoming place for meeting friends, enjoying a meal with family, or treating that special someone.\u00a0 OUR VISION - More than just a bakery and a cafeWe love food, and we want to share that love with Arkadelphia. We believe even the most familiar foods can be made into luxurious treats with fresh, local ingredients and a bit of care. From muffins to grilled cheese to pork tenderloin, we promise to wow you. Plus we'll prepare mouthwatering dishes you won't find anywhere else in town. In addition to a full bakery complete with fresh breads, cakes, and pastries, The Wild Hare will serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner six days a week in a roomy building downtown. A covered outdoor patio will add to the downtown's growing nightlife, and an inviting indoor dining room will also serve as a showcase for local artists. We'll have Arkadelphia's only kids' area, which is designed to provide calm activities to occupy the little ones while parents eat or visit with friends. And we'll have cooking classes, tastings with local artisans, and other inspiring events. We hope you will adopt The Wild Hare as your favorite place to meet a friend for coffee, study, get away for a special occasion, or play games with a group. Come often and stay as long as you want. (Check the FAQs below for additional information.) AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THE DOORS SOONERWe're already making changes to the building, purchasing equipment, and meeting with suppliers. The menu is complete, we have all our dishes, and we're about to start sprucing up the patio and building exterior. These are all things we anticipated. But in preparing to upgrade some of our utilities, we discovered that most or all of the building's wiring will need to be replaced, and we need to replace the existing air conditioning system in addition to installing a system to handle air in the kitchen. By supporting this Kickstarter campaign, you can be the difference we need to get the doors open sooner while making The Wild Hare \"your restaurant\" and earning great rewards! HOW WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPENKickstarter allows you to support projects you find compelling by choosing a reward and pledging at a level that is comfortable to you.

  "About the story : In a desperate attempt to escape one of his parent\u2019s dinner parties, Brett takes off at a run down his driveway and runs straight into Corinne Calhoun. She\u2019s carrying a metal box and claims to be delivering it to her uncle Jordi, but won\u2019t tell Brett what\u2019s in it. She offers to pay him in cigarettes if he\u2019ll walk her there. He does, but the visit doesn\u2019t go anything like he thought. He quickly realizes that he\u2019s ended up in a part of Corinne\u2019s life that she doesn\u2019t share with anyone. About the project : Hello! I'm nearing the end of my time in film school and Borderline is going to be my final project. The story itself is something my writing partner and I created almost 3 years ago, and it's one that means a lot to both of us. Getting to make it now means more than I can put into words here, but needless to say, the goal is to execute what's been in our heads since the beginning. In order to do that, we need your help, lovely hero! Any money donated will go directly into the project in three very key ways:\u00a0 This will be small production overall. I will be rehearsing with the actors for the rest of this month into the beginning of September, and the shoot itself will take place over the 20th, 21st and 22nd in a variety of locations around the Seattle area. The finished project will be completed on the 15th of October and will then be submitted to open festivals.",
  "Hey everyone! Erinn Peet Lukes here. I've been a pro musician for almost ten years. For the lion's share of those years I was working hard with my bluegrass band, Thunder and Rain. We started in Golden Colorado and ended up playing all over the state. We also toured Ireland and the UK . You may know me from our viral cover of Guns n Roses \"Sweet Child o Mine\", which reached 6 million views on YouTube in the winter of 2019.\u00a0 I had vocal surgery in November 2019 that put everything on pause. \u00a0It was the first break I took in years. It was scary, but by February 2020 I was ready to perform again. I was gearing up for a fun summer of tours with the band and getting back in the saddle. Unfortunately, the world had other plans! Thunder and Rain released our third album (that was generously funded on Kickstarter!) at an ill-fated time- January 2020. We had a second tour of the UK planned as well as festivals and gigs all over the country. I spent thousands on T Shirts, Vinyl, albums and publicity.\u00a0 \u00a0I sat alone and watched my gigs get cancelled, one by one. My voice was healed, but I wouldn't have a chance to use it for.....at that time no one knew how long it was going to be!\u00a0 So I broke down to my core pieces. I rescued a dog. I wrote songs that popped out while doing home work outs. I was inspired by podcasts and Britney Spear's Instagram. I did a song challenge where I wrote everyday about different topics. I realized that after getting though a vocal injury and a global shutdown, \u00a0I was ready to take a risk. I sold my band van and all my furniture and moved to Nashville, TN. I came to town with some recordings from the quarantine that I was eager to finish. February gave me inspiration for two more, for a total of seven brand new songs! I reached out on a very helpful Facebook group for a woman to produce, and I was very lucky that Rachel Baiman answered the call. Rachel is a multi instrumentalist, singer, songwriter and producer who has been working it in Nashville for over 10 years.\u00a0 We listened to the influences and references I was inspired by - pop, 90's alt rock, bluegrass and country. \u00a0She assembled and truly badass team to record including Grammy award winning engineer Sean Sullivan behind the controls. We got electric guitar whiz Anthony Da Costa to set the mood for each track. We holed up in the Tractor Shed in Goodlettesville, Tennessee for a few days and laid down the tracks, \u00a0I was able to pay for the studio time and musicians, the mixing, the mastering, two live videos, a music video, two photo shoots, album art, social media promo and a single premier with the money left over from selling the old band van as well as money from my own pocket that I made teaching lessons. The total I've spent so far on this project is $8,365. There's still more to go in terms of creation, promotion and cost. In this day and age there's no use recording something without promoting it, and Krista Mettler at Skye Media is already working hard on promo for the next single and video. Heartsville Records in Australia is working on international distro. I also have plans to make another music video for the third single. I have another problem on my hand- my closet is filled with Thunder and Rain merch. I never got to sell it because the band broke up before we had a chance to tour on the new album.\u00a0 YOU CAN HELP ME FUND THE REST OF MY PROJECT AND RECEIVE THE LAST OF THE THUNDER AND RAIN MERCH! This merch will never be made again so get it while you can!

  "At the beginning of 2021, some new energy began to gather around a fresh set of hymns... New arrangements and imaginative instrumentation took form...friends were gathered to sing and play... And I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s come of the progress so far. \u00a0I do need your help to finish the project, so this page is dedicated to communicating what's happening with it and opening up opportunities to be a part of it! I'll be communicating a bunch via updates here on Kickstarter, but a whole lot more on my Instagram - Q&As, live streams, etc on all sorts of topics - gear, production, songs, etc. \u00a0So hop on over there to find me after you pledge: @aaronstrumpel. _____________________________________________ A few fun details to not miss: _____________________________________________ Current Track Listing: _____________________________________________ A More Comprehensive Story: After years of hearing people talk about it, I\u2019ve been finally taking the time to read Rilke\u2019s \u201cLetter\u2019s To a Young Poet\u201d and there\u2019ve been a few treasures in there. Today I read: \u201cBeing an artist means: not numbering and counting, but ripening like a tree, which doesn\u2019t force its sap, and stands confidently in the storms of spring, not afraid that afterward summer may not come. It does come. But it comes only to those who are patient, who are there as if eternity lay before them, so unconcernedly silent and vast. I learn it every day of my life, learn it with pain I am grateful for: patience is everything!\u201d I\u2019d begun to feel that pain at the end of 2020, and it was accompanied by some guilt for not creating immediately during our mind-bending pandemic\u2026and of course, not being able to tour and do what I do best took it\u2019s toll on my sense of self and well-being. I definitely felt that a summer may not come. But...I surely wasn\u2019t going anywhere. \u00a0Being stuck made it necessary to learn a new rhythm of life, how to walk daily and eat well, how to breathe intentionally and be present to my friends. I was learning patience, I guess. And then sometime in January of this year, I began to feel new growth around a set of songs and hymns that I\u2019ve loved for years. I began to map them out in the studio, tweak arrangements and melody, discover what alternate tunings and new harmonic structure might do to these long-sung songs. And like anything that\u2019s been growing in hidden places, I felt a strength and sturdiness to what was emerging. \u00a0 So here I am, with a set of songs that already feel so strong. \u00a0I hope you'll come alongside and partner with me to see them fully grown! _____________________________________________ The People (so far) \u00a0____________________________________________ *Keep an eye on the campaign page in the coming weeks, as well as the back updates, as I will be finalizing the design around the album. You\u2019re gonna dig the shirts and pins and I can\u2019t wait to reveal it all! ____________________________________________ *A HUGE thanks to Clark Hutt who's been incredible in capturing the video footage of me in process!\u00a0",
  "My artistic goal was to portray every color of dragon that has significance in \u00a0human history. \u00a0I recently completed my 13 dragon collection, rich in symbolism. By combining art and music into a digital booklet and recording, a fuller, more expressive and passionate audio/visual experience can be experienced. In collaboration with renowned \u00a0composer Greg Hansen, we are creating a full 13 track album with each song dedicated and influenced by the traits of each historical dragon. \u00a0The album is already half finished so this kick starter is for the remaining amount of money to create the rest of the tracks and digital booklet. \u00a0",
  "The Epichorus is thrilled to release our 3rd studio record, an instrumental album accompanied by a 64-page book filled with stories, photographs and art made during the session. The music has been recorded (it's gorgeous!) and the book has been written, but we need your help to bring it to the world. This album honors some of the greatest artists of Arabic music: Oum Kalthoum, Hamza el Din, Saleh and Daoud al Kuwaiti, and the music of the Mevlevi Sufi mystics. The book is a collection of 22 little stories that speak the history of these magnificent musicians and explore the concepts of lineage and healing. It's also filled with artwork painted while we recorded the album, and wonderful old photos of the artists. As musicians, we are profoundly indebted to all the artists and teachers who went before us, whose musical explorations and devotions became the notes that filled our heads as children. We wanted to honor all that we've received, and make it new. We recorded three original compositions alongside the classics.\u00a0 This is the 3rd studio album from The Epichorus. Based in Brooklyn, we are a melting pot of sound, rooted in the Arabic tradition, with other influences including Greek, North African, Jazz and more. \u00a0This is our first attempt at an instrumental recording. Ten of us gathered to record live in a circle at an old church converted studio outside Woodstock known as Dreamland. The Epichorus is led by composer and oud player, Rabbi Zach Fredman.",
  "Gotas de Libertad Hi everyone! This is my first album as a singer and songwriter. I feel so excited about it that I can't wait to get you listen to it. This album came as a result of a 20 year personal research for \u00a0freedom of mind, spirit and body.\u00a0 \"Gotas de Libertad\" means \"Drops of Freedom\".\u00a0 After questioning myself about the urgency of \"being myself\" but still a part of my community, I eventually found my way. These are my first steps to a long career I wish to have as an Artist.\u00a0 I put all my heart in it and I am willing to share it with those souls who, like me, are in search of their truth.\u00a0 Each song represents a spiritual step forward, along this journey that is our life. They are, in a way, those things I found essential for keeping my soul truthful and I hope they be helpful for you as well.\u00a0 I think music can really help our souls to go back home.\u00a0 I hope this work will go to the hands of those of you who are desperately in seek of themselves and I hope this CD will help you somehow to find your own way to find happiness.\u00a0 It all started when in a lazy afternoon in October 2018, \u00a0I was trying to get myself entertained by playing the guitar.\u00a0 I had been going thought a very creative moment at that time. I used to hear music in my head all of a sudden, while walking along the street, or especially just as I woke up in the morning. I eventually decided to record those melodies that kept spinning around my head and one lazy afternoon in October 2018, as I was getting very bored being all alone at home, \u00a0I decided to take the guitar and get myself entertained. Whenever I do so I don't really know how long it is going to last! Sometimes it can be for long long hours. Anyway, that day I decided to find some chords for a melody I had been hearing in my head and I eventually succeeded to find the chords and the lyrics, too.\u00a0 I couldn't believe it! At the age of 40 I discovered I could write a song!!! I went back to it, to see if it was a true talent of mine or if it was just a stroke of luck.\u00a0 Well, you know what? I found that it was quite easy for me to put into music what I had been keeping in my heart for many many years: my thought, my feelings and wishes.\u00a0 I felt as a miracle was happening to me. Actually I had been seeking it for quite a long time!\u00a0 Since my early ages I felt I loved\u00a0music very much, but only as an adult I really understood it was a real mission for me.\u00a0 After graduating I spent some years in Japan, England, then back to Italy and eventually in Spain, where l am based now.\u00a0 Music has been always there with me.\u00a0I've always looked for opportunities to learn and share music with other people.\u00a0 When I decided to set my mind on music, I came across a wonderful book called \"The artist's way\" by Julia Cameron.\u00a0 This book took the best out of me.\u00a0 After discovering and applying her methodology, it happened to me to feel like a river was flooding out of the deepest part of me. I wrote my first song in English and then another in Italian and then another one in Spanish and all music was mine, too!!! I felt so blessed. I could really talk throught music about all the things that really matter to me: love, music, nature, \u00a0my beloved ones, my homeland, how to find myself as sn artist and the world around me!!! But making it into an album wasn't an easy thing! \u00a0 I went through tough moments, ups and downs, that always come along together with happy ones. Eventually in April 2020, as the quarantine started, \u00a0I found myself caught in a great desire of sharing my music with people, that I couldn't help it. So I called Jaga Joel G\u00f3mez Arroyo to help me at the recording studio, C\u00e9sar Vasconcelos and Andr\u00e9 Marchiori, two of the greatest Brasilian musicians in Barcelona to work on \"Il mare\" a bossa nova I wrote to express my deepest devotion for the sea and \"Samba blues\", \u00a0a fusion between two of my favorite styles.\u00a0 However my repertorie was quite varied and I needed more musicians to help me out to make my dream come true. For \"The Crescent moon bear\", I song I wrote which is based on the Japanese folktale Tsukina Waguma, I could count on Shyam Sunder at the bansuri and Jordi Rallo, at his wonderful tumbak, too.\u00a0 I couldn't believe it, it was really happening. Now I needed Ra\u00fal Sandin, with whom I've been making a duo for more than a year. He is an excellent guitarist and a great friend, too. I needed him to help me out with \"Chiaroscuro\", a song inspired by Caravaggio's paintings and \"Il mio Angelo\", a song for my dad.\u00a0 Objective achieved! My joy increased more and more!!!\u00a0 For \"Chiaroscuro\" we could also count on Andrea Duca with her violin and Frances Bartlett with her Cello! Wow!! If you wish to see Chiaroscuro video clip, check my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2e_nc34Vlc&t=12s I also had the great joy to have Danilo Blaiotta play \"Calabria\" and \"Estoy cambiando mi piel\", this time together with Filippo Bianchini. Least but not the last, \u00a0I had another song I had been wondering about as I didn't know how to arrange it: \"La hija de la Fortuna\".\u00a0 This song is based on the famous novel by Isabella Allende \"La hija de la Fortuna\". \u00a0 I must say that was one of the biggest challenge I had to face. The song, in fact, is divided in 5 little songs. Each of them recreates one of the most signficant moments of Eliza Sommers' adventure between Chile and California. Thanks God, we could make it together with Cesar Vasconcelos at the guitar, Carlos Zambrano at the \u00a0trombone, Nico Correas at the drums and Joel at the second voice. Now \"Gotas de Libertad\" is almost ready for you!!! Your support will help me to end the project!\u00a0 I hope you will enjoy it!!!! I have prepared some nice presents for you!!! These are the nicest illustrations I have ever seen: \"The Little Piano\", \"The Ballerina\", \" The kitten\" and \"The Elephant\" by the Argentinian artist Marina Bluthgen.",
  "This is a story about mistrust. 5 agents have been tasked with observing and testing the subject of an experiment (that may or may not have been successful) for one year. With none of them allowed to leave the facility until their task is done, tensions rise as the group becomes evermore distrustful of each other, and the subject.\u00a0 The bulk of the funds from this campaign will go towards equipment; mainly cameras, microphones, and lights. The rest will go towards paying the actors. Since this is a movie with a small cast, we won't need to worry about having a lot of money to pay a lot of actors. We will use locations we have at our disposal, and props and costumes will come from thrift stores, so we won't need much for those either. This project will be minimal, with as little spending as possible, due to the fact that a smaller budget is much easier to obtain than a big budget. This is a story I, personally, am passionate about. I love film, I want to make movies, and I am excited to be able to explore this concept on screen. It's an idea that hasn't been done like this, and hopefully you'll all be able to see it for yourself soon.",
  "Let's Be Frank is a celebration of the hot dog, and many of you are already fans \u2013 thank you! You may have stopped by our pop-up restaurant from February-August at King & Bathurst, or maybe you grabbed a dog at a concert this year through our food truck. Chances are you know\u00a0one of us and are family or friends.\u00a0However you have found us, we wish to again thank you for your support. We started our journey five years ago, as four friends looking to open a bar where everyone would know our name. But what could we do to differentiate ourselves from other bars? Well... hot dogs! What we saw was Toronto lacking in true hot dog culture. Street meat is fine and all, but there are so many awesome types of dogs out there in the world that you just have to taste to believe. And we love making our own up to satisfy your taste buds. Our new restaurant has been a passion project amongst all of us. Our great staff from the pop-up restaurant has donated time and efforts towards helping us renovate this new space. Unfortunately, the building we've been able to secure a 5-year lease with has been neglected for far too long, and we've had to spend way more than we anticipated in cleaning up the water damage and tearing down/building up new walls and flooring. We want to ensure that what we open with is a beautiful space that you'll want to spend time in \u2013 hence this crowdfunding campaign. We know what we need to do and how much it will take to do it, and we're falling short. We don't think we're asking for too much \u2013 we hope we're not. This $5k would help us immensely. It would allow us to hire contractors to help expedite our opening. 100% of the funding will go towards this renovation. Thank you for reading!\n",

WHAT YOU'RE FUNDING We're asking for your support to help us fund a variety of things that we'll need to get our doors open and provide you with the highest quality food made with great tools and  equipment. We want to install a top-of-the-line, commercial juicer that will produce the best tasting, freshest juices possible. And we need your help to purchase a professional induction oven so we can create delicious, healthy baked goods and other hot menu items.  Your funding will also help us pay for the little things that will help make Nourish a warm and comfortable place to be like tile, lighting, tables and chairs from neighborhood  artisans, and even things like a changing table for the bathroom. In short, all the essentials we need for a great neighborhood cafe.  If we can exceed our fundraising goal, we'll use the money to offer online ordering and in-neighborhood delivery, outdoor seating including heat lamps for those foggy days, and a grab n' go refrigerator case to pick up your favorite Nourish items to take home.  EVERY BACKER RECEIVES A REWARD\nYour support is critical to us opening our doors and equipping the cafe. Your support is not just a donation - it includes a reward that range from fresh juices and Nourish logo mason jar glasses, all the way up to private dinner parties or even getting a menu item named after yourself.

  "Since we started Bon Vivant as a local 100% grass-fed business in 2010 we have dreamed of bringing Real Food to a casual dining experience. We were baffled that such good food, which is so plentiful in our neighboring farms, was so hard to come by if we wanted to eat out, especially for a quick bite. Opening the caf\u00e9 is a dream come true, and we are especially excited by the wonderful reception we have received from the local community.\n With a menu of 100% grass-fed meat, raw cheeses, dairy from 100% grass-fed cows and a plethora of other local foods, our menu is truly unique, and delicious! Whether you want to come in for a quick smoothie, almond butter brownie, or bring family and friends in for a full meal, we have you covered. In addition to having a great time, you\u2019ll know you\u2019re eating the best food local farms have to offer. We also have great options for people following Paleo, gluten-free and vegetarian diets without compromising a dash of flavor.\u00a0 \nYou may have already seen some of the improvements we\u2019ve made to the space since we took over the business in July. We are so excited to be able to bring Real Food to our Del Ray neighbors, but we have a few improvements we\u2019d like to make that are beyond our current scope of finances. We feel these improvements will be such a wonderful addition to your experience at Bon Vivant that we hope you may want to be a part of it! \n Del Ray is such a friendly neighborhood and being able to sit outside a caf\u00e9 watching people walk by, and bumping into friends without leaving your comfy seat and good food is what life is all about. We\u2019re excited at the possibility of offering that experience for you at our caf\u00e9. \nThank you for taking the time to read about us and our pending projects, below are the details of what we are hoping to achieve, and we truly appreciate your donation. \nIf we raise $18,000\nWe can add a beautiful patio in the front for outdoor dining. Permits are already in place, we just need the funding! It will give everyone a great outdoor environment to enjoy, something that we have been sorely missing during the summer. We still have a few good weather months left and we\u2019d love to have the outdoor seating there for everyone to enjoy year round, weather permitting! Don\u2019t worry about the flowers, while the planters will be taken out, smaller planter boxes are part of our outdoor dining design.\u00a0 If we raise $29,000\nWe can do the outdoor dining and upgrade our kitchen. Unfortunately the kitchen is not a full kitchen and this prohibits us from being able to offer many things like a full breakfasts (with our local eggs and bacon!) or grill up our delicious 100% grass-fed steak or hamburger. Imagine the possibilities!\u00a0",
  "\u2022 In January 1976, the first issue of PUNK Magazine #1 was published. It changed the world. That first issue created the anti-disco movement, transformed Lou Reed from glam-rock burnout into \u201cThe Godfather of Punk,\u201d and heralded The Ramones as the most important punk-rock band in the world. Its hand-lettered graphics also inspired a fanzine movement that featured many more crude and badly-produced fanzines, such as England\u2019s \u201cSniffin\u2019 Glue\u201d (by Mark P.), \u201cRipped and Torn\u201d (by Tony P.) and Scotland\u2019s \u201cNext Big Thing\u201d (by Lindsay Hutton), as well as \u201cSlash,\u201d \u201cFlipside\u201d and \u201cSearch And Destroy\u201d in the USA, among many, many other \u2018zines across the universe.   \u2022 The first issue of PUNK Magazine was developed, created written, drawn and printed in a very short time: Mid-November 1975 to New Year\u2019s Eve 1976. It appeared three months before the Ramones first album and a year before the first Sex Pistols record were released. It didn\u2019t cash in on a popular movement; PUNK Magazine created it.   \u2022 The radical look of PUNK magazine\u2014hand-lettered editorials and page layouts, feature articles presented in photo-comic formats, and a cover that caricatured Lou Reed as a horror comic icon\u2014created an authentic visual \"punch-in-the-mouth\" for what we insisted was a genuine social movement, and it became a knockout. \u201cPunk Rock\u201d before PUNK magazine appeared was a vaguely-defined term that described the New York Dolls, the Bay City Rollers, AC/DC, The Standells, the pub-rock bands popular in England at the time (Eddie and The Hot Rods, The Stranglers, etc.), and many mediocre rock bands who appeared atat CBGB. After PUNK Magazine appeared, punk rock was about the Ramones, The Dictators and the Dead Boys in the USA and the Damned, the Sex Pistols and The Clash in the UK. Thousands of great bands have emerged since then.  \u2022 PUNK was the first media outlet that viewed the downtown scene at CBGB as more than just a new music scene: It was a social schism separating the previous late \u201860s-based rock culture that was dominating the East Village at the time and replacing it with a new aesthetic, based on the original bohemian and beatnik elements that preceded the hippie movement. In other words, PUNK foresaw a \"New 'Hood Order.\" Within a few years, most of the hippie shops in the East Village had disappeared and a few dozen punk rock shops were doing good business.  \u2022\u00a0PUNK Magazine was often descibed as a \u201cfanzine\u201d in the 1970s, suggesting a small circulation and a limited editoiral viewpoint. In fact PUNK was a legitimate newsstand publication, publishing 25,000 copies that went to newsstands and subscribers before its demise a few months later. Although it sometimes utilized the elements of fanzines for parody, PUNK would be more properly described as an \u201cartzine.\u201d It was definitely the first \u201cpunk \u2018zine.\u201d inspiring many other magazines and fanzines in its wake, notably \u201cSniffin\u2019 Glue\u201d and \u201cSearch And Destroy\u201d in England, and \u201cSlash\u201d in the USA. \u2022 On January 14th, 2016, PUNK magazine\u2019s artists, cartoonists and illustrators will mark the publication of the first issue with a group gallery show at \u201cHowl! Happening: An Arturo Vega Project,\u201d located in the heart of the East Village, a stone\u2019s throw away from where the CBGB club and Arturo Vega\u2019s loft (where Joey and Dee Dee Ramone lived with him in the 1970s) were located until a few years ago.  \u2022 This kickstarter campaign will enable fans of PUNK (and non-fans who think this is a good investment), to purchase stuff from the Howl! Happening gallery space, as well as PUNK Magazine stuff. For instance, PUNK #19, which featured The Bullys on the cover, will be a more interesting item now that the band\u2019s music can be heard on the PUNK kickstarter video. They\u2019re great, right?  \u2022 The exhibition catalog will include writing from James Wolcott, Steve Heller and Carlo McCormick, as well as an article about Ged Dunn, Jr., PUNK Magazine\u2019s founding publisher (by John Holmstrom), as well as lots of graphics and stuff from the original PUNK Magazine and details about the artists in the show: Each of them contributed to cover images for PUNK. I think this catalog will become the next PUNK Magazine collectible. As everyone knows, our back issues sell for too much money on eBay, well, this is an effort to reprint them and make them more accessible. So if we make enough money from this kickstarter, we can plan reprinting other issues. But we will need a huge response to do that, reproducing PUNK #1 and putting together this kickstarter campaign? UGH! Too much work!  Okay, that\u2019s our pitch.",
  "Women have their little black dress. Men will have their staple black watch, designed and engineered by pOrtahl. We at pOrtahl designed and created the watch you are missing, inspired by high-end watch customizers from around the world.\u00a0 Below is a list of reasons why pOrtahl's Peacemaker is the watch you are missing: This is your chance to own a\u00a0'Founders Edition' Peacemaker watch, packed with features and designed with you in mind at just a fraction of the retail price. Your reward for believing in us so early on. Bragging rights incoming! Allow us to tell you our story. \u00a0\ud83d\udc47 We have for a long time been inspired by the creations of famous high-end watch customizers such as MAD Paris, Blaken and Artisans de Gen\u00e8ve - often referred to as watch artisans. They challenge the status quo and rethink classic watch designs to fit today\u2019s design standards. A customized watch like that can easily set you back tens of thousands of dollars.\u00a0 So, we decided to take matters into our own hands. We started pOrtahl to incorporate these customized watch styles popularized by the artisans into our brand DNA. We do this by making it our mission to create watches that are remarkable by their color, material and design. After two years of blood, sweat and tears we are finally launching The Watch You Are Missing. We did a ton of research in order to find and incorporate the best features for your money, with the goal of creating a mid-range everyday watch. This watch was designed by us at pOrtahl, incorporating our vision on watch design and inspired by the boldness of the artisans. We interviewed peers on their frustrations, we scoured countless of watch fora and we worked closely with our focus group of over 3,000 members on Facebook. After lots of experimenting and four different prototypes these are the features you will get when you purchase your very own pOrtahl Peacemaker. Peacemaker was forged from aerospace grade 5 titanium, also known as the metal of the Gods. It is ~5x stronger than stainless steel, at only half the weight. We optimized for the perfect weight so that the watch feels hefty in the hand, but effortless around the wrist. Titanium offers many benefits over stainless steel, more commonly used by watch brands. Titanium is more expensive to source and harder to work than steel, however we strongly believe that the advantages of titanium are more than worth the extra cost. Our titanium case and bracelet are fortified with a matte black 'Diamond-Like Carbon' (DLC) surface treatment. Additionally we added a fingerprint resistant coating and a sweat resistant coating. Your watch shall remain rust and stain free and oh yeah, unlike most stainless steel watches it's anti-allergic! We paid extra attention to the quality of our DLC surface treatment. We have tested and re-tested several coating methods in collaboration with our coating partner, to improve the quality of the coating to the highest standards.\u00a0 Every link in the bracelet has been coated individually, allowing for a more even distribution of coating molecules along the surface of the bracelet. The beating heart of Peacemaker is a customized Swiss made STP 1-11 Hi-beat automatic movement. It has 26 jewels and beats at a rate of 28,800 vibrations per hour. That's 8 beats per second! With a 44 hours power reserve it's no problem to enjoy a mindful Sunday without knowing the time, only to slide it back on your wrist on Monday morning - still running. A Little Bit About STP... \u201cDriven by passion, powered by innovation\u201d In 2006, a small group of entrepreneurs decided to develop mechanical movements and produce them in Swiss Jura. In keeping with the motto \"driven by passion, powered by innovation\", fascinating mechanical movements of outstanding quality were created and are produced on state-of-the-art assembly lines, some of which have been developed by STP itself. \" (source: swisstp.com) Curious to learn more about our movement manufacturing partner, Swiss Technology Production? Have a look at the video below to discover how they manufacture outstanding movements such as the STP1-11. Let's compare our STP1-11 to the most popular movements used by microbrands today and you'll see why we chose the STP1-11 as our movement of choice for Peacemaker. Peacemaker sports a 40 mm case - ideal for the average size men's wrist. We wanted to make this watch as slim, yet robust as possible and we did just that. Peacemaker's case is just 11 mm thick (!!), yet has 10 ATM water resistance. Engraved into the sides of the case are the pOrtahl brand name and the titanium periodic element (Ti). Peacemaker's movement is visible through the open sapphire glass caseback.\u00a0 The bracelet's solid end links connect seamlessly to the case - which means no ugly gaps. We hate ugly gaps. The lugs of the case reach slightly past the second link, reducing rattle of the bracelet. The links on the oyster bracelet can be individually removed through its pin system, ensuring lasting sturdiness. No loose screws. We also hate loose screws. Fixed to the top of the case around the sapphire glass you'll find our scratch-free matte black ceramic bezel sporting our signature seconds engravings. The inscriptions are only showing the prime numbers on a sunburst circumference. The 'EIGHT PER SECOND' inscription is a reference to the amount of beats per second of our Swiss automatic movement. An everyday watch should be able to take a punch. Our sapphire glass on the front and back of the case offers the very best clarity and scratch resistance your money can buy. We applied not one, not two, but five layers of anti-reflective coating to the inside of the glass, ensuring an unblemished view of the passing of time. Our DLC coated milled solid steel clasp is your security against sleight of hand thieves, who are sure to want a pOrtahl of their own. But they won't get yours. We did hours of research to find the right balance between security and ease. This fold over, double push-button clasp with safety makes for a two-step removal, giving thieves a hard time trying to steal your pOrtahl. The clasp provides 6 micro-adjustment holes for the perfect fit. Every King needs a crown and on the Peacemaker it's located off-center at the 4-hour position. This makes for increased visibility of the pOrtahl ring on the face of the crown when holding a glass of wine or a beer. The lume portal on the crown will illuminate at night catching the eyes of passersby. The perfect conversation starter. The Peacemaker's electroplated black dial provides a minimal, yet mesmerizing aesthetic. In the top half of the dial you will find our brand name, with the '\u25ef', representing the (soon to be) iconic pOrtahl logo at the center line.\u00a0 In the bottom half you can find the name of the watch - \u00a0'PEACEMAKER'. Underneath is the proof that you were here first and are part of the pOrtahl Founders Collective. Exclusively for Kickstarter backers we added a 'FOUNDERS EDITION' inscription. The Hours and Minutes Hands Our polished gunmetal hour and minute hands tell the time on the Peacemaker. The hour and minute hands were inspired by both the Rolex Daytona and Zenith El Primero. The hands are injected with 5 layers of bright blue BGW9 Super-LumiNova\u00ae, allowing you to tell time in the dark. The Seconds Hand Our customly designed seconds hand sports our signature counterweight on the back and the pOrtahl blue tip. It's designed to nearly reach the edge of the dial where it draws its perfect circles along the border of the dial. During the day Peacemaker is designed to be modestly minimalistic, but at night... \u00a0At night the watch comes alive as our signature lume portals light up in the dark. These lume portals, powered by Swiss Super-LumiNova\u00ae are featured around the dial and on the crown. We were aiming for the perfect size for everyday wear. Not too big, as slim as possible and effortless around the wrist. We believe this is it. We have designed pOrtahl's Peacemaker from scratch and in this chapter we want to share our vision on watch design with you. We'll explain the reason behind some of the choices we've made so that you may better understand what makes Peacemaker so special.\u00a0 At pOrtahl we have 5 design goals that make up our design ethos for any watch that we are ever going to create. 1. Something you choose every day - Our watches are tempting to put on every single morning. 2. A conversation piece - Our watches are conversation starters and we'll give you a story to tell. 3. Lasting lifetimes - Our watches are engineered to last and to be passed on from father to son. 4. The best possible experience - Our watches are designed with you in mind. 5. Making every time telling occasion special - Our watches invoke the same feeling of excitement as when you saw your pOrtahl for the first time - every single time you look at your watch. Surface Treatments (DLC) One of the things we are most proud to bring to you is our matte black DLC (diamond-like carbon) coating, a best in class surface treatment. This coating provides some damage control and makes sure that your pOrtahl is able to take a punch. This provides \u00a0some extra peace of mind.\u00a0 Feedback from our focus group pointed out that black DLC coatings can vary in quality and durability, which is why we decided to test several methods of surface treatments. We created a coating process that coats every link individually, allowing for a better and more even distribution of the coating molecules along the surface of the bracelet, hence a more durable coating. 'Men's Staple Black Watch' Why did we choose black? Women have their little black dress. Men will have their staple black watch, designed and engineered by pOrtahl. Peacemaker is a unique addition to every watch collection and at the same time it is also the perfect everyday watch for the one-watch-guy. A black watch just goes well with anything you wear.\u00a0 Another reason we chose black is the paradox of choice. Successful people such as Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Barack Obama are known for wearing the same outfit every day. This is mainly to limit the number of choices they have to make and to save their brain capacity for more important decisions throughout the day. Your matte black pOrtahl Peacemaker will always be a good option. Minimalism We firmly believe a watch is no longer worn for its primary function - i.e. telling time. It is worn to make a statement. That's exactly what we were going for with many of our design choices. A statement. You'll notice that the indices we designed have a minimalistic aesthetic. They disappear and appear depending on how the light catches the dial. Combined with our custom seconds bezel inscriptions they are more than enough for getting a quick glimpse of the time. Super slim Slimness has been a persistent trend in modern product design. Slim phones, slim laptops and many other products that we use daily take up as little space as possible in our lives. We wanted to make our watch as slim as we possibly could so that it easily slides through sleeves and doesn't look or feel clunky on the wrist like many other watches do.\u00a0 To create a watch this thin (11 mm) there are a couple of choices we have made to make it all possible.\u00a0 1. The movement. A movement for the large part decides how thin the case can possibly be. Our Swiss made STP1-11 offers the perfect balance between the features and quality we want to offer you and its sexy slimness. 2. The glass. We chose flat sapphire glass on both the front and back of the watch. 3. The bezel. We chose a non-rotational bezel as rotational bezels significantly increase the thickness of a watch.\u00a0 4. Water resistance. 10 ATM water resistance again gave us the perfect balance between slimness and the right features we want to offer. More than 10 ATM is just unnecessary for most people. Casual swimming with a 10 ATM watch is perfectly fine and let's face it, how many of us are really scuba diving with our favorite watch? Yeah, that's what we thought. Getting rid of tiny frustrations We tried to get rid of all of our little frustrations that both we and our friends have had wearing various types of watches over the years.\u00a0 1. Off-center crown. We put the crown off-center on the 4-hour position so as to prevent it from poking into your hand too much when bending your wrists (for instance when you play sports). This also prevents the watch from getting stuck behind things. 2. Extended lugs. Some watches have watch bands with too much sideways mobility in between the links of the bracelet, making the watch feel cheap and flimsy. We have extended the lugs on the Peacemaker slightly past the gap between the end link and the second link. This prevents the bracelet from \"rattling\" too much and provides a more sturdy and high quality feel. 3. Knurled pattern. The pattern on the side of the crown is knurled allowing for more grip when pulling it out, setting the time or hand winding the movement. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to get your freshly cut fingernail under the crown of a watch to pull it out. 4. Pins over screws. We have experienced this ourselves and clearly, we are not alone. Watch fora are full of complaints about screws in bracelets loosening over time. Pins may be a little harder to replace, but they add lots of longevity to your bracelet. Safety Thieves will always want what you have. But even if it isn't stolen, losing something you love is one of the worst feelings one can have. That's why we added a fold over, double push-button clasp, with safety - which makes for a two-step removal - providing some extra security around the wrist. After reading horror stories from people losing their watch because they didn't tighten a loose screw in time, we found yet another reason for pins over screws.\u00a0 Additionally, we chose not to add a quick release spring as this too creates a single point of weakness for either theft or loss of your watch. These are all decisions we've made to ensure your watch stays around your wrist. Doing things differently (instead of creating another silver diver) We love product design and are always looking for ways to improve on current design standards. That's why, instead of creating yet another silver diver, we wanted to create something different. Something inspired by the bespoke watch artisans that go against the grain.\u00a0 1. The '\u25ef'. Most brand names, like regular names, are written with a capital letter at the beginning of the word. In our case, however, pOrtahl is written with a lowercase 'p' and an uppercase 'O'.\u00a0 The '\u25ef' is the very core of our brand DNA.\u00a0It represents the portal through which you escape from the often immense pressure of modern day life on every time-telling occasion. The '\u25ef' is therefore what we want to emphasize in our brand name. It is incorporated into the design in many ways. 2. The off-center logo. It may take some getting used to, but it was a conscious design choice to have the '\u25ef' at the centerline of the dial, putting the rest of the brand name off-center to again emphasize our brand identity. 3. Lume portals. Although the Peacemaker may be humbly minimalistic during the day, it comes alive at night thanks to the different Swiss Super-LumiNova\u00ae lume portals lighting up around the dial and on the crown. This will soon be a way to recognize who is one of us, even in the absence of light. Packaging We started out sketching and designing metal and lacquer high-end watch boxes for our watches. During this design process, we gathered feedback from our focus group on Facebook on this idea. When we told them what we were working on, however (to our surprise) most people in our group recommended us not to go for a metal or wooden box since they would just throw it out anyway. It seems most people will not save watch boxes (or any boxes for that matter). It was recommended to us that we'd go for a hard paper box as this can still provide a very high quality experience, yet at the same time, it reduces our carbon footprint and it is much easier to recycle. That's how we pivoted to luxury hard paper boxes for our packaging. pOrtahl offers a 2-year international warranty on our Peacemaker watch, meaning we will repair or replace your Peacemaker watch within 2 years of delivery if it suffers any mechanical, manufacturing or assembly defects. This warranty does not cover damages resulting from misuse, or any cosmetic damage such as scratches or marks to the finish, which under the conditions of the warranty constitute regular wear and tear. Opening of the caseback outside of an authorized repair will render the warranty null and void. In the unlikely event that your Peacemaker suffers from a mechanical defect, please contact us immediately and we will offer you a fitting solution. Our campaign is designed to deliver As you may know, many Kickstarter projects offer their backers tons of design options to customize their products, creating not just a paradox of choice for the backer, but also a lot of logistic complexity to the project. After all, all variants have to be manufactured according to order and shipped out to the right person. After analyzing tons of projects and meticulously going through their comment sections to learn from their mistakes it became clear to us that almost every project that offered customization would not deliver on time or too often delivered the wrong goods. \u00a0 At pOrtahl we are focused on our promise to deliver. We have worked tirelessly for the past two years to bring you the watch you are missing and we firmly believe that this is it.\u00a0No customization needed. We aim to deliver your watch on time, to your doorstep, as promised. Here's a timeline of some of the milestones we have achieved leading up to our launch. It's been an amazing journey and we are so grateful to finally launch our watch on Kickstarter. There is much more to come for pOrtahl! My name is Alain (on the right) and I co-founded pOrtahl together with Jordi (on the left). We met when Jordi became my supervisor, back when I was doing an internship at a marketing agency in 2015. We became best friends over our shared love for product design and we started working together shortly after finishing my internship. We have been talking about creating a watch together ever since we met, but we finally started working on it right before the pandemic hit.\u00a0 For the past two years we have been working on 'The Watch We Were Missing'. Now, after many setbacks, successes, obstacles, victories, coffees, beers and tweaks we are extremely proud to show you what has since become 'The Watch You Are Missing'! This is Peacemaker. It's been an incredible journey and we are so, so close to making this dream a reality. We need your help to do it.\u00a0 If you like the watch and you're curious to see us release more watches like it, please back our project today and help us kickstart pOrtahl to be the next big thing in the watch industry.

The videos and photos of neon buffalo that you see in this campaign are of the 'production sample' and accurately represent what we will ship to Backers. We've already started making our custom UHMWPE fabric and all that is left to do is press GO. We're incredibly excited! Shipping fees will be collected post-campaign via the BackerKit platform. \u00a0This enables us to charge you the most accurate and fair shipping possible based on the weight of your package and shipping destination.\u00a0The estimates below are *only* estimates and are subject to change based on rates carriers charge at the time of shipping, this is only to give a baseline for consideration. The pre-filled neon buffalo will most likely have to ship separately in its own box, so if you have multiple items in your pledge via pledge level or add-ons, this will increase the shipping cost due to needing multiple packages. This may also result in increased customs costs for international backers due to receiving multiple packages. *International Backers* We love you and want the neon buffalo to roam your country. However, due to the heavy weight of neon buffalo, we will be limiting our international shipping locations for the pre-filled option.\u00a0 neon buffalo Heavy: $20-25 neon buffalo Heavier: $25-30 neon buffalo Heaviest: $30-35 neon buffalo international/unfilled: $10-12 neon buffalo Heavy: $80-210 neon buffalo Heavier: $100-230 neon buffalo Heaviest: $120-270 neon buffalo international/unfilled: $40-80 The lower-end estimates primarily cover Canada and Mexico. Overseas options start at $130 for the Heavy (30-pound) option.\u00a0 A Note On Customs: All international backers will be responsible for customs fees charged by their respective countries. We launched our first campaign on Kickstarter over 8 years ago. Since that time, we've evolved as a company and learned a lot. Your support has been integral to where we are today and we cannot thank the Kickstarter community enough. Kickstarter has opened doors we didn't even know existed. We've formed genuine friendships with backers, hired backers as employees, traveled around the world with backers, and developed trust and community with backers. We've created a family of wild-individuals from all across the globe. We've been using the production prototype that we have in hand for over 6 months and it is AWESOME. However, in order to bring the neon buffalo to life, we need to reach our goal of $50,000 to meet our factory's minimum order quantities. We'll use the funds raised on Kickstarter to cover the cost of production and shipping container fees as well as to create the training content. Everything is ready to go. All we need to do is hit our funding goal and get into production!",
  "cord 1 is a cable management object from artifactual, a product design studio based in Atlanta, Georgia. Precisely-machined from solid 6061-T6 aluminum, cord 1 provides a secure anchor point for the many wires, cables, and cords that power our modern lives. Designed to be a beautiful and functional addition to any desk, cord 1 features an inverted channel that ensures cables remain securely captured during use. Reusable micro-suction pads on its base enable it\u00a0to attach to a wide range of surfaces, again and again. Design\u00a0 cord 1's geometry is simple; it was designed to be a functional object that seamlessly integrates into any setting. To properly retain cables, cord 1's channel had to be large enough to accommodate a wide variety of cables, but small enough that those cables' plugs could not pass through. After a number of iterations, cord 1's 4mm channel is compatible with all of the most popular cables that power our favorite devices, from Magsafe to Lightning to USB-C. Material cord 1 is machined from solid billets of 6061-T6 aluminum, an aerospace-grade alloy of aluminum that has excellent material properties. It is anodized to a beautiful grey finish, providing it with an aesthetic and protective coating.\u00a0 Attachment\u00a0 cord 1 is secured with 0.8mm-thick micro-suction pads, which feature millions of tiny cavities that function as suction cups, each forming partial vacuums when pressed against surfaces and producing a strong suction force.These micro-suction pads don't leave a sticky residue, and can be rinsed under water to restore their \"stickiness\". cord 1 has been tested on a variety of surfaces; sealed wood, metal, plastic, ceramic, glass. Manufacturing\u00a0 Our production partners are located in Shenzhen, China, the manufacturing center of the world, and we have been working closely with them over the past few months to prototype cord 1 and to ensure that it is optimized for full-scale production.\u00a0 Manufacturing is the main driver of cost for cord 1. In the CNC-machining production process, cost is directly tied to both the setup time and the cutting time required to machine each part out of metal. With larger production runs, the cost of the setup time can be distributed, bringing down the cost of each unit. Our funding goal reflects a production run of 100 units, bringing the unit cost down enough for cord 1 to be manufactured, shipped to artifactual HQ, packaged, and then delivered at a reasonable cost to our backers. Project Timeline About Us\u00a0 Hi, I'm John Kiernan-Lewis, a mechanical engineer with over six years of experience in product design and manufacturing. From camera tripods to child car seats, I have had the opportunity to guide products through all stages of development, from first sketch to mass-production.\u00a0 artifactual was founded in 2021 to foster the development of functional, thoughtfully-designed objects. We are so excited to launch our first product, cord 1, and to deliver it to desks, nightstands, and countertops all around the world!",

  "Lost at Sand is a story that needs to be told, and with your help i'll finally be able to tell it. Well at least Kick start it with a pilot.\u00a0All i can say is alot of time, and pride has been written into this story line to ensure (You) the viewer gets an awesome amount of entertainment. \u00a0 Story- (No spoilers here) Bo on the run, and hunted must figure a way to disappear off the map for good. Join us for an untold story with plenty of action, and amazing character development. Lost at Sand is an original story written by Tate Eppler. Lost At Sand Pilot will introduce us to three of the shows characters. Bo Hurt- Main Character (25) Male, On the run, turns up on the outskirts of Clovis, NM. Abby Nest- Supporting character (24) Female, Struggling single working Mother. Sam Nest- Supporting character (4-5) Male, Abby's sad free, innocent son. Lost at Sand Pilot- script peak Opening:(Scene 1)- Camera focuses down from the sunny clear sky to the vast lonely desert with nothing in sight but two dry black cactuses, and a couple of sun bleached rocks. when suddenly silence breaks, and we hear a deep weak first breath. Bo (Our Main character) raises up into sight with an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt, messy hair, and a pair of Ray-bans ready to fall off of his face with any movement. Bo, now shielding his eyes with his left arm from the harsh rays, then removes his sunglasses, to focus on his surroundings. The camera flips to see what's in Bo\u2019s point of view, and we now see a beaten up highway with a road sign that says 15 miles to Clovis. Camera then cuts behind Bo as we see him stand completely noticing a small duffel bag sitting next to him.\u00a0 (Camera goes back to front view of Bo Torso up) Bo- (puts sunglasses back on)(Picks up bag)(sighs, and says sarcastically) \u201cTook long enough\u201d (And begins walking towards the highway as the theme song starts to play) Break: (Title sequence) Abby\u2019s house:(Scene 2)- Camera comes into a messy, but not trashed house. The dining room table comes into view as we the audience is scanned over the past due, and final notice bills. Then in a rush, Abby comes into the room pulling her polo work top over head. Abby- \u201cSam hurry up baby we\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d (Abby quickly putting her earings on) Sam- (Walks into room still in pajamas *pouting*)\u00a0 Abby-\"Sam we have to go why are you still in your pajamas?\" Sam- \u201cMom I don\u2019t wanna go to school today, I wanna go to work with you. I don't like the new school.\u201d Abby- (takes a knee next to Sam) \u201cHoney I know it\u2019s hard adjusting to a new school, but I promise it will get better.\u201d Sam- (Pouting) \u201cYou promise mommy?\u201d Abby- \u201cOf course, We all have to do things we don't like, but with the things we don't like comes the things we love to do, like watch captain Kull cartoons, and eating a tub of your favorite cookie dough icecream. Which just so happens to be in the freezer.\u201d Sam-(Now excited) \"Really?\" Abby-\"Yup\" (Looks at clock) \"Shit we're gonna be late go get dressed babe.\" Cost Reasons.

  "It's a collection of nostalgic stories that remind you of simpler times, capturing the yearning that we all have for the days without responsibility. Where working 9-5, driving yourself to doctor's appointments, worrying about a rent or mortgages, were not a blip on your radar. It's the soundtrack to your next car adventure, as you drive carelessly through the mountains with the windows rolled down and the smell of pine trees dancing in your nostrils. It's the music you drum your ladle too in the kitchen while you're cooking, accidentally flicking food on the ceiling and burning what's the in oven because you're busy mouthing the lyrics and dancing. It's the background to a night with your friends, drinking boxed wine around the campfire, laughing at the top of your lungs, and taking blurry polaroids that'll stain the inside of your wallet for years to come. And it's the first album I'll ever put out, with a collection of songs so near and dear to my heart. It's an undertaking, in regards to time, emotion, and unfortunately...finances. It'll be featuring other musicians I deeply admire, exceptional artwork, and beautiful merchandise. These donations will help ensure that the product I share with you, and hope brighten your adventures, cooking, and evenings with friends, is exactly what I'd like to create.",

  "\u00a0Environmental disasters are occurring around the world with increasing regularity and severity, and they are affecting larger portions of our Earth and devastating ever-greater segments of the population. Disasters are becoming a more frightening reality no matter where we live. Most of us watch televised images of these disasters, separated from their wrath by the relative safety of distance, as if we are watching a movie and not a real event.\u00a0 A previous work of mine, \u201cWar: Ongoing Project,\u201d stirred viewers and brought them to a new realization of the costs of war. This environment  project will alert them to the emotional costs for humans as a result of global warming and climate changes.\n\nThis project aims to immerse viewers into the aftermath of a natural disaster, allowing them to experience the personal trauma and loss so many suffer.\u00a0 The \u201cENVIRONMENT/MAZE\u201d, created with Hugh Levick, will consist of several large areas, each with a distinctive environmental disaster-related theme. Maze passages will connect each area, but false leads, police barriers; artistic structures and a variety of storm debris will present obstacles to the participants. The idea is to disorient the viewer, causing confusion and frustration similar to what would be felt in a real disaster where one would not find clear paths to relief or safety.\n\nThe themes of each area will vary, representing fire, storm, flood, wind, rain, etc. Within these areas will be constructed sculptural debris, abstract figures of distressed people or animal bodies, sometimes hung from the ceiling. Fans may be used to generate winds, and mirrors may be installed to create illusions of space and to further the sense of disorientation. The viewer will be exposed to these elements from all angles, increasing the sense of complete immersion into the experience.\n \nA very loud and intense sound will emanate from one area. This sound, a combination of music and the actual cries of distressed people, will be an audio theme throughout the exhibit.\u00a0 \u00a0In another area, overhead projectors will cover the floor with an image of rippling water. Against one wall there will be an oversized, blackened canopy bed in ruins. It will be covered with debris, the moldy canopy intertwining with lathe and plaster. Over the bed and cascading, like a waterfall or broken levy, from the wall to the floor will be a flow of crumpled paper. As it seeps from the wall, it is mostly white, but as it falls down over the bed, it gradually turns from white to black. Projected images reflected on that cascade will create the impression of falling water. A room that was once someone\u2019s sanctuary of sleep and comfort has been destroyed. The sound in this room is that of a beating heart.\u00a0 \u00a0These rooms and passages will be generally dark enough to cause the viewer some anxiety or disorientation but with just enough light for safe navigation.\n  \nI welcome other participating artists and set designers to design and build some of the areas. They will be recognized as creative participants in the project. Companies will be encouraged to participate through donations of money and materials. Grants from the state or local government could help fund this project.\u00a0 \u00a0Installations of this project are being planned for Buffalo, NY, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and California. I hope to bring this traveling exhibit to as many locations around the world as will welcome it.\u00a0\n \u00a0Rewards\n\nThe reward for supporting this project will be a signed original piece of art from the collection of Ben Perrone. The art reward will take into account the amount donated. Also the names of major donors will be inscribed on the walls of the project.\u00a0",
  "What will this crowdfunding be used for? \u00a0This crowdfunding will finance the creation of our second album and the filming of our concert release. SONICO recorded, in December 2019, their second album. \"Eduardo Rovira: Inedito e Inconcluso\" is a self-produced album, funded without the help of a label or record company. Our first goal will finance reproduction (CD/Vinyl) and copyright payments.\u00a0 Like many artists, SONICO had to cancel all its activities due to the COVID19 crisis, including 6 concerts for the presentation of our second album: \"Eduardo Rovira: Inedito e Inconcluso\". In this \"catastrophe\" scenario an opportunity has appeared! Film & Arts (the Latin-American leading television channel dedicated exclusively to Arts) has offered us to launch our second album \"Eduardo Rovira: Inedito e Inconcluso\" through his channel. Our second goal will finance the filming production costs to hold a concert without the public. We call on your support to carry out this beautiful project and encourage our artistic creation. We need you!\u00a0 The Brussels based quintet SONICO celebrates the repertoire of the Argentinian composer Eduardo Rovira. Rovira is unjustly thought of as the \u201cother Astor Piazzolla\u201d. This album is the result of an important project of investigation and interpretation that has recovered 14 pieces based on manuscripts and non-commercial recordings. Our goal is clear: we need to collect \u20ac 2000. SONICO needs your help to be able to pay for reproduction (CD/Vinyl) and copyright payments for our album \"Eduardo Rovira: Inedito e Inconcluso.\u00a0 If the collection exceeds the starting sum, it will allow us to finance the filming production costs (\u20ac 2000) to hold a concert to be program in Film & Arts.",
  "For eight years, The House of Art has moved from space to space, filling each one with fantastical art, including dramatic and photo realistic pencil drawings, and paper mache creatures in the form of dragons, beasts, and even a full-size African elephant.\u00a0 \nPaintings and sculptures breathe life into empty spaces; so much so, that the many mannequins seem to move on their own.  Nowhere else in the world can you see its equal. It has attracted attention from all over the nation, and has been featured in documentaries in at least two other countries. Once it nearly spawned a television program when it became one of the top attractions in the State of West Virginia.  Just when it seemed that things could only get better, in 2013 the House of Art had to suddenly shut its doors and journey forward once again to find a home for its Appalachian artists and their creations.  A year passed, and it seemed like nothing was going to happen. Then a generous donation was made.  A private investor has given us the opportunity to fix this building up and three years to return the investment. The property at 900 Mercer St. is nearly 100 years old and was, for many years, the old Virginia Bank of Commerce. Other than a drably painted vault door, there was little to be seen in this now deadened place, but quickly The House of Art began restoring the building back to its former glory.  In no time \u00a0carpets were pulled up, revealing the original tile floors. Walls were torn down, along with drop ceilings and useless mechanical equipment, revealing a three bay coffered ceiling that was nearly two feet thick and filled with dental molding. After only a month, the original historic qualities of the building began to shine through.\u00a0 Progress\u00a0 \n\nThis place will be the first structure that the gallery can solely call its own, and with your help we can bring it up to the standards of wonder and spectacle that the House of Art is known for. We just need help taking care of the basics, like electrical, heating, cooling, and additional bathrooms, as well as meeting building codes and regulations that will come up during the restoration process.We will also replace the existing windows and storefront with \u00a0historically accurate units, at their original heights, so that the gallery can become even more present in the community.  At this point, there are four phases we would like to complete, to help establish the new Gary Bowling's House of Art. \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022\tMeeting bathroom requirements \u2022\tAccessibility and egress issues  \n\u2022\tMechanical upgrades  / Electrical / Heating and Cooling \n\u2022 Re-roof main structure and workshop addition \n\u2022\tGetting the main show room open  \u2022\tInstalling access to the workshop  \n\u2022\tRefurbishing the vault room  \n\u2022\tInstalling all new windows on the first level  \u2022\tRefurbishing the original storefront  \n\u2022\tFinishing out the upper floor to create additional gallery / studio space  \n\u2022\tInstalling new windows on the upper level / additional signage  \u2022\tRefinish workshop  \n\u2022\tCreate a secondary exit from the workshop  \u2022\tInstall an additional restroom \n\u2022\tInstall new historical window fixtures in existing openings  \u2022\tRepair and secure coiling door  \n\u2022\tThis art center in southern West Virginia will brighten the existence of all that come near.  \n\u2022 Exposing children to art and art classes, which some Appalachian communities are totally without in their daily curriculum.   \n\u2022\tBring art to Veterans as a way of expressing emotion when there are not words.  \u2022 Add to a already growing art community in Southern West Virginia.  Artistic Legacy  By helping re-establishing this art center in Southern West Virginia, you will be facilitating art in the surrounding Appalachian communities, and giving a home for the Appalachian artist and their creations. You will be helping expose young up-and-coming artist to the potential of practicing art as a profession, and showing how a passion to create can become the driving force behind a career.  In doing so, you will help to change the face and mindset of the community for generations.  Many thriving artists have had interaction with the House of Art or its artists. Without that experience, their art may have never had a place to grow and be nurtured into what it now is. We have a building. Now we just need your help to make it usable. We would like to raise $40,000.00 as a stepping-stone in our efforts to raise $300,000.00, So that that we can not only fix the building, but create a facility that will inspire generations of Appalachian artists. Gary Bowling\u2019s House of Art is a 501(C)-3 non-profit and all donations are tax-deductible. \nWe're offering a host of rewards and gifts for your pledges. Whether digital, 2D, sculptural, or fantastical, here's your chance to own a small part of Gary Bowling\u2019s House of Art.  Gary Bowling  Gary Bowling is the president and co-founder of the gallery. His art is his autobiography. It reflects moments of his daily life, fingerprints of his emotions, thoughts, and attitudes at the time of execution. Using a wide range of mediums (watercolors, oils, acrylics, etc.), he transforms wood, paper, and canvas into transitional reflections.\nHis art is inherently versatile, and depicts progressive-microcosms with universal appeal. With varying degrees of subtlety, Bowling incorporates pundits, philosophy, satire, and humor. Beauty embraces wit and wisdom. With adaptations of materials, techniques and forms, Bowling integrates traditional basics with unique treatments. The unexpected embraces tradition.\nBowling has participated in art shows from New York to Miami. His paintings, however, have spanned the globe with their popularity. Private collectors are responsible for his global recognition. His national recognition comes from state and federal governments, as well as private collectors. Examples of his works can be seen in state and federal exhibits, including, but not limited to, the Smithsonian. Jody Queen Queen is a self-taught artist who is ever-focused on the minute detail that makes every subject unique and ultimately brings it to life. his work is startlingly realistic and invites us to examine more closely the meticulous regard for the textures that give everyday objects their singularity. Queen works primarily in layered graphite, enjoying the range of expression the medium allows. he also works in wood, acrylics, and mixed media. Following the dream of sharing his love of art, Queen is the co-founder and vice-president of Gary Bowling's House of Art, \u00a0His work has also been juried into Tamarack, the Best of West Virginia. Jamie Powers Powers is an acrylic painter and a mixed media artist.  The paintings are usually horror-themed, of which some are fiction, while others are based on reality. He was born in the dark hollows of southwest Virginia, the son of a coal miner, and grew up in McDowell County, West Virginia. He graduated Big Creek High School in 1996, then went on to study at the Columbus College of Art and Design, majoring in Illustration. He graduated in the spring of 2001. He has worked as a freelance illustrator, but now focuses more on the fine arts.  He has shown work at The House of Art in Bluefield, WV from 2010-2014, in a group exhibition called \u201cThinking Like a Mountain\u201d at the Southwest Virginia Community College in 2010, and later at Bluefield College in 2012. He \u00a0also displayed work at Kulture Klash 7 in Charleston, South Carolina in 2011, and at The East End Artmares exhibitions in Charleston, WV from 2010-2012.  He was just juried into The Allied Artists of West Virginia show at the Huntington museum. Jamie is still creeping around the coalfields of southern WV, being inspired by all the real monsters in the region. Isaac Preston  Preston has been with the House of Art crew for roughly six years, and many of his works have been created and displayed at the gallery. He presented an art show with 'The Artful Lawyer' gallery in Blacksburg, VA in 2013, and his\u00a0work is also featured in the Appalachian Arts Center in Wardell, VA and the Riff Raff Arts Collective in Princeton, WV. Preston uses recyclables as his primary medium, and he is also known for his works in wire sculpture. He is also active with the Hinton, WV theater group Ars Creo, and \u00a0acted with the Planet Extreme Teen Center in Princeton, WV in their production of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' in which he played Willie Wonka. When time allows, he poses as a live model for artists, and performs hand percussion and spoken word at open stage events. He has also conducted workshops for his wire work. Originally centered in Bluefield, WV, Preston\u00a0hopes that reestablishing in the Princeton area will give him, and other artists, a great opportunity to share their passion with others. He seeks to inspire \u00a0new generations to follow their passion and spread happiness whenever possible. Rita Montrosse Is a native to West Virginia and has taught art for 34 years at Princeton Senior High School in Mercer County. Presently, she is an adjunct instructor of Watercolor and Metals Smithing at Concord University.\nHer paintings reflect a personal relationship with her environment, either at home in the mountains of West Virginia or in her travels. Her many sketches and photographs provide material for her watercolors/mixed media paintings, and have even influenced her jewelry designs. Whichever media she uses, she works in a series starting with a representational theme and pushing it as far as she can in developing the concepts. She doesn't set a limit to the number in a series, instead working it until it seems complete. Often, a series will be revisited because she can\u2019t release it, or has had an insight into a new compositional arrangement. \nShe feels fortunate that she lives in the beautiful state of West Virginia and has been able to work at what she loves, both as an art teacher and an artist/artisan.  \nChristopher Lee Clark  Clark works in a wide array of mediums, including ink, paint, plaster, and sculpture. He is one of the key artists behind the library mural in Princeton, and has created set pieces for the Hinton, WV theater group Ars Creo, in which he also performs as an actor. Clark is a member of the Appalachian Artists Collective, for which he designed and built the Paper Theater in the Clay Center in Charleston, WV, and his work has been used and published by the internet artist community founded by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, HitRecord. Clark's work captures scenes of intricate fantasy, often encompassing sinister, unusual, or otherworldly tones. The creatures he has created at the House of Art and elsewhere are the fully realized visions of a mind that sees no impossibility in the realms of creation, and works to bring elements of spectacle, wonder, and imagination to life. Many of his pieces are visual staples of Princeton life, appearing in shop windows, parades, and productions. Clark has been part of the House of Art for six years.

  "When you look at the bottom of a plastic container before recycling it, do you ever wonder who created that ubiquitous system of triangles and numbers?  Milly Zantow, a little known woman from south central Wisconsin had a vision, set out to make a difference in the world, and did.\nAlthough many have never even heard of her, she is one of the most important people in the recycling community.  Milly is responsible for creating that system of numbered triangle symbols on the bottom of plastic containers.  Raised to reuse and recycle, Milly was always sensitive to waste.  Back in the 1970s she was surprised to hear that a rural Sauk County, Wisconsin garbage dump was to be closed early because it was filling up so fast.  Milly went to the dump and sat and watched as people dropped off their garbage. One thing she noted was that a majority of what she saw was made of plastic.  She believed that something had to be done.  She contacted a local milk jug manufacturer and came to an exciting conclusion \u2013 that the plastic could be ground down and reused.  According to the Wall Street Journal, \"Zantow pushed to introduce plastics recycling to the area.  After laying groundwork with lawmakers, communities and industry, in 1979, Zantow co-founded the first complete recycling service in Sauk County, E-Z Recycling, which handled more than 200,000 pounds of materials in its first full year.\"  Milly died in 2014 at the age of 91.  She never saw a monument in her name, but a group of Sauk County Institute of Leadership program participants wish to raise funds to place at least one memorial for this inspirational woman who did so much with so little.  Our goal is to place a personalized bench with a custom-made art piece in the newly constructed Harvest Park located in Reedsburg, Wisconsin.  The art piece is to be made of recycled metal materials; the bench will be made of recycled plastic and feature a memorial in Milly's honor.  We would also like to place an informational sign describing her contribution to the world of recycling.  \nWe have contacted a local bench company that will assist in providing the bench and have been in discussions with local artists that will create a one-of-a-kind sign befitting such an icon.  Harvest Park, in Reedsburg, Wisconsin is the home of The Ruminant, a must see as a part of the county\u2019s up and coming Fermentation Fest.  Having a memorial for Milly in a place where a combine was recycled into a beautiful art piece feels right.  Follow the link below to learn more about The Ruminant:\nhttp://www.karlunnasch.com/project-pages/2013.10-ruminant-stained-glass-harvesting-combine.htm  Harvest Park is a highlight of the yearly Fermentation Fest and will be seen by thousands of people: http://fermentationfest.com/ Related Links www.facebook.com/MillyZantow http://millyzantow.blogspot.com/ ",

  "We are raising funds for the funding of the Short Film: God's Plan. Although a very small production and independent film, we are hiring some actors with experience, using good quality equipment and will book some locations to maintain a certain standard of awesome quality for the film!

Many of the audience will become attached to the PLOT of the film and the main character's STRUGGLES as they are all too common and relevant. \u00a0For those who ever had or has a gift and talent they wanted to pursue as their ultimate passion but somewhere along the course that passion has gotten side swept by priorities of proving financial stability, marriage and life...

  "\u00a0Follow us on facebook \u00a0 For your consideration,\u00a0 \"Beyond The River Bridge\" is based on the unsolved murder of Mary Faye Hunter. This is a true story that took place in Decatur, Alabama in May of 1967 when Mary Faye went missing. Her remains were found by two children 5 months later. For 50 years her murder went unsolved, until now. Motivated by my grade school friend, Brad Golson, I decided to write a screenplay about this and he launched his own investigation into her death around December 2017. Since then, not only have we solved the case beyond a reasonable doubt, but we have uncovered a local conspiracy to conceal the truth about her death and those surrounding it. Also I have been motivated to return to film-making. When I was a teen my father, Dr. James W. Hunter produced two movies for me. The movies are available to watch for free on youtube.com/jwhiiiproductions. I have been working in film for almost 30 years. You see, Mary Faye was also my dad's sister. Please help us bring justice to Mary Faye by getting this film produced. Our hope is that through this film, we may spark renewed interest locally that might put pressure on the local government to close her case once and for all and give this closure. The local D.A. has refused to release any information to me, her only living relative interested in the case. They are withholding the autopsy report. They have shown no interest in our new evidence. You are not only producing a good quality film here, but you are also demanding justice with your support.\u00a0 This film will be a period piece, set in the early stages of Mary Faye Hunter's life beginning in 1954. The film with span the two decades preceding her murder, and will also follow her brother Jimmy's life. Our goal is to create an immersive experience to transport audiences back to the past, in search of the truth. The film will be a love letter to the 50's and 60's, and we plan on paying attention to every detail in order to keep the movie authentic to the period. \u00a0Our youtube page will tell you more about us. \u00a0 Depending on our budget and needs, I plan to shoot the film digitally with possibly some 16mm and 8mm footage thrown in for authenticity. I will be able to pool my old resources in order to keep costs down and work faster. We expect a 30 - 60 day shoot with locations in Alabama and Tennessee. Possibly Georgia and California also. I would like Julia Garner (Ruth from Ozark) to play Mary Faye due to their uncanny resemblance. I am currently in negotiations with her representatives. I am very serious about this project.\u00a0 If you have any other questions or concerns, please contact us at 3412timberway@gmail.com for more information. Please share this Kickstarter page as much as possible. Thanks so much.\u00a0",
  "Sam\u2019s Log Cabin is a special place to a lot of people, and we are very excited to finally announce our plans for the backyard! \u00a0 Almost 4 years ago, Rhasaan Fernandez and Mike Daillak took over the cabin from the original Sam\u2019s family. \u00a0Since then, they have worked tirelessly to craft it into a different kind of restaurant experience: \u00a0A cozy and warm place where the community can enjoy a great breakfast or lunch in an atmosphere that is as local and organic as the food, all while engaging with each other and the local arts scene. \u00a0 The backyard is a big part of that vision! Imagine enjoying live music while waiting for a table on the weekends (the added patio will also help cut down the wait times!) or bringing the family to a movie night or feature stage performance. \u00a0These are but a few of the plans we have for our new space. \u00a0 As our community has expanded, we've put all of the profits towards\u00a0increasing our use of local/organic/sustainable ingredients on the menu. \u00a0We plan on continuing in this direction as we move forward. \u00a0Yet to do that, we first need to expand our seating and kitchen capacity. \u00a0 That brings us to why you\u2019re here!\u00a0 \u00a0Our goal is to raise 40k for several big additions to the backyard, including: - An additional larger patio\u00a0for added outdoor seating\u00a0 - A stage featuring live local music on Saturdays and Sundays as well as evening performances on a monthly basis \u00a0(Saturdays will be various genres - Sundays will be a \u201cBluegrass Brunch!\u201d)\u00a0 - Vegetable/Herb gardens, native grass and other landscaping\u00a0 - More fruit trees (we currently have figs, blackberries, apples and lemons)\u00a0 - A brick oven for some more creative dishes (breakfast pizzas, baked egg dishes...etc)\u00a0 - A space that can be used for community events (meetings, concerts, parties, movie nights...etc)\u00a0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0Some structural changes we\u2019ll also need are:\u00a0 - An outdoor walk-in refrigerator\u00a0 - New hoods for an expanded kitchen range\u00a0 - An enclosed storage area\u00a0 - A new perimeter fence - An outdoor service station\u00a0 - Cement foundations for the patio and walkways\u00a0 - Drainage systems\u00a0",
  "Hello my name is Niamh Dunne, I\u2019m a singer and fiddle player from Limerick in Ireland and I am making a new album of songs. I\u2019ve been in the band Beoga for almost 20 years. In the last number of years we have explored different musical avenues and have worked with an array of incredible artitsts and started writing songs as a band for the first time. It has brought me to a place where I was drawn to start to write and sing my own songs. They are the songs of my own personal history, and, in that great tradition\u00a0of folk singing, telling the stories of ordinary people who lived extraordinary lives. I have recently had the great honour of performing and filming some of these newly written songs with the Ulster Orchestra in The Titanic Drawing Room in Belfast. I performed with the incredible talents of Sean \u00d3g Graham and Nicola Joyce and enlisted the help of my good friend and long time collaborator Michael Keeney to score the orchestra parts. It has given me a real push to get into the studio with these brilliant people and make my own recording and share these songs.\u00a0 If you want to support me in the making of this album you can pre order a download, a CD or a vinyl to help support the work. There are a variety of options available in the rewards section of the campaign for you to check out. I love the idea of creating a community around this project. Thank you so much for your support, it means a lot.\u00a0 I'll update you as I progress through the recording process, see you on the other side!",
  "Our vision is to create and deliver an audio-visual experience.  Crave is not only our project title it is the sensation we want our audience to leave with.\n\n With that in mind we have collaborated with several artist to come up with a style direction that has the potential to leave an everlasting impression.  Using live DJ\u2019s, live visuals, projection installations, and luminescent ambiance, the treatment feels unrestricted with the lack of boundaries between what is real, and what is surreal \u2013 it is limitless, infinite, and therefore boundless. \n\nProject Crave is an alliance between artists meant to remind people that we must live every moment.  The world is changing so rapidly if we don\u2019t stop to live every once and awhile things will pass us by.  This project is a fusion of talent, heart, and hope brought together to inspire people to strive to find the fun in all aspects of their existence.\n\n Whenever they think back, their Craveings will remind them of the one spring night they entered another world full of neon paintings, beams of light, and the crowd they danced the night away with. \n",

What makes the ExBar better than the competition? Standard dumbbell and barbell designs haven\u2019t changed for thousands of years, dating back to Ancient Greece. They are bulky, costly, and take up valuable time to assemble and disassemble. Most other innovative products on the market cost several hundred dollars. As you will see below, the ExBar is in a league of it's own. Our Story Two years ago, Andrew was in the process of setting up a small home gym and quickly became frustrated because there was no products on the market that allowed him to perform a full body workout without having to order many different products and spend hundreds of dollars. He thought, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there something better?\u201d The idea for the ExBar was born that week. After a quick prototype was assembled, Andrew quickly told JR, his brother-in-law, about his new idea. JR was the perfect partner for ExBar as a Certified Fitness Trainer, gym owner and US Military Veteran. The ExBar team has spent the last two years designing the perfect product. R&D, patent work, speaking with manufacturers, potential licensors and many fitness professionals. Multiple prototypes were received from our overseas manufacturer which were tested rigorously and improved every time until arriving at the product offered to you today. Our manufacturing facility is standing by ready to produce the product and the team is ready to fulfill your orders and exceed your expectations. We are passionate about bringing the ExBar to millions of homes and fitness centres across the world and improving lives. We have done our best to offer the most competitive express shipping rates. All figures are in Canadian. At this time we are only shipping to Canada and USA. That will soon change.",

  "Our next album, Bendjistan, is on its way!\u00a0 Since our first album Lost Weekend came out in 2016, we've done three years of composing, improvising, touring, meeting new and exciting musicians, getting new inspirations and playing concerts around Europe (and the world!), and we're finally getting ready to bring you our latest effort. This album is much more than just our music: we rely on sound engineers and producers, a mixing and mastering engineer, photographers and design artists, not to mention a label, promoters, printers etc... A crowdfunding campaign will help us with the costs involved in hiring all these generous, gifted, highly-trained people, so as to reach the ultimate goal: putting our music in your hands. Here's an overview of what all this is about. This crowdfunding hopes to cover part of our costs (see behind the scenes, below). \u00a0At this stage, we estimate a total expenditure of 8,000 to 9,000 EUR; we are hoping to raise half of this, and cover the rest with sales and gigs.\u00a0 We'd like to give you the chance to participate in this, our latest creative adventure. We will offer you in return our gratitude in the form of CDs, Vinyls, collector tote bags, a bespoke tune and even should you wish a private concert. We are three musicians from three countries and three distinct musical backgrounds, putting our strings together to shape a music as new and original as we can. \u00a0Petra Onderufov\u00e1 (Violin, Slovakia) combines her Jazz education with the Folk sound she has learnt from fiddlers from all over, exploding on stage with a high-energy delivery tempered by cool-headed themes and improvisations. Aleksander Kuzmi\u0107 (Guitar+Vocals, Slovenia) has travelled from the Balkan songs he grew up with to musical cultures far and wide, teaching himself to compose and improvise fluently in styles from Flamenco to Greek and Funk to Metal, always merged into his own completely original and virtuosic performances. Toby Kuhn (Cello, France) left a lifetime of Classical music behind when he began to discover and invent new exciting ways to play his instrument, always fluently pushing boundaries with power as he journeys joyously into a musical world of boundless possibilities.\u00a0 Together we have been working for five years to create an intense musical experience that takes you, our public, on an unforgettable voyage across style and invention, to then bring you home changed and exhilarated. And, of course, 'appy. If you'd like to know more about us, our music, our story, and our upcoming gigs, check out our website wildstringstrio.org, our facebook, youtube, instagram and bandcamp pages. And of course, do write to us at wildstringstrio@gmail.com, we'd love to hear from you This album is a series of original tunes that we wrote in a collaborative process over the last three years, getting our influences from the folk music that we hear every day, principally from the Balkans but also from further afield, from Celtic to Flamenco, Azerbaijan to Mali; as well from our training as Jazz or Classical musicians; from the music that we have listened to including Funk, Pop, Metal, Jazz and of course World Music of all persuasions; and finally from three lifetimes of improvising freely in jam sessions in caf\u00e9s, bars, on the street, on big stages and backstages, by ourselves, together, and with amazing musicians from everywhere (Uzbekistan, India, Sweden, Iran, Bulgaria, UK, USA, Spain, Chile, Czechia, Serbia, Morocco, to name only a few... and of course our native Slovakia, Slovenia and France!) We have tried to put all of our trademark energy and joyfulness into these tunes, but also care and attention to detail, with as much love and soul as we possess.\u00a0 A step up from our last album brings our playing, composing and improvising to a new level, expanding our horizons inwards and outwards to that mythical and fantastic place where everything is music and music is everything, the country we call Bendjistan. The composition of this album has been going on organically for three years. We've rehearsed in our homes (thanking our flatmates for their patience...), in friendly venues and most recently in our friend Matija Solce's home to get our material ready. In January we arrived in GAM studios, in the Belgian Ardennes, to record 9 of our tunes. There our amazing producer and sound engineer Leander Meuris and his fabulous sidekick Toon Develetere recorded us over five days of intense music-making, accompanied by healthy doses of good food and drink! With their help, support, and clear decision-making we were able to get everything we wanted out of our session, i.e. not only a great album but also a very enjoyable moment.\u00a0\u00a0 We've just finished listening to the work that our exceptional mixing and mastering engineer has done: Leszek Kami\u0144ski has taken our raw material and extracted a real work of art in a magical process: painless, fast, professional, and fiercely exciting. We still need to make an epic album cover: our photographer Tadej \u010cau\u0161evi\u010d will travel with us in early july to Croatia to... well, you'll see!! We need to design our album cover: Jan Ce\u013e\u00fach will be making it all look spiffy. We are teaming up again with Slovenian label Celinka run by Janez Dov\u010d, who did great work on our last album and who will help get the new one out to you, wherever you may be. We will need to print our album; of course as a CD, but also as a vinyl, and we plan as well as a USB stick, and as a digital release so that everyone can enjoy our music, regardless of how And of course we will then RELEASE IT TO YOU at the end of September.",
  "We are 3 on the Bund, an exciting band that came together in March of 2019 after meeting in the University of Limerick's renowned Irish World Academy. Our complex, layered arrangements consist of both traditional and newly composed tunes which are played with an energy and a passion that is completely authentic. Just before Covid hit Ireland in early 2020, we decided to take our next major step and record our debut album - a plan that was quickly hindered by the first lockdown in March 2020. Since then, we managed to arrange our music remotely and record our album in different locations when regulations allowed for it.\u00a0Also, the lack of performance opportunities over the last year and a half limited our capabilities of creating our debut album. This is why we need YOUR help!\u00a0 The band's 4 members are from varied musical backgrounds which contributes to our diverse sound; Aisling Lyons who plays harp and concertina is from County Clare, Rebecca McCarthy-Kent on fiddle and piano is from Tramore in\u00a0County Waterford, Se\u00e1n Kelliher on guitar and banjo comes\u00a0from County Kerry and finally, Simon Pfisterer who is originally from Bavaria, Germany, is the uilleann piper of the group. As individuals, we all are award-winning and accomplished performers and as a group, we have already travelled to Beijing, Shanghai, the UK and the United States. On our album you will find our own compositions alongside traditional tunes and songs, all arranged with an intricate and modern twist. As we play a wide variety of instruments (Fiddle, Guitar, Concertina, Uilleann Pipes, Harp, Banjo, Piano, Mandolin, Whistles), we often change up the instrumentation and make every set sound unique while keeping our original \"3 on the Bund\" sound. The album title, \"Frenzy\", is the name of one of the tunes on the album, a polka composed by Breannd\u00e1n Begley. We chose it as it best describes the initial feeling we had when we started playing together as a band. We are also delighted to welcome a few guest musicians on the album: R\u00f3is\u00edn Ryan on vocals, Trevor Hutchinson (L\u00fanasa) on double bass, and Dermot Sheedy (Hermitage Green) on bodhr\u00e1n and drums.",
  "Hi! This kickstarter project is to cover a stipend while I write and research an upcoming screenplay based upon the often little-discussed and known facts of the Civil War - very much relatable and timely to today. For instance, did you know that President Lincoln was actually very \"fun\" and personable to be around often, even during the midst of handling a serious crisis? Did you know that General Sherman had a \"spy\" who was so to eager to single-handedly win the war that he volunteered for a suicide mission, was caught, imprisoned, and picked up later by Sherman in a raid, only to volunteer for an even bigger mission after that? Were you aware that Union soldiers held a mock trial in a seized courtroom and actually \"tried\" the case the South was making, and voted to agree with it? And are you aware that women often knew of their \"limited\" role(s) of the time, and were actually cunning and smart to operate and successfully in a 'supportive\" function, knowing that their day was on the horizon and that a country that offered that horizon needed their presence now? This screenplay will incorporate all of this and much more.\u00a0 I am looking to cover a stipend for the three months that it will take to fully research and write this (I have already begun part-time). My first book is releasing later this year - look for \"Twelve Angels: The Women who taught me how to act, live, and love\" on Amazon - and, as you will find from the book, I have the connections to help realize this screenplay.\u00a0 Your investment will not only come with the associated rewards, but you will also be contributing to a \"voice\" of positive reasoning and binding much needed today. Thank you for your interest and support, and I look forward to this exciting opportunity! (*working title)",
  "'Ockhi' is a Feature Film on a true story of two young brothers, George, and Anil (age 18 and 12), who live in a town of Kerala and have a loving family. It's a story of love, loss, and victory. In December 2017, Cyclone Ockhi destroyed Kerala and nearby towns on the banks of Arabian Sea, as a result, 661 people went missing, George and Anil too, for the 7 longest days of their lives in the Arabian Sea. The Director \u00a0Abhinav Dubey is the Director of the film. He has a BA in Journalism and Mass communication from India, and MA in Filmmaking (Direction) from The Northern Film School, Leeds, United Kingdom. He has directed many short films and has won many awards for his Short Curtains. He has been working on this story from the past 9 months and waiting to tell the story to the world. The story is of two young boys' struggle for survival in a turbulent sea for 7 days will also create impact and more awareness for increasing the rescue and relief facilities at the disposal of the government. This will also encourage people at large to hold on in such adverse conditions for their own survival and a better life. The climate change is bringing more such difficult situations all over the world.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 We want to tell the true story of survival which will not only show the world how people stand together at the time of crisis but also reveal the government functioning and how the system works. Whatever we get through the funding, 20% will be kept aside for Kerala relief fund and will be used whenever such natural disaster happens. This film is for the people who survived, saved, and also in the memory of who lost their lives in the sea.\u00a0 \u00a0 As we move towards the production of the film, the main challenge is to get the Visual Effects right. As we all know, Vfx cost a lot for a feature film, But we will try to make it as real as possible. The initial target is \u00a38000 and we would go ahead for a target of \u00a3100,000 as we want to give pure cinema experience. \n \n It's not easy to shoot in the Arabian sea for long, that is one the biggest challenge for us to keep going, but we have managed to get the right people on board. We have also got the Government on board and they are more than happy to help in making the film and we will try to get the Indian Navy as well. \n \n We really need your support to make this film get on screen, and we promise you will get the best experience and cinema. \nWe have a powerful script, budget, schedule, and crew. Now we need you. We're crowdfunding because financing an independent feature film is a challenging proposition for investors and we want to offer opportunities for people to get directly involved with the project. 'Ockhi' going to be a true community experience. We have many rewards for you, please do have a look! We understand that not every person has the money to donate, but what we hope you can take away from our project is the passion we have not just for this film, but for the people who have opened their doors and hearts to us. We are committed to faithfully sharing their story with you. You can help us share it with others. Spread the word. Everyone involved with this project will be very proud, remember...

  "\u201cCarlos Seixas for classical guitar\u201d is a project I started many years ago while I was studying my bachelor\u2019s degree in Spain. I was drawn mostly by the interest I have in transcribing music for guitar and by the undeniable quality of Carlos Seixas\u2019 music. The fact that Seixas is one of the greatest portuguese composers was also an important point: I always felt the need of performing music from my own country.\u00a0 \"Carlos Seixas para guitarra cl\u00e1ssica\" \u00e9 um projeto que iniciei h\u00e1 j\u00e1 alguns anos, quando estudava a minha licenciatura em Espanha. O interesse surgiu principalmente devido ao gosto que tenho pela transcri\u00e7\u00e3o e pela qualidade indubit\u00e1vel da m\u00fasica de Carlos Seixas. O facto de Seixas ser um dos melhores compositores portugueses foi tamb\u00e9m um ponto a favor, j\u00e1 que sempre senti vontade e necessidade de tocar m\u00fasica do meu pa\u00eds.\u00a0 \u00a0I started an extensive work of transcribing, arranging, practicing and publishing a set of Sonatas from this composer. Now it\u2019s time to put all my work and effort in a CD! Iniciei assim um trabalho extenso de transcri\u00e7\u00e3o, estudo e publica\u00e7\u00e3o de um conjunto de Sonatas deste compositor portugu\u00eas. Chegou agora o t\u00e3o esperado momento de gravar um CD com estas sonatas.\u00a0 A great deal of love and thought has been put into this CD, a very unique and exciting project, I might say! I have been practicing and preparing a whole program only with Carlos Seixas\u2019 music that include a vast and contrasting repertoire that represent the apogee of baroque portuguese music. This CD is a colaboration between myself, the sound engineer Javier Salvador and \u201cMovimento Patrimonial pela m\u00fasica portuguesa (MPMP)\u201d, an organization that promotes portuguese music.\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.jsmrecords.com \u00a0https://mpmp.pt/ Dediquei muito tempo, esfor\u00e7o e dedica\u00e7\u00e3o na prepara\u00e7\u00e3o e consequente realiza\u00e7\u00e3o deste CD. Este projeto inclui uma repert\u00f3rio vasto e contrastante, e representa o apogeu do barroco portugu\u00eas. Este CD \u00e9 uma colabora\u00e7\u00e3o entre mim, o t\u00e9cnico de som Javier Salvador e o Movimento Patrimonial pela M\u00fasica Portuguesa (MPMP), uma organiza\u00e7\u00e3o que promove a m\u00fasica portuguesa e os seus compositores e int\u00e9rpretes.\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.jsmrecords.com \u00a0https://mpmp.pt/ Everything is prepared and under control! :) \u00a0I will record the CD from the 26th to 31st October 2021 in Castell\u00f3n, Spain. I am extremely lucky for the huge support of Movimento Pela M\u00fasica Portuguesa. However, I still need to cover the cost of recording, editing and mastering the audio. If we are lucky enough to overpass my goal, the money will be used to cover travelling and accomodation expenses.\u00a0 Tudo est\u00e1 preparado e a correr como esperado! :) Irei gravar o CD de 26 a 30 de Outubro de 2021, em Castell\u00f3n, Espanha.\u00a0 Sinto-me extremamente feliz e honrada pela parceria e pelo apoio do Movimento Pela M\u00fasica Portuguesa. Contudo, tenho de financiar os gastos correspondentes \u00e0 grava\u00e7\u00e3o, edi\u00e7\u00e3o e masteriza\u00e7\u00e3o.

  "Since its unveiling at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1963, the Porsche 911 has captivated motoring enthusiasts around the world. Throughout its eight generations of models, the 911 has largely retained its iconic rounded profile. This CNC machined aluminum speedform sculpture is an interpretation of the Porsche 911 ethos done in collaboration with professional automotive designer Andhika Dimas. It is designed to exaggerate the 911's iconic timeless proportion and capture it in sculptural form. A Speedform is a common automotive designing style which helps automotive designers hone proportions and create movement in the design. The placement of lights, mirrors or air intakes is often disregarded at this stage as designers are striving to make the design as dynamic as possible.\u00a0 Traditionally, speedforms are sculpted from clay by an automotive designer (#dontforgetthemodellers). There is no substitute for freshly machined metal, so in typical AltDynamic fashion, we had to elevate the speedform to sculpture quality.\u00a0 We have spent countless hours virtually simulating toolpaths and have machined nearly two dozen prototypes to sculpt an elegant speedform. The outcome is a flawlessly machined finish fused with flowing contours.\u00a0 All Speedforms are machined in the USA. We have done extensive prototyping to make sure we can deliver them on time and with the utmost quality and craftsmanship. We know Porsche and automotive enthusiasts have high standards and are very particular about colors and the spec of their cars. We are starting this campaign with a base offering of 5 color options. Based on feedback, we will add more colors, the more backers there are, the more options we can offer.\u00a0 We are using anodized color coatings which are extremely durable, corrosion-resistant, scratch-resistant and won't stain or rub off. Porsche, Lamborghini and Ferrari use anodizing for their center locking wheels.\u00a0 If you have a particular color, finish or texture, we will gladly try to accommodate you. Custom colors, materials or paints are all possible. Inquire within.\u00a0 Customer service is a top priority for us! We use the milestone timeline system we pioneered on Kickstarter to keep backers updated. Each blue dot represents a milestone where we will send a campaign update so you know how development is advancing. We will not be like other Kickstarter campaigns who leave their backers in the dark and guessing as to what is happening. Every order will be emailed a tracking link. Once the campaign ends, you will receive a Backer Survey email from Kickstarter where you will choose relevant options (such as color) for your pledge and provide us your shipping information. We are planning to ship pledges this July. Message us if you have a question on how to pledge.\u00a0 We have a track record of successfully completing and fulfilling our campaigns. View our prior AltDynamic campaigns to see what our backers are saying. We only ship quality! Please note this passion project is not done in partnership or in association in any way with Porsche AG or Porsche Cars North America, Inc., though it would be really cool if it was (write us).\u00a0",
  "With more and more screen time, people are starting to invest a lot in appropriate hardware. In return, they boost their performance. As a monitor only weights about 5 kg nowadays, we decided to come up with a stand to allow you to set up your monitor easily, and anywhere you need it. There are 2 types of threads 3/8 or 1/4) possible on tripods fittings. We use 3/8-16 and for those who only order the bracket we include an adapter to the other standard 1/4-20. The bolts and plastic spacers required to connect the bracket to your screen are always included. If we reach \u20ac10 000 during the lifetime of the campaign we will include this adapter in all pledges! At a certain time, 1 out of 2 office workers will suffer from ergonomic concerns like back or neck pain. A wrongly positioned screen may not only cause injuries (for example MSD) but is also uncomfortable and may lead to eyestrain. All these health related issues have a negative effect on your productivity. The ergonomic risk is even higher for people working form home as they often do not have a dedicated office but are working at a counter or a regular table. For all of you, we are the solution! There should be 4 holes with thread at the back of your screen. If you don't see then straight away, they might be hidden by the existing stand. These holes are made following a universal standard of measurements. Most brands like Samsung, Dell, LG, MSI, Lenovo, Huawei, Acer, Philips etc. stick to this standard. Reading this you realise, your screen will probably be one of the 90% screens that fit our product! We will provide the necessary screws and other essentials to connect the bracket. You don\u2019t have your own office at home? Don't worry! Switch between your kitchen counter, living room table, bathroom counter and always have your screen at the right height. The possibilities are endless! We even tested the screen with indoor cycling or rowing. We have a small tripod (height range 29 \u2013 87,5 cm) if you intend to use the desk in the sofa or at the table, like on above pictures. If you want to set the monitor directly on the floor to watch the screen while standing, our large tripod (height range 46,5 \u2013 143,5 cm) is better suited.\u00a0 Having\u00a0the\u00a0television\u00a0on in the background\u00a0while\u00a0\u201cno one is watching it\u201d,\u00a0is enough to delay language development\u00a0for your kids. Normally,\u00a0a parent speaks\u00a0about 940 words per hour when a toddler is around. With the television on, that number falls by 770 words! With our product, you can hide the screen when not in use. This makes it less likely to seduce you to start watching when you do not intend to so. For optimal ergonomics, it is best to watch television on a monitor and not on a mobile phone or tablet. This is likely the case as on average, we watch around 4 hours of television a day. If you sit more than 10 hours a day, the chances of dying early increase by 34% compared to those who only sit 1 hour a day. With this product you kill two birds with one stone; you can use it to work standing and you will watch less television because the television is stored when not in use. Or inmates with who have access to natural light are less likely to relapse? Students will process information quicker after a hike in nature and will experience less stress. Direct your sofa to your window so you can enjoy your garden and natural light. When you decide to watch television, close your curtains, light some candles and set-up your screen in front of your curtains. \u00a0Your body will tell you at which height and position to set-up the screen, watching television was never so comfortable. The bracket and the thread housing are both laser cut and machined in Ghent. The tripod is made in China by the same supplier as we use for other projects. We are well aware of its capabilities as we have supplied over 2 000 customers without any problems.\u00a0 The product is extremely user-friendly thanks to its portability because of the handle and the lightness of the unit (also depending on your screen of course). Besides these positive points, it also takes up little space. The unit is especially suitable for those who want to work in different places or want to take the screen with them when traveling and working in another location. We have more than 3 000 customers and over 150 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 - reviews on Etsy and on our website. It all started on Kickstarter and we are proud to say that we have always kept our promises. We are here for the long run!

Jacques Mayol, famous French diver, adored the beaches and the sea of \u200b\u200bKaratsu. A vibrant tribute is given on this page written by his Japanese friends :http://www.yoyokaku.com/sub7e-6.htm.\u00a0 It was during a trip in 2017 that we crossed Japan and found this ideal location. We met Japanese people ready to welcome our French gallery project ! Our gallery in Karatsu is called JI's \"French Art Gallery\". Its goal is to discover French art in all its forms of expression : exhibition of pictorial, sculptural, artisanal art, bookstore, design, French \"savoir-vivre\", etc. To open this gallery, we need to make repairs. This place is an old restaurant, which before that, it was a tatami store. Three generations of the same family have succeeded each other in this place (around 80 years of family and commercial history). It is rare to find places like this located in the city center. It is for this reason and for its development potential that we have chosen it.\u00a0But there is still a lot of work to be done to make it consistent, to create spaces and give real beauty to this place to create a gallery worthy of the name.\u00a0We have estimated the budget at 50000 \u20ac if we do all the work ourselves. We both have experiences in renovation. We know that this is not a negligible amount that's why we hesitated to create this crowdfunding.\u00a0But we strongly believe in the success of this project and we come to tell us that to offer you the most beautiful, to offer you to share our dream and also to promote our culture, we had to take this step. To present you the project in a more concrete way, the local is about 115m2 with several dedicated spaces. We want to create a space that is both modern and minimalist (so that the artworks have their place). Its design will blend French culture with its creators and Japanese culture with its history and location. With this zoning, we want to explain a little more the distribution of spaces and show you the flow of displacement : Today the gallery looks like this : At the end of the renovation, this is what the project should look like.",
  "In the spring of 2020, I was preparing to release my debut folk EP, North Branch River -- ordering CDs, working on merch, and spreading the word about my release show, scheduled for March 21st! As you can probably imagine, things did not go to plan. The release show was cancelled, along with so many other things, as the world shut down to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 I did release the album, and I received so much lovely feedback from friends, family, and strangers from afar about how the music impacted them. But I'd be lying if I said the pandemic didn't take some of the wind out of my creative sails. What use was there for my music, in a world that was struggling to survive? What future could I see for myself -- as a musician and performer, and storyteller and community balladeer -- in a world that was feeling more and more out of control?\u00a0 I found myself in a creative \"egg\" stage for much of 2020 -- not playing much, not writing much, and certainly not thinking about a new album. \u00a0But new years always bring new energy, and 2021 brought with it a desire to bring more music into the world. As winter rolled into spring, I found myself hatching from my little egg, singing more, playing more, and thinking about what I was being called to bring forth.\u00a0 The result is Ghost Story - a full-length album of traditional and original folk songs arranged for banjo, guitar, and bouzouki. Ghost Story is my attempt to answer \u00a0questions that I think about deeply: What is the role of traditional music in my life? What stories do I want to continue singing into the world? What stories do I want to leave in the past? And what stories do I want to change, reinterpret, and reframe so that something new can emerge from them? The answers to these questions, like so many of the most pressing questions of this moment in time, are both/and sort of answers. Yes, let us engage with and grapple with those hard stories we have inherited. Yes, let us transform them into something that can feed us in a changing world.\u00a0 In literal terms, this means creating an album which blends original and traditional music, one that matches songs of trauma with songs of resilience and resistance. It means queering old ballads, so that they represent more of the range of our experiences, both historical and modern. It means combining new sounds and styles with more traditional approaches to musical storytelling. Most of all, it means pouring my heart into all that I love about traditional folk music and creating something which -- I hope -- is worthy of our past, and worthy of our future.\u00a0 This is the essence of Ghost Story.\u00a0 Work is already underway on this project! I've already clocked several studio sessions with my producer, Colin McCaffrey, getting down good bones on the tracks that will be the foundation of the album. I've even designed my own album art, and have recorded and edited a music video for one of my original songs! My hope is that with the funds from this Kickstarter, I'll be able to work at a quicker pace and release the album by the end of the year.\u00a0 I'm asking for $5,500 to complete this project. These funds go directly to paying my producer for recording time, for his work laying down accompaniment, and for the process of mixing and mastering the tracks. It also will fund my purchase of the physical CDs, which is a large out-of-pocket expense at the end of an expensive process.\u00a0",

  "\"A Sacrifice of Praise\" is a series of bilingual musical settings of the entire Divine Liturgy in Byzantine chant, available in both Byzantine and Western staff notation, that can be utilized by chanters, choirs, and congregants alike. The Greek musical settings are drawn from renowned composers of the Ecumenical Patriarchate such as Petros the Peloponnesian, Gregorios Protopsaltis, and others, while the English scores utilize the official translation of the Divine Liturgy published by our Archdiocese and set to music by a number of well-known composers such as Nicholas Roumas, Samuel Herron, Phillip Phares, and others. As Byzantine Chant continues to flourish in the United States, this project will prove to be of inestimable value in helping Church musicians to offer the \u201csacrifice of praise\u201d in both Greek and English. The Dynamis Byzantine Ensemble will be recording the First Mode Hymnal from the set. The subsequent album will serve as both a didactic model for the First Mode Hymnal as well as a traditional model for singing Byzantine Music in the English Language.\u00a0 We need support to be able to record and produce the recording of the Divine Liturgy, so please consider giving to our fundraising campaign! In support of this project, the Music Ministry for the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of San Francisco has generously donated $3,000 to the Dynamis Liturgical Collaborative.",
  "Concept A collection of anonymous screams gathered in New York City. People are invited to enter a soundproof booth, the portable catharsis, and unleash their most intense, primal sound. Their scream is recorded and catalogued.\u00a0 Why Screaming is such a visceral, involuntary act, and as adults we are generally discouraged to scream. The idea of cathartic release as a healthy way to cycle your energy is not only appealing to me, it\u2019s logical. It is necessary to liberate and then regenerate energy on a normal basis to feel present and grounded. The Scream Box is a public service, a space where you can emotionally purge and free yourself of the responsibility of any negative energy you that may be festering. In today\u2019s blistering political climate, a public catharsis is more necessary than ever. There\u2019s something really powerful about making the choice to scream. The Box The Scream Box is 7\u2019 x 3\u2019, soundproof, portable, and will show up wherever it is needed. Parks, bars, record stores; almost anywhere is a viable location for the Portable Catharsis.\u00a0 The Catalog A catalog of screams does not yet exist. A collection of peoples\u2019 most unedited vocal escape feels mystifying and powerful. There are so many things to be done with this collection of energy. Most notably, I plan to slow down these tones to various speeds, and then create a collection of calming ambient music from them with the help of my many musician friends. I love the concept of shifting the vibrational energy of something from negative to positive. Collecting low vibrational energy, letting it sit, and then turning it into a positive, higher vibration. What Happens You enter the box. You are given very simple, straightforward instructions. 10 seconds to prepare, 15 seconds to scream (cued by a red light), then 15 seconds to collect yourself before you reemerge into society. Your decibel level is recorded and given to you on a card. Screamers can visit CatalogofScreams.com (coming soon!) to see stats- where the box has been, where it\u2019s going, the highest decibel scream, how many screams cataloged to date, etc.",

We facilitate rebirth on individual and collective levels with sacred sound. We listen to divine guidance as we connect with the sacred sound current with beloveds in Evolutionary Music concerts throughout the country.

We have just finished creating our fourth album, \u201cAgape Evolution: The Movement.\u201d We have been so blessed in our service, with four best album of the year awards, but we are certain this is by FAR the most beautiful and powerful yet.

  "O Passeio\u2026 \u201ca tour\u201d or \u201ca ride\u201d...\u00a0 The name\u00a0O Passeio represents both the title track from my new CD and also embodies the roller coaster ride that making this CD has been. Inevitably, the process becomes the music and this is certainly reflected to the listener on this project. O Passeio features eleven\u00a0original compositions inspired by AfroFunk, Reggae, South Indian, R&B, Cape Verdean, Flamenco, Cuban, Brazilian, Peruvian, Argentinian and Jazz genres. These exciting musical hybrids are the heart of this project and represent my passion for exploring diverse sounds from around the globe. The idea germinated in the late 1980's when I got to be part of the WOMAD festivals and experienced so many new artists and forms of artistic expression, all in one place. Those early experiences also factor largely in my grad work where I write about the musical impact those festivals and this city has had on me. I first began creating the Los Variants theme of blending artists, genres and influences in 2012 and released my debut CD jass/blues in 2013. It spanned several genres from country to reggae to Afro-funk to avant-garde jazz. Here is a sample from the first CD entitled\u00a0\"Che Che Toronto\"\u00a0 It features Kobe Aquaa-Harrison and Lydia Persaud on vocals. \u00a0The past three years has been about collaborating with many talented and generous Toronto based musicians and I can honestly say that it has been a privilege. As co-producer and bassist Justin Gray mentions in the \"Behind the Scenes\" video below... \u201cthe musicians who joined us in this recording each brought so much of their own musicality to the compositions; we basically asked them to do their thing.\u201d A sample of the music on the upcoming CD and some recording footage can be seen here: Guest artists such as: Ana Lia Garrido, Kevin Turcotte, Natalie C. Morris, Fernando Galleo Torres, Markus Moses Jackman, Louis Simao, Dominic Mancuso, Kobe Aquaa-Harrison, Maryem and Ernie Tollar, Benjamin Barille, Waleed Abdulhamid, Ravi Naimpally, Tico Souza, Marito Marques, Luis Orbegoso, Michael Occhipinti and Justin Gray are part of the Canadian musical mosaic and their contributions to this, and many other projects have been immense.\u00a0 Break down of Expenses TOTAL\t\t\t\t          $4250 CD Release Date: December 12th at 9pm at The Burdock, 1184 Bloor Street West Toronto, ON Ticket Link:\u00a0http://burdockto.com/shows/?show=1419  FB Event:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/events/233423410659559/",
  "ABOVE is my Directors/Cinematographers reel. As no footage of Forever Loved has been shot yet, this is here to give you an idea of my filmmaking style, as well as a look at some past films I have done leading up to this point. This story is a very person and real story for me and I feel that the making and completion of this film can go on and help others who have and are going through this very thing. For the film is not only about suicide, but about what we cant do to prevent it and, if it does happen, how we can deal with it. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Robert and Victor are brothers, not by blood but by bond. But one tragic morning flips Roberts world upside down when he wakes up to multiple missed calls from his mother and Victor. Robert calls his mother back, and she begins to inform him that Victor has passed away after committing suicide.\u00a0 Robert immediately rushes to his Aunt Samantha's home in Northern California, from the Greater L.A. Area, where he moved for work a year and a half earlier. There, he is greeted by his mother Marie, who before taking him to see his aunt, tells him that she (his aunt Samantha) wants him to give Victor's eulogy. Ushering him into the living room, Samatha does, in fact, ask him to give the eulogy, but Robert is hesitant because he does not understand how Victor could do this to not only him, but to his family. More importantly, to his Mother. What would he say? He begins to question whether he actually knew Victor as well as he had thought he did all these years. Were they even brother? However,\u00a0In the effort of comforting his aunt, he agrees to do it. In his room, he begins to think on what he is going to say, but the more he thinks on it, the more frustrated he becomes. He then begins to think of the conversation he and Victor had just before he left for L.A., and how badly Victor just wanted to get out and leave as well. How he felt like he was being left behind. But Robert tells him, if he ever needs an escape, just call him and he'll be there.\u00a0 But this thought only makes Robert's anger brew even more. Enraged, he throws the notebook he had began writing the eulogy in, across the room. Marie hears the commotion and enters the room, picking up the notebook on her way in. She tries to console him, but Robert lashes out at her stating that he does not want to do this and that he does not understand why he has to pay for Victor's choices. Marie quickly reminds Robert that this is not about him but about the family and more importantly his aunt, and that he is not the only one effected by Victor's Passing.\u00a0 Ashamed and heart broken, Robert reveals to his mother that Victor called him that night and that he ignored it and went back to sleep. He begins to state how he thinks he could have saved him if he had only answered.\u00a0 Marie tells him that there was nothing more he could have done and that they wont ever know why he really called. That all they can do is move on and remember Victor for the bright, always smiling, and funny person that he was. At the funeral, Victor, begins to give the eulogy but before he can get the first sentence out, everything goes dark and a single person is left standing in the congregation, Victor.\u00a0 All the anger and frustration that had been brewing finally erupts and Robert confronts Victor, asking how he could be so selfish. How he could have done this to him, the family, his mother and the people he claimed to love. How they were supposed to be brothers, but apparently were not. Victor takes it all until Robert anger fades away. Victor explains he never meant to hurt anyone, and that he has always thought about him, his mom and the family, but that he was suffering and in pain. Robert apologizes for not being there for him but Victor tells him that what he did had nothing to do with him and was his choice alone.\u00a0 Victor tells him that although he was in pain, he is now ok and at peace. Looking into the congregation, Robert continues his eulogy, speaking of their favorite chill spot that looked out over the city, and how they discussed everything from girl problems to travel plans to life goals.\u00a0 And that that is how he will always remember him as: the bright eyed, always smiling, and funny person that he was, who loved life. That no matter how Victor left this\nearth, he will forever be his best friend, his family\u00a0and his brother.\u00a0 Victor will always be, Forever Loved. Films are expensive, and the details of a film production can add up quite quickly, especially in the Los Angeles area. This is even more so for Independent and student filmmakers, where it can seen nearly impossible to find backing and/or funding. To put it plainly, we need this movie to get funded or it just simply cannot happen. My fantastic team and I are diligently putting in the time and effort to get this film off the ground and make it a reality, but we need your help, the help of our community, friends, and family to truly make this film happen. If you do so choose to help us reach our goal, first of all, let me be the first to say thank you from the bottom of my heart, and second, let me share with you where your hard earned money will be going. Your money will be going to all aspects of production for the film, some of the most important listed below: We will be fortunate to be shooting on the RED Digital Cinema 4k camera, which will give us the best quality image possible, and also have our crew and equipment assembled and ready. Our dream is simple, yet complicated to execute (as most dreams are). It is to create lasting and impactful stories for all those who watch them. Whether you have been in a theatre and laughed, cried, been scared, or inspired, our dream, as independent film makers, are to create those very stories, characters, and moments that will bring you those connections as before.\u00a0 By supporting us, you are giving us that opportunity to do just that and the ability to show the world what we can do.\u00a0 And for that I THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart. Whether you choose to help us, or not, or simply just cant at the moment, I ask that you Please spread the word or donate in order for FOREVER LOVED to become reality.\u00a0 This story is a very person and real story for me and I feel that the making and completion of this film can go on and help others who have and are going through this very thing. For the film is not only about suicide, but about what we cant do to prevent it and, if it does happen, how we can deal with it. Thank you very much for all your support! It means the world to not only myself, but my cast and crew as well!

  "As we embark on opening our first restaurant, Scrum-did-dly-ump-tious, at the top of 2022, we invite you to go on this journey with us as we walk by faith, in and on purpose, with talent and passion, pouring our hearts and souls into this project. On Tuesday, October 12, 2021, we officially signed our lease on a shell of space formerly a barbershop in Historic Downtown Lawrenceville. As we enter this space and embark on this journey, it is with great pride that we honor those that came before us who were not afforded similar opportunities. Our vision for this 2200 square foot space is to make it our own and transform the environment into one that gives alluring vibes and speaks to our unique personalities, interests, and tastes, those of which we desire to engrain and permeate into the atmosphere to create genuine connections, deep resonance, and invaluable relationships with our patrons. As a double-minority owned business, we are staunchly committed to making extraordinary strides and breaking barriers for women-owned businesses, especially those developed and operated by Black and Brown Women, to build bridges and close gaps, creating financial stability for our families and community. To strengthen our efforts, we humbly ask for your championship and support to build with us by sowing a seed into our restaurant venture. We are raising money for startup costs including build out of the space. \u00a0Given the times that we are in and the rising costs of materials we find ourselves looking to get additional funding on top of the 150,000 that we have put in ourselves. \u00a0This will be more than a restaurant, it will be a hub for the community, a place where we can constantly and consistently pay it forward to the community itself through employment, food drives and so much more. \u00a0This is a much needed space in Downtown Lawrenceville.",

By the way I just received the tracks from the mastering which was the first step before digital distribution and then hopefully...vinyl! My proposal to you is to help me to finance this very first batch of vinyl records. They will be red and there will be 300 of them. Also, I'm thinking about the whole process in a way that ensures you'll receive a high quality product.\u00a0 Any contribution is welcome!\u00a0 I tried to put enough options so that you can contribute by choosing the one you're more comfortable with. The minimum is 1\u20ac and the maximum is... wait there's no maximum!! But know that if you contribute with 100 000 000\u20ac I'll do my very best to get you to Mars with a golden vinyl to share with extra-terrestrial creatures.\u00a0 The costs are: - Mastering: It's for me, you're welcome. - Rights Administration (you have to pay to press your own vinyl records): +/- 500\u20ac - Vinyl Cutting: 325\u20ac - 300 vinyls pressing: +/- 1700\u20ac - Kickstarter fees: +/- 250\u20ac -October 1st: : I send you the digital version of the album before everybody -Mysterious date: Digital release of the EP -As soon as I can in January 2022: I receive the Vinyl Records and I send it to you Note that this timeline could still change a little because some of the steps don't depend entirely on me. ==> 100 000 000 thanks in advance! <== Can't wait to play in your town and share a good fresh Belgian beer with you!\u00a0 J\u00e9r\u00f4me",
  "Countercurrent is currently working on our first full-length album, Exchange. Who even is this \"Countercurrent\"? Countercurrent is a duo based in Western Washington that has been delighting contra dancers and concert audiences for nigh on a decade. Composed of Alex Sturbaum (guitar, vocals) and Brian Lindsay (fiddle, feet, vocals), we incorporate Irish, American, French-Canadian, and pop influences into our music to create a high-energy and dynamic sound! What's Exchange all about? Our music has always been about exchange; about the flow of musical ideas between the two of us, the exchange of energy between us and the dancers, and the cultural exchange that comes of the blending of different folk traditions. This album's goal is to capture the energy and dynamics of our live sound, where the exchange of ideas is at its hottest and most alive, with tools that are unavailable to us in a live setting*. Cool! So what goes into making this album? We've been recording through the spring at Studio 4123 in Seattle. We've almost completed the tracking and a significant portion of the mixing. We are really excited about the tracks we've put together, and things are already starting to sound really good! Once the album is fully recorded and mixed, we've been lucky enough to engage the abilities of Tonal Park Studios in Maryland to do the mastering. The project is on track to be finished by mid-September of 2018. How are you paying for this? That's where you come in! We've been very cost-effective with this whole process, but making an album is always an expensive endeavor. We're trying to raise $4500, which will cover: We chose Kickstarter specifically because we have always been a community-focused band; we owe all the success we've had so far to the wonderful traditional music and contra dance communities that have supported us over the years. In making this album, we wanted to involve these communities directly.\u00a0 I want to help out, but I can't afford to donate. What can I do? The success of a crowdfunding campaign like this is directly tied to how many people it can reach. Regardless of whether or how much you can contribute, it would mean a lot if you could help get the word out! You can do this by liking or sharing the link to this Kickstarter campaign on social media, or sending a personal email to friends who might be interested. Also, tell your friends! *banjos",
  "Website/ Facebook/ Instagram/ Youtube/ Soundcloud/\u00a0 Castellano al final  Engine has been our number one project since years now, feeding both our mouths and hearts. Together we wrote a countless number of songs, travelled to a countless number of cities and shared a countless number of hotels and houses. We are very proud of the over 120 performances we've been presenting since 2015 in Argentina, France, Italy,\u00a0Brazil, Canada, United States, England, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain before and after the release of our first record, Un d\u00eda m\u00e1s sobre la Tierra. We feel that our artistic brotherhood has now reached a further step. We decided it was time to lay a new set of songs on record. Since Pierre Lauth-Karson joined the band in 2016, his harmonica, his voice and his presence\u00a0transformed the sound of the Engine project. We will record this album in Albuquerque, with great sound engineer Drake Hardin. The original idea is to catch the organicity of the band, basing the work on live takes. We will later be recording and adding other instruments and\u00a0 parts. We aim for a sound that embraces the various components and influences of our music, from root unplugged Colombian Cumbia to the Beatles, as well as all the nuances our songs naturally carry: afro-beat and funky guitars, Latin acoustic guitar rhythms, bluesy and brassy harmonicas, Argentinian rock dynamics and guitar solos,\u00a0Brazilian rhythms and work on spoken words. The record will feature original songs in English, Spanish and French, all co-written by the 3 members of the Engine project. We want a record that honors the love we have for music, as diverse as it may be, and that also enlightens the poetry.\u00a0 The lyrics are ironic yet profound reflections that are alternatively sensitive, relevant and timely. The Breathing Machine is a photo documentary on the band directed by Juliette Bailly. Alejandro Tom\u00e1s Rodriguez and Robin Gentien met in 2012 in Pontedera, Italy, as they were both resident artists of the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards. Within that project, they presented various performances and taught music and theater in prestigious institutions in Rome, Paris, New York, Woodstock, Yale, Sao Paulo, Florence, Toronto, Bucarest, Berl\u00edn... \n\n\u00a0 As they left Italy in December 2015, they went on their first European Tour. During the Engine Winter Road, that took them over 15 cities in France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands and in the UK, they started a collaboration with Pierre Lauth-Karson, a long term friend and collaborator of Robin. In March 2016, Engine settled in Buenos Aires, where they spent two years. That is where they recorded their first EP, Un d\u00eda m\u00e1s sobre la Tierra, released in December 2016. They performed in Buenos Aires, Rosario, San Pedro and toured in Brazil and in the United States. During this period, Pierre Lauth-Karson finally became a core member of the band, creating the final cog in the Engine. In 2017, the trio went on their second European Tour, Future is a multicolor machine crossing borders. In 2018, Engine spent the winter composing, performing and recording in Albuquerque for a three-month residency in collaboration with UNM and AMP concert. In the summer 2018, the band will be going on its third European tour, the\u00a0Cosmic Shoes Tour. People have been asking us for a new record pretty much since the previous one was released.\u00a0Recording is expensive, and we wanted to do it in the best conditions possible while keeping it in a reasonable range. As we performed all around, always in an absolutely independent and self-financed way, we had the chance to meet hundreds of people who, in a way or another, made all of this possible. We realized that 400 of you pre-ordering the record would be enough for us to release it worldwide. Looking back to the previous months of touring, it did not feel like an unreachable number. What we are asking is your trust: we need you to\u00a0buy the record in advance. It is the only way we can make this album the best possible. We need your support. We plan to spend a minimum of 5660 \u20ac: 3000 \u20ac for the\u00a0recording, mixing & mastering the tracks. 450 \u20ac\u00a0to protect the songs at the SACEM 780\u00a0\u20ac\u00a0for the SRDM\u00a0 680\u00a0\u20ac\u00a0for printing the CD 550\u00a0\u20ac\u00a0on Kickstarter\u00a0fees And approximately 200\u00a0\u20ac on the realization and printing of the various gifts we'll send you ! The expenses contemplated are the minimum we need to record, protect and distribute our record. It does not cover any of the diffusion, graphic or recording salary. We count on you! Thank you for your help! Alejandro, Robin & Pierre. Engine Desde hace a\u00f1os Engine ha sido nuestro proyecto n\u00famero uno. El que ha alimentado nuestras bocas y nuestros corazones. Juntos escribimos much\u00edsimas canciones, viajamos a un mont\u00f3n de ciudades compartiendo un mont\u00f3n de hoteles y casas.\u00a0 \u00a0Estamos muy orgullosos de los m\u00e1s de 120 conciertos que hemos presentado desde el 2015 en Argentina, Francia, Brasil, Canad\u00e1, Estados Unidos, Inglaterra, B\u00e9lgica, Holanda y Espa\u00f1a antes y despu\u00e9s de publicar nuestro primer \u00e1lbum, Un d\u00eda m\u00e1s sobre la Tierra.\u00a0 Sentimos ahora que nuestra hermandad art\u00edstica lleg\u00f3 a un escal\u00f3n m\u00e1s alto.\u00a0 Nos dimos cuenta que era hora de poner un nuevo conjunto de canciones en un nuevo disco. Desde que Pierre Lauth-Karson se uni\u00f3 a la banda en 2016, su arm\u00f3nica, su voz y su presencia transformaron el sonido de Engine project. \u00a0Los meses de gira y los viajes que vivimos, dieron a nuestro live project una nueva solidez.\u00a0 \u00a0Ahora queremos ofrecerles este fuego purificador \"cleansing fire\" en un disco, que puedan experimentar sin barreras de tiempo o espacio, como un testimonio de lo que the Engine Project es.\u00a0 Vamos a grabar este \u00e1lbum en Albuquerque, New Mexico, con el gran ingeniero de sonido Drake Hardin. \u00a0La idea original es atrapar la organicidad de la banda, focalizando la grabaci\u00f3n en tomas en vivo. Posteriormente agregaremos y grabaremos otras partes e instrumentos.\u00a0 \u00a0Nuestro objetivo es lograr un sonido que abarque los diversos componentes e influencias de nuestra m\u00fasica, desde la cumbia colombiana unplugged hasta los Beatles, as\u00ed como todos los matices que nuestras canciones naturalmente incorporan: guitarras afro-beat y funky, ritmos latinos con guitarra ac\u00fastica, arm\u00f3nica blusera y con explosiones tipo brass band, din\u00e1micas de rock argentino, ritmos brasileros y poes\u00edas rapeadas.\u00a0 El disco incluir\u00e1 canciones originales en ingl\u00e9s, espa\u00f1ol y franc\u00e9s, todas co-escritas por los 3 miembros de Engine project.\u00a0 Queremos un disco que honre el amor que tenemos por la m\u00fasica, en su diversidad, y que tambi\u00e9n ilumine la poes\u00eda.\n\nLas letras cargadas de reflexiones ir\u00f3nicas pero profundas son al mismo tiempo sensibles, relevantes y actuales.\u00a0 Alejandro Tom\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez es cantante y guitarrista de la banda. Escribe la mayor\u00eda de la letras. Naci\u00f3 en Rosario (Argentina). Tambi\u00e9n es actor y director de teatro, actualmente es profesor invitado en el Departamento de Danza y Teatro de la Universidad de Nuevo M\u00e9xico (UNM).\u00a0 Robin Gentien guitarrista franc\u00e9s, nacido en el suburbio parisino de Montreuil. De muy joven empez\u00f3 a dirigir bandas, y colabor\u00f3 con brillantes m\u00fasicos africanos de la escena parisina. Tambi\u00e9n trabaj\u00f3 como actor en muchas obras teatrales.\u00a0 Pierre Lauth-Karson cantante y armonicista franco-americano, nacido en Paris. Toc\u00f3 y grab\u00f3 junto a varios m\u00fasicos de la escena del blues parisino, de los cuales se destaca su participaci\u00f3n como voz principal de un Coro Gospel.\u00a0 Alejandro Tom\u00e1s Rodriguez y Robin Gentien se encontraron en el 2012 en Pontedera, Italia, siendo artistas residentes en el Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards. Con esa compa\u00f1\u00eda presentaron varios espect\u00e1culos y ense\u00f1aron m\u00fasica y actuaci\u00f3n en prestigiosas instituciones de Roma, Paris, Nueva York, Woodstock, Yale, San Pablo, Florencia, Toronto, Bucarest, Berl\u00edn...\u00a0 \u00a0Cuando salieron de Italia en diciembre de 2015, hicieron su primer Tour Europeo. Durante Engine Winter Road tour, que los llev\u00f3 a m\u00e1s de 15 ciudades a lo largo y ancho de Europa, comenzaron una colaboraci\u00f3n con Pierre Lauth-Karson, antiguo amigo y colaborador de Robin.\n\nEn marzo de 2016, Engine se instal\u00f3 en Buenos Aires. Alli pasaron dos a\u00f1os y grabaron su primer EP, Un d\u00eda m\u00e1s sobre la Tierra, publicado en diciembre de 2016.\u00a0 Tocaron en Buenos Aires, Rosario, San Pedro y recorrieron Brasil y Estados Unidos. Durante este per\u00edodo, Pierre Lauth-Karson se convirti\u00f3 ineluctablemente en miembro central de la banda, creando el engranaje final del motor. \u00a0En 2017, el tr\u00edo realiz\u00f3 su segunda gira europea, Future is a Multicolor Machine crossing borders. \u00a0En 2018, Engine pas\u00f3 el invierno componiendo, actuando y grabando en Albuquerque en el marco de una residencia de tres meses en colaboraci\u00f3n con UNM y AMP concert. \u00a0En el verano de 2018, la banda realizar\u00e1 su tercera gira europea, Cosmic Shoes Tour.\u00a0 La gente nos ha estado pidiendo un nuevo disco pr\u00e1cticamente desde que lanzamos el anterior. La grabaci\u00f3n es costosa, y quer\u00edamos hacerlo en las mejores condiciones posibles, manteni\u00e9ndolo en un rango razonable. \u00a0A medida que actu\u00e1bamos por todos lados, siempre de una manera absolutamente independiente y autofinanciada, tuvimos la oportunidad de conocer a cientos de personas que, de una forma u otra, hicieron posible que nuestro proyecto continuara.\u00a0 \u00a0Nos dimos cuenta de que si 400 de ustedes compran el disco anticipadamente, eso ser\u00e1 suficiente para que lo grabemos y lo lancemos a nivel mundial.\nMirando hacia atr\u00e1s, a los meses de nuestra gira, esto no suena como un n\u00famero inalcanzable.\u00a0 Lo que estamos pidiendo es tu confianza: necesitamos que compres el disco anticipadamente. Es la \u00fanica forma en que podemos hacer este \u00e1lbum, lo mejor posible. Necesitamos tu apoyo. \u00a0Ahora.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 vamos a hacer con el dinero?\nPlaneamos gastar un m\u00ednimo de 5660 \u20ac:\u00a0 3000 \u20ac para la grabaci\u00f3n, mezcla y masterizaci\u00f3n de las canciones.\u00a0 450 \u20ac para proteger las canciones en la SACEM\u00a0 780 \u20ac para el SRDM \u00a0680 \u20ac para imprimir el CD\u00a0 550 \u20ac en tarifas de Kickstarter\u00a0 \u00a1Y aproximadamente 200 \u20ac en la realizaci\u00f3n e impresi\u00f3n de los diversos regalos que le enviaremos!\nLos gastos contemplados son lo m\u00ednimo que necesitamos para registrar, proteger y distribuir nuestro \u00e1lbum.

  ">>> PROJECT UPDATE 5/6/18:We made our goal!!!!!!\u00a0Thank you SHAKE YOUR PEACE! community!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW - until the campaign ends all the money raised beyond the 12k goal will fund the upcoming bike-music tours + \"Ecotopia Now!\" high school assemblies! \"We have come this far, we're not gonna turn around, we feel just like goin' on!\"=======================Tiny Bio:SHAKE YOUR PEACE! is a music project created by Gabe Dominguez in 2005, formerly based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and recently relocated to Salt Lake City, UT.\u00a0The project is most well known for its ebullient live performances, Ecotopian perspectives, and bicycle-music tours.\u00a0 Kick-What?SHAKE YOUR PEACE! is trying to raise the last 20% of funding needed to finish an album of original music called \"Whup Music.\" Kickstarter is all-or-nothing. If the project isn't 100% funded by the time the campaign finishes, ALL the money you may have pledged is returned to you.You're 80% Done!?! Rad! What's in the Last 20%?The last 20% includes: tracking (the horn section, the gospel choir, some percussion, some bass, some electric guitar, some lead vocals, some orchestration - including a mariachi band - and some special effects/ sound design - including fireworks explosions ;), mixing (mountains of tracks), mastering, and printing.\u00a0Whew! The album will be mixed by the incomparable Blake Henderson.  Blake also engineered the majority of the album, and has acted as an assistant-producer since we began working together in 2012. As you can hear on his website, he\u2019s as good as they get. Project Management:$12,000 is a lot of money, and I don\u2019t take it lightly. I plan to work as efficiently and frugally as possible, and take my deadline of \u201cthe end of the summer\u201d (Aug 31, 2018) seriously. People who know me well know that I\u2019m irresistibly drawn to doing things myself, so in classic SHAKE YOUR PEACE! style I\u2019ll be doing as much of the remaining work that\u2019s left on the album myself, and trying to keep costs down at every step, without compromising the quality or vision. Amazingly, this giant budget includes the work of friends (like Blake) who are cutting me ridiculous deals for their work and time! (Making records is expensive!) This is truly a community-powered piece of art.\u00a0 Those who know my wife Sonya Cotton (who has an impeccable track record of getting high quality albums out the door), will be pleased to know that she's co-project-managing the completion of this album with me. When we team up, we make good things. Victory is assured :)\"Let's Get Workin' On It!\"Whup! http://www.velovisionaries.com/ What're You Gonna Do With the Finished Record?In short: the usual things that we independent musicians do when we release our albums: contact the press and hope they\u2019ll listen, shop it around to indie labels with hope brimming in my little heart, and play shows! But the 2 things I\u2019m most excited to do with the album that are more unusual include: 1) Bike tour! I plan to do my 5th bicycle music tour of Northern Utah, and 3rd bicycle music tour of the SF Bay Area. Also being considered are a bike tour of the Northwest, and a Hudson River canoe tour! Coming slowly to a town near you...\u00a0 2) \u201cEcotopia Now!\u201d high school assemblies. I've successfully tested out this concept at 3 different high schools in Utah. They're essentially Ecotopian pep rallies/ recruitment-fairs for local ecological and social justice organizations (including the schools own student clubs). Pedal-powered by the kids themselves (if they so choose), the assembly features whup music alternated with 3-minute long impact-speeches passionately delivered by representatives from the local Ecotopian orgs. Each speech invites the kids to join-in on some kind of immediate, concrete, hands-on action that the org is up to. No platitudes allowed. In my experience so far, these assemblies have been deeply transformational. Students, teachers, band, orgs - everyone felt stoked and ready to get to work. A Unique Copyright:In my effort to \u201ccontribute whup music to the soundtrack of those who are marching\u201d as I say in the Kickstarter video, I plan to release the album\u2019s songs under a unique copyright that designates them similarly to the way a National Park is designated: held in the commons for everyone to enjoy, but defended from industry. Unlike in a National Park though, where humans are meant to be visitors and the ethos is to leave-no-trace, I\u2019d hope that people would leave-plenty-of-trace and fully inhabit the music. The license is a standard Creative Commons (CC) license, mixed with an invitation to all Ecotopian entities (those working for social & ecological justice) to freely use the music for their: documentaries, flash mobs, memes, conferences, parties, whatevs, for free and without needing to ask permission. It\u2019s called: \u201cWild-Aligned/ Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\u201d The CC part of the license puts up a legal fence (the park boundaries) to keep for-profit entities asking permission. A Different Album Format:\u00a0I\u2019m stoked to release the physical album in the form of a first-class stamped postcard that comes with TWO download codes - one attached to the postcard itself, and one stuck to the paper backing of an accompanying SHAKE YOUR PEACE! sticker. The sticker, with its download code, is intended to be for the buyer, while the stamped postcard with its code is intended to be snail-mailed by the buyer to a friend. In addition to it being a great excuse to send a snail-mailed postcard to a friend, my thinking here is that whereas CD\u2019s are: non-ecological, heavy (which matters on a bike tour), and often seem to be ripped onto a hard drive and then long-forgotten in CD books, an album-postcard is more ecological, lightweight, doubles as a form of promotion, and can be used as a nifty bookmark (ideally holding your place in the pages of Edward Abbey\u2019s \u201cMonkey Wrench Gang\u201d). Thanks for reading!If you've read this far, you've got stamina! I like ya shtyle kid. If you've felt inspired by what you've seen/heard/read here, I hope you'll consider sharing this Kickstarter with your friends. It's a massive help to me. THANKS!!!",
  "Dia dhaoibh,\u00a0 Beannachta\u00ed \u00f3 Chorcaigh, \u00c9ire - greetings from Cork, Ireland. I am delighted to announce the launch of this campaign for my solo concertina album, which has been a dream come true for me.\u00a0 Tobar Gan Tr\u00e1 (which means \"a well that doesn't run dry\" in the Irish language), is a concept album that documents the journey in my repertoire and a style of playing concertina, starting with simple tunes that I learned over 30 years ago all the way up to recently learned compositions. I am also glad to be able to present an unusual style / system of concertina playing and to make my own arrangements. I hope this will provide some inspiration and contribute fun sets of tunes for people to play, especially for younger musicians, from a life of learning music so far. It will feature solo recordings and collaborations with some of my close musical friends and favourite musicians. I recorded this album at Conor O'Sullivan Studios in Cork and Donogh Hennessy's studio in Dingle, Kerry, but the next steps to completion are expensive.\u00a0 This Kickstarter is your chance to pre-order this album, and to allow me to get this project over the line. With your help, it will be mixed by the great Donncha Moynihan in Cork city and mastered by the wonderful Ruair\u00ed O'Flaherty in Los Angeles. Artwork is being provided by the celebrated Cork artist, Eileen Healy and design by Brian O'Hanlon. There are some excellent musicians on there including: Caroline Keane (concertina) Rory Healy (fiddle)\u00a0 Macdara \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in (bouzouki) Nicola U\u00ed Aodhg\u00e1in, my partner (uilleann pipes) Vince Keehan (mandolin) Paul O'Driscoll (double bass) Johnny \"Ringo\" McDonagh (bodhr\u00e1n) Conor O'Sullivan (guitar) Donncha Moynihan (guitar) On this album I'm featuring musicians and a production team that are all superb professionals. I am very excited to be able to work with these people and to bring them together on this album.\u00a0 Go raibh c\u00e9ad maith agaibh, (a hundred thanks to you), I am very grateful for your support.

  "(versi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol abajo) Amig@s, After a few years working on new music, we have chosen 6 of our new songs to be part of a concept album called \u201cTu Mission\u201d. We want to invite you to be part of our mission, which is... Our mission is to be aware and to get involved in what is happening around us. We prioritize our goals, dreams, and well-being as well as those of our community\u2026We invite you to reflect on what is important to you and on your surroundings. In fulfilling our mission, we need your help! In appreciation for your support we don\u2019t only have 18 different thank you rewards such as signed CDs, T-shirts, hoodies, private classes, private performances and personalized songs to offer you, but the album itself is our offering to you and to our community to hopefully improve people's quality of life with our music and messages. The way this works is if we don\u2019t fundraise at least the total amount we are asking for, the project won\u2019t get a single penny. That also means your donation will stay in your bank account until the campaign is finished and accomplished. We want you to join us so you can find your personal mission, which one is yours?  \u00a06 songs, 6 missions: -N\u00f3madas Opci\u00f3n. To fight for a world without borders where you can go where you need to go to have a better life. -Contar. To tell the universe how we deal with some important things down here. -Cloud. To make sure you go up to your personal cloud often enough and dedicate time to yourself and your well-being. -Palabras. To reconnect, respect, and take care of nature while learning from it so we can achieve a better global balance. The goal is to never forget where we all come from, the natural world. -Where you wanna be. To try your best to be where you wanna be and who you wanna be with at any given moment. -Su Mission. Be aware and fight together against injustice in our community, especially when it comes to big issues like gentrification, fair housing, and inequality. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Photos by our friend and collaborator Marc Hors. \u00a0Bio and more info about us\u00a0HERE. We also have a team of superstar friends / local musicians collaborating: and former Makr\u00fa members still a big part of our family: Bringing quality and freshness to the project we have Juan Manuel Caipo recording and co-producing. He is founder, musician, and producer for the band Bang Data, producer of \"Quiero Creedence\", Latin tribute album to Creedence Clearwater Revival among other projects. We are also very happy to have Eric Drooker's artwork as part of our project. He is an illustrator, painter, graphic novelist, and creator of many of the known covers of The New Yorker, animator on HOWL and many more\u2026 We have been following his work for years and we love how our music and his art fit together, especially in this project. Also part of this creation is the new music video from the song \"Su Mission\", taking place in the Mission District in San Francisco, where we wanted to show its transformation and to raise awareness about how gentrification is affecting the vibrant Latino and artistic community there. Coming soon!  To make this happen we had on our team: -The local artist/activist: Jorge Molina. -Videographer: Claudia Escobar. -Video Editor: Sara Krieger. Bringing an album to life requires a lot of work, time and money and we want to be able to offer a very high quality product to the world. The cost of the entire project is gonna be over $17,000, including recording, studio, producer, engineer, musicians, mixing, mastering, printing, PR, artwork, merch and Kickstarter expenses and fees. We have financed part of this work already with our savings, but we could really use the help to finish this up! Thank you so much for your collaboration and for becoming part of Our Crew!

  "F\u00e0rsan started last summer as a way for all of us to spend some time together. We booked a week-long tour and rehearsed over Skype in Boston and Antigonish. M\u00e0iri sent recordings of her favorite songs and puirt-\u00e0-beul and Neil, Elias, and Katie arranged them into sets, paired them with tunes, and sent the results back up to Nova Scotia. As we played and danced together, we realized there was more to the project than an excuse to hang out and that's when we decided to record our first album. Last month, we spent 9 days rehearsing and recording in Nova Scotia. Between M\u00e0iri's Gaelic classes at St. FX, we played and cooked and laughed together. We carefully selected our favorite material, polishing and getting it ready, testing it out on a wonderful audience at the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre on a snowy night, and finally driving up to Point Aconi to record it all at Lakewind Sound Studios. We're so excited to share this music with you. We have a wide array of sounds on fiddle, pipes, whistles, piano, accordion, percussive stepdance, puirt-\u00e0-beul and Gaelic songs and we think we've created something really special. We hope you do too! The funds we raise on Kickstarter will go directly to the production of our album. Here's a quick breakdown of our approximate costs: We're hoping you can help us out by pre-ordering a copy of this CD! We are so excited about the music we've made, but the only way forward is with your help.\u00a0Kickstarter is an ALL or NOTHING program and your credit card will only be charged if we raise the full $7000. Every little bit helps, from a share on facebook to a donation to the campagin. Thanks so much for your support!",

  "The time has come! Our 4th full-length studio album has been recorded and all the final mixes are done! Now we need the funds to pay for mastering, manufacturing, and distribution of this release.\u00a0 It has always been a goal of the band to one day release one of our albums on vinyl LP. What better time than now! Along with many other fans of classic Jamaican music we are happy with the comeback vinyl records are making and are celebrating their resurgence in popularity.\u00a0 But pressing vinyl isn't cheap! For this to happen, we have to ask for a bit more to cover those costs. The Georgetown Orbits are so grateful for the continued support of all the fans over the years, and we work hard to make sure our music is always reaching new ears. We all feel strongly that this album is our best work to date. We need your contribution to make this album a reality! Quite frankly, The Georgetown Orbits would not exist without you! We want to give a deep, heartfelt THANK YOU to everyone for your support! <3 GTO's",
  "I\u2019ve always considered songwriting a major part of what I do as a musician, but never really pushed it very much until the last five years or so. So in this last, very challenging year, I\u2019ve recorded a bunch of them and gathered 12 of them into my first album under my own name. Most of these songs are acoustic guitar based, so I guess you\u2019d call them folk, but there\u2019s also some rock \u2019n roll and country mixed in there. I think it\u2019s a pretty good batch of songs, and I\u2019m excited for you to hear them The recording and mixing is done, with mastering sessions coming up in the next few weeks. The funds raised through this campaign will be used for package design, manufacturing, distribution and promotion. I\u2019ve put together some fun rewards, so I hope you\u2019ll consider supporting this project.",
  "Y'all! I have a new batch of songs ready to go, and I am honestly so excited share it with you.\u00a0 As I've started producing albums for other artists in the last couple of years (what a dream!), it's pushed me to dig deeper into my own well, searching for themes and stories that matter the most, the universal ones. It's also pushed me sonically to a new place that's still very much me, but you know, 2021 me.\u00a0 As I head into this next chapter of my career as a producer-artist, YOU will be a part of my successes, just like you've always been. This album is about claiming your space in the world and staying put in that serene place. About how proclaiming who you are and what's important to you is a welcome and necessary function of life. These songs simultaneously acknowledge the difficult parts of the past and celebrate the clarity that comes from being true to yourself. You, dear listener, continue to be the reason I make records; it's because y'all continue to show up for me that I continue to put music out into the world. Let's do it again, shall we?!\u00a0 Be a part of this album's story and help me release this record! And you know I need your help here: let's spread the word! Please share this Kickstarter campaign with your friends and family who love music. Thank you!\u00a0 with sincerest gratitude,\u00a0 MB | HANDWRITTEN LYRICS | This isn't news to you, but recording and releasing records takes a whole lot of work and muscle - from me, my band, engineers, designers, photographers, manufacturers, publicists, and distributors. All those things add up quickly!\u00a0 I really, really want to release this album on vinyl - it would be my first vinyl release! If we raise $30k, that can happen and all our audiophile dreams will come true.\u00a0 | THE VIP PACKAGE | | HOUSE CONCERT | | AN ORIGINAL SONG FOR YOU | | MY GIBSON L-4A GUITAR |",
  "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was out of the ashes of the diagnosis of my daughter with a life changing disability that God began to plant a vision of Champions Concessions Treats and Eats into my heart. I began to look at those with disabilities with a new set of eyes, seeing the unique challenges that they face and how much joy they give to the people who allow their hearts to be touched by their lives. I also saw the fears of each parent as their children fall further and further behind their peers. The greatest fear that I have and many parents of children with disabilities, is what happens with our child when we are no longer here to take care of them. Will they be able to care for themselves when we are gone? How will the world around us receive our children? Who will be their champion outside of our home? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A champions is defined as one who fights on behalf of another; One who overcomes the odds, struggles through the hard times, and overcomes. A champion is undefeated and unbeatable. My daughter is a champion, and there are many others like her that are looking for an opportunity to let their voices be heard. They want to add value to the world around them. They want to work, love, live and have friends. They want community. Champions Concessions Treats and Eats wants to provide that place for them. We want to create a brand that uses their gifts and talents to shine. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are in need of $250,000 to get started with this vision. The money would be used to secure a building for Champions Concessions Treats and Eats to operate out of, to purchase commercial restaurant equipment, and to hire a special needs coordinator to ensure that each person coming into our caf\u00e9 is fully supported in their job. \u00a0Any additional funds raised will go to ensure that Champions Concessions Treats and Eats is set up for the long haul. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We will be serving Cotton Candy Burritos, Snow Cones, Funnel Cake Bar, Crepes, Soups, Salads, Sandwiches, Nachos, Hot Dogs with all the fixings, home made pies and sides, but our greatest product is our staff. Champions will have a staff that is filled with persons with disabilities both hidden and seen, as well as support staff and advocates for them. We will create a environment that allows each employee to be celebrated for who they are and what they are championing for. We are Champions. Will you be our Champion?",
  "We offer a classic flat rate model and transfer this to the catering industry. To date, this business idea is completely unique and offers enormous opportunities for all parties involved. We offer 3 tariffs, see tariff structure in the gallery. You pay only the monthly subscription and nothing else. There is no need to pay in the restaurant anymore. The target groups are, in addition to private individuals, especially employees of companies without a canteen or who are regularly in the home office. In addition, we support the catering industry in the Corona pandemic with this flat rate model and provide new, regular guests. You can sign up and use TASTE IT normally as a private person. Or you are lucky and your company pays you a subsidy for the TASTE IT subscription, then it will be even cheaper for you. When you support us, you support local restaurants at the same time, and sustainably! With our model, we encourage people to go out to eat much more often and this in turn increases the overall turnover of the gastronomy. In turn, the business model saves you time (less cooking yourself), money (monthly fixed price) and nerves (no more annoying pre-cooking for work). With the proceeds from the crowdfunding campaign, we can bring our app to market maturity, i.e. finalize the programming and start a test operation. In addition, we can expand our distribution network so that we can acquire even more partner restaurants even faster. This will give you an even better and more balanced selection of great restaurants.",
  "The goal of this Kickstarter is to fund illustrations for a children's book called Pavo & Scout's Friends. \u00a0I have paid for three illustrations so far. \u00a0Once funds are raised, the artist will complete more illustrations and I'll submit the project to publishers/agents. \u00a0If it's not picked up by a publisher, then I'll self-publish. \u00a0 Given the times we live in, there is a great need for everyone, including young children, to learn about inner strength and resilience. \u00a0I've been an educator for about 10 years and at one point I worked at a school with a high suicide rate. \u00a0Even before that I had seen many students struggle with social-emotional wellness. \u00a0This, along with my own spirituality, is what inspired me to write this book. \u00a0 Pavo and Scout's Friends will appeal to young readers who love animals and adventures- and help parents start the conversation about discovering one's own inner strength. \u00a0",

It is said that deities look after not only Kakashi but also all human-shaped objects. Therefore, by taking great care of these objects, deities will watch over you too. We pay a lot of effort in the design of the appearance of Kakashi. It has a gentle outfit with a Magatama (i.e., a curved, comma-shaped bead) which symbolises wisdom. Having a tender smile on its face, it represents the joy of a good harvest, and the guidance of people. \u4ed8\u5c5e\u306e\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3066\u3001\u82f1\u8a33\u3082\u5168\u3066\u8f09\u305b\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306e\u610f\u5473\u3084\u540d\u524d\u3092\u82f1\u8a9e\u3067\u8aad\u3080\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002 In addition to Japanese, the attached booklet also contains all English translations.

  "Hey folks, thanks so much for stopping by and supporting the Kickstarter for my new album, \"Songs for Hard Times\".\u00a0 For as long as I've been writing songs and putting out records I've wanted to make a solo album: just me and my guitar. After spending a year and a half off the road at home with my family during the pandemic, it seemed like the right time to hit record on this project.\u00a0 It's a handful of traditional and cowboy songs that takes you on a journey from the Appalachians to Texas, with a few stops in between. \u00a0These are songs that I've been singing for years, whether during sound check or in green rooms across the world. When I managed to find time to pick up the guitar during the pandemic, these are the songs I found myself gravitating towards, so it felt right to finally get a recording of them.\u00a0I traveled up into the Algonquin Highlands to a cottage with just my old Martin D18 and one microphone, and \"Songs for Hard Times\" was born.\u00a0 I wanted this recording to feel and sound organic, like you were sitting right there in front of me - no bells and whistles or second takes. If you listen closely, you'll hear the birds who were nesting right outside the window, the wind blowing through the trees and the lake splashing up on the shoreline.\u00a0 Upon finishing the recording session, I shipped the songs out to Edmonton, Alberta, where engineer Scott Franchuk mixed, mastered and readied them to be put onto vinyl and CD.\u00a0 It was also around this time I stumbled across Pilgrim Creative, based out of Kansas City. I immedietly fell in love with Logan's work and knew that it would accompany\u00a0these songs perfectly. After a few short e-mails we were able to come up with the artwork for \"Songs for Hard Times\".\u00a0 So what comes next? The songs are done - the artwork is ready - and I want to get this album into your hands and onto your record players as soon as possible! At this point I could go ahead and release this album on Spotify and AppleMusic, but I've always felt that this kind of music was made to be listened to on a physical format like a record or CD. The funds raised from this Kickstarter are going to help pay to press and manufacture the vinyls, CDs and T-Shirts that feature the album's artwork. It will also help cover the costs of mixing, mastering, artwork creation and licensing of songs. I couldn't be more excited to get this album onto your record players and shirts onto your backs. Thanks for taking the time to stop by and support this project. Stay well, Zachary\u00a0",
  "Who we are Two friends who bonded over bourbon and then wound up obsessing about biscuits. And that\u2019s how Harlem Biscuit Company was born. Harlem Biscuit Company was founded in 2020, and in our beloved Harlem, NY.

I love it when a plan comes together.\" What we are creating Biscuits! A Biscuit Shop! A Biscuit Brand! \u00a0But most importantly an experience that revolves around biscuits. From our own Harlem Biscuit Company storefronts, to supplying our local community with our products, to stocking grocery store aisles and freezers; we\u2019re looking to take this brand around the world. [Please note: we are not offering our actual products here - that's not legal...] What we offer Harlem Biscuit Company offers biscuits and biscuit sandwiches are made from the freshest ingredients from locally sourced markets, and are made from scratch daily. \u00a0Our sandwiches are filled with the tastiest ingredients. From fried chicken and thick-cut bacon to our house-made pork sausage and savory white gravy, to our signature \u201chot\u201d chicken. Where we are in the process What started as a pop-up experience(opened on November 3rd, 2020) has quickly morphed into a brand, a brand with local and national recognition. \u00a0We like to think of this brand as opportunity in a time of chaos. \u00a0We're currently operating a cafe experience out of a bar during the day while they are closed. \u00a0As you can imagine a bar's kitchen isn't well suited for a business that relies on baking. We\u2019ve outgrown our current arrangement and now it\u2019s time for our own physical storefront so we can take this brand to the next level. Why we\u2019re Crowd-Funding? This is a change of pace for us. We\u2019ve been blessed with a huge following and massive support from our community both near and far but it hasn\u2019t replaced our daily grind. I\u2019m proud to say that the Harlem Biscuit Company has no debt. We have strong cash flow but no physical assets to borrow against. We don\u2019t have rich parents to take a startup loan from or a trust fund that can support this endeavor. The numbers are solid. Having our own physical storefront for operations gives us the opportunity to scale up right away \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to bake more, sell more, supply local businesses with our products, offer catering, add staff as we grow and support local students in pursuit of their academic endeavors at HBCU\u2019s. Why you should back this project We\u2019re 100% black-owned and looking to do something impactful in our community and beyond. We\u2019re on a mission to make biscuits trend again and we do this by pushing the boundaries of flavor profiles. We\u2019ve got a proven track record of creating jobs, even against the challenges of the pandemic. You can count on us to succeed in what we\u2019re building; we\u2019re planning conservatively and scaling appropriately. Your support means EVERYTHING to US!

  "We are Orn\u00e2matiK, a band out of Ann Arbor, MI that brings you original compositions, infectious grooves, and unique interpretations of Eastern European folk music. In 2012 we released our debut album as a larger ensemble with all traditional songs. Since then, we developed our sound, stripping down to the bare essentials and blending the spacious combination of three live horns and drums & bass with electronic effects and vocals. We continued our exploration of music from the Balkans and, most excitingly, spent countless hours writing and rehearsing new compositions that we are ready to record and share with the world!\n \nOur current lineup consists of the visionary Drew Schmieding on drums, the lively Ben Rolston on bass, the experimental Derek Worthington on trumpet, the improvisatory Eric Schweizer on reeds, and the intuitive Bethanni Grecynski on trombone, kaval (Bulgarian shepherd's flute), and vocals.\u00a0 THE PROJECT:\u00a0About This Campaign\u00a0 We cannot wait to share this music with you. We are extremely proud of the unique compositions we've been working up and the distinct sound we've developed as a band. But there are many costs involved in producing a record, which is why we're asking for your support. The money we raise here will go directly to pay for the costs of this project: Your support will bring our vision of this music to life! The album and all the rewards offered in this campaign are original - including CDs, vinyl, drawstring backpacks, aprons, and more - and we know you'll enjoy them. Certain items will require a decision of color or design so we'll get in touch after we've been sucessfully funded (fingers crossed). Bethanni and Ben are in the process of creating amazing artwork which will be featured on the album and the rewards.\u00a0 Throughout this process we've been working with some truly inspiring recording engineers, Rishi Daftuar and Don Godwin. Their dedication and craft are showcased in each of the songs you'll hear on the record.\n \u00a0THE MUSIC:\nHear Examples From the Album Setlist\u00a0 The following tracks are demo rough versions of songs we intend to record on this exciting second release. They represent the basic structure of each song to offer perspective on what you can expect, but the final versions will be much more warm, full, and sonorous.

  "The Greek Music Ensemble is seeking your support in order to record and produce a double CD featuring the music and songs of the two major figures of Greek Art Music, Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis.\u00a0 \n\nManos and Mikis successfully married poetry with music for more than 50 years, leading the cultural history of our land, Greece, through a fascinating journey.\u00a0It is because of all the influential poetry they set to music, that Greece is possibly the only country in the world where a large percentage of the population was able to know, listen, and sing this poetry in their every-day life, something that would have never happened without their contribution.\n\n The creation of this double CD, dedicated to the music of Manos and Mikis has been a long-time project for the Greek Music Ensemble, and one that is very close to our hearts. \nOur approach, interpretation, and arrangements of Manos and Mikis music is unique and it represents the perspective of the ensemble artistically, aesthetically and emotionally.\n\n The concept behind this project is the representation of the powerful relationship between Greek Art Music of the 20th century and Greek poetry of the past two centuries. Manos and Mikis not only combined effectively Greek poetry with music, but they also managed to integrate the Folk, Byzantine, and Urban music tradition of the land in their music,\u00a0creating an aesthetic product of high artistic and emotional value.\n\n But there was more: Mikis and Manos embodied two core concepts:\u00a0Eros\u00a0and\u00a0Revolution\u00a0--reminding us Yiannis Ritsos\u2019 beautiful verse:\u00a0\n\"...\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd o \u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7, \u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b9\u03c9\u03c0\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03b5 \u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7...\"\u00a0\n\u201c...your first and last word eros and revolution recounted it, poetry told your entire silence...\u201d\u00a0\n\n Manos and Mikis wrote music that carried the feelings, hopes, aspirations and troubles of an entire generation in a small and fragile country\u00a0that had just gone through WWII, a civil war and, a few years later, a dictatorship. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In those dark times their artful musical creations were not simply an escape, they embodied instead the yearning of an entire people.

  "Jerry Goldsmith is one of the most popular film composers of all time. You might recognize him for his score and theme to Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Or his thundering score for Disney\u2019s Mulan. The echoing trumpets of Patton that lead into one of the most memorable marches in any war film. The soaring theme for Disneyland\u2019s California Adventure\u2019s most popular ride, Soarin\u2019. Or his Oscar-winning choral/orchestral score for The Omen. Overall, he scored more than 250 projects. Due to his popularity, nearly every film score Goldsmith composed has been released in some form. But at least two works remain unreleased for the simple reason that the\u00a0 original recordings are missing. One is his first theatrical film score, the western Black Patch from 1957. The second is The Man from 1972, about America\u2019s first black president. These are noticeable gaps in his discography and the only way to fill those gaps is through new recordings of the scores. This is where Intrada \u2026 and you \u2026 come in. Intrada is one of the foremost record labels focusing exclusively on film music and has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with the composer and his legacy. Since 1985 (that\u2019s 36 years for those counting), we\u2019ve been releasing soundtracks from composers from all periods, featuring all types of music and genres. We even have a series of recordings in which we meticulously restore and authentically re-create film scores of the past. This series, in fact, started with Jerry Goldsmith. Back in the 1980s, Goldsmith himself spearheaded an Intrada recording of his favorite score, Islands in the Stream, and then, a few years later, Rio Conchos, a mid-\u201960s western recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra. Both releases were quite successful. Over the ensuing decades Intrada has made new recordings of scores by Bernard Herrmann, Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa and Dimitri Tiomkin. Our latest recording, the Kickstarter-funded Dial M for Murder from director Alfred Hitchcock,was done in 2018, with renowned conductor William T. Stromberg leading a striking and passionate performance by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. Simon Rhodes engineered, and Douglass Fake produced. The recording was enthusiastically received by Kickstarter patrons, critics and soundtrack collectors alike. For this new proposed project, we are reassembling the same dream team with plans to record this fall. Let\u2019s dig a little deeper into each of these scores. Black Patch (1957) is the Warner Bros. western film that introduced Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s feature film scoring talents to the world. The assignment gave the young composer the opportunity to demonstrate to everyone that his talent for scoring westerns resulted in music that was both melodic and fresh. Composed for orchestra without trumpets, the music is rich with inventiveness. The absence of trumpets results in an overall darker sheen to the music, befitting the somber, dark-edged storyline of the film. The absolutely ravishing centerpiece of the score is the haunting minor-key love theme, introduced in a quiet manner and richly developed into one of the composer\u2019s finest early themes. The lean black-and-white film, set right after the Civil War, was directed by Allen Miner and written by Leo Gordon, who plays one of the protagonists in the film, alongside stars George Montgomery and Diane Brewster, with Sebastian Cabot playing a delightfully \u201cFrenchified\u201d villain. Listen to a few minutes from Black Patch taken directly from the film soundtrack. The Man (1972) is a fictitious political drama that starts when a freak accident makes the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, played by James Earl Jones, the first African-American president of the United States. This time Jerry Goldsmith not only uses trumpets but deploys them in fanfare-like passages drawn from the richest and most splendorous Americana mode! Taking his inspiration from Aaron Copland, Goldsmith fashioned a brief but powerful score befitting the extraordinary images\u00a0of the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial and the magnificent portrait gallery of past U.S. Presidents. The film was produced by ABC Circle Films and intended for television but ultimately deemed of such superior quality that Paramount Pictures released it into theaters instead. Rod Serling penned the script, drawn from a bestselling Irving Wallace novel. Joseph Sargent helmed the picture and kept the primary story in focus with little distraction. \u00a0Listen to a few minutes from The Man taken directly from the movie soundtrack. Leigh Phillips is reconstructing both previously unreleased scores\u2014Black Patch from Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s own surviving scores and The Man from the film print. Leigh was essential in our presentation of Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s 1977 score forDamnation Alley, having re-performed the missing electronic overlays that allowed us to present the entire score back in 2017. William T. Stromberg, veteran of numerous classic film score recordings for both the Marco Polo label and his own Tribute Film Classics label, follows up on his magnificent and authentic interpretation of Dimitri Tiomkin\u2019s Dial M For Murder score by again stepping up to the podium and leading the orchestra in this splendid new performance of two Jerry Goldsmith film scores being newly presented by Intrada! Having said all this, we can\u2019t do this project without your help. So please join us on this journey to making two of the last Goldsmith scores to see the light of day available to everyone. We hope the many different rewards tiers are enticing. Thank you in advance for your support! Check out some videos from our Dial M recording: Here's a video of Douglass Fake and William Stromberg reviewing the Dial M score before a recording session.\u00a0 Here's the orchestra recording the main title to Dial M.\u00a0 And here's one more video of Doug and Bill discussing changes made to the score before recording:\u00a0 But wait, \u00a0don't go! \u00a0We have a very special offer as part of our Kickstarter. \u00a0Intrada Shipping Manager Jeff Johnson will tell you all about it:",

  "New album Lica Cecato & Stefano Scutari \u00a0 DUE COMETE Why do we want to make a new album right now? \u00a0The pandemic has had and is having unthinkable effects of a certain destruction on various fields of profession, including fields that are already fragile in themselves, such as art, and within it, music. Human beings have survival resources that they only use in extreme situations. Stefano and I met 40 years ago in Treviso, near Venice in northern Italy, through music and specifically, having in common a passion for acoustic guitar and Brazilian music. We made our first album exactly 30 years ago, \"Our Favorite Songs\", which is long out of print, but you can hear it on Spotify, Deezer, YouTube and other digital platforms. After our first recording, our professional lives were divided as I went to live abroad, we made, separately, about 12 albums each, with various line-ups. For at least 10 years we have dreamed of making a second album of our own, \"DUE COMETE Lica Cecato & Stefano Scutari\". During the pandemic, apart from 6 months in Rio de Janeiro last year, I arrived in Venice in mid-August 2020 and was no longer able to travel, as I usually do, living in Japan, Brazil and Italy. Confined in Venice for almost a year of lockdown, both Stefano Scutari and I started to meet to play guitar and sing for pure pleasure, and without a precise plan, we pulled out old compositions and created new ones, and when we saw, after about 3 months, we had 12 original songs, with varied rhythms, not only the very Brazilian flavour, but the Mediterranean one, with a rich variation that goes from milonga, to samba, to English pop, to Italian canzone, with lyrics in Portuguese, Italian, English, and one in Venetian dialect, which is where our story begins and continues until today. How is this album special\u00a0 For us, living as musicians for over four decades, even if a little counter-current, we both continue to love and praise acoustic music. Our album has a lot of it! For some songs we invited, besides the duo, the percussionist Leo di Angilla and Donatella Castellani as backing vocal. We recorded in Venice, at Waterland studio, whose sound engineer is Cristiano Verardo, a well-known guitarist who has won gold and platinum disks with the Venetian group Pitura Freska. Knowing each other for so many years, linked by this island-city, makes a recording very relax, cozy, takes away the normal tension of entering a studio. The Studio \u00a0 The album is being recorded in \u201cWaterland\u201d studio, Venice, Italy, in June 2021. As I mentioned before, we have two guests, percussion and backing vocals. Now and 30 years ago, we enter the studio with only voice and guitar. The musical and sound quality is focused on the spontaneous live energy, presence and intimacy. High quality sound recording, warm, pure and rich. Rewards \u00a0 With this campaign we offer you some very nice rewards. Besides a kind of \"pre-order\" of the digital album for download, CD or vinyl you also have the possibility of an exclusive concert with our duo! We are looking forward to doing shows, online or at your place, if it's in Europe, as we haven't been able to do live music for so long. We can forget the geographical problems and the cost of airfare and hotel and bring the music to your homes. During the pandemic we studied the best way to do online concerts, if you wish, exclusive for you and your friends. We also offer a digital songbook in pdf with all the sheet music, lyrics and a part of guitar tabs. We've known each other for over four decades and shared our love for music and art all through it, even taking different paths professionally. We grew older together and the music is still growing within our minds and hearts. We are really excited about this new album and hope that you will be too. We will be very grateful for any contribution and participation in making this happen!

  "This is your chance to be, just as the chieftains of St Patrick's time, a patron of the arts: \u00a0 Professionally printed and bound, illustrated book plus professionally recorded and packaged CD.  Listen to\u00a0 a sample from chapter 1 This project balances out the typical St Patrick\u2019s Day shenanigans (plastic green hats and partying, fun as it all is) with an educational project that will educate, entertain, and represent authentic Irish culture responsibly, through a spoken narrative with musical accompaniment recounting the factual tales and adventurous exploits of the young Patrick, from his capture and enslavement as a young man, through his daring escape, and beyond, into his later return to Ireland as a missionary, where he expressed his full love of the Irish people. Little did we know, until we started researching the actual facts, that young Patrick\u2019s life was a breathtaking adventure full of derring-do and a story ripe for the telling!        The finished project will consist of a professionally recorded CD of spoken narrative and musical accompaniment, plus an illustrated text.  The musicians on board include some of the industry\u2019s top names from the global hit shows Riverdance and Celtic Woman, as well as some of the cream of the Irish America's music community. Our goal with this project is to provide readers a solid introduction to:      a) the authentic roots of an exclusively Irish yet globally recognizable cultural icon\n    b) The traditional musical instruments of Ireland. We believe this project will provide so many who have an interest in their Irish heritage with a solid foundation on which to explore further. We have writer Therese Kunz, a seasoned playwright with over twenty years experience, working with us on the project's narrative.     We have calculated a Kickstarter goal of $5000 to supplement additional funding from outside sources. This figure will ensure that we can both produce a high quality, professionally recorded book and CD package and  also compensate all the participating artists appropriately.  By lending your support, you will be making the authentic roots of Irish culture a more integral part of a deepening of Irish-American heritage.  Thank you so much for taking the time to read this - we really appreciate your support. \u00a0",
  "Rooted, an Irish CD 10 years in the making Derek Byrne left Ireland at the age of 21 to tour with Riverdance. He found the love of his life in Milwaukee and decided to stay. The fact that Milwaukee has the biggest Irish festival in the world, great local trad players and lots of Irish pubs is a happy coincidence. It wasn't long before he set about making friends and forming a band over a few pints.

  "Wonderwritten is an Independent Film slated for production spring of 2018 in Scotland. Join Oregon based creators in telling a uniquely compelling story of the human experience set in the stunning Scottish Highlands. In a rare and emotional screenplay, the story of Alan Ainsley, a Scotland based writer, follows a series of five days in a week of his life. Driven by Alan's internal narrative of letter-like writings and inspiring compelling curiosities about his patterns of behavior, Wonderwritten reveals an unexpected expression of humanity. Alan, having been recently left by the woman he loves and uniquely navigating the new course of his life, keeps his audience engaged with his unfolding nature. Our writers embark on a mindful exploration of heartbreak through the eyes of wonderstruck writer, Alan Ainsley. The story explores the intricacies of humanity's relationship to the world, through the journaling of a writer with an exceptionally unique view of his circumstances. Threaded by a powerful internal monologue, our story wanders the expanding landscape of human emotion and perception. Alan, a published writer and enthusiast for philosophy, offers an unfamiliar character with a powerful message underlying his oddities; \u201cHere\u2019s to life, and to this moment.\u201d With thought-provoking writing as the catalyst, our creators aim to evoke its audience's sense of wonder while rekindling curiosity.\u00a0 THE SCOTLAND SETTING Our location in Scotland \nand how this story came to fruition is an example of how sound and imagery play into our most intricate emotions; inspiring ideas, changing minds and creating stories. With the setting as the source of inspiration, Wonderwritten and the story it tells were born.\u00a0Wonderwritten and our main character are the product of creativity evoked by both visuals and music in relation to our setting in Scotland. OUR CROWDFUNDING GOAL\u00a0 Our Kickstarter goal is set for $40,000. A $40,000 minimum budget covers airfare, transportation, meals for cast and crew, lodging, acting talent, music licensing, shooting permit fees and location reservation\u00a0for production in Scotland, as well as pledge perks such as reservation of the premiere venue, VIP dinner and after party venue costs. PRODUCTION SCHEDULE\u00a0 Production for Wonderwritten is slated for early May of 2018. Pre Production began in December of 2016 and Post Production is summer of 2018. TALENT AND CONNECTIONS IN SCOTLAND Professional acting talent is being sourced locally in Scotland. Producers, and designers for Wonderwritten\u00a0are working through pre production with the assistance of artists and creators local to locations for the film.\u00a0 INTENTIONS AND OBJECTIVES\u00a0 Runtime for Wonderwritten is an estimated fifty minute length, planned to premiere November 2018 at the Historic Elsinore Theatre in our hometown of Salem, Oregon. Specific premiere date will be announced shortly following completion of campaign. Following this event, our plans for the film include submission to Film Festivals around the United States, Scotland and beyond, as well as a tour of screenings across the Pacific Northwest.\u00a0Our Kickstarter campaign features backing levels that include standard and VIP tickets to see the film. Higher levels include VIP dinner and drinks with the creators as well as a VIP ticket to the after party in Salem, Oregon. \"We are excited to take on this huge project. I am excited to be telling a story that speaks to a lesser explored conversation about humanity and how we perceive experience during our brief time alive on this planet. How we embrace or disregard each moment, and each experience, how those experiences shape our thinking, how our minds change and how they don\u2019t, and the overall intricacy of our behavior and interactions. From this project and this film, you should expect close attention to detail, and an encounter with characters that are utterly relatable, yet utterly unique and compelling. My goal is for this film to feel like an intimate conversation. Rich in substance, quirk, and thought, and warm with emotion.\u00a0We have a story that focuses on how a particular character perceives heartbreak; the strongest emotions that overcome us as humans intimately interacting with other humans. Alan Ainsley is a writer, that published his first and only successful work titled \u201cA Portrait of Awe\u201d while deeply in love and living life with someone named Anna. So our audience is introduced to Alan, after having separated from this woman. And as the audience, you\u2019re observing Alan in this aftermath of emotion. You\u2019re coming up with ideas about his unique character, his situation and probably rather struck by his thoughts and behavior. There is a sense of wondering what exactly has happened here, and a mystery to Alan\u2019s small journeys over the course of his story. The film is primarily monologue driven. We hear both Alan\u2019s cultivated and spontaneous thoughts. Over the course of this story, we\u2019re exposed to some really stunning imagery of our setting. The Scottish Highlands being one of the most grand visuals and Alan\u2019s town and home, both very charming and full of character. I think that if all of us can get this project in front of Salem, even just Salem, we can reach our goals for budget, and we will premiere Wonderwritten at our historic theatre. Watching people over the past year look at this lovely, growing city in surprise and excitement for the community at work, makes me so thrilled to do exactly that.\" \u2013\u2013\u2013AshlieRen\u00e9, Writer, Director of Photography \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

  "We are producing this drama episode with a good splash of comedy mixed in to speak to some current issues in America. The displayed video is a trailer from one of our episodes presently available on Amazon, \"The Pugilist.\" In particular, \"The Head Coach,\" will speak to the playing of the national anthem at sports events and why the ritual is respected by a majority of Americans. \"Trial 2020\" is a program that delivers online episodes about America's challenges defining right and wrong. There are right ways and wrong ways to have grievances addressed in America. Your pre-purchase of the episode will help defray about 14% of the total cost of production. We are using one of four Phoenix-area production companies to provide camera, audio and lighting equipment. Along with that they will provide cinematography, editing and other operating expertise. We have to pay for make-up and set design articles, locations, the cast and certain administrative services. A Director may come with the production company or we will have to secure one as well.",
  "I've lived and worked in Whitby (a small town on the northeast coast of England) as an artist for several years now, but when I discovered the building I live in was going up for sale, I realised it was time for a new adventure. I've been given notice and have just a few weeks left to relocate myself and my business. That of course takes funds, so I thought it would be nice to combine my efforts to secure somewhere new with taking the chance to have one final long look at where I am now and celebrate Whitby in one last series of drawings. \u00a0The drawings are done in charcoal pencil on watercolour paper and come in a black 8\" square frame (approx 20cm), with a white mount. The limited edition prints are on quality eco friendly paper and come bagged up with a 6\" white mount (approx 15cm).\u00a0\u00a0I normally reuse photos for small drawings and repeat work to offer an entry level range - as this is a special project I'm offering unique one-off drawings. Each round of prints is a limited run of 50, hand signed and numbered. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am also including time lapse of the drawing being created and both rewards get an information sheet with more on the chosen subject - a bit about its history, location and what makes it special to me. Shipping is included at all levels - with that in mind, please note that if we hit stretch goals, additional bonus prints will be supplied bare (no mount) but still signed and numbered of course. \u00a0That way, backers get the best possible value and I retain enough funding to deliver the project (and myself to somewhere new). The setup of this project is very simple - I've costed producing one original and a limited run of prints from that artwork. If we double that target, I'll produce a second and so on - the great thing about this one is that for every additional round we manage, everyone gets a bonus print whether you've pledged for a mounted print or an original drawing. \u00a0So, the more we raise, the greater the rewards :)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I already have some photographs of iconic locations in and around Whitby that I haven't worked from before, some of which I may use for this project, I will also be taking more images in my final few weeks here as I revisit some of my favourite walks. The pictures shown above are samples of two existing Whitby drawings, featuring two of my very favourite spots so you can get a sense of my work and just how beautiful this place is.\u00a0 Since we've sailed past the initial target, I've started on the first of the new drawings - here's a quick work in progress image of the abbey ruins. \u00a0For more gothic gorgeousness, check out this quick video with some of the photographs I take my inspiration from, including that abbey shot.",
  "The project kicked-off in November 2015 when we released our debut album. \"Conga Line\" came in an eye-catching digipak designed by our friend and a great artist from Serbia -\u00a0Slavko Krunic. And let us tell you, this CD is something we're really proud of!  An album was released with 2 groovy singles with high quality videos to it - just take a look for yourself: \u00a0 April 2016 was when we decided to rerecord our album song \"You Are Greedy. This time you could hear it in a new chilled yet still groovy, acoustic arrangement. The video to the song was made in a historic gold minery in Zloty Stok (Poland) - a very special place where our inspiration was taken to the next level and where we realized making our dream come true is closer that ever. We decided to make the most of our music and deliver it in the most luxurious way and make a vinyl!

In order to help get this record off the ground and reach a wider audience, we could use your help.

Our favorite part about Kickstarter has been the connections we\u2019ve made and the incredible shows we\u2019ve been able to book through this platform. \u00a0We've had the privilege of meeting many of you and have been able to put on concerts in your homes and backyards.

  "I'm Ariadne Antipa and when I began my DMA degree in Piano Performance, I chose Choral Conducting as my minor in order to gain the skillset necessary to embark on a project such as this.\u00a0 I commissioned the phenomenal composer Brian Raphael Nabors to write a piece for virtual choir which would bring musical life to three powerful poems reflecting the essence of the Black Lives Matter movement. The piece travels from dark to light, beginning with \"Bullets Don't Have Names on Them\" (a poem written by 8th grader Zaire Avery), followed by \"The Difference Between You and I\" (a poem written by 6th grader Samar Darby), concluding with \"A New World Coming\" (by award-winning poet Erren Kelly).\u00a0 By contributing to this Kickstarter, you will be helping to fund the production costs. Commissioning the piece, advertising the project to singers nation-wide, and funding the audio engineering together cost thousands of dollars, all of which are coming from my pocket. \u00a0 Your support will give this project the funding necessary to succeed and to ensure a polished product. Thank you!",
  "The basic idea of this CD was to use the process of writing, recording and then listening to these songs as a form of self-therapy...  These songs are fundamentally autobiographical, but some of the names have been changed to protect the guilty! This CD has been in the works for over two years. Actually one could say it has been in the works since 1987, which is when one of the songs (Loving You No Matter What) was written! The musicians on this CD are nothing short of spectacular. From the NYC Reggae scene, Derrick Barnett (bass), Gabe Kircheimer (drums) and Aya Kato (keyboards) form the nucleus of the rhythm section. There are appearances from many other notable musicians like Cornell Marshall (drums), Andy Bassford (bass), Noel Jones (bass) and Samuel \u201cEarth\u201d Maxwell  (keyboards). Did I mention horns? Every song has beautifully orchestrated horn parts created by Travis Calvert (sax), Doug Fischer (trombone) and/or Jamie Kraus (trumpet). There are background vocals featured on every song and some of the guest singers include: Nellie McKay, Marcia Davis, Simone Gordon, Carla Kelly, Laury Webb, Sarah Mischner, Keith Johnston, Nando Griffiths and many others.

  "We are asking for financial help in order to finish our first full length album, which will be a mixture of original and traditional folk music on fiddle, guitar and vocals. There will be both songs and instrumental tunes. We have been playing together for two years, working up material that satisfies both of our hungry musical brains while enjoying a fluid creative process. We feel it is past time to set down the fruits of our labors on a record. A number of singular artists both old and new have inspired us. To name a few: Andy Irvine, Alasdair Fraser, Nic Jones, Martin Hayes, Dick Gaughan, Andre Brunet, and Nightingale. A common thread between these artists is their ability to thrive on playing old music with their own voice, to deliver their own version of these timeless songs and tunes. Like them, we're trying to build on the depth of this material by adding our own layers to what is already there, and adding our own story to the mix. We\u2019ve both made albums in recent years with other bands and projects, but this one is of particular importance because it will be a big step towards defining our sound together.  We hope this album will be the first of many, and help us further refine our partnership. For this album we are working with Jim Prendergast at Mill Pond Music Studios in Portsmouth NH. Jim has quietly been creating many amazing records in the past five years, and we trust his ability to interpret our music. He is definitely the man to help us push this album forward. We also made an easy decision to invite the incredible Jeremiah McLane to join us as a guest on this album, playing accordion. He has paved the way for us with some of the singular recordings he has made in the past, and he is a huge inspiration to both of us. His presence on this recording will not only add color but a huge amount of depth that we could not achieve without him.\u00a0 \u00a0We're hoping that, in the end, both traditional and contemporary tastes in music will be satisfied when listening to this album, but we need your support to get there.",
  "5 years have passed since the last EP, and 10 years since the second album. So it was time for a new SKy76's musical release. Still in the quest of \"classical music and electronic sounds\" perfect blend, this new album bring \"hybrid\" instrumental songs in the first place, mixing real instruments \u00a0and sounds from everyday with electronic textures. But it doesn't forget the most beautiful and complex instrument: the human voice, with two tracks performed by a wonderful female singer... (one of them is the single \"Twist in my Sobriety\" released last year). 5 ans se sont pass\u00e9s depuis le dernier EP, et 10 ans depuis le deuxi\u00e8me album. Il \u00e9tait donc temps pour la sortie d'un nouvel opus musical SKy76. Toujours teint\u00e9 d'influences \"classique et \u00e9lectronique\", ce nouvel album fait la part belle aux morceaux instrumentaux \"hybrides\", m\u00e9langeant des vrais instruments et sons du quotidiens avec des textures \u00e9l\u00e9ctroniques. Mais il n'oublie pas le plus bel et complexe instrument qu'est la voix humaine, avec deux titres interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s par une formidable chanteuse... (dont le single \"Twist in my Sobriety\" sorti l'ann\u00e9e pass\u00e9e) Although this album will be available on most of the online streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Deezer, etc...), a release on physical disc has become an obvious choice. The convenience of music streaming is undeniable today, but owning a physical record to listen music is a different and very interesting experience. The physical limitations of vinyl demand a greater dynamic audio range than used in the CD or digital versions. A great care is made on the mixing stage of this new album, and an audio mastering (the final stage of \"sound improvement\" before the release), dedicated to this vinyl version (entrusted to a specialized \"mastering\" studio), will give a certain quality and special importance to it. Finally, it is also planned to provide a download code for the \"Masters tracks\" to all vinyl's buyers. It will allow everyone to listen the whole album in high definition (CD quality) non-compressed digital files. Bien que cet album sera disponible sur la majorit\u00e9 des plateformes de streaming musiques (Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Deezer, etc...), une sortie sur disque physique s'est naturellement impos\u00e9e . M\u00eame si le c\u00f4t\u00e9 pratique du streaming est aujourd'hui ind\u00e9niable, poss\u00e9der un disque physique pour \u00e9couter de la musique est une exp\u00e9rience diff\u00e9rente et tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante. Les contraintes techniques du vinyle impose une meilleur dynamique du son , que ce qui est utilis\u00e9 sur le CD ou en digital. Une grande attention est port\u00e9e sur le mixage de chaque morceaux de ce nouvel album, et il est pr\u00e9vu un mastering audio (l'\u00e9tape audio finale \"d'am\u00e9lioration\" avant la sortie officielle) d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 cette version vinyle (confi\u00e9 \u00e0 un studio sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9), ce qui donnera une qualit\u00e9 et importance particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 celui-ci. Enfin, il est \u00e9galement pr\u00e9vu d'offrir \u00e0 tout les acqu\u00e9reurs du vinyle un code de t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement pour les fichiers \"Masters\" de chaque titres de l'album. Cela permettra d'\u00e9couter \u00e9galement chaque titre en haute d\u00e9finition (qualit\u00e9 CD) non-compress\u00e9. The artist is nothing without the support of his audience! Your financial support will help the full \"production\" of: Vinyls production is currently taking longer than usual (a consequence of COVID-19). Therefore, the vinyl release is planned in december 2021, around the same time as the official release on streaming. L'artiste n'est rien sans l'\u00e9coute et le soutien de son public!

  "What's up everyone! It's Aimey & I am back for another tarot party. Wonderland introduced me to the tarot world. My very first deck was an Alice deck, which makes this project even more special to me. Creating my own Alice deck and seeing this project come to life feels something like a world moment; mostly because I learning tarot through the story of Wonderland.\u00a0 The Wonder World Tarot is playful, fun & full of little surprises. It also includes references from Through the Looking Glass, which is also pretty awesome. I covered all costs for this print run out of pocket and all decks are currently in my possession. That said, I have only printed 500 copies, some of which I am sure will have some bruising. Because of this, I had to limit the number of all pledges. On the bright side, Push Kitty is still a very small name so no worries, that is still plenty! Specifications: Check out this flip-through video of the deck on Youtube, like & subscribe :).\u00a0 A'down the rabbit hole we go! The Wonderland stories & all of its renditions are captivating, both visually and textually. Alice's journey is very unusual. I find the world of wander to be quite magical, especially since the stories that really made no sense were always the most relatable & memorable to me. I spent a lot of life trying to make sense of things, but why worry? Life is weird, fun, and tumultuous at times; you get ups, downs and all sorts of in-betweens. I am a visual learner, so seeing the stories unfold were often teachable moments. Anywho, I am super excited to share this project with you all, The little Aimey inside of me jumps for joy! \u00a0 The Major Arcana features many of the main characters including concurrent appearances of the star of the show, Little Alice. From the Fool to the World, Alice meets many friends and gets advice along the way, each encounter providing her with some rhyme or reason, trial or tribulation, and so on; all contributing to her accomplishments at the close. Alice is illustrated in a cooky little art style with some character changes, most obviously her red shoes. The red shoes are a nod to the Wizard of Oz, as the protagonist travels through the fools journey, swooning (mostly) everyone she meets. \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd73 The Wands suit feature both characters with major roles and supporting roles. The orangey (is that even a word? lol) fall colors are pretty consistent throughout the deck, but they are more prominent in the wands suit. Alice's journey through the suit starts with giving her something to fight for. This gift of passion is followed by plenty exchanges of... sorts, along the way. The cups suit finds that sweet spot between warm and cool colors. Autumn, with an emotive feel as the purples and peaches dance harmoniously throughout the imagery. With the suit of water we see plenty of emotional interactions, some bitter, some sweet, some...meh, like the Hatta in the four of cups; but hey, isn't that the name of the game? The game called LIFE... for most of us anyway.\u00a0 The swords suit leans on the blues and purples to give us that cool-airy feel mental process. The cheshire cat appears more in this suit because of his ability to engage one in thought. The cheshire cat's ability to answer a question without answering it is quite brilliant. This method encourages one to think for themselves; this way they are accountable for their own decisions and results. Oh, cat with the grin, guide us through the blues of the swords suit gently... or just slap us with knowing there is a hungry walrus that wants to eat us (7 of swords), or a pot-smoking ex-caterpillar who keeps asking us who we are (King of Swords). Lmaoo, haha! Okay in all seriousness, the swords suit lowkey leads with an air of anxiety. When I pull a card with swords I automatically think deeper into the reading. Mental health is so important and so is awareness. Take care of yourselves! Now off to the coins we go! Sweet mother of wander, the radiance and warmth pulsing through the coins suit is contagious... that is until you grow too large and get stuck in a \"nervously shilly-shally\" ol' rabbit's house that plans to blow you to smithereens (3 of coins)! lol. But hey, who likes a negative Nancy? Let's move on like our cute little flamingo and hedgehog friends (5 of coins). The suit of coins feature some characters from Through The Looking Glass folks, as well as the first Wonderland tale. The character selection is always done thoughfully, some of my favorite being the 3,5,10 and King of coins. Any true Alice fan will get it, otherwise you will be confused about why a large Dodo bird sits in the Kings position; but just so you know, this bird did lead a traumatized group of creatures into a caucus race that they all won. If thats not an entrepreneurial spirit, I dont know what is! This is the original Sun card which is almost identical to the other except the brothers have a snotty nose & the number (19) is a different color. I personally love this version with the snot, but I try not to be selfish for those who would prefer not to see mucus on their tarot cards lol \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Hear me out! external mucus represents impurities leaving the body, which makes lots of sense for the Sun card (at least I think so) lol. With both Sun cards we all have the option to keep one, the other or both. Maybe they can mean different things or just add a little more joy to your deck. I mean, how many of us experienced a happy little snotty nosed kid running around? Lol anyway, your deck, your choice. Can we make that hash tag? When the idea first came about, I thought of all the amazing Alice decks that were out there, all beautiful & unique in their own right. I thought about how my vision of the art would contribute to the brilliance of Lewis Carroll's creativity. I learned that creativity is a process, and most of us will experience some doubt along the way. I questioned my ability to re-image the world to make it feel a little more like... me. A little more unusual... a little more whimsey... a little more warm... a little more... fun! I thought of all the characters illustrated in this super unique, children's-book-like art style & the concept just felt so right! Check out a flipthrough of the prototype deck on Tarot Oracle's youtube Channel There are also a bunch of other awesome youtubers who have reviewed Push Kitty decks. I recommend giving youtube a search for any decks you might like for unbiased reviews. Of all the add ons, I am most excited about the Wonder World Tarot Tiles! The Wonder World Tiles set will feature the original back design of the deck (purple with cream bunnies), an extra Justice tiles that is not included in the deck and a free Canvas pouch of your choice! Albeit the Flash Dance or the Hatter & the Hare, I found that a pouch provides a much better home for these light weight little tiles than a box. The pouch doubles as a deck pouch, since it is large enough to fit the Wonder World Tarot deck with or without the box. I realize there aren't any tiles like mine out there but trust me when I tell ya, these little tiles are all the rave! Give em a try, you'll be glad ya did! Why Push Kitty Tiles? Specifications: The Extra Justice card can mean many things. For me, one guy wants to chop my head off for sport (lacks empathy), and the other doesn't (has empathy & care for all). Many meanings can be assigned but remember; your tiles, your choice! Check out Tarot Oracles review of my tarot tiles on his youtube channel, it is hysterical! lol.\u00a0 The Little Buddha Oracle is a 72 card deck made to inspire and guide the seeking heart. This deck takes a gentle approach to the more difficult messages of every day life. It is a perfect companion for the Little Buddha Tarot and/or any other cutesy deck with a light-hearted feel. It is incredible adorable, cheeky & a little sassy at times lol. Specifications Check out a full flip-through or extended walk-through of the deck on my youtube channel.\u00a0 I have received MANY requests to include other decks as add ons for those of us who want to combine shipping, so I've done that & created a bunch of bundle tiers to help save a couple bucks (roughly $100 for all bundles). Because these print runs are limited, I had to limit the number of bundle tiers to 10 copies. Here is a list of the decks you can grab on this campaign. Some decks are exclusive to my website, check out my site if you don't see the decks you want here. If they are not there they just havent been released quite yet. I recommend following Push Kitty on Instagram for updates since this is where I post most often. I have some sort of video for most of my deck on my Youtube channel so if you get curious & think, \"whats that deck?\", I recommend you head over for some visuals. I invite you all to like and subscribe to help grow the channel. Fair warning, I am a ball of anxiety & a bit camera shy so don't judge me lol. \ud83d\ude02 \u00a0*All shipping is calculated in backerkit* As many of you know, I have taken a leap of faith with this project, so i have already paid all costs to print and have the deck shipped to me. All of the Wonder World decks are currently in my possession, so turn around will be quite prompt. I believe in this project 100% so this was a no brainer for me. Then again, I am a bit of a risk taker so I would not regret a single thing if the project did not turn out how I'd hoped.\u00a0 Further, this deck has been elevated to the max! I paid extra for every single spec that I love to see in a deck. The magnetic box, the matte painted edging for longevity, even the silk matte finish cost me extra. The deck even better than I'd imaged, it was worth every penny.\u00a0 That said, we are all receiving a top notch deck as is, but I am happy to order some extra little goodies that can get to me quickely for the yum of it! These stretch goals apply to all backers with tangible goods. I'll add more if by some chance we get to some wild number with funding. If there are more backers than decks I will print another edition, but there will be changes to the back design, box design, edging and. card finish. I've also been thinking about using the funds for a pocket sized deck. Let's see how things go. Unlocked- Stickers- \"The cat with the grin\" Unlocked- Prints Unlocked- Wonder World Pen- all backers with the Wonder World Sticker & Journal Set $33,333- An additional free Pouch- all backers with a bundle. That's all I got this go around. Many more thanks, warm hugs & love everyone. You are all infinitely awesome & much appreciated! \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73 Love - AB",
  "Hekatean Witch and Priestess of Hekate Marcia C. Silva takes the classic structure of the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot to create the Hekatiko Tarot. The illustrations by Dylion Orion Brahn evoke Hekate in Her many faces, Her botanicals and animal allies, ancient Temple of Lagina and her priesthood, witches, and deities linked to Her. The Greek word Hekatiko (\u1f19\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc) means \u201cof Hekate\u201d. This name was chosen to symbolize that this deck is consecrated to the goddess. It is a deck that takes the classic structure of the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot and re-interprets it through traditional and modern Hekatean elements that talk deeply with us \u2013 it is a deck made by devotees, for devotees. In this deck, each of the 22 Major Arcana cards is connected with one of Hekate\u2019s epithets (i.e., a quality or attribute of the goddess), plus one of her botanicals correspondences - some are historical, others are contemporary. In this deck, the Minor Arcana cards from Ace to Ten are represented by Hekate\u2019s ancient Temple of Lagina in Asia Minor and her priesthood, as well as her animals, colors, and symbols: On the other hand, the Court cards are represented by other beings that have some relationship with Hekate: After choosing a reward tier, the following add-ons will be available for you: Marcia C. Silva is a hekatean witch, devotee, and priestess of Hekate. She started her witch\u2019s path in 2005, but all changed with Hekate's call in 2017. Two years later, she created the first podcast all about Hekate in Portuguese, the \u201cCaverna de Hekate\u201d ( Hekate's Cave). In 2020, she published her first book, \u201cBruxaria Hekatina\u201d (Hekatean Witchcraft), and in 2021 she published \u201cAs Faces de Hekate\u201d (The Faces of Hekate). The main mission of her priesthood is to facilitate knowledge-based access to information about Hekate (especially in Portuguese, her mother language) and to assist people in their personal connection with the goddess, especially within the modern practices of Hekatean Witchcraft. Dylion Orion Brahn is a tattoo artist, and illustrator who has been devoted to art for over 25 years. He started studying witchcraft around 2002, and today he is a devotee of Hekate and a High Priest of the Wiccan Eleusinian Tradition in Brazil, founded by Edu Scarfon.

  "The Marlin Briscoe movie project, titled The Magician, recounts the amazing, true-life journey of Marlin \"the Magician\" Briscoe, the first starting black quarterback in professional football. However, this is not merely a football movie, it is a gut-wrenching and inspirational story about a man who never gave up, despite the worst of odds. \u00a0The original screenplay was written by Gregory Allen Howard, writer of Remember the Titans and Ali. Marlin grew up in a single-parent home in the racially divided housing projects of South Omaha. \u00a0From an early age, he was forced to endure, and overcome, many of the discriminatory practices of that time. \u00a0But with the guidance of his mother and a father-like cousin, Marlin escaped a lifetime of working in the packing plants with a full-ride scholarship to Omaha University (now the University of Nebraska at Omaha). The late coach Al Caniglia saw something special in Marlin, and made him the starting quarterback. \u00a0Upon graduation in 1968, after a record-setting career in college, Marlin was drafted in the 14th round by the Denver Broncos, but not as a quarterback, as a defensive back. However, at the prophetic advice of \"Coach Al,\" who knew that the Broncos were one of only a few teams that held training camps open to the public, Marlin negotiated a three-day tryout with the quarterbacks. He agreed that, after the three days, he would quietly move to defensive back and \"start tackling people.\" Marlin's abilities out-shined the other quarterbacks in camp, but at the end of his negotiated tryout, he was moved to defensive back. \u00a0About halfway through the 1968 season, after injuries sidelined starter Steve Tensi and his backups proved futile, the Broncos reluctantly moved Marlin into the role of starting quarterback. \u00a0In a short season, Marlin set the rookie record for touchdowns, a record that still stands today, and was runner-up for Rookie of the Year. Despite his success, Marlin was released from the Broncos without explanation and returned to Omaha jobless. \u00a0Marlin had done the unthinkable, and broken the color barrier for black quarterbacks everywhere, but the writing was on the wall. \u00a0He knew that to stay in the league, he would have to change positions. \u00a0With the help of former teammates and his cousin, Bob Rose, Marlin trained as a wide receiver, a position he had never before played. \u00a0But all the while, he never gave up hope that he would once again play quarterback. Within two years, Marlin was named an All-Pro wide receiver with the Buffalo Bills. \u00a0Legendary coach Don Shula traded a first round draft pick to bring Marlin to the Miami Dolphins, where he earned two Super Bowl rings and was an integral member of the 1972 Dolphins, the only undefeated Super Bowl champion. \u00a0Marlin ended his football career in 1976, never getting the opportunity to play quarterback again. On top of the world after a successful football career, Marlin moved to Los Angeles looking for new challenges. \u00a0Job offers were plentiful and Marlin quickly adjusted to the fast-paced life of LA. \u00a0But it all came too easy. \u00a0There were no racial hurdles to jump and no competition to be found; the things that had always driven Marlin to succeed. \u00a0He no longer had to be disciplined. \u00a0He was lost and, in spite of all his success, still bitterly anguished the the role of quarterback had been taken from him. A dark obsession began to reveal itself; something to which Marlin had no answer. \u00a0And what started out as innocent partying turned into what Marlin calls \"the real story,\" an addiction to crack cocaine that took his job, his house, his marriage and on several occasions, nearly his life. Marlin's life spiraled out of control, as he spent days, months and years chasing that high. \u00a0He conned passersby for drug money and isolated himself from family, friends and teammates. \u00a0At one point, he even spent the weekend locked in the trunk of a drug dealer's car. But just as Marlin had persevered in his battle to overcome racism in professional football, he would overcome addiction as well. \u00a0Many people played pivotal roles in his recovery, but ultimately, it was the Magician himself who had to turn the corner. The Magician will chronicle, not only Marlin's historic accomplishments on the football field, but his meteoric fall from glory at the hands of a crack addiction. \u00a0It will also dissect his life experiences and past relationships that enabled him to finally overcome his demons. \u00a0The Magician will be a strong character-driven film that will focus on the man himself and his life-long struggle for self-discovery and self-fulfillment.

  "This project is near and dear to my heart. I started working on this screenplay April 30th 2007. Since then a lot has changed in my life. I have an 8 year old son, I've written 4 screenplay so far but the time for writing and waiting is over. Its time to bring these projects to life starting with Unsalted Butter my 2nd full length screenplay.\u00a0 My goal is to take $50,000 to hire a novelist to convert this screenplay into a novel while simultaneously hiring a play-writer to convert this screenplay into a play. Once the play-write and novel has been completed I will release the novel onto kdp.amazon.com. We will do several shows locally for the play-write and depending on the success of the two plus the leftover funds, the full length feature film will begin pre-production. I will collaborate with the other two writers to strengthen the screenplay and hiring actors in addition to using the stage actors as well.\u00a0 The success of all three platforms will help spawn my film production company Blue Journal Studios to create the other projects and help bring other writers works to life as you have for me.",
  "Are you a lover of monsters? How about male monsters? Maybe even attractive male monsters? Perhaps you also are in need of some lumbar support. What if you could have it all in 1 giant novelty body pillow?! These are boyfriend pillows with a twist.\u00a0 I am Zyephen, a comic artist who is now starting my 4th kickstarter. I am a self employed artist and I support myself with my art. I'm coming to you from Galveston County Texas, and I'd like to welcome you to the My Monstrous Lovers project on Kickstarter. So now that you've met the boys, I bet you're wondering what the products would really look like. Well, luckily I've got a solid partnership with my manufacturer, and they were kind enough to make prototypes of each of the pillows.\u00a0 Avenachs is printed on peach skin fabric that measures 40in(100cm) x 141in(358cm) **wings included. and has a hidden zipper along the bottom for stuffing. His manta wings will be pre-stuffed with a thin layer of quilt batting and sewn closed so that no stuffing from the main pillow overflows into the wings. He is the most expensive to produce. Malekhan is printed on peach skin fabric that measures 20in(50cm) x 132in(336cm). Naajra is printed on peach skin fabric that measures 20in(50cm) x 144in(366cm). Both have a hidden zipper along the bottom for stuffing. Thiel is printed on peach skin fabric that measures 40in(100cm) x 79in(200cm) and has a hidden zipper along the side for stuffing.\u00a0 So at this point, maybe you're thinking, \"I like the boys, but maybe a huge body pillow isn't for me.\" Well guess what? The designs are also available as wall art! If not in your bed, then most definitely on your wall! Don't have wall space either? These little guys don't take up much room, and they're also stinkin' cute on top of it! Check out these adorable 3in(7.5cm) monster boy acrylic key chains. Please note that delays may occur during the production stage, but I'll be sure to let you know if the factory gets delayed. \ud83d\udcee Shipping\ud83d\udcee I'm located in the US(Texas 77565). Shipping will vary wildly depending on what you order and where you live, and this is why I'm using Backerkit to charge shipping after the campaign ends. This will also save a little money for everyone by removing Kickstarter's fees from cutting into shipping cost. Shipping inside the US will typically range from $4 to $12. International shipping will be harder to determine. I've sent packages to Canada for $15usd and to Australia for over $40usd for the same package weight. The best way you can estimate is to try and calculate it yourself to get a rough estimate on what the shipping will be for your specific order. You can get a rough estimate on the weight of your order here. Thank you all for supporting the My Monstrous Lovers project! I hope to bring all of you wonderfully unique and quality products that you will love!",

  "When three veteran crusaders head out on a journey of discovery searching for what they believe to be another coming of christ, they encounter much more than they anticipated. From a damsel in distress, to mysteries of the universe beyond their imagination. To a God Unknown (working title) is a student film, being produced by final year university film students. The trailer is a proof of concept, and with your help, we are hoping to improve significantly on the quality for the final production. With a larger time restraint to produce this project, we are first and foremost hoping to be able to take the cast and crew on a road trip to a much more significant location. Being in Perth, Australia, filming a medieval film is challenging for locations, as they can be few and far between. Reaching our goal will allow us to transport the cast, crew, and equipment to better locations, particularly in the south west regions of Australia. We are hoping to film in much more remote, forested locations, to give it more of a medieval Europe feel. In doing so, we would require to hire out generators, especially for powering lights on set. Some sensitive film lights require us to hire specialized generators which we don't have access to. Furthermore, to make our film even more visually awesome, we are looking to take on board an art department. Whilst we may have a volunteer, with additional funding, we could potentially hire a professional to do work such as makeup, costumes, and set designing. With enough funding, we may also achieve: These will further the visual quality of the story, however are not as critical. We are filming throughout May, for a June the 9th deadline of the final film. The film has already undergone a large amount of pre-production, and we are nearing the production stage of the film.

  "Hello everyone. I'm Heidi Talbot. I'm a singer and songwriter from Ireland now making my home in Edinburgh, Scotland. \u00a0When i'm not singing and making music you'll find me taking care of my two daughters or teaching/studying yoga.\u00a0 I'm about to start recording my 6th solo album in the coming weeks with world renowned producer/multi instrumentalist Dirk Powell (Joan Baez, Eric Clapton, Loretta Lynn). So much has changed for us all over these last couple of years and for me, now feels like the right time to make an album of songs inspired by where I've been, right up to where I am now, exploring themes of love, loss, healing and hope. We have put together a team of musicians to bring these songs to life, some people I have never worked with before - taking myself out of my comfort zone and making space for new ideas and inspiration. I'm so excited to make this music. As an independent artist, I was depending on touring/performing to generate the income \u00a0to finance and release this record. As we know, live music has disappeared these last 18 months and so I find myself asking for your support in making this album come true.\u00a0 I am incredibly grateful for the support I have received over these last few years from family, friends, colleagues and the kind souls who support my music. I will do my absolute best to send beautiful vibes out into the universe and create a soundscape on which to elevate you, to lean on or escape if/when needed.\u00a0 Love and Light to you all Thanks for reading Heidi xxx",
  "Why help us transcend the digital phenomena and reach into the physical manifestation of the sublime analog world by transferring 'TRUE NATURE' onto a gorgeous 12\" Vinyl Record with original artwork?\u00a0 Because....\u00a0 This is DUB. This is ROOTS. This is REGGAE influenced music with a touch of ELECTRONICA. \u00a0A vinyl record has a groove carved into it that mirrors the original sound's waveform. This means that no information is lost. The output of a record player is analog. ... This means that the waveforms from a vinyl recording can be much more accurate, and that can be heard in the richness of the sound. \u00a0Alison's deep meditative bass is the common thread throughout our album; binding together beats, rich tones, deep lyrics and ethereal vocals that create a unique dub experience. \u00a0 Ultimately, this vinyl is for you.\u00a0 We want YOU to have the most incredible audio sensory experience possible and it is our belief you will 'feel' 'TRUE NATURE' if you're listening on vinyl. We are 'Native Soul Project'; a collaboration between Alison Wunderland and Carla Werner. Both musicians with established careers as individual artists, coming together to form a common bond in music we love and respect deeply. We met in 2015 and played our first show together at SoCal roots festival, 'Reggae on the Mountain'. \u00a0Since then we have played many shows in Los Angeles, Orange County and New Zealand alongside and supporting a slew of reggae heavy weights including Toots and the Maytels, Sly & Robbie, Pato Banton, Soul Syndicate, Piracy Conspiracy, Knights of the Dub Table (NZ) and Regan Perry (NZ). \u00a0We have always worked extremely hard as a band (at times with regular band mates, drummer Rock Deadrick (Ziggy Marley) and key/horn virtuoso John McKnight (Fishbone)) and as individuals. Carla has been a self-educated music producer since 2006, engineering most of the trance vocals she's performed, and producing three of her own albums. \u00a0'TRUE NATURE' is her debut as mixer alongside Lucius Borich. \u00a0\u00a0'TRUE NATURE' is a culmination of tracks written over several years drawing influence from the happenings in the world we live today, including musical inspirators Alpha & Omega, Massive Attack, Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop, Lee Scratch Perry, Grace Jones, Thievery Corporation and Bob Marley. \u00a0\u00a0The album was produced and partly recorded in the US and completed in New Zealand during the lockdown period of 2020, forcing Carla to work remotely with various musicians/artists in the US, Australia and New Zealand including Alison. In the lockdown, a remix emerged of the album's flagship track 'One To Ten' by producer Paddy Free (NZ) (\u2018Salmonella Dub\u2019 - \u2018Inside The Dub Plates\u2019). \u2018One To Ten - Paddy Free Remix\u2019 was released October 1, 2020 and features as an extended dub version on Paddy's own album \u2018Paddy Free In Dub #2\u2019 released in April, 2021.\u00a0 'TRUE NATURE' was officially completed in January 2021, and mastered by Stuart Hawkes at Metropolis Mastering in London, UK. The digital album will be released worldwide on JUNE 30, 2021. Sooooooo.....\u00a0 This campaign is for 30-Days-Only. \u00a0Because vinyl is so popular right now, it's going to take 3-4 months for manufacturers to physically produce vinyl because of current demand. \u00a0If we do not make our goal you will receive back your funds, and we will work out some other way to do this because we must. There is also every possibility we will \u00a0surpass the GOAL and if this is the case, we will be able to help fund touring and press related costs for the album, but more importantly, invest in the future employment of other musicians along the way. We are so grateful to YOU and for the blessing of MUSIC we all get to share; our true universal language. Please send us questions about anything. We believe in total transparency so if you're unsure of anything, just ask us.\u00a0 Nga Mihi, and thank you again. Alison & Carla xx",
  "Music is my constant, my original love. And now, finally, I have a collection of that expression to share with the world. In order to make it all happen, I need your support! The production quality I received from my talented producer Avi Vinocur and the guys at 25th Street Recording Studios in Oakland exceeded all my expectations. What started out as a demo ended up as a little record that I really love... and I'm hoping you will too! Where will the contributions from you and others go?\u00a0 With $5000 raised, I can kick start my PR campaign, backed by a seasoned consultant, and cover my album production costs. In the event we exceed my goal, I will use the extra funding toward exciting extras. If we reach $7000, I can make a professional music video for one of my singles. If we reach $9000, I'll put the money towards a radio campaign and put the album on vinyl, which would be a dream come true! Eveything I raise will go toward this album.\u00a0 Thank you from the bottom of my musical heart for considering supporting me in reaching my goals! Gratefully yours,\u00a0 Claudia\u00a0",

  "It all started with a song. It's a bright, funny, adorable, get-up-and-dance song that was just begging to be illustrated. I could see it as soon as we put our lyrics together with the music. I could see our main characters, Larry & Joe, coming to life on the pages of a book.\u00a0 My name is Stephanie (Beppie). I'm a JUNO-nominated children's artist. My fourth album (Dino-mite!) is coming out this fall, and right along with it will be my first-ever children's book! The album itself has been a labor of love for the past two years. This dream of mine to create a children's book began long before that. Three kids, three albums, and three million cups of coffee later, I can finally say that IT IS HAPPENING! Last year I teamed up with a local artist, Robyn Slack, to start the process of bringing these dynamic dancing dinosaurs to life. Larry & Joe were not new characters in my world though, in fact, they made their grand debut on my JUNO nominated children's album back in 2019. Since then, Larry & Joe has remained my number one selling, my most streamed, and my most requested song. It only made sense for them to make a comeback in a BIG way. \u00a0 Robyn and I are almost done with our first draft of the book! To make our project come to life, we will need to raise funds. Funds for printing, marketing, mastering, and editing. All of the funding so far to create the book project has come from my own personal bank account. I believe in this song and this story so much that I have invested my own money, hundreds of hours, and all of my creative energy for the past two years into making it happen. We are so close we can almost taste it (but we won't taste it, cause it's a book, and people shouldn't eat books....duh!). This fall will be so exciting! We will be embarking on a virtual Jam & Draw tour, a music tour, and a book reading tour all across the prairies here in Canada and virtually across the globe. We are pulling out all the stops to share the love and the energy that Larry & Joe bring to the world. \u00a0I know that you will love this song and story combo as much as I do! It's time for the kids of the world to get up and dance with Larry & Joe. As Joe would say: Wiggle that Dino tail tonight and ROAR! 'Cause, you're Dino-mite! This Kickstarter campaign gives you three levels of support. Each option comes with the book and the album. Pick the option that works best for you and your budget! We can't wait to share our hard work and our art with you!",
  "If Taylor Swift and Paul McCartney can do it, so could I. \u00a0And I did; I recorded an album during COVID lockdown. Thanks to the internet, I had lots of help. Like many songwriters, I\u2019m an OK singer who sometimes backs himself up with more trained voices. David Taylor is a dynamic singer with whom I\u2019ve been in several bands over the years. He\u2019s also appeared on a few of my previous records. Another former bandmate and songwriter Leslie Sanazaro added a few notes of her lovely voice, as did Nicole Colombatto. These three add a striking finale to the gruff male musicians playing and singing \u201cF-kt Up\u201d. Folk veteran David Helling adds his soothing baritone and guitar in our little \u201cLullalbye\u201d duet. Two hot-shot guitarists, Mark Youngbauer and Scott Rockwood, are also from the Saint Louis rock scene. Mark has played in a few bands with me, as well as many others over the years. He plays with effortless taste and ease. I\u2019ve seen him play a few gigs with Scott, who is a founding member of Madahoochi. Madahoochi were fan faves in town, and made a name for themselves regionally. He himself is a brilliant songwriter as well as virtuosic guitarist. Once you hear his guitar on \u201cComing To Terms\u201d, you\u2019ll understand his reputation. So far, everyone I\u2019ve mentioned is a Saint Louis resident. Or in Scott\u2019s case -- was -- but he moved to Florida a few years back with his partner, Shawn Hartung, yet another excellent musician. But this album was recorded in the COVID era, so we actually didn\u2019t get to record much in person. Recording and playing music, live or in the studio, is usually done in person. But, as you probably recall, that was a luxury none of us could enjoy during that time span. No eye contact, no pats on the back, no taking breaks together. Most importantly to the groove, no ensemble playing! That created many challenges, and this album benefits from modern technology. Not just that we had to simulate a live band while playing one at a time, but also distance. Again, even with my beloved fellow Saint Louisans, they may as well have been hundreds or thousands of miles away. And some were. But thanks to the internet, we were still able to share files. The two exceptions were the lullabye I did with David Helling, and the other is the pseudo-ska song, \u201cDo What You Do (Don\u2019t What You Won\u2019t)\u201d. The basic tracks (bass and drums) were recorded in The Before Times, when my friend Matt Kaden came to town a few years back. Mr. Kaden is a veteran songwriter himself, a multi-instrumentalist who also appeared on my previous albums, Pop Another Cork and \u00a0Down. If ever there were an act that fit the title The Greatest Band You\u2019ve Never Heard Of, that would be his. He was part of a three-headed monster called Soothing Sounds For Baby, a cult-classic Boston band from the 1980s and \u201890s. Fellow Soothing Sounds member Al Hifi played also appeared on this album; I\u2019ll get \u00a0to him in a moment. The silver lining to making music over the internet, with distance irrelevant, was that I reunited with some former bandmates and collaborators from younger days. My buddy Matt Schickele joined in the fun for a few tracks, including the super-happy organ part on that aforementioned ska song, and some harmonies elsewhere. Reuniting with old college buddies was especially satisfying. It wasn\u2019t just that we had a reason to talk and work together, which was fun, but we share a history. We understand each others\u2019 mental shorthand, preferences, and logic. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s nice to be understood. Which brings us to the heavy hitters, without whom this album would not be as great. Dan Sonenberg and Allan Heifetz, aka Al Hifi, both made enormous contributions. They\u2019re both bandmates from younger days, and to collaborate with them was a joy. Dan is a composition professor at University of Maine, whose opera \u201cThe Summer King\u201d has drawn national attention and praise. He\u2019s also a mad-cap songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, especially featured as this album\u2019s main drummer. Al is also a mean drummer (another member Soothing Sounds for Baby), but mostly plays guitar and bass, abitof singing as well as drum programming. Speaking of robots, I arranged orchestral instruments more than usual, and that in some ways dictated our workflow. They were often the foundation upon which we built. Knowing that, it impresses me all the more that the music flows as organically as it does. Al Hifi is a one-of-a-kind artist, a hilarious yet deep songwriter and videographer. He was a great influence on me in our formative days, and it\u2019s a delight to reunite artistically.",

  "Avocadish is the Midwest's first all-avocado bar. We are opening up our first location in Dinkytown, Minneapolis early 2020. Check out our recent press coverage from Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal, City Pages and The Minnesota Daily\u00a0 Explore our website and follow us on Instagram to see special events and menu creation.\u00a0\u00a0 Our concept is growing fast. With rising community interest & growing social media following, Avocadish has been approached with multiple proposals beyond our first two location openings. We have spent the last twelve months crafting our dream in its natural, authentic state, and turning down outside investments that would compromise that. We have the consumer buzz, capability, passion & drive to succeed, but need capital for a successful explosive growth. \u00a0Every dollar we raise from the support of this Kickstarter community would help our mission to fuel community wellness and promote positivity with nutritionally dense and accessible avocado dishes. Additionally, our head chef, Lyd\u00e9 Heckroodt, is based in South Africa. While she is the culinary inspiration behind our company, she is also a native and professional kitesurfer with a family, partner and career in Cape Town. Lyd\u00e9 travels to the United States for weeks at a time to develop Avocadish, which tends to be costly. With your support, we could fund these travels and make it possible for our chef to be as involved to the fullest degree. Our highly anticipated first location is opening in January 2020 in Dinkytown. Located in the up and coming University Food Hall, it will feature counter service, shared seating space, and a To-Go window for easy access for online orders and delivery services. The menu will feature nourishing and customizable breakfast, lunch and dinner dishes as well as crave-worthy late night bites. Our second location is opening in 2020 in Downtown Minneapolis. As the project develops, our team will share its progression. \u00a0 Our ingredients are simple, straight-forward foods, building innovative flavors and wholesome dishes centered around the avocado. Our concept hinges on our guest's elevated experience through: convenience, personalization, transparency and collaboration / digital media.\u00a0 Avocadish is a movement centered around the belief that a healthy lifestyle should be accessible, affordable, and appealing to all.\u00a0To maintain a movement, each location will have a tailored and wholesome menu to fit the needs of that community. For example, our late night menu will be exclusive to locations serving college campuses.\u00a0 The common thread through all of our locations is our commitment to our values: \u00a0In July 2018, Alex Varouhas met Lyd\u00e9 Heckroodt on a bus in Portugal. They built the foundation of their friendship while conversing about a mutual obsession: avocados!\u00a0 The following October, Lyd\u00e9 flew out to the United States for the first time and for five weeks, she and Alex worked together to create an all-avocado menu. Today, they now lead Avocadish, not only an avocado bar, but also a movement centered around the belief that a healthy lifestyle should be accessible, affordable, and appealing to all.\u00a0 ALEX VAROUHAS\u00a0 Alex arrived in Minnesota from Seattle at the age of 22 with very little: He was a former professional gamer, turned high school dropout. Minnesota gave him an opportunity to work hard and pursue higher education.\u00a0He eventually received a business degree from the University of Minnesota: Carlson School of Management. Upon graduation in 2016, he pursued a new chapter away and would spend the next two years deeply missing Minnesota. Wanting to return, he focused on making positive changes in his life by eating healthier, doing yoga daily, and traveling more. During this time he began to appreciate the nutritional content and versatility of the avocado. Then in August 2018, he became consumed about the idea of a movement and avocado bar centered around sharing his experience with mindful living. He has been running with the dream since. LYD\u00c9 HECKROODT\u00a0\u00a0 A native to Cape Town, South Africa, Lyd\u00e9's two lifelong passions are waves and food. By the age of 9, she started surfing and soon graduated to kitesurfing, which she now does professionally. Her father\u2019s struggle with a lifelong illness familiarized her with a pure and raw diet as a child. Her passion for cooking has grown as she\u2019s sought out a variety of foods that support a competitive athlete\u2019s lifestyle. Avocados have become a daily staple in her diet due to the high nutrition and fuel they provide. Taking her years of experience with cooking and development of her own cuisine, Lyd\u00e9 has composed a truly unprecedented menu founded entirely around the avocado. The menu is a pure portrayal of her focus on health and wellness and the taste of guilt-free indulgence.\u00a0 We are committed to the betterment of our community and we believe that each of us are like ingredients; best when fused together in harmony to create something brand new. The whole, as they say, is greater than the sum of its parts. We exist to foster and build communities of people who encourage one another to change the world. Our goal is for our guests, employees, and everyone who interacts with us to feel a sense of belonging, recognize their why, and run with it. We look forward to serving you!\u00a0\ud83e\udd51",
  "The main intention of this redemptive mission is twofold: the creation of a neighborhood coffeehouse, and through it, the establishment of a leadership development program. The program consists of three intermediate objectives and one final objective. The three intermediate objectives are Hard Skill Training, Soft-Skill Training, and Holistic Assessment. We will teach them teamwork, problem-solving, time management, and more. Lastly, we will address the mental, emotional, and spiritual health needs of our employees. This includes life coaching centered on addressing all aspects of their personal well-being. This will enable our trainees to arrive at the final objective of developing a solid skillset, becoming well rounded and self-sufficient, to the point that they are able to transition to long-term, sustainable employment. Rail//Line Coffee is a work of Community Leadership and Development Inc. to reclaim, restore, and promote community renewal. It will serve as a neighborhood coffeehouse to which locals can come, enjoy coffee, and grow their relationships. We will employ at-risk youth and women from within the community. Due to the nature of our community, most of our trainees do not drive, which makes our location and mission unique. As we live and serve in South Billings, we understand the lack of economic opportunities that currently exist south of the tracks. It is our hope and goal that Rail//Line Coffee will function not only as an impetus for economic growth and stability, but also provide a practical job and leadership training program teens and women will find advantageous for furthering their own personal growth and employment opportunities. \u2018South Billings\u2019 is generally recognized as the area hemmed by rail lines running east-west through downtown; from there, south to Interstate 90, and bordered on the east and west by Interstate exits forming a distinct area of demarcation. It is home to the City/County Jail, the Montana State Women\u2019s Prison, the Yellowstone County Youth Detention Center, and Probation/Parole Offices; CLDI recognizes that it is also home to over 9,000 persons, primarily families. The population is unique with a distinct community identity, and is arguably one of our state\u2019s most ethnically diverse communities. While Montana is 89% Caucasian, South Billings is comprised of 27% Native American, 25% Hispanic, 8% African American and 40% Caucasian individuals. These families are served by three elementary schools plus a middle school, all of which have Title I designation.\u00a0 According to US Census data (2010), the two primary census tracts where our clients are located (Billings\u2019 tract #9.02 and tract #3.0), the median family income is $29,000 and $25,000 respectively. The median family income for the entire zip-code (59101) measures $42,986, which shows a great disparity in finances for those served by our programs. As many as 69% of these persons rent the spaces where they live compared to a city-wide ratio of just 37% rental occupancy. CLDI is a faith-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has been working since 1981 to invest in and foster transformation in Billings\u2019 oldest and most marginalized community, the South Side. Our mission is to seek transformation through the gospel by rebuilding lives, restoring families, and re-neighboring communities. Our work has included: job-skill training for men coming out of prison; building and offering quality, affordable housing to persons in need; life-skill training and development for older teenagers and adults in order to help advance career opportunities; work with pregnant and parenting mothers to counsel them, as well as providing transitional housing to women exiting incarceration and drug abuse; and lastly, staff and volunteers to work with at-risk youth, family members, partner organizations, and schools serving the South Side. A core belief of CLDI is that all people have Imago Dei, meaning they have been created in the image of God, therefore, all people have intrinsic value and worth. Driven by this belief, CLDI intentionally engages those we serve in relationship to emphasize dignity, hope, and cast vision for living life to one\u2019s fullest potential. We believe that through this relational investment, change is obtainable and that such change will greatly impact individuals and families, thus, communities and the city as a whole. Mission Statement \u2013 We aim to stimulate economic growth on the South Side and provide a strategic work and leadership development program for at-risk teenagers and women. Core Values: Rail//Line Coffee will serve the South Side of Billings as a neighborhood coffeehouse. Within its walls, we will employ at-risk youth and women. Each employee will participate in an employment and leadership development program constructed by management. This program will serve several objectives such as providing meaningful employment, higher-wage paying jobs, skill development, and holistic coaching for the purpose of self-sustained employment elsewhere down the road. Our youth truly desire to be involved in the mission of CLDI, and to employ them as part of Rail//Line Coffee would provide great opportunities to encourage their growth and development. This redemptive mission model can serve as a bridge between our various works, such as Youth Works (our program to serve at-risk youth) and the Hannah House (a sober home for women stepping out of addiction and to be reunited with their children) by providing an avenue of employment and job training opportunities that will not only enhance the individual, but the community as a whole. By providing intentional leadership development and job skill training for some of the women and youth we serve, it will provide real hands-on experience in business development and management, paving the way for higher-paying wages upon graduation from the leadership program. Additionally, the building is located in a highly visible and accessible area, as 1st Avenue South serves as a central vein for those commuting throughout the various parts of the city. With the ability to include a drive-through into the building design, along with our goal to fully fund the renovation and first-year operating costs of the project, this is a redemptive mission model that has every opportunity to not only be sustainable, but lucrative. CLDI has a reputation for undertaking projects that are not only challenging but also complicated. Due to location and local history of the gas station, one outcome will be a greater connection to the community through the provision of a local neighborhood space and aligns with the ministry and work we engage in, to restore and transform our community. We will evaluate the success of our project\u2019s objectives through a specific set of performance measures. Our first performance measure will be the financial viability of Rail//Line Coffee. We will measure our profit vs. loss and get an understanding to how well we are doing economically. This will provide insight into ways we can continue to save money, steward it wisely, or grow the program even more. If the coffeehouse begins to lose profit we will reevaluate and identify avenues so that we may continue the program. If Rail//Line Coffee is growing its profits, we will then look for ways to bring on more individuals or utilize our income supporting CLDI programs. The second performance measure of Rail//Line Coffee will be a measure of how well the job and leadership development program is working for the individuals who are participating. This will be measured through employee assessments. Each assessment will cover the employee\u2019s performance as well as provide a means to evaluate their supervisors. It will look for ways to improve the system, ways to help them individually, and ways the managers can lead better. Leadership within Rail//Line Coffee will also fill out personal and employee assessments. These assessments will help employees learn their strengths and shore up weaknesses. It will also help the managers learn where they can do better professionally. \u00a0If necessary, the program will be adjusted to become more efficient. Lastly, our final performance measure will investigate the number of graduates from the job development program who have found employment within a new business elsewhere. Through this, we will get quantitative data behind the actual number of graduates currently employed outside CLDI. Furthermore, we will follow up and collect qualitative data from employers and graduates of how their skills are being utilized and whether they see success from the program. This information will be gathered by tracking our trainees after they have graduated and have obtained long-term sustainable employment. These external assessments will be collected and combined into a quarterly report to be used as an evaluation tool by Rail//Line Coffee\u2019s leadership. We have established three intermediate goals and one overarching goal of our job development program. In no particular order, our first goal of success is the hard-skill training goal. We aim to teach our trainees how to be a successful barista when it comes to drink making, using espresso machines, cash management, using a point-of-sale computer, customer service, and more. This goal will be reached through the hands-on work our employees will do every day. The second goal we have established is our soft-skill training goal. This involves time management, interpersonal skills, communication training, problem-solving, teamwork, etc. Through successfully meeting this goal we will enable our employees the ability to work beyond coffee bars, as these skills translate to any job. Our third goal is to holistically assess and address our employee\u2019s emotional, mental, and spiritual needs as they progress through the program. Through periodic evaluations, we will determine if external assistance is needed, such as counseling or other interventions. Through this, we are able to identify and address any destructive habits and enable our employees to make and embrace healthy decision making. Our end goal for the job and leadership development program is that each graduate will have been coached and mentored with dignity and honor, training them to their own strengths and skill set, rounding them physically, emotionally, and mentality, to the point where they are self-sustainable and able to launch into the workforce. Our Pro Forma encapsulates our project\u2019s total costs including the land purchase and soft, hard, and other costs. In total, our project will cost $867,003. Again, we have already purchased the land and building. Hard Costs include site developments, building costs, building permits, and system development fees. This total will cost $429,789. Soft Costs include architectural/design/consulting, site analysis, civil engineering, and reimbursables. This total will cost $43,080. Other Costs include a cash contingency, real estate taxes, and insurance, title &/or builders risk. This will cost $45,134. We have set our total Business Start-Up Costs at $219,000. This includes furniture and d\u00e9cor, equipment, signage and drive-through menus, and our start-up operational costs. We are anticipating a monthly expense average of $11,329. Our estimated sales are $1,000 per day, which we anticipate being on par with the slower season of the business. This brings our monthly total income to $24,000. Subtracting our cost of goods sold, set at 30%, our monthly gross profit becomes $16,800. Finally, removing our total expenses from our gross profit, we project an average monthly net profit of $5,471, bringing the annual net profit to $65,652.",
  "Chef Marc, chef of Renaissance Caf\u00e9, started as a small chef providing meals for friends and family. Chef Marc has grown up around cooking and restaurants his entire life. He remembers his father making the best meals, particularly around the holidays. He can still remember when his talent for making something with limited ingredients clicked. He was living in France and he wanted a thanksgiving meal. He was able to make an entire meal without the use of a recipe. He spent the next 10 years working in various restaurants and bakeries learning the skills it took to run a business. His pride and joy, however, came from a yearly tradition where 20 of his friends would rent a cabin and he would be the live-in chef for the week. He loved the memories they all made as they ate great food and they all liked that it only cost $20 a person for an enormous amount of food. Chef Marc knew that he could provide the same amount of joy to anyone that sampled his cooking. His flair and creativeness still runs throughout his cooking and he truly believes that the devil is in the details. His first deli job was at the Draper Historic Theatre. Chef Marc finds in funny that his first caf\u00e9 will be at the same location he started learning about the art of cooking. As a start-up company, Renaissance Caf\u00e9 will provide brunch items, soups and salads, sandwiches, and boxed dinners catering to the busy homemaker of Salt Lake City. The Draper Historic Theatre has always been a hidden jewel in the heart of Draper City, Utah. With a jewel such as this, a delicate caf\u00e9 would be the icing on the cake. A caf\u00e9 would also benefit the theatre for concessions and events such as dinner theatre. Having this caf\u00e9 will cater to the following: \u00b7 Clientele of the theatre. \u00b7 Draper community, homemakers, and workers around the rapidly growing city of Draper \u00b7 Busy Homemakers including working moms and dads Right now is the perfect time to start up as the holiday season begins to make its time-consuming way into the lives of the projected clientele. Having easy and affordable meals available during the busiest part of the days is exactly what everyone is looking for, whether they want a quick stay, passing by or a comfortable area to sit and relax for a few minutes. Renaissance Caf\u00e9 can provide exactly what clients are looking for. Renaissance Caf\u00e9 believes that every meal is a gift and in doing so, each meal (To Go) will be boxed and tied with ribbon. Carry out bags will look like gift bags, making every dining experience a gift. With the few caf\u00e9s that sparsely populate Draper City, Renaissance Caf\u00e9 will join the few already seasoned restaurants in the area. Our biggest gain is the theatre goers that attend the theatre every weekend. The expansion to the theatre concession menu will start of the Caf\u00e9 clientele strong and stable. Profitability will follow the rule of all business. We presume the equation will be as follows: Labor 30%- Food and supplies 30%- rent, insurance, ect 20%- profit 20%. With expected low start up costs, profitability is expected end of 2nd quarter. Start up costs are expected to be under $45,000. The caf\u00e9 will have 20 indoor seats, (with outdoor not included), income is expected to be 21,600 per month. What makes us unique is that we are working with the Draper Historic Theatre( A 501c nonprofit organization) to mutually benefit each other in providing clientele and with the projected economic growth in Draper of 41.4% , the need for a caf\u00e9 is unanimously needed for the heart of draper.",

My mother Alice Papillion was big on helping others and making them happy through the sweets she so loved to bake.\u00a0 So\u00a0I started baking \u00a0full time out of my home. The word spread fast and success soon followed. I went from one store to 10 in 1 month! It was amazing how much joy a simple cookie brought to my wholesale customers, but most importantly, their customers. I was beyond shocked because never in a million years would I have thought. Something that I baked that me and my mother shared would bring so many people so much happiness.\u00a0 Where is Alice P is now ready to take her place in the baking world.

And if I can reward people with cookies and other desserts in exchange for their support, everyone wins.\u00a0 I am turning to Kickstarter not only as a way to help fund opening my business, but as a way to build something wonderful and delicious - an incredible new cookie and dessert community in Lake Charles, La. A place where after i get the\u00a0business situated in the new space, for the first time ever, Where is Alice P cookies and desserts will be directly available to the general public once again.\u00a0The way they were meant to be, warm fresh out the oven and made to order.\u00a0 Kickstarter funds will be used to help complete any construction I may need once in the building. \u00a0The funds will also go towards start-up capital to help me grow from a \"one woman show\" into a full scale establishment with real employees. Also it will help with start up supplies and equipment.\u00a0 My goals are sweet & simple. I want to build beautiful long lasting relationships with my supporters and become an integral part of the growing artisanal community that is putting Lake Charles on the map as one of the most vibrant, exciting retirement and delicious food destinations in the world. Along the way, it wouldn't hurt to try and make the world a better place one big chewy cookie or one delicious slice of decadent dessert at a time.

  "The idea behind +BLUE (More Blue or Mais Blue in portuguese) began when I sang for Caetano Veloso in 2012. His song \"A Little More Blue,\" which he wrote and recorded while in exile in 1971, became a staple in my performances and inspired a collection of new original songs that pull from my own experience of leaving home and belonging.\u00a0 The sounds of vintage tropicalismo, jazz, samba, and soul, plus a trace of modern elements are the backbone for 8 new compositions and 3 selected covers that make up the album. They are my immigrant love letters to Brazil and to other artists before me who left Brazil, like Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, and Carmen Miranda. A special nod also goes to influential groups from the 70\u2019s like Os Mutantes and Os Novos Baianos.\u00a0 Here's \"Ladeira Da Pra\u00e7a\" by Os Novos Baianos. I blended their samba with a Motown groove! I reharmonized Caetano\u2019s melancholy cry for his country, \"A Little More Blue,\" and recorded it with a modern jazz/blues production. Check out the Os Mutantes inspired psychedelic final verse of the song. The album title, +Blue, was born of this song\u2019s title.  In the samba-funk song \u201cPois \u00c9 E Tal\u201d (So It Is And Such), the ambiguities of \u201cwhere is home\u201d can be resolved at the ubiquitous crossroads where Exu is called upon to point the way.  \u201cGuerreira Vai\u201d (roughly translated to \"you go girl!\" :-) fuses bai\u00e3o and 70\u2019s funk as a backdrop to a magical story starring Roberto Carlos, Gal Costa, and my \"patron saints\u201d Carmen Miranda and Caetano Veloso. Here's a bit of the demo: \u201cSouth American Way,\u201d made popular in the 30\u2019s by Carmen Miranda is re-imagined as a lamenting ballad with jazz, samba, and electronic elements. \"We Belong Here,\" with the energy of a 70's samba from Jorge Ben or vintageSergio Mendes, takes you on the back and forth of my upbringing between S\u00e3o Paulo and Chicago...and where ever you land, well that's where you belong!\u00a0 The samba, \"Quando Me Desamericanisar\" (when I dis-americanize) is my answer to Carmen Miranda's \"Disseram Que Voltei Americanizada\" and pokes fun at my expense of trying to re-acclimate to Brazil after a long absence.\u00a0 Reminiscent of Baden Powell & Vinicius de Moraes' Afro Sambas, \"Sangue Da Terra\" (Blood Of The Land) traces the immigrant story and the ever pulsing blood of the homeland. Check out the demo: After giving Kickstarter their percentage, the remaining funds will go toward recording, post production, manufacturing, and getting the CD and rewards to you. If by chance your generosity exceeds the pledge amount, I'll use the added funds to hire a PR team to promote the release. That would be amazing! I have lots of stuff planned and lined up to feed you with content during the 30 days, so stay close, check in often and let's be in touch! Beijos!!",
  "WOW!\u00a0You guys are awesome. In just 17 days, we've made our goal. The kids will make a new DVD, and thanks to you a sound studio for the community is becoming a reality for future Ladakhi music projects. Haven't pledged yet?\u00a0It's not too late to make an impact. Help us\u00a0meet our stretch goal for an additional $2,899.\u00a0Together\u00a0we can really improve the collaborative production experience for the students and professionalize the studio for future community projects. For every pledge that moves us closer to the $10,600 mark, we can apply the funds for buying\u00a0an LCD monitor ($900 USD) and a 27\u201d iMac ($1,999 USD).\u00a0This additional purchase would\u00a0enable students to work alongside our video mentor in the control room and maximize computer time for interested young people. If you are just hearing about the project this is a great way to pitch in.\u00a0Students can use it not only for their DVD creation, but local musicians can use the iMac for editing and adding to a digital archive of the stories told in Ladakhi song cycles. This archive will become a vital part of our LAMO-Siddhartha School Studio Library, created by the local community for generations to come. On behalf of the children and staff of Siddhartha School and LAMO, we are filled with gratitude for your kind support, sharing and good wishes! Jullay! Laura and Tenzin Dhasey ----------------------------- We areSiddhartha School, a rural school in the Himalayan region of northern India called Ladakh. Through continued partnership with the Ladakh Arts and Media Organization (LAMO), we seek to provide our students with new opportunities to learn traditional and modern forms of Ladakhi music\u00a0by bringing back a six-week music camp for interested children. Last year's camp was a great success and the children made a wonderful DVD of their songs for backers and for world music fans everywhere.\u00a0This year we'd like to prepare them for a weekend of live performances on LAMO's outdoor stage,\u00a0so they can share their music with the local community and help them gain confidence for recording sessions culminating in a new DVD.\nWhat's more, this year we will involve our students more in the recording and production of their new DVD product, challenging them to learn more about the media arts entailed in creating their own recording.  Ladakhi music is an amalgamation of many influences \u2013 located as it is on the crossroads of high Asia. It has taken from other cultures but retains a special sound all its own. Curious? Listen to an excerpt from a PRX documentary on Ladakhi music by Conor Gilles, a\u00a0Siddhartha School intern, and local musicians. \u00a0Why have a music camp and why make a DVD? At our school we strive to offer a sensitive curriculum that honors our rich traditions and life ways.  We find traditional music and song cycles are being forgotten as new forms of media take over people\u2019s lives and children have no venues to engage with the past, as Ladakhi art forms are seldom taught in schools. \u00a0We've found that when our kids are given the chance to meet local artists and musicians, they are left wanting more. They want to learn by playing and mastering the forms under the guidance of real performers. We'd like to give them that chance again this year, and build on our prior success by engaging them in the production process with LAMO and videographers, graphic designers, and sound editors. Our children are eager to work with local musicians and the professional media staff at LAMO, our partner in this meaningful project. Will you join us? The Basics: Our first goal is to create a six week music camp for 30 students as an extracurricular activity, encouraging the children to build on skills they've been honing in traditional music and contemporary song writing. Thanks to a generous foundation grant, we already have the funding necessary for this year's musicians' salaries and additional instruments. We are confident the students will grow and improve musically with this year's instruction. Our second goal is to build on last year\u2019s success and this year's project by improving the quality of our product and the experience for the children engaged.\u00a0We\u2019d like to get the children more involved this year in the creation of the DVD, from the graphic design of the packaging to the scripting and editing of the product so that they have a greater engagement with and ownership of the project. We are asking for backers to invest in the equipment and mentorship/training for the DVD production. Your contributions will enable us to purchase computer, camera, and audio equipment that will become a part of the LAMO-Siddhartha School Sound Studio, so that it can be utilized by artists and young people from the greater Leh area and inspire other schools to work with LAMO on similar projects. We estimate the costs for these basic tools to total $7,225 with a negotiated education discount. The remaining funds ($475 approximately) will supplement our workshop budget for media professionals to mentor our students on the recording equipment, video editing software, and graphic design applications necessary for producing their DVD. Music Matters: Together we can kickstart a rich music and media experience for the young people of Siddhartha School and generations of youth from the area in the coming years. And as the students work with LAMO and local artists, they are challenged to create a product for you of increased professional quality. This builds confidence and pride, instilling a message that they can create work valued by an international audience.\n The impacts of this investment will be far reaching. By serving as a community resource for local musicians as well as those with an interest, the sound studio will enable countless performances so that everyone in the community can share in the music. Thank you for thinking of us and Jullay!",

  "After a very difficult year, we're finally finishing up the recording process for our second album! Although the pandemic crushed our touring plans for 2020, Melody was able to focus on her songwriting, and the songs that were created during this time speak for themselves. There's a little more pop influence in the album overall, compared to our last release, but don't worry... there's still rock in there! It's been amazing working with Will Turpin (of Collective Soul) as producer, and in our opinions, there isn't a bad or weak song on the entire album. We honestly couldn't be more proud of it! While we've managed the cost of recording the album, we need your help with paying for the album release and marketing. We want all of our marketing materials to be professionally created and promoted, and this is a very expensive endeavor to undertake. Your contributions will be budgeted as follows: $5,000 Goal $500 - Principle Photography Session $1,000 - Video marketing for all singles $1,500 - Hard costs for production of promotional materials (Merchandising) $2,000 - \u00a0Graphic Design for promotional materials, singles and full album Any contributions above our $5,000 goal will help to create *MUSIC VIDEOS* and additional album/brand promotions!

  "\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy2fUmeTmyQ\u00a0 Just a look at what we do! Thanks so much Joe!!! More than 18 years ago I started on my culinary journey.\u00a0 My mission was to gain a diverse experience working in some of the best restaurants. \u00a0During my journey, I ventured to Maui, where I learned local dishes and preparations. \u00a0 During my time on the island I worked along side Chef Raul Bermudez, a very well known and talented chef where I learned dishes from his family and it thought me how important family meals are with love ones... It was around that time that I embraced the name and the creation of Viola and Agnes' Cafe evolved.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The dream I had on the islands has come true for me and my family in a way I could have never imagined! Here is Nassau Bay Texas for the last 3 and a half years the crew and I have worked so hard to be a great neighborhood cafe for our surrounding community and we are asking for a bit of help to keep the dream going! \u00a0 I received information about a potential space available just around the way from us so that we can keep the business right here in Nassau Bay where we feel it should be. I gathered my savings and investments, and I applied for a small SBA loan to cover the cost of unlocking the doors.\u00a0 Although excited, reality kicked in very fast. Nothing in the building was reusable.\u00a0 The space needed a total and complete makeover, all the old equipment and furnishings had to be removed\u2013 literally EVERYTHING! Accordingly, I have to start from scratch.\u00a0 The overwhelming number of changes and upgrades quickly blurred my vision of the beautiful family-owned restaurant that I always dreamed of; which is why I am reaching out to you on Kickstarter asking for your support. With your support and donations, Kickstarter will be used to purchase necessary kitchen equipment and will help \u201cbring life\u201d to the dining space by adding art, tiles and good ole southern charm to the space.\u00a0\u00a0Many prayers have made my dream a reality by bringing my exciting new restaurant to Nassau Bay\u00a0 But, it takes a community to raise a restaurant, which is why I need your help in order to bring the best new restaurant to Nassau Bay Tx. Help us reach $10,000 over our goal so we can get our outdoor seating ready for summer. Also to purchase our \"Soul 2 Go\" mobile! We have been thinking of doing our own togo delivery to the neighborhood so we can bring the food you love at the cafe directly to your door minutes after being garnished by chef! Without risk there are no rewards. Opening a restaurant is risky. With over ten years of experiences in the restaurant industry, I have confidence in my ability to provide extraordinary food, professional service, and to build a restaurant where guests are ALWAYS welcomed. \n\u00a0 I understand the inherent challenges in opening a restaurant, such as: staffing, construction delays, funds and many minor issues that can easily become major. However, I am confident that I will diligently work hard to ensure goals are timely met. I will also communicate in a timely manner any and all accomplishments and/or pitfalls.",
  "There is a big problem, restaurants are failing to take advantage of technology, which means ordering from a restaurant currently involves higher food costs, long wait times for the food preparation, inconsistent quality made by staff mistakes, and very high risk of accidents in the kitchen causing cuts and burns to the chefs and cooks. \u00a0We want to solve all of these problems this is why we are introducing the robot chef into the market, Our robot can prepare and cook the food faster than any other human chef. MiFood is a company that provides automation and robotization services for restaurants. With the aim of reducing the production cost and preparation time of each restaurant dish. In addition to reducing the risk of workplace accidents for restaurant workers. We currently provide our services to more than 200 restaurants and our goal is to create our own restaurant franchise.\u00a0\u00a0 Our company targets the food industry, specifically a worldwide restaurant market of over 2,4 billion EUR. Spain has more than 300,000 restaurants and the number increases each year. With thousands of potential franchises and existing restaurants as potential customers, the market potential is global. MiFood launched its robots in Madrid, followed by other major cities in Spain. At the moment we count with more than 200 restaurants using our services, we expect to reach 5.000 restaurants by the end of 2021. There are many companies willing to purchase a company like ours, big restaurant chains like McDonalds, Burguer King, in order to adquire a technology that reduces the staff cost by 70%. Food delivery companies like Just Eat, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero are building their own cloud ktichens and they would like to purchase our company as well because this will bring them the possibility of having their own automated and robotizated kitchens in order to sell their own products directly to the consumers without the need of an external restaurant. The chefs are suffering workplace accidents and we must end it. Our company has developed a technology capable to replace human chefs with robot chefs. We are raising 300.000\u20ac to complete the automation and robotization of the restaurant industry in order to reduce the food price, preparation time and the risk of workplace accidents. The funds in this investment round include building and then selling MiFood robot technology to existing restaurants to automate their preparation and cooking processes in the kitchen and, especially, designing our fully automated restaurant chain with the MiFood robot for our own franchise purposes. Future funds will be needed to complete the design of said kitchen and to cover the robot's material costs, design a restaurant to be used as a model for franchises, menu expansion and future robot improvements. Other costs include food for testing and other supplies for our robotic restaurant. I\u2019m a computer engineer based in Madrid who has been studying robotics at the faculty since earning my degree.\nWe have worked on multiple successful startups, one of them developed a software platform for farmers and cattlemen to sell their products online.

  "This project is Tony G Van Pelt to create the DEPTHS of Madness documovie based on true historical events. This story is about the real life 1824 Fall Creek Massacre in Madison County, Indiana. Documenting the historical events of the senseless brutal and bloody massacre of 9 Native American Indians-2 men. 3 women (1 squaw left for 3 days before she succumbed to her injuries while others walked by her...only to 'disregard' her because of the color of HER skin), and 4 children-2 girls & 2 boys. This movie gives the cries of the Innocent their Voice. Tony G Van Pelt is my amazingly loving husband of 21+ years. He is the writer and creator of this documovie. He is also the artist of the cover photo from one of his own dark moments when he was in great pain and wasn't being heard. Once my husband learned the details of this Dark Night moment in Indiana's AND humanity's history, he has been driven by these Voices to tell this story. He is Clear that he MUST do this, because he does NOT walk away from helping the Innocent! I am so grateful to his passion and love to not only allow these Voices a microphone and stage to tell Their story, but also for them to finally FEEL Heard! How many of us have a longing to be Heard in our darkest of moments? This is how You too can be Heard!",
  "Hi friends! I am recording the audio of my piece, Lost Children, for release on an album. Lost Children is an hour-length ballet-operetta about five children trapped in a nightmarish fairytale world. This is one of my favorite pieces that I've ever written and I am very proud of it. It's written for narrator, four vocalists, six instrumentalists, dancers, and film.This audio recording will allow me to pitch the piece more effectively to dance companies and allow for more future performances of the work. By donating to this kickstarter, you are helping to pay the fabulous musicians who will be playing this piece for the recording. They are all lovely, talented musicians and I'm very excited for the opportunity to pay them for their hard work - particularly after such a challenging year for performing artists due to the pandemic. This project will be recorded in August 2021. The album will be released on all streaming platforms and hard copy by the end of 2021. Thank you so much for being a part of this!",

The way Tashfeen handles the bully and the tragedy that occurs sparks interest in his faith of Islam among the students and faculty at his school.

  "My name is Evan Vang. \u00a0I am the oldest brother of 10 Children. \u00a0I have 3 sisters and 6 brothers. \u00a0I am a father of 3 girls and soon to be husband of the beautiful and incredible lady Nicci Maggard.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My father and family are Hmong refugees from Laos following the Vietnam war. \u00a0They arrived in the United States in the late 70's shortly after the story of our family would begin.\u00a0My father met my mother in late 1979 early 1980 and I was born August of 1980. We are the Vang's as I know them. Our mother God bless her and everything she did for us in the beginning but had her hands too full. Clinically she was with bi-polar disorder and mild schizophrenia. \u00a0She did the best she could but in the end our father was the only parent to raise all these kids for years. As children in this home we did not have a lot but found comfort in certain foods my father would prepare. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0On the weekends my father and mother would either take us to the Farm Fresh Grocery to pick out or just show up with donuts. These weekend breakfast moments were priceless for us kids. \u00a0Sometimes my father would really make us happy and prepare sticky rice and his famous rice wrapper fried spring rolls. \u00a0We didn't have a lot of money growing up so whenever he had the extra money and time away from work he would make these incredible treats in a large pile. \u00a0Soon our neighborhood friends and their parents would find out about these Hmong rolls with sides of sticky rice and they would remain legendary to them until this day.\u00a0 So what is Kung Food Kitchen Experiment. The name comes from my father's love of old Kung Fu movies and my love of cooking. In Kung Fu and in cooking there are many different styles and techniques that can used alone or combined to create something extraordinary. \u00a0The Vang Roll is my interpretation of my father's rolls and is named to pay homage to my family. \u00a0\u00a0A Vang roll on the outside can be seen as a spring roll or lumpia but the insides are what make them different. \u00a0They are filled with fresh ground pork, rice noodles, carrots, cabbage, green onion, yellow onion, celery, Sriracha, black pepper, garlic powder, and soy sauce. \u00a0 The goal of Kung Food Kitchen Experiment is to make simple and incredible comfort foods from all over. \u00a0To experiment with cross culture fusions, new dishes all together, or \u00a0a traditional take on a dish that we hope to make more popular like Congee. \u00a0The culture I would like to have in our business is a creative food culture where cooks young and old can try new ideas. \u00a0Whether we fail or succeed on a recipe we are moving in a forward direction. The dynamic of the business will not be a full service restaurant but more fast casual with area to eat and gather. \u00a0I want to be part of the change in kitchen culture and compensation as Danny Meyer sees it. \u00a0I want to build my team up with ongoing education and make sure there is a next step for them whether with our company or their own leap of faith. We want to support them wholeheartedly.\u00a0The Big Vision/Dream is that Kung Food Kitchen Experiment expands to multiple locations in different states and becomes the creative arm to other concepts on the horizon. \u00a0 So how did I get here. \u00a0Originally I had started this idea about 9 years ago. \u00a0I was rolling upwards of 600-900 Vang rolls a week. \u00a0I was overwhelmed with it back then and the focus was not there to continue with a new job I had started. For 7 months I rolled upwards of 700 a week until I eventually put the idea to rest. This past summer my beautiful and amazing Nicci was concerned I would be out of work due to rain. \u00a0I work at an outside bar The Shack that is incredibly busy all of the time unless it rains. She was convinced from the forecast it was going to rain for 15 days straight.\u00a0So I tried looking for a second job but I also thought I would try and bring Kung Food Kitchen back to life. Within a few days I had 1600 rolls worth of orders for friends and family. \u00a0Fast forward to today I am working out of a catering kitchen and we are just over 30k Vang rolls eaten. \u00a0The number of dumplings and chili beef wontons are somewhere around 5-6 thousand but I have lost count. \u00a0A friend of mine asked me to think about doing a Pop-Up from her Beer bar. \u00a0I had never done a Pop-up before but figured why not. \u00a0I love cooking for friends and family this would give me an outlet to do this on a much larger scale than my home. The Pop-up would also give me the opportunity to cook \u00a0recipes new and old rather than just the rolls, dumplings, and wontons. \u00a0With the most incredible load of stress and anxiety in the lead up to and the beginning of the Pop-up it was a complete success. \u00a0We had over 150 people show up between 12pm and 8pm that day. We sold out. We have now done 2 more Pop-ups since and have 3 more on the books and more to follow.\u00a0 What originally came from necessity and concern over supporting my family has taken on its own life. From post after post the web of people that enjoy our food and rolls has continued to grow. \u00a0Eventually my brother would take some of my rolls to Buxton, NC about a 3 hour drive from Virginia Beach. \u00a0He brought them to a local bar and had given them away. \u00a0Shortly afterwards I would be bringing my products in mass to the awesome people of Buxton, NC. \u00a0\u00a0I love to cook for people and this also is a largest part of the experiment. \u00a0For years I loved to invite friends and family over and enjoy great food and drinks. These days when we would get together we would always try different dishes. I was always curious to attempt new recipes or putting spins on old ones. \u00a0For the past 9 years this has been essentially a bi-weekly thing. Bringing friends and family together over a meal and drinks is always a positive situation. \u00a0The great thing about the Pop-up is that I am able to bring a larger group of people together from all walks of life. \u00a0A true melting pot of good people, foodies, friends, and family. We will always have that common thing we all share no matter and that is the love of great food and the sense of belonging. That is the environment I will create in Kung Food Kitchen Experiment. \u00a0 Why the Kickstarter? I have reached a point where I need to purchase the kitchen I have been working out of and it will be shutting down within a month or two. \u00a0Where the Pop-ups have been busy and profitable I haven't been able to raise the capital necessary for purchase of catering company and support my family at the same time. \u00a0I am at a wall at this point where until I own the business and have a full time lease I am limited on how I can generate revenue.

  "This is a student thesis film, hence a low budget one. \u00a0I need to meet some basic costs on set - production cost. I tried to keep the production and the post production costs as small as possible. But it is there. The subject I choose, is based on a true story - presents a very cruel fact of our modern life - relevant and penetrating. I may not be an experienced film maker with a heavy filmography, but I am very passionate about what I am going to do.\u00a0 \u00a0If you like the storyline and\u00a0 stretch your hand a tiny bit to help me, to help my dreams to get realized, whatever the amount may be, it will make a huge\u00a0difference.",
  "THE FILM IS ABOUT two brothers and their best friend they've watched over for years who catch wind of a rich businessman\u2019s stash of money hidden at his house. From there the three decide to invade his home in the woods and attempt to rob him. From there, they find themselves stuck in a terrible situation that pushes their loyalty and their own morality. THERE\u2019S SOMETHING ROTTEN in this story, something we aren\u2019t telling you, something that shapes our characters destinies, and something that will tear them at the seems! Wouldn\u2019t you like to know what it is that ultimately commits them? THE STARS of the film are coming together, with just a few more roles to fill, that YOU can help with, our current lineup includes: \u00a0 \u00a0 THE REASON we are so gung-ho on making this film the right way? Well, we all believe the story is deserving of it being in the right locations, the right lighting, the right camera movement, the dramatic pacing, and the right actors to make it work. The Characters are so unique, but are they any more unique than any others out there hoping for the money to complete their project? Maybe, maybe not, but we do know that we have a fantastic team of people that are all deserving to see this put together properly and watch audiences like YOU enjoy them as much as we do! WE ARE a group of independent filmmakers that are incredibly passionate about intriguing films with great story-telling and we all have a vision for this film to appeal to both niche cinephiles as well as the casual viewer that is in need of a good visceral, emotional whirlwind of a ride! DIRECTOR\u2019S STATEMENT WHERE SLEEPING DOGS LIE is the journey of one long terribly tragic night. I believe these characters all have a specific reason for being part of this story, each one drives the nail in the coffin (so to speak) individually, not ever realizing how one single action is causing an adverse reaction. I\u2019m a big fan of films such as Rear Window, No Country For Old Men, Blue Ruin, and The Game. There is an emotional piece to these films that we as a viewer are completely able to see ourselves as one or many parts of each of these characters, which helps us to relate to the tragedy that befalls them. We are given a journey of puzzle pieces to put together, never knowing where the next clue will drop, or if it ever will. This story is truly about the emotional toll that a family member has on his brother that has the ability to rip every ounce of trust and love you had for that person, completely away. It is a tense situation, a test in loyalty, brotherhood and how to keep the puzzle pieces moving forward as the rest fall off around you and don\u2019t quite fit together. MY GOAL is for every viewer to be so entranced in these characters that their palms are sweaty, and they're literally sitting on the edge of their seats with a nervous excitement of \u201cwhat will happen next\u201d mentality. OUR TEAM AND OUR LOVE AND VISION for this project will drive us to make it the best possible film, but with YOUR HELP, we can ALL, TOGETHER make this film something that you can tell people for years to come you had a hand in and be forever engrained the history of this film.",
  "The One Caucasus Festival is an\u00a0International festival and long-term borderland program aimed at creating inspirational & safe space for meetings of young people from the Caucasus region.This year's festival in Tserakvi, Georgia will allow youth from the entire region to come together to celebrate with music and art. The driving force behind the festival is Polish human rights activist Witek Hebanowski who has done many major projects including starting the Human Rights Day International Letter Writing Marathon which has participants in 80 countries and generates over 2 million letters regarding human rights every year.\u00a0 I have cooperated with Witek on human rights projects since 1998. The funds raised by Kickstarter will go towards paying for the construction of the stage for the musical shows. My wife Pam Ikegami and I paid for the trip ourselves. We will be assisting with the general running of the festival. We also will be doing workshops on Human Rights, and if possible under primitive conditions doing some screenprinting right on the site.",

  "Carreg Lafar is a Welsh language folk/trad group, active in the Welsh trad music scene for nearly 20 years. The name means speaking stone or echo stone. Our blend of traditional and contemporary music, passionate and lively performances with dynamic vocals and instrumentals has changed many people's view of traditional Welsh music. The group presents a vibrant spirit with its roots in the language and living tradition of Welsh song and dance music. We've previously recorded 3 CDs with Welsh language record label Sain, but now we feel its time to have complete control over our recording, its creation and promotion.  It's nearly 20 years since we recorded our first album Ysbryd y Werin and it's 11 years since our third CD Profiad, where has the time gone! We are now in a position to record and start touring more regularly again, maybe even another tour of the US and Canada.  In 2013 we were able to make a 3 track EP, 'Y Cadno', but now we're keen and excited to make a full new album of Welsh traditional songs and tunes, as only Carreg Lafar can.\"Carreg Lafar treat Welsh traditional material with a freshness and a skill that deserves to be heard far and wide.\" fROOTS\u00a0 We would love you to be part of our new album, to help us raise the funds to record a whole new batch of great songs and tunes at a wonderful studio in Abergavenny, Stiwdio Felin Fach. The new album will have all the things people love about Carreg Lafar, \"a dense flurry of vocals, fiddle, pibgorn, flute and guitar\" But now we have a maturity that comes from many years of experience, profiad yw mam doethineb! experience is the mother of wisdom! Our new album will have all the drive and passion of our previous CDs but also encapsulate the lessons and wisdom gained form the last 20 years. To celebrate our 20th anniversary in 2015, we want to make this the best Carreg Lafar album yet, even better than Profiad, \"This is the most impressive album yet from Welsh band Carreg Lafar.....excellent arrangements make this stand out as one of the finest albums of Welsh music I have heard\" - Living Tradition. Welsh language songs, stunning vocals, harmonies, driving tunes and soulful airs will all be included, some songs and tunes that we've been playing around with for many years and some that we've just discovered. We already have some funds but not enough to hire the studio, record, mix, mastering, design work, new photographs and distribution. Please help to realise our dream, you can make a range of donations and everyone will receive a reward for your support and generosity of spirit.

  "My name is Rita Leydon and I want to invite you to share in a dream. I\u2019m a filmmaker and for the last dozen or so years I\u2019ve been documenting a variety of Swedish folk musicians, concentrating mostly on mature masters of the nyckelharpa and the fiddle in order to ensure that their repertoire and style of playing is safeguarded for future study. My desire is that students as well as lovers of Swedish folk music the world over will have access to authentic source material. This filmmaking effort is an exploration into the loam that holds my roots. This is the music I love, the music that speaks to my soul. So far, I\u2019ve produced nine documentaries which have cost me many thousands of dollars from which I have no expectation of financially recovering. Because my husband and I are now retired and no longer have as much disposable income as we once did, I fear that my strong desire and motivation to continue this important project is financially threatened. Trusting that the grass roots magic of a KickStarter campaign might be a solution to the challenge I now face, I\u2019m forging right ahead and planning a filming trip to Sweden from mid May to mid June this year. I have four fabulous musicians on board willing to subject themselves to a day of my ungainly intrusion:\u00a0Thore H\u00e4rdelin, fiddler from H\u00e4lsingland;Peter Puma Hedlund, nyckelharpa, tunes from Uppland and H\u00e4lsingland;Christer Wesstr\u00f6m also from Uppland, who plays the older silverbasharpa;\u00a0Pelle Bj\u00f6rnlert, a fiddler, who plays tunes from Sm\u00e5land and \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland My husband likens what I\u2019m doing to the work of Alan Lomax, the great American field collector of folk music. Perhaps, to a small degree. My appeal is for your participation in this dream by taking ownership with me and thus enabling me to continue to expand our archive of Swedish Folk Music Treasures. Keep in mind that there is no expectation of financial gain. This is strictly a labor of love. We ourselves, not to mention future generations, will all benefit from the continued documentation of our uniquely Swedish cultural treasure. Thank you very much for you help and support! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The $5000 that I am hoping to raise with this KickStarter campaign will help to defray upfront costs of my imminent filming trip to Sweden plus studio expenses related to the work, i.e. airfare to Sweden from USA, rental of a car while in Sweden, occasional lodging, miscellaneous software upgrades related to the film work, digital media for filming, etc. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Each of the samples in the video are from my own DVD films to which I own copyright.

  "It started when Mary McGeown owner of \u201857arts\u2019, a creative workspace in SE13 approached our stall at Brockley Market and asked if we'd like to take over her space for one month. The thought of getting involved in something with the community that we\u2019d come to love, made it an easy decision to make. We went about creating a vibrant foodie environment offering a creative tapas and natural wine menu alongside a deli and ingredients section, where customers could sample and learn about the ingredients they were enjoying so much. L\u2019Oculto was much loved by the locals and in December 2015 went permanent. L\u2019Oculto is considered by the locals as a true neighbourhood restaurant, a local gem and we consider all of our customers to be part of our extended family. With the help of this Kickstarter campaign, we want to not only continue to provide them with the kind of dining experience they truly deserve but also expand our offering by running regular cookery classes, tastings and events where we'll be inviting chefs and artisan producers over from Spain to share their knowledge with you. For all of this we need a bigger space. \u201cBest eating in venue in london\n- One of the best restaurants going in London with excellent organic foods and wine lists from small family estates throughout the spainish region and which is exquisite, delightful and can not wait for the new restaurant to open in brockley....well done\u2026.\u201d Luigi \u201cFabulous in every way - \u201cIt is always such a fabulous treat to return to the warm welcome at l\u2019oculto and we\u2019ve been delighted to bring friends and family and now our newborn son. Everything is of the highest possible quality. The food is unparalleled in its flavour, originality and quality, the service and wine never disappoint. We can\u2019t wait for the new venue to open too. Can\u2019t recommend highly enough. Thank you and keep on doing what you\u2019re doing!\u201d Msejs \u201cAn absolute gem! - \u201cWe ate here last night, the food is spot on, a small, seasonal menu sourced from producers the owners know personally and all of the highest quality, the service is spot on and you truly feel like you are in a restaurant in Spain not Lewisham! A real find and an absolute gem. If you can, GO! \u201c John \u201cSpain Comes to the Streets of Brockley -\n\u201cL'Oculto is, for my money, the best restaurant in the greater Brockley area. This is made more miraculous by the fact that it doesn't really have a kitchen, and that the team behind the counter is turning out superb tapas on a hotplate and little else. They rely on the best Spanish ingredients to make it authentic and delicious, and they deliver consistently great stuff.\u201d Marshall L\u2019Oculto holds a Certificate of Excellence for consistently earning great reviews. We have secured the lease on our second site and some of the works are already underway. We have big plans for this space and we\u2019re super excited about them, plans that we know our customers are going to love and the neighbourhood is going to benefit from as there is nothing similar in the area for our local residents to enjoy and be part of. - We are totally stripping out the interior of our new space including gutting, extending and rebuilding the kitchen with brand new equipment - you have no idea how much this means to us after working for three years in a kitchen space smaller than anyone can imagine and working off nothing more than an induction and an oven. The re-build will enable us to breath firstly but most importantly the space and new equipment means we\u2019ll be able to experiment more with ingredients and new dishes and ultimately creating exciting new menus for our customers.  - Not only are we creating a whole new kitchen area but we\u2019re taking down a wall and opening up the kitchen - this will enable us to not only create a connection between the chefs, the food and the customers but make cookery classes much more interactive.  - We want to transform the neglected back yard into a space that can be enjoyed by everyone, with an \u2018edible garden' growing plants and herbs for use in the kitchen and within our cookery classes. This means a costly rubbish clearance and garden design that makes the area fit for purpose. - Everyone that knows us knows how much this new venture means to us and how hard we\u2019ve worked to get to this stage. This is not a flashy refurb, that's just not us, its simply a matter of creating something special that we can share with the community, a place with heart, a place for everyone to enjoy and be a part of.  We have a tonne of exciting and enticing rewards to thank you for believing in us and being part of our journey. \nFrom a half day in the kitchen with our chefs, cooking with them, learning about different ingredients and techniques to a dining experience for up to 10 people with a paired drinks and tapas menu.\nTake a look below at just some of our rewards: Receive a Mini Merchandise Bundle - \u00a330 Receive one of our quality, branded L'Oculto aprons - \u00a345 A single ticket to our Kickstarter party.

  "The Peasant Sabbatical: The title says it all!\u00a0 I have spent most of my adult life traveling, studying, performing, and living the music in unlikely places at unlikely times. In the past I have had some financial support in the form of grants (studying with the Gypsies of Spain in Andalusia, or after the tragic war in the Balkans), but most times it has been without funding, often producing non-commercial music, on an absolute shoestring budget.   The \"Peasant Sabbatical\" is a CD is where acoustic 12-string guitar meets world music, with some help from other talented musicians, particularly on violin and acoustic bass.\u00a0 I also add instruments such as tamburitza, brac, prim, mando-cello, button accordion, and tambura. It is a project very dear to me, and perhaps my best work so far. This is the first project where I took great care to create a musical score for each song prior to recording.\u00a0 If the project is successful, I plan to offer a corresponding musical songbook as well. This will be my sixth CD project, and I have a history of producing quality recordings.\u00a0  My prior CDs have also been critically acclaimed.\u00a0  For example, \"American Gypsy\" was clearly a groundbreaking CD that was nominated \"Album of the Year\" at the \"American Independent Music Awards\". \u00a0 Notably, this was a totally instrumental CD competing against all musical categories.\u00a0 However, being solely an independent artist, the process of producing the CD left me without the necessary resources to adequately promote the final product.   My last project, \"12-string Guitar\", a very ambitious exclusively solo 12-string guitar CD, was nominated \"Solo Guitar Album of the Year\" at the JPF Music Awards in Nashville.\u00a0 However, due to financial restrictions, I was again unable to promote the project in any meaningful way. All my CD projects are unique and varied in their musical approach.\u00a0 For example, \"World Blue\" is an ambient - yet melodic, pensive   \"new age style\" CD, that many people consider my best work so far. \u00a0 \"Cold Fish\" is a live performance CD inspired by great jazz-fusion artists such as Pat Metheny, Spyro Gyra and Weather Report.  I am a composer and performer, not a salesman, and I have no clever video to entice you. My music does not fit neatly into any particular genre, so I am aware that one must truly enjoy music for music's sake to have an interest.\u00a0 That being said, I would sincerely appreciate your support, and have tried to create pledge contribution packages that reward your contribution. I might add, that this project is already nearing completion, that the music is already scored, arranged, and recorded, and that your contribution will be used for the critical final steps that include: artwork, mastering, production, and promotion of the CD.  I would be delighted and honored by your support, and look forward to hearing from you soon.",
  "It was almost 10 years ago\u00a0 when a small group of musicians came together in\u00a0a dank practice space in the Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle. We all shared a love of Jamaican music, and began practicing to forge a sound inspired by all the classic Ska, Rocksteady, and Reggae artists we admire. Shortly thereafter, a band name was chosen that was in part a tribute to our ska heroes The Skatalites: The Georgetown Orbits. At the heart of all our efforts have always been the fans. Every show, each album we've released, everywhere we have traveled. None of it would have been possible if it were not for your generous support. Kickstarter allows us to be independent musicians by giving us a platform to let the people who love this music have a direct influence on this release. The songs have been written and\u00a0recorded for our 3rd full-length studio album. However, we still need the funds to get\u00a0these recordings mastered and pressed. To all that contributed to our last Kickstarter campaign for 'Super Sonic' we give a heartfelt thank you. That album was a success thanks to your support. To everyone new to our sound, we bid you welcome, and hope to get a chance to meet you at one of our shows in the coming year.  Our talented lineup of musicians is as strong as it has ever been. With your help this album will be a big hit! Thank you.",
  "Hello and welcome to my project! My name is Mia. I'm a small illustrator from Hanover in Germany. This is my fifth Kickstarter campaign. While I started making enamel pins back in 2018 I decided that for my first project in 2022 I wanted to get back at a project I started in the beginning of my art career. In 2019 I created my second kickstarter and it featured 7 pride flag enamel pins. Over the 2 years people have asked me to make more of the pride flags into pins and as someone LGBTQIA+ myself without a pin made that would fit me I decided to dive right into it. If this is your first Kickstarter project check out the \"How Does This Work?\" chapter down below. Update: Although the stretchgoals on Kickstarter have not been reached, I decided to make every pin available as of january 27th. The reason for that is that during Pride Potions 2.0 I have had significantly more orders with Pride Potions on Etsy than before. I thought there might me a connection between both and it would just be fair to make more pins available. \ud83d\ude0a Every pin is now available through Kickstarter. The 7 new designs and the 7 original designs. You can check out my former Pride Potion Projects here.\u00a0 All pins will be hard enamel with a smooth surface and a precious look. They all come with two needles on the back and two metal pin backs for a secure fit. All pins will also have the Miamouz logo on the back and a backing card made out of printed recycled paper. I tried to create Kickstarter tiers as uncomplicated as possible so there is only a 1 item tiers and special offers for bigger preorders. If you want to purchase more than 1 pin but less than 6, you can use the add-on option. For prices please check the graphic below. \u00a0All special offers will be Kickstarter exclusive. With this Kickstarter you'll also have the chance to get one of the original Pride Potions created back in 2019. All original Pride Potions will count towards the new goals and stretchgoals so if you want to get your hands on a lovely lesbian potion and help this project out there's a way to do so. You can add all new and original Pride Potions to your pledge by either getting a discounted Kickstarter Tier or by adding add-on extra pins. Check out my Etsy for more pictures of those potions. If you have any question feel free to message me or to use the FAQ feature. The initial goal for the Kickstarter campaign will be 600\u20ac (approx. $680) which will be enough to get one pin in production and cover the costs for reorders of the original pride flag pins so I can offer those for Kickstarter backers as well. In total there'll be 6 different hard enamel pins. They will be available through stretchgoals (see stretchgoal text\u00a0above for prices). If the campaign is fully funded you'll be able to choose your rewards from all unlocked designs. If it isn't successfull you won't get charged at all. You can become a backer throughout the whole time this campaign runs and won't pay anything until the initial goal is funded and the campaign ends. You are also able to change your backer tier and extras with just some clicks while the project is still up for funding. After the project is funded, Kickstarter will gather all the funds and forward them to me so I can get all the new pins into production. Following this there'll be a Kickstarter survey for every supporter so you can choose which products from the unlocked designs you want to receive. You'll also be able to provide your shipping address in said survey. All items will be ready latest in march I guess but I try my best to get them ready for shipping as soon as possible. I ship all my items in sturdy boxes made out of recycled cardboard. I like to use environmental friendly packaging such as paper tape, cute paper bags and tissue paper as packing material. All international orders are sent with tracked shipping. Orders within germany are sent without tracking but if you insist on tracking you can still raise your pledge for that. Simply check out the add-on graphic above. There might be additional costs such as taxes for which I'm not responsible if you're from outside the EU. There will probably be a delay in shipping internationally due to Covid-19. While my Etsy orders took approximately 2 weeks to arrive in 2019 orders now take up to 3 months. To help funding my project firstly I really appreciate every active backer. Even if the stretchgoals are not unlocked yet everyone who backs for a certain amount of tapes/pins increases the odds of unlocking said items. As you won't get charged until the end of the project you can still reduce your pledge before the campaign is over if your desired washi or pin hasn't been unlocked by then. It would also be awesome if you could spread the word about my project. Sharing nowadays can be a huge support because every share might reach someone who someday decides to preorder my tapes. I'm very happy about every share on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and so on. Links to my social media are at the bottom of the page. I have already created more than 80 enamel pins, 7 washi tapes and several other stationary items so far so I have some experience with manufacturing them. I have also shipped over 2000 pins for my last Kickstarter projects (plus ~5000 for etsy and patreon) and I definitely have some experience with shipping. The final shipping date is set in march but international shipping currently takes a little longer due to Covid-19. If you want to check out my social media, feel free to click the links below. And if you're still reading I wanna say A BIG BIG THANK YOU for looking through my project. Drawing and being creative gave my life a push in the right direction again after becoming disabled. \u00a0I'm very happy that I can be the creative person I am. <3 I'd be very thankful if you could spread the word with your pin and washi collecting friends or people who would like this project in general. Thank you so much for your attention! Mia",
  "Hello World! I am Vanessa Lawrence, artist & FIDA Fashion Illustration Drawing Award Arts Prize Finalist 2021. I am bringing my FIDA nominated fashion drawing portfolio work to you via Kickstarter; to get my work into the world, and help fund my studio and creative practice whilst at the Royal Drawing School 2021-22. Let me invite you into my fashion world\u2026. During Covid-19 Lockdown I engaged with my art practice in new and different ways, navigating my way through online life drawing to win a place on the postgraduate course at the Royal Drawing School. I love to draw from live performance, film & photography. It brings narrative, movement and vitality into my work. As the pandemic unfolded, live life drawing company Drawing Cabaret Couture, began to offer drawing opportunities online. It was a joy to be welcomed into their world of fashion, film & editorial photography, & to draw each week; building my portfolio. Through Drawing Cabaret Couture I have enjoyed access to this years London Fashion Week 2021 and the Alternative Hair Show. Drawing from these cutting edge editorial fashion moments and fashion films has nurtured my work and creative confidence. Works created from these sessions have been FIDA nominated and exhibited at Istituto Marangoni \u201cUltramarine\u2019 Summer Exhibition in Miami this year. The Met After Midnight, Karen Elson X Moschino, 2021. Pastel on paper 65x50cm. The 4th FIDA Award Finalist 2021 The Met gala, is the fashion world equivalent of the Oscars. It is an evening when designers, models, and Hollywood stars convene in the year\u2019s most over-the-top looks to celebrate & fundraise at a new exhibit from the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute. The soir\u00e9e was cancelled last year and postponed this year, due to COVID-19. It was a delight for me to see the glamour & grace of Karen Elson, model, musician & Moschino muse, attend. I have followed her lockdown recordings, Radio Redhead, via instagram, adding her tracks to my studio playlist. Her Instagram posts told the story of her evening, revealing the team & talent that collaborated to create her iconic Moschino red carpet look. In the small hours, Karen Elson posted a short film of her cutting herself out of her glittering sequinned corset dress. For me, this was such an incredible fashion moment; I had to try and capture it! Iconic, witty & wonderful\u2026 It is an honour to know that she enjoyed seeing this work posted on Instagram & a delight to see it become a finalist piece at the 4th FIDA Awards 2021. I have chosen this celebrated portfolio of FIDA nominated fashion drawings to bring to Kickstarter, to fund some special edition prints, and support my future work. Limited Edition Prints. Kickstarter offers a perfect platform to promote and create this work in a concise time frame. It is my ambition to create an edition of prints that are affordable and accessible. I am excited to bring this project to you. I have explored different options of prints. The A4 limited edition (limited to 100) signed prints are an affordable opportunity to obtain an original artwork. Whilst the larger A3 Limited Edition ( limited to only 100) signed, gallery quality Giclee Print offers an opportunity to own an original and quality print, which celebrates creativity within the fashion industry, and the power of creativity in the most difficult of times. Expect exceptional rich pigment tones on gallery quality Hahnemuhle Photo Rag 308gsm paper of these FIDA nominated pastel drawings. The paper and Giclee print ink translates the materials of pastels & charcoal of the original pieces. Each tier offers a way to engage with my work and support my creative & studio practice. Ophelia Veil: Cutting Edge Couture As Seen In Print! I am proud to present Ophelia Veil 2021, inspired by the couture of London based designer Megan Casey & American artist Henry Darger\u2018s Vivian Girls.\u00a0 This image struck a chord with its nomination for a FIDA (Fashion Illustration Drawing Award 2021) by judges David Downton, John Booth, Stina Persson, Noemie Schwaller, Catherine Howard (Esquire) , Shivangi Bhardwaj (Adidas), Shawn Davey (Selfridges), Spiros Halaris, Peter Turner, Eris Tran. It was an honour to have my work pass through this panel to be a nominated work for this prestigeous award.\u00a0 Recently it has been seen on screen on the Royal Drawing School blog & Instagram; & in print with arts & fashion editorial Lazin Magazine. I would love to see this work created as an accessible & affordable print to be enjoyed by fashion & art lovers world wide. Original Artworks I intend to Make 100 artworks available, with a spread of print sizes and early bird offers, to make my work affordable & accessible.\u00a0 I shall list a small selection of original artworks available directly from my studio. These will be works that have been celebrated in print and across various media in the last year. To see these works find their way into the world, to be lived with & enjoyed will be an incredible highlight to this campaign, Supporting my practice: Royal Drawing School: Drawing Development Year 2021-22 I discovered the Royal Drawing School in 2017 and began to rekindle my love of drawing. In 2020 I applied for the prestigious postgraduate Drawing Development Year. I was so honoured and delighted to be offered a place on this course, as it went online, in response to Lockdown restrictions. It has been such a delight to develop my creative practice, from my VIA Arts Prize Charcoal drawings which where the focus of my previous successful Kickstarter, to my current work. Previous Kickstarter Make 100 Project We Love 2020-21. It was such an honour to be selected as VIA Arts Prize Finalist 2020. With UK restrictions the exhibition of finalists works was put on hold. I launched a limited edition of prints of this work in response to the public interest expressed. I felt strongly that I wished to create an edition of accessable gallery quality prints.\u00a0 Stretch Goals & ambitions fulfilled! To know my work now resides in international collections such as The National Conservatory of Lisbon & The Royal Ballet School London is credit to the public support via Kickstarter. \u00a0It is so incredibly humbling to know my work is displayed in Kickstarter supporters homes, lived with & loved! Get to know me a little better\u2026 Follow my process & creative endevours via Instagram @vanessalawrencexx *Prints are sold unframed, photos are for illuatration purposes.",
  "When Harmonic Thunder, a barbershop quartet from Ohio, was founded back in early 2018, we knew that we wanted to be committed to the highest musical quality and for spreading our love of harmony as far as we could! \u00a0We were overjoyed to win the 2018 Johnny Appleseed District Quartet Contest in a barnburner of an event and enjoyed an incredible year of performing around the state and eventually taking our act to the International Stage in Salt Lake City in the summer of 2019.\u00a0 Our performance schedules were filling up quickly, so we invested in new music and custom arrangements to provide a thrilling show for the choruses and audiences for whom we were looking forward to perform. \u00a0COVID-19 had other plans unfortunately.\u00a0 When it became clear that shows and contests weren't a reality for the foreseeable future, we decided that we were committed to continuing our musical development and giving the best treatment possible to all our new music, but this time, with the end goal of our Debut Album!\u00a0 Creating an album is hard work and it's not cheap, especially when trying to ensure the best quality. \u00a0We've put in a lot of the work already: hours upon hours of travel to rehearsals, countless virtual meetings to discuss track list / artwork / recording / etc., \u00a0arrangers fees, and coaching sessions. \u00a0All that being said, we decided to create this fundraiser to help make this dream a reality and we are sincerely asking for any and all help from our friends, families, and supporters over the years. We have estimated the below costs for our debut album: We're incredibly grateful for all the support and love we've received over the last 3 years. We have been enriched by all of you so much that we want to share the gifts and joy of singing with the world! \u00a0Thank you for checking out our Kickstarter page and we hope you will support us in this exciting journey!

  "We are Marina and Bruno, \u00a0we always had a passion for cooking.\u00a0 \u00a025 years ago we left our office work to create a small company of home style cokies.\n\u00a0 \u00a0After the first difficult times, thanks to the quality of our products the family company has grown and our\u00a0 brand \"tre fontane\" can now be found in many stores all over the world. \n\u00a0 We specialize in soft macarons, almonds and fruit flavoured, which we make gluten free so that they can be enjoyed by everyone. \n\u00a0 Our passion leads us to always experiment with new recepies but we love especially those of our tradition. \n\u00a0 Like many Italians, known to be the homeland of sailors, we also have another great passion, sailing. \u00a0\nAt 16 we bought the first boat and, since then, we have spent all the time we could find to travel around the Mediterranean, first by ourselves and then with our childrens. \n\u00a0 Now, at 60, we would like to try to combine our great passions and start a business that allows us to offer our favorite traditional dishes on board of our sailing boat.\n\n\u00a0 There is a personal shopper, a personal trainer, a personal........ we want to realize a personal restaurant on our sailboat. The Italian cuisine is well known and renowned all over the world but the most traditional dishes of the tradition are still mainly unknown.\n\u00a0 \u00a0In our macaron packs we always add at the bottom few recipes for our customer friends to discover old but new dishes, such as bunet, or  fried amaretti and many others.\n\u00a0 \u00a0This gave us the idea to ask for the contribution of the kickstarter\u00a0 community. \n\u00a0 We would like to welcome a few people at a time, prepare a meal of traditional dishes and make them taste, almost like a private restaurant, in the most beautiful bays of the Ligurian coast on board of our sailboat \n\u00a0 Our dream is to offer clients / friends a wonderful dish of \"Mandilli de sea\" with pesto (very thin lasagnette dressed with the typical Ligurian sauce Pesto, literally \"Mandilli de sea\" means silk handkerchiefs in ancient Genoese) or Capon magro alla ligure ancient dish of the Ligurian sailors or one of the other more than 100 dishes of our tradition \n\u00a0 We\u00b4ll be happy to prepare dishes that are vegan, vegetarian (you\u00b4ll try our Coundigiun) or kosher friendly or any request made by our guests\u00a0 We are very committed to preserve our planet! Our boat (sail boat) will be equipped with solar panel and wind generator, we don\u00b4t want increase the pollution of the sea We do not want a restaurant in a permanent place, we want to bring the restaurant in the most beautiful places.\u00a0 \nWe do not want so many anonymous customers, we want 4-5  people at a time in order to get to know them and enjoy each other company\u00a0\u00a0 We do not even want to make money, we want to\u00a0 share our coast, our dishes and have fun \n with our guests Of course the boat will be equipped to accoil also people with different moving abilities\u00a0 The investment is very low, to realize what was planned we need 10,000 euros. We could ask them to a bank or even self-finance us \n\u00a0 Why did we turn to kickstarter then? \n\u00a0 Because we want to turn to a community that is open-minded and open to innovative ideas, \nwe want those who \"book\" to feel like a friend who shares the expenses of lunch on the boat with other friends, not a customer who books with a tour operator.\u00a0 \nWe want you to ask us something special (maybe a dish you've heard about from friends or relatives in Italy) or enjoy it at night off the coast of Camogli.\u00a0 The reward for the financing of our project is a lunch, on board our boat in the harbor or port of Portofino or to the Cinque Terre or ... where the heart or the wind takes us\n\u00a0 Of course you\u00b4ll use the reward when you want from 2019 to......in any period - spring summer and fall are beatiful but also in the winter in a crispy day you may enjoy lunch on deck. \u00a0The required money will be spent on the adaptation of the boat and the kitchen and safety equipment. \n\u00a0 Was it more? we would like to equip the boat with filming systems (including aerial) to capture the best moments and to pay tribute to the guests of our personal tour\u00a0",
  "When I was growing up, I dreamed of owning my own restaurant. Living in Ethiopia and Paris instilled a love for both of these cuisines. Each one so rich in history, and so similar in so many ways. When I had my daughter, Anais, I knew that I needed to take a risk to secure her future. I decided to finally take the plunge. DC is a becoming a melting pot for cultures from all around the world. Which is why I found it so puzzling that no one had a restaurant that infuses cuisine from the birthplace of coffee with the feel of a Parisian cafe. The more I thought about it, the more I wondered - how come no one had thought to marry buttery croissants with dark and dreamy buna (Ethiopian for coffee). Why hadn't anyone given the choice between fluffy injera with shiro or sweet and savory crepes? The idea seemed so simple to me, and the more I questioned why no one had thought to open a space featuring these cuisines, the more I realized - I am that somebody! That is how the Addis-Paris Cafe was born. Even the most powerful chefs and restaurant owners will tell you that owning your own restaurant is the hardest business in the world. They are not lying. The feedback I got when I opened the space was overwhelmingly positive. That's the first step - and I nailed that out the gate! My customers loved the food. They loved my innovative twists on Ethiopian classics, like turning the classic tomato salad up a notch with a healthy dose of avocado. They loved having a quick bite of crepe with a sip of a creamy latte. They loved having a space in the Mount Pleasant area where they could come and enjoy music, take in art, and still enjoy a delicious meal with family and friends. However, their praise could only sustain my business for so long. An influx in customers meant a higher demand in the kitchen. Waiting tables and cooking all by myself became nearly impossible. But how could I pay someone when I was still getting my feet grounded in the space?\u00a0 An influx in customers also meant that my makeshift kitchen wasn't going to work forever. I can't crank out food at the volume I need without having the proper tools - that's like asking a plumber to fix a sink without a wrench! I knew that in order to keep the Addis-Paris Cafe alive, I would need to think of something and think of something fast. That\u2019s where you come in.",
  "This effort is to fund the recording, mixing, mastering and reproduction of Jefferson Rose Band\u2019s second album, 'Feel Like Dancing'. We are excited to release 11 songs that will take you on a musical journey to dance rhythms from Spain, Latin America, Africa and the Caribbean. We mix in some funk and rock too, for good measure. \u00a0 To make this independent release come to life, we need your support! The musicians on this album represent some of the best of Seattle\u2019s jazz, funk, rock and world music scenes. It is a rare opportunity for great players such as Alex Kitchen, Naomi Siegel, Tobi Stone, Aaron Walker-Loud, Ahkeenu Musa, Cameron Brownfield, Samantha Boshnack, Leslie Kitchen and Mahamadou Kone\u00a0to collaborate on a project and it is important to document this music with a high-quality studio album. \u00a0 We will use this record as a vehicle to apply for festivals and to tour around the country and abroad. Our goal in 2014 is to take this music to the world. With the incredible level of musicianship, the variety of songs in both English and Spanish and the the fact that this music makes you want to dance, we feel we are poised to reach new heights as a band. Also, it is important to note that to respect this music, the players and to guarantee a high-quality product from the studio, Seattle music engineering icon, Mell Dettmer is recording the album.",

  "We want to bring you the feeling of a Norwegian Christmas!\u00a0 So we're making you Koselig - a Norwegian-style Christmas magazine.\u00a0 Since the late 1800s, Norwegian publishers, organisations and charities have published julehefter \u2013Christmas magazines. Some are special editions of famous cartoons; others are beautiful literary magazines with removable art prints. The latter is what we want to give you. Koselig will be a little break in the busy time before and around Christmas. A beautiful magazine made for those moments when you just want to wrap yourself in a blanket, put your feet up and relax. The magazine is designed to share with you a touch of that old-fashioned, postcard-y Christmas feeling we get when we celebrate in Norway. Updated 28/10/2021 With 3 days left of the campaign, we\u2019re 153% funded and we've reached our first stretch goal! Thank you all for your pledges and support \u2013 we're so excited to see this magazine come to life.\u00a0 \u00a0Our next stretch goal is a reach with 3 days to go, but here it is! We are Amelia and Nica, a Norwegian/British couple living in Weston-super-Mare on the west coast of England. Amelia is Norwegian, and has grown up reading julehefter \u2013 Christmas magazines \u2013 all her life. As she grew older, literary Christmas magazines, filled with stories, artwork and articles, became one of her favourite Christmas traditions. Nica is British. She fell in love with the concept of koselig while falling in love with Amelia. When visiting Amelia\u2019s family farm in Norway, she couldn\u2019t get over the cosiness of being surrounded by handmade quilts, candles, cinnabuns and knitted jumpers, and never being more than a stone\u2019s throw away from nature and hiking trails. It was Amelia\u2019s mum who gave us the idea for Koselig.art \u2013 our website \u2013 and this Christmas magazine. She is a big knitter, quilter and koselig facilitator, and she acquires a stack of Christmas magazines every year. \u201cMaybe you should make one in English,\u201d she said one year. \u201cMaybe,\u201d said Amelia, too busy stuffing her face with cinnabuns to notice the idea that instantly set root in her brain. Since then, we\u2019ve written, published, designed, consulted on, edited, translated and produced a number of books and art projects through Amelia\u2019s company, Thought Library Media. We\u2019ve even run a successful Kickstarter campaign before, back when we were Ink & Locket Press. We learned so much from that adventure, and we\u2019re excited to put that knowledge to use. It took a few years for the idea of the Christmas magazine to spring into life, but this year we\u2019re ready: we\u2019ve launched Koselig.art and we\u2019re ready to share our super koselig Christmas magazine with the world, to give you \u2013 our English-speaking friends \u2013 the art of koselig living. Koselig is a true labour of love, and we\u2019ve worked hard to make it look beautiful. The magazine will be filled to the brim with hand-painted illustrations, beautiful page frames, full-page artwork and moving stories. M. Amelia Eikli: Stories, illustrations, artwork. Greger Stolt Nilsen: Artwork. Emily Clapham: Artwork, memory. Ellen Wilberg: artwork. Britt Eikli (Amelia\u2019s mum!): Knitting pattern, model knitting. Elisabeth Eikli (Amelia\u2019s sister!): knitting pattern translations and tests. Hannah Roberts: Editorial assistant, proofing, editing. Antonica Eikli: Editor-in-chief, layout, design. \nKoselig also includes images and paintings from Norwegian and Danish Christmas cards from the late 1800s and early 1900s, with artwork from: Andreas Bloch, Wilhelm Larsen, Othar Holmboe and Gustav L\u00e6rum. *#1, you say? Yes \u2013 The feedback on the test prints of the magazine has been overwhelming, and we\u2019re hopeful that this will become an annual publication! Digital rewards will be sent out on 1st December. Our goal is for every backer to have their magazine by 15th December.\u00a0 Not all of these costs scale in the same way, so if we sell many more copies than anticipated, the breakdown will look a little different. Any additional funds will be put towards Koselig.art and creating next year\u2019s magazine. Toll and import fees: Please note that we unfortunately can\u2019t take responsibility for any tax, tolls or fees you may have to pay to receive the magazine. Many places do let books and magazines enter toll-free, but please check the rules applicable for your territory. We want every supporter to get a piece of Koselig.",
  "Socrates will offer specialty gourmet coffee and middle-eastern pies(Cheese, Zaatar etc...) to consumers in West Dearborn, MI. We are more than just your average run-of-the-mill coffee shop and offer more than just coffee. Socrates provides an environment for the growing vibrant and innovative scene in West Dearborn. We also offer a unique atmosphere through our contemporary and industrial design, alongside with a special Italian brewed coffee named Illy. https://www.illy.com/en-us/company By inviting local bands, singers, public figures, professionals and college students, we will establish ourselves as a hub for Detroit\u2019s best destinations to visit. Nightscape will be focused on a diverse group aged consumers, for a chill and relaxed atmosphere. The purpose of this plan is to raise $200,000 to set up our shop and begin our marketing campaign using all available resources and focusing on social media. Socrates will offer three products: coffee beverages, coffee products, and middle-eastern breakfast style. Coffee beverages will be our main seller and sold by the cup in three sizes. All our beverages will be made from organic fair trade coffee beans supplied by Illy, an Italian coffee roasting company that specializes in the production of espresso, and sourced worldwide. It will be distributed by a local distributor named Cadillac Coffee. We will also offer coffee products such as grinders and French presses for those who want to match the quality of Socrates in their own home. \u00a0Our target customers are students, music lovers, coffee-holics, young professionals and also general professionals around the area. Our longer hours of operation will allow us to widen our customer base within each segment. Our large part of our marketing strategy will be to have live music throughout the weekend or every other week, depending on client\u2019s taste, to allow non-music individuals to be able to have a good time as well. Using the social media profiles of our guests will allow us to reach a wider audience and increase traffic into the shop. Joining the Dearborn Chamber and Arab-American Chamber of Commerce will also help in increasing traffic and be able to have access to a wide range of professionals and non-professional clients within the chamber by sending e-mail blast every week with promotions. Socrates will provide the most stimulating and unique coffee shop experience by providing a relaxed and harmonious space for excellent coffee to be consumed, and culture to be enjoyed.\u00a0 \u00a0The population of Dearborn, MI is over 99,000. The surrounding cities include Dearborn Heights with a total population of 60,000 and Detroit city with over 700,000. We estimate that the total market of Dearborn that drinks coffee is 40,000. Of this 40,000 people, we believe that 3,800 people are within reach of Socrates. Within this group of 3,800 people, we estimate that 1,400 people drink coffee. Of this 1,400, half drink coffee every day and the other half drinks coffee three times a week. This represents 29,400 cups of coffee per month. (The above information is estimation) . \u00a0Daily consumption of espresso-based beverages has nearly tripled since 2008, according to the latest data from the 2016 NCDT. Between 2008 and 2016, past-day consumption of gourmet coffee beverages soared from 13% to 36% among 18-24-year-old, and from 19% to 41% for those age 25-39. For espresso-based beverages alone, the jumps become 9% to 22% for the 18-24 age group and 8% to 29% for those aged 25-39.\u00a0 \u00a0Socrates will market its line of specialty, gourmet coffee through social media, word of mouth marketing, mailbox flyers, and initial discount coupon offering. It will price its products comparably to its nearby competitors, while saving in labor and expenses in order to maintain profitability. Socrates intends to use the trending vibrant and positive energy scene around West Dearborn to attract its initial customer base and create the ultimate experience. These strategies combined will create a foundation of loyal customers from which Socrates can attain profitability and later expand. Our goal is to provide a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere for our customers. Socrates will be about more than just coffee, but will also strive to create a strong feeling of community. \u00a0Every other weekend, Socrates will hold a live music night. This will be the company\u2019s most effective method of promotion as West Dearborn has quite a vibrant young crowd. The bands and artists for each night will be promoted through social media, the company website, and flyers. Consumers throughout West Dearborn will come to see their friends and family play. By featuring hot new upcoming artists, we expect to also bring in new customers that otherwise wouldn\u2019t visit our store. This increased traffic to Socrates will help to boost sales of our products.\u00a0 Strengths: By offering a wide selection of coffee products, Socrates can appeal to every type of coffee drinker. Provide an atmosphere drastically different from our competitors. Hold live music nights to attract new customers and establish Socrates as the hub for students, professionals and non-professionals. Weaknesses: There are already two competitors in our area which will make it difficult to take a sizable portion of the market share. Since we are a startup business we will have limited resources to compete with our competitors and expand our brand. Opportunities: The growing constructive sites in West Dearborn and the 60-million dollar investment by Ford is a market through which we expect of business can take advantage of. The project will result in the consolidation and relocation of up to 600 Ford Motor and Ford supplier employees and could create as many as 200 jobs. In addition, the project is expected to create approximately 50 permanent full-time non-Ford retail jobs at the site. Threats: The increasing price of coffee beans presents a threat to our business. Coffee bean prices have risen to a two year high. At this time, it is uncertain as to whether or not these price hikes will continue in the long term. We will lock the price with the local distributor for at least two years before seeing any changes.",
  "My Churro is an experience of delight and happiness.\u00a0 Select the presentation (Bites, stuffed or crunchy) and the sweet sauces you prefer. In a small trailer equipped and specialized in churros, we will be present at events and in a semi-trailer of similar presentation we will join shopping centers with the aim of reaching more places at a lower cost. We designed a differential product with the objective of operating in network and generating employment for entrepreneurial families and at the same time facilitating knowledge to be a better franchise business owner.\u00a0 Select (bites, stuffed or crunchy), you favorite flavor and enjoy. Three simple steps that allow you to enjoy a delicious snack. My Churro, is prepared in an artisan-made way. We have incorporated multiple flavors, achieving a perfect and crispy combination. All you need to do is simply select the desired flavor, enjoy and share. \u00a0The churros are handmade and include natural ingredients (wheat flour, vegetable oil palm) to preserve their freshness and aromas. They are accompanied by sauces of different flavors. They look pretty simple, right? Well, that's what we wanted: make My Churro the easiest way to enjoy a crunchy churro and the perfect combination of flavors. It took more than 1 year and a half to develop the brand concept, the preparation recipes, the required equipment, select the flavors and achieve a product that simply delights. Finally, we managed to unify resources, products and people to serve churros of excellent flavor and presentation. Now we need to carry out marketing, install ourselves in a commercial place, acquire two additional semi-trailers, create an agenda of participation in events and give to taste the product.\u00a0 Crispy, delicious, something to look forward to. This is how we see a Churro, which goes back a long time, outside the school or church in different countries of the world in an informal market. I felt the need to share my passion for delight, and I gave other people a glimpse of the magic I see in a good snack. What was once a product in an informal market could now become an opportunity for entrepreneurial families who will also support good business owners through a franchise model. I had the opportunity to spend time outside of my country (Colombia) and eat different fresh snacks, and I noticed that many products that have been commercialized informally can take a higher quality to other countries and create jobs, delight and expand the offer of foods. Places where people from different cities can have the opportunity to taste whether they are locals or tourists. That is why we have done our best to combine the flavor and crispy in a snack. After 1 year and a half of working with our team and allied businessmen with experience in this project, we can say that we have almost everything ready to start producing My Churro in the right way. However, some of our manufacturing partners and trusted allies in China and the US They need a minimum financial commitment on our part to start an important production execution, so we can reduce costs and production times. That's why we have set our funding goal at $ 30,000 that will add to the $ 46,000 we have invested in a trailer, a semi-trailer, a vehicle, supplies and some equipment, which will give us a boost to our dream. By reaching this financing goal, we can produce our final product in larger quantities, make our first order with the quality we want, so that we can meet the demand of each possible franchise in a short time. That said, all those who help us in the development of My Churro will get the product firsthand and will be the first to receive exclusive and superior quality benefits in the future. I love being an entrepreneur, but I love serving people even more, especially if it's something I can enjoy! I'm obsessed with marketing, good experiences and happiness for consumers and the people who work behind each of my projects. I have been in the technology and marketing industry for more than 10 years, and my career has focused on favoring the commercial operations of other companies and helping them to market their products with meaning. With My Churro, I am working with my team, my family and partners to give people a simply delicious experience and to help families join us in having a fair and better quality of life.",
  "Our Aim? We are three good friends with a love of food, drink and merriment. After many evenings at our current local we decided to do our bit to help rejuvenate our home of Stalybridge by offering a local space to eat, drink and host exciting and relevant social events. These will include brunch, cinema club, games evenings, live music, spoken word / comedy clubs and regular art and photography exhibitions as well as bringing a relaxed and welcoming place to hang out with old friends, as well as the ones you haven\u2019t met yet, all under one cosy roof.  Our Offering? Quality, consistency and an amazing atmosphere. Fresh and exciting food including experimental burgers and rule-free ramen, small plates and dishes. For drinks we want to offer the finest cask and keg the UK has to offer as well as a range of beers and bottles from around the world.\u00a0 Our Reason?\u00a0 We are all locals of Tameside and Stalybridge and often commented on what we believe is a large gap in the market allthough we want to create a space for everyone we recognise that currently there is little in the way of offerings for the younger demographic. We believe Stalybridge would benefit from a place catering to the new influx of residents who work in Manchester and surrounding areas that have chosen to make Stalybridge their home. We feel we can bring something different to the local community to create a buzz here in the town we call home and in doing so will help in bringing people to Stalybridge as well as offering something unique to those who already live here but perhaps don't frequent it's nightlife or eateries.  Our Plan? We want to open a venue where our friends and customers can enjoy a feast of fresh and exciting food including our chefs wildly successful World Burgers and Raman dishes alongside a wide selection of beers, spirits and wines. We plan to source produce from local suppliers and ensure that products sourced from further afield are ethically sourced and adhere to fair trade agreements. We want this to be a place for everyone, as such our dedicated food-smith will be creating a wide selection of gluten free options as well as amazing meat and dairy free food to cater for our vegetarian and vegan guests.",
  "This project made its funding on December 4. It all happened suddenly toward the end, so there was not time to write about stretch goals. A \"stretch goal\" is a new or added goal, beyond the original goal, in the event the project exceeds its funding. In our case, we have a number of people lined up who are ready to pledge, so I want to emphasize that we can still take those additional pledges and that they will continue to advance our cause. Here, then, is our stretch goal. Funds beyond our target will go toward a commission. We will approach Johnny Simons with a proposal that he create a new original theatre work that will complement the archived works on our website. The idea is that he will write a piece -- perhaps to be premiered at the Hip Pocket Theatre in 2014 -- that will round out the works that we are digitizing from the early Simons and Balentine years. We will find a way to videotape the performance, using some of the digitizing/editing activities that will be underway at that time. This -- the newest in a long line of Simons originals -- will then cap the website archives, demonstrating the ongoing vitality and creativity of live original theatre in Fort Worth. We hope that we can raise enough in these final countdown hours to award this special commission to Johnny as a special thank you for his prolific output, and as a tribute to Douglas and their very special creative relationship. So please, keep those pledges coming! New pledges from this point may request that donor names be associated with this new commission, as well as with the website itself. At the end of this one-year project there will exist a website with 25-30 of Doug and Johnny's shows (video and audio), plus early home-made tapes, garage recordings, and the visual reference material that goes with them. An archive if you will, of the important collaboration between Johnny Simons and Douglas Balentine in those early years of the seventies and eighties at Fort Worth's Hip Pocket Theatre. My\nname is Bruce Balentine, but this project is not about me; it is about my\nbrother, Douglas. I want to preserve his music and see it live again.\nDoug worked for some 30 years with Johnny Simons\u2014his collaborator, mentor,\nfriend, and soul-brother\u2014producing innova\u00adtive musical theatre in Fort Worth,\nTexas. Johnny wrote the scripts and lyrics, Doug composed the music. Johnny directed\nand cho\u00adreographed; Doug played piano, assembled the musicians and rehearsed\nthe singers. In 1977, they and Johnny\u2019s wife Diane founded Hip Pocket Theatre,\na Fort Worth institution. You can learn more about them here: http://www.hippocket.org The\ntheater is still flourishing today, and will be starting its 38th\nseason in June 2014.  The image above shows Doug at his keyboard at the original Hip Pocket Theatre on Highway 80 (1979). The theatre moved later to two subsequent sites, but always retained the rustic and improvised texture that is its unique trademark -- as if the theatre and its music grew spontaneously right up from the scrub brush and oak trees on the west side of Fort Worth. Douglas\ndied in 2008. He left behind a room full of reel-to-reel and cassette tapes: more\nthan 30 full-length musical theatre pieces, plus albums, songs, half-finished\nscraps, and the scores, scripts, and printed materials that go with them. Some\nof the most beautiful music I\u2019ve ever heard lies buried in those tapes; and some\nof the most moving lyrics, Johnny\u2019s lyrics, are brought alive by Doug\u2019s musical\nin\u00adterpretation and by the stories and staging captured on the \u00be-inch U-Matic\nvideo cassettes filling a second storage room. These\nold analog tapes are degrading with each passing day that we do not digitize\nthem. I have devoted much of the past four years to converting those tapes into\ndigital form. I al\u00adready have more than 50 hours of material on my hard drives. Digitized music is in the form of 44.1 KHz stereo .wav files, and video is MPEG2. But it\nis very time-consuming, and I have a full-time job. I am increasingly worried\nthat the material is vanishing faster than I can get to it. What\u2019s\nneeded is a professional who is paid to do the digitizing. This professional\nneeds to have the following skills: We have located and lined up those professionals. But it costs money. The first phase of this project involves getting these fragile tapes digitized and secure. Phase I: There are three phases to our plan. The first is by far the most important: digitizing the analog tapes to stop their continued degradation. We have found several firms able to do this work both in San Antonio (where most of the tapes are) and in Fort Worth (where video cassettes are stored). My brother Jim is in San Antonio to supervise the tape work there, and\u2014since the Hip Pocket Theatre is located in Fort Worth\u2014that area holds many long-time aficionados who can help with labeling and indexing. During digitizing, the transfer specialists will set levels and ensure the best copy. They will also encounter old worn-out splices and broken tapes, requiring splicing and other repairs. In some cases they must \u201ccook\u201d the tapes (due to an unfortunate design flaw in a particular brand of Ampex recording tape popular at the time). We have the appropriate tape decks, cooking and splicing equipment and will provide them to the audio company. We will also work closely with them to assist in this digitizing phase. Here is a breakdown of the tape collection: That's 280 audio and 165 video tapes -- a total of 445 tapes representing some 720 hours of material. Many of the tapes will run easily at real-time (for example, it's been my experience doing this in my home studio that most of the cassettes have remained in good shape and experience no problems). Others -- the larger R2R tapes especially -- will exhibit a lot of damage. We'll go from easy to hard to make the early phase produce output quickly. Almost half of the budget is targeted at Phase I based on the expectation that we'll experience problems with about a third of the R2R tapes but little problem with the rest. Phase I digitizing will require six months. Phase II: Once we have the tapes in digital form, we can distribute the rest of the archiving effort thoughtfully across many people The second phase is for organizing, labeling, tagging, and preparing the material for uploading. Most of this work will be done by me at no cost, but some significant budget is set aside for data entry and cataloguing tasks that must be done by team members associated with the Hip Pocket Theatre. Peggy Bott Kirby is the main person assigned this task. We expect to receive offers of assistance by the many scores of Hip Pocket exes who have enjoyed this remarkable theatre for so many years to help with this effort instead of (or in addition) to their backing pledges, as described in the rewards. Phase II will require six months. Phase III: The third phase develops the website and populates it with these materials -- audio, video, and images. Much of the work can be done by website talent already working with the theatre -- for example Robert Bourdage -- who maintains the current hippocket.org website now. But we will need to bring in outside expertise for some of the details associated with content management and copyright protection issues. We have dedicated the rest of the budget to that technical assistance. Phase III will require four months. The phases overlap as shown in the figure above. Phase I will begin with the easy tapes. So we will have several shows ready after two months to begin the indexing and cataloguing effort. Phase I and Phase II then proceed in parallel for the majority of the project, which is scheduled to last exactly one year. By the seventh month, we will have a very large body of material ready, and can then begin the website itself. That development is expected to take four months, during which any difficulties with the digitizing and cataloguing of the \"problem\" tapes can be addressed. In this way, we'll meet our schedule even if an unexpectedly large number of tapes exhibit difficulties. There are more than 30 full-length musical-theatre productions that represent the Simons and Balentine early years. See the video for the top 14 (approximately 2:30 in the Kickstarter video above). When this project has ended, the website will contain as many of these 30 shows as we can locate and catalogue -- one page per show. Each page will hold the musical selections and any video footage that we have been able to recover, as well as photographs and images of scripts, programs and posters. Above is a wireframe showing one concept for the home page of the website. Design details will be worked out in the early phases with the finished wireframes presented to the web developer for rendering. The wireframe above shows one concept for user-selection -- in this case, material from the early years prior to the founding of Hip Pocket Theatre. Songs from the Christmas albums, \"The Lake Worth Monster\", and Casa Playhouse shows contain many of the concepts that seeded the theatre and its early burst of creative output. The wireframe above shows what one of the show pages might look like. In this case, we have a well-archived show called \"Elder Oaks.\" Along the right, the user can listen to and/or download each song from the show (in mp3 or wav format). In the gray boxes will be promotional materals, a synopsis of the play, and other visual (scanned) material. A scrapbook link and download buttons are placeholders for other materials, which may grow to include scrapbook photos, scripts, cast listings, and a video of the original show performance (if it exists). There will be some 25 or 30 of these pages, depending on how many shows have survived and what kind of condition the tapes are in. We cannot know for sure the exact page count until Phase I is complete. I have a detailed project plan showing budgets, timelines, and the technical inventory of all of the tapes. Get in touch with me if you want to see and review it, or if you want to contribute some of your time to assisting in its execution. - Bruce Balentine",
  "As you know, for 24 years, I've been sharing music with friends and family in the form of THREE CDs EVERY year.\u00a0 These CDs include hand-picked music from around the world and often follow a theme, an idea, an artist, an era. The CDs are professionally replicated and include custom on-disc labeling and informative and entertaining disc inserts. Every year I spend months listening to music, making selections, arranging the selections, creating labels and inserts, negotiating with the replication vendor, assembling the jewel cases with inserts and gift wrapping each set. Then every set goes in a padded envelope, and I buy postage for each. Then, like musical magic, it arrives in your mailbox.  This has been a tough year for me and I'd love your help in getting the music out the door for this, the 25th year.  Components of my cost for the project include: purchasing music, buying blank CDRs to create multiple iterations of masters, purchasing the heavy paper insert stock, printing the inserts at STAPLES (the paper is too heavy for my desktop printer) , the replication (usually 70 sets (i.e., 210 CDs) by Cassette Works in Pasadena, CA), gift wrap, and postage. I send most of the 70 sets out by US Mail, domestic as well as overseas (to England, Hong Kong, So Africa, etc.) at an average cost of $2.40 postage per set).\u00a0 Total cost of the project is usually between $800 and $1,000.\u00a0 If you've enjoyed the music, if you've been turned on to new artists and feel richer for it, please help share me the music. For some of you, you've been getting the music for 20+ years. Some of you have only been receiving the package for a few years.\u00a0\u00a0 If you can give $20, that would be great; if you can give more, even better.  NOTE: This Kickstarter campaign only goes 30 days.\u00a0 Don't delay.\u00a0 Pay today!  And, finally, THANK YOU. ",
  "My name is Mari but everyone calls me \"Dee\". Why? I'm still not exactly sure. But I like it so it stuck. I've worked in the food business for 17 years and have been the proud owner of The Cake Countess and The Poisoned Apple for the last 7. The industry is fierce. The field is competitive. And there is absolutely no shortage of cake decorators/bakers/chefs...etc out there (honestly, everyone knows someone who knows someone who bakes these days). But I digress... Most days my feet hurt, my hands cramp and I have my first meal waaay past noon. Do I love it?\u00a0 Hell friggin\u2019 yes I do. Am I insane for loving it?\u00a0 Debatable. But again, I digress\u2026. Growing up hugely misunderstood for my love of all things dark and weird, I know what it's like to be served a nice hot pile of censure. And that's why I do what I do. I like my work to appease the most discriminating of eyes (yes, we're looking at you grandmas), but to always remain true to form. \u201cThose aren\u2019t gemstones, they\u2019re faces, those aren\u2019t ribbons, that\u2019s a strait jacket, that's not a tree, that's a spinal column\u201d. I love wielding the superpower to make someone\u2019s jaw drop with a show stopping centerpiece or to celebrate a first birthday with an eccentric cake that says \u201cHey kid, your parents are nuts and you might not fit in with the rest of the world, and that is absolutely perfect\u201d. But mostly, I LOVE having the knack to make people feel comfortable, welcome, and if need be, cheered up with something as simple as a complex form of sugar. \"Feeling sick? Crappy day? Spouse left you?\" No worries, I can fix that right up be it through a slice of \u201cDrunken Piano Pie\u201d, a \u201cGrave Dirt Cake Jar\u201d, or a birthday cake that shrieks when you cut it. It\u2019s my passion, and my curse. I could not possibly love a human baby more that I love food. (Just want to make sure I still have your attention).\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, I\u2019m lying through my teeth as I have an 11 year old whom is the coolest person on the planet and whom I love to death. But back to the point, I love food. GOOD food. I will happily eat bread crusts all week if it means getting a meal that will knock my socks off on the weekend. The problem is most times, that\u2019s usually not the case. Most times, I\u2019m treated to overpriced disappointment. I don\u2019t believe in an $8 slice of pie with a $2 side of whipped cream. I don\u2019t believe that cake should be boring and bland for the sake of structure and appearance. Over the years, I\u2019ve worked hard to perfect my craft. I still think of ways to improve on it today. My work is a reflection of years of trial and error, obsessively researching until my eyes practically fell out of my head, and enthusiastically figuring out ways to unearth awe and beauty in that which is \"unconventional\".\u00a0 After years of saving, I decided to take the calculated plunge of leasing a larger commercial space closer to my hometown of Los Angeles. On the downside, I am still in need of two key pieces of equipment. Slowly throughout the years I\u2019ve acquired the basics (commercial mixers, fridges, freezer, and the like). Unfortunately I was never able to attain a commercial convection oven of my own and it goes without saying that ya can\u2019t bake anything without one of these bad boys!\u00a0 Another much needed item is a dough sheeter. If I had a penny for every time someone said \u201ccan\u2019t you just do it by hand?!\u201d I would have a dough sheeter. Like, as of yesterday. The harsh reality is, baking is a blood sport. What popular Food TV shows neglect to mention is just how huge the toll on the body it is. You get scrapes, burns, cuts, puffy feet, and sleep deprivation. But all of that is a \u201cpiece of cake\u201d (pun intended) compared to screaming joints after rolling out endless batches of dough, fondant, and cookies. And unlike those TV stars, this is a one woman show, at least for now anyway. A reliable oven and sheeter would hugely increase production levels and enable the reach of larger markets, making day-to-day tasks \u201ceasy as pie\u201d (ok, I\u2019ll stop).\u00a0 In a nutshell, having the much needed extra space and equipment would afford the opportunity to branch out in ways not feasible before as well as take on a higher volume of orders, thus growing this little beast of a business. Participating in farmer\u2019s markets, offering classes, catering to a wider demographic, shipping our products nationally, and even a food truck is all part of the evil plan.

  "Thank you very much for considering to help me.\u00a0 We plan to open our doors for you in October 2018. We are here on Kickstarter to raise additional capital to bridge the gap\u00a0between start up costs, and the unexpected setbacks that delayed our opening date. \"Our Goal is to make you feel good. Our food and service are the tools of achieving that Goal\" Hello my name is Asamad Ashim, just call me Sam. \u00a0I'm thirty years old, and for past nine years I have been working diligently to open a restaurant. \u00a0After many years of planning and commitment. I am about to open a fast-casual restaurant with my team in Fort Worth, Texas. I'm very excited to tell you a little bit about myself and an idea that is going to change the industry. Change the way you experience the luxury of hibachi food. When you finish reading this you will understand the benefits of this new concept. chef Sam Ashim Why I am asking for Your Help. ---> The process of opening a restaurant from scratch with a new concept requires finances, bold actions, confidence and experience. I love cooking, but just love will not make a restaurant's cash flow positive for long periods of time. My love of cooking is very important, but I believe that it is just a small part of a successful business. \u00a0This summer (2018) I started the process of building a restaurant in Fort Worth Texas. When I set out to hire a general contractor for the project I interviewed and got quotes from fifty different contractors. I needed to find the best deal. I had to be very resourceful in order to make everything happen to open this restaurant. After researching tediously I hired a general contractor. The space I'm currently leasing is never been utilized for a restaurant. I had to do everything such as new; plumbing, grease trap (on the sidewalk), air conditioning system, ventilation hood, electrical works, gas, walls etc. I have been at the construction site almost every day for past four months and counting. I planned to open my restaurant at the end of the August, unfortunately construction got delayed. We had issues installing a 2000 gallons grease trap at side walk. It required more permits, and we had to close the side walk for a month. At one point we had to close the whole street to connect the grease trap to city lines. The issue with a grease trap could have been avoided if the general contractor had checked the work of a plumber. At the end of the day I blame myself for not double checking both of their work. So here I am on Kickstarter asking for Your help. It is difficult for me to ask for something unless I have given you something of value. \u00a0I feel better being on other side, the helping side. I know that I will find a solution for my current obstacles. I am almost ready to open, and I have my team with me. \u00a0With your help we will bridge the gap\u00a0between the start up costs, and the unexpected setbacks that delayed the opening date. \u00a0 Concept ---> Ashim\u2019s Hibachi Grill fast-casual restaurant will introduce Japanese Hibachi style of cooking, Korean POK Bowl style of cooking. The fast-casual restaurant will also serve Thai rolled iced cream to downtown Fort-Worth, Texas and neighboring areas. The company\u2019s industry base is on a fast casual dining system similar to quick-service restaurant (QSR) and relies on efficient operations and high volume sales. Our establishment will offer food services to guests in combination with selling alcoholic beverages. we will be providing carry out services and entertainment while preparing the food. \u00a0Guests will order and pay for their meal at the register counter or self-order kiosks and seat themselves. The staff will clean and deliver food to guest\u2019s table. I (Sam) have fifteen years of experience in restaurant industry. I grew up helping and working for family owned restaurants, developed and gained extraordinary skills in service/hospitality industry. I attended and graduated from University of Central Arkansas with Accounting degree and minor in Chinese language. I have developed an efficient system for preparing and serving each meal for my guests while still offering best quality products and ingredients at a competitive price. The comparative advantage of Ashim's Hibachi Grill restaurant is that guests will get their orders under 10 minutes once ordered. By saving time for guests and offering high quality and delicious food at a competitive price the restaurant will gain market trust and guest loyalty. Through years of research, passion, and gathering recipes from around the world I will introduce menu offerings that are fast, simple, healthy and easy to prepare.\u00a0 Ashim's Hibachi Grill Sushi Chefs\u00a0 Intentional focused menu: Service is focused on a menu of fried/steamed rice bowls with choices of shrimp, beef, chicken, tofu or vegetables that includes; broccoli, onion, carrot, and fresh salads. Our Menu will also include a variety of appetizers such as; fried dumplings, fried oysters, egg rolls, scallops and banzai shrimp.Our establishment will have desert station's serving Thai rolled ice creams. The entire inventory will be kept fresh by rotating and labeling them and ordering them multiple times a week. Ashim\u2019s Hibachi Grill (fast-casual restaurant) will have total of 77 seats, will be open from 11am-1am on most days, and will employ 6 full time and 6 part-time employees.\u00a0 Ashim\u2019s Hibachi Grill will be an inspiring fast-casual restaurant, combining an eclectic atmosphere with excellent and interesting food. The mission is to be efficient and have superior service. Guest satisfaction and loyalty is our paramount objective. Ashim\u2019s Hibachi will be the fast-casual restaurant of choice for a mature adult crowd of all ages. Ashim\u2019s Hibachi Grill will be operating within the fast-casual niche of the restaurant industry. It will be competing against other segments within the industry competing with fast food as well as more traditional sit down restaurants. We have following opportunities to service our guests: Guest wait time: We will focus on delivering guest orders to their tables in under ten minutes once the order has been placed. In traditional Hibachi Restaurants rice, vegetables, noodles and meat are prepared by one cook using one grill then served separately. On average, forty minutes is spent to cook and serve seven guests. Ashim\u2019s Hibachi Grill will have three separate grills.The first grill will be used to prepare rice, second grill will be used to prepare vegetables and third will be used for preparing meat. By having this system guests will get the orders under 10 minutes once ordered. Portion Selection: Ashim\u2019s Hibachi Grill concept offers different-sized portions. Our guest will have an option to choose what satisfies their appetite. Menu Variety: Ashim\u2019s Hibachi Grill will serve Japanese Hibachi style of cooking, Korean POK Bowl and Thai Ice Cream Rolls. The Dining Experience: Customer satisfaction with food and service has been and continues to be of utmost importance. Our findings indicate also that the d\u00e9cor, lighting, bar, and other options to improve the dining experience are also factors in customer decisions. Ashim\u2019s Hibachi Grill took all these factors into consideration for the design of this cosmopolitan fast-casual restaurant. Open Kitchen System: Kitchen operation such as preparing vegetables, preparing steak and fish, will be visible to guests. Our focus is to make sure guests will experience clean kitchen environment. Competitive pricing: Ashim\u2019s Hibachi Grill menu is priced at mid-tier level with no entr\u00e9e over $20. In addition the menu includes appetizers and desserts under $15. Ashim's Hibachi Grill Team Being Resourceful - In this picture we are installing surveillance camera's and surround sound speaker system. \u00a0We saved over ten thousand US dollars just by installing it ourselves. \u00a0Our website www.AshimsHibachi.com was built by our team member and we saved over eight thousand US dollars. \u00a0Our furniture was built by our team from recycled pallet wood. \u00a0All of the wall painting's are made by our team. \u00a0I am very excited to work with such a talented people, we are Family. \u00a0With the help of my team we have saved tremendous amount of money. \u00a0\u00a0 Erin painting chairs, she worked really hard :) Thank you very much taking the time for reading all the way though :)\u00a0",
  "Hello all, welcome to my Kickstarter page and a glimpse into what I'm looking to do and why I want to do this. First, I would like to say that I'm the last person in the world to ask for help, but the first person to try and lend a hand when I can. Recently I was jammed up and facing a roadblock that I just could not get around. Luckily my husband knew that I needed help \u00a0and made a call. \u00a0Thankfully I was able to receive the professional counseling I needed to put things back in perspective, and gave me a new outlook on my future.\u00a0 During that time I reflected back on my 25+ years in emergency services, my life, my friends and family, what is important to me and what makes me happy, and I made a decision; I need to redirect my focus in a new venture! The public safety field is unforgiving and unyielding.\u00a0 I became an EMT when I was 22 years old, started dispatching shortly thereafter as well, and just 6 short years ago, at the age of 41 (what was I thinking) went out and became a firefighter.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen a lot, I\u2019ve done a lot, and I have heard a lot, most of which I don\u2019t forget, and can\u2019t forget.\u00a0 No one in this field, and I know I\u2019m talking to a lot of you who are reading this, know what I mean. I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to take my management background and life's expertise and find a new path, and I have that opportunity knocking! I just need a little help getting off the ground. \n\u00a0 So here's my redirect; recently a very close and dear friend of mine, after 16 long years of being a restaurateur has decided to throw in his bar towel. His establishment was the third longest running restaurant in our town, that is until Wednesday, September 12th with the beer almost gone, we had the last Wednesday Night Trivia at The Copper Stallion.\u00a0 Owner, Terry Light has decided to turn the page in the book of his life and start a new chapter after his long career in the pub, just as I am, and he is looking for a buyer. I've known Terry and and his wife Joni for a number of years and we've grown to be good friends. I know the pub still means a lot to them and I am looking for backing to take over his proud establishment yet make it my own. \u00a0Remodel, re-branding, a new menu, and new exciting events to draw in a new crowd and bring back the loyal customer base that was already established at The Stallion.\u00a0 Yes, I want to buy the bar!\n\u00a0 The Fiskdale Tavern will occupy the space on the second floor of 538 Main Street, Fiskdale where the Copper Stallion is currently sitting vacant and waiting for someone with heart, drive, a strong spirit for adventure, and dedication to working hard to breathe new life into her. The building itself is of historical significance to town, having served multiple purposes since it was built in 1887 which will lend quant charm to The Fiskdale Tavern's theme. With exposed chestnut beams, rough exposed granite walls, a small brick fireplace and rough-hewn barn-board walls, the space is full of history including having once been a hotel, a rooming house, a shoe shop, along with several other restaurants that have also occupied the space. There is even rumor it was brothel at one time; how naughty!!?\n\u00a0 So the stage is set, that\u2019s the plan, now if you will bear with me just a bit longer I can tell you a little more about the plans for the Tavern that so many will all enjoy because you all made it happen. Imagine, the neighborhood Tavern that folks from all over helped \u00a0bring to life!\u00a0 This couldn\u2019t be a better plan, seriously.\u00a0 But, work needs to be done, hence the need for financial backing.\u00a0 The bank won\u2019t touch the project without investment; that\u2019s where you all play a part!\u00a0 Unfortunately this is not a typical turnkey flip of ownership opportunity, well it is sort of, but the old Stallion is in need of renovations in all areas; the kitchen, the restaurant area, and the bar. The punch list is a little extensive and I won\u2019t bore you with all the particulars but there is a true need for additional equipment, especially behind the bar, replacement equipment in the kitchen, and small things that add to the expense list like uniform shirts, menu printing, eye catching SIGNS noticeable from the street to help attract people to stop in and sit fora spell.\n\u00a0 The space is charming, it's old, and it works perfectly for the Tavern vision we have. Like any other business with aging equipment, newer, more energy efficient pieces need to be purchased and they are not on the higher end of the $$ scale. Even after looking online at used commercial outlets who resell used commercial appliances and bar equipment, we've decided it's better to buy new and pay a little bit more than inherit someone else's problems (and get a warranty).\n\u00a0 The atmosphere in the Tavern will be VERY laid back and casual, out of the way of the hustle and bustle of life that seems to be just flying past us every day.\u00a0 The d\u00e9cor will be simple and include vintage photos of historical buildings, locations and points of interest around Fiskdale (and Sturbridge) which will be provided by a local town historian. We will be putting in new flooring, adding new equipment behind the bar to put eight more rotating beers on tap, and many more exciting things!!\n\u00a0 We will be offering a wide range of food choices but wish to set our sights on being the best gourmet burgers and specialty wings joint this side of Worcester, Springfield, and Hartford!\u00a0 We\u2019ll have numerous tavern appetizers, Garlic Parm Bacon Knots, Nachos Grande, Fried Ravioli, Ragin\u2019 Cajun Popcorn Shrimp, Humus & Pita Chips, Poutine, and more. We will be offering two soups; New England clam chowder and French onion soup, as well as chili daily, and a soup special that will change weekly. We will have several salad choices including House, Caesar (toppings include chicken, shrimp or steak tips), Honey Garlic Salmon, Chicken Bruschetta and several others, as well as numerous made from scratch salad dressings. \n\u00a0 Lunch is served Thursday through Sunday with a Sunday Brunch & Lunch that starts at 10:00am and runs through 4:00pm. Dinner will be served nightly Monday through Saturday starting at 4:00pm. We will be offering daily specials in addition to our set menu which will have several chicken, beef/pork, seafood, pasta dishes as well as two Copper Stallion classics, Cottage Pie and Bangers and Mash.\u00a0 Our menu offerings are competitively priced with other area restaurants with similar styles with 99% of our menu being available gluten-free and or Chefs using only the freshest produce and meats from locally sourced farmers and butchers. \u00a0Who's hungry!!?\n\u00a0 Now, if all of this sounds like a restaurant/tavern you would like to sit down for a meal at or just stop in and relax at the bar with a drink and an appetizer, we would love your support. We will be offering some great incentives including VIP Cards as well as well beer mugs, pint glasses, T-shirts and other Tavern logo items and a brass name plate on a plaque that will hang in the entry vestibule proudly displaying our supports who made the Fiskdale Tavern dream a reality!!",
  "Welcome.\n\n\u00a0 This is a beginning of a very exciting time in my life where I will take all that I have learnt over the years and apply them to myself.\n\n\u00a0 The idea of this project came into my mind after falling inside of a hole. I was lost and felt I needed to figure some things out. I was thinking a lot. Thinking about life and thinking about my future in the business. Then there it was. I had a vision.\n\n\u00a0 The project itself is an opportunity for me as a chef to take myself to another level in my career. I always had a lot of creativity and now its time for me to show you. I will be traveling around the world to meet new experiences and to cook food in various restaurants where my menus will be on for people to enjoy.\n\n\u00a0 My philosophy about food is simple. It has to be natural. Whatever produce I am using I want it to be the right time to use it and at the right place. I believe in sustainability and using all parts to minimize wastage. Mostly I prefer that food is cooked in its original state, as a whole. You get a carrot then you cook like it is and the flavours will remain as part of the integrity of the produce. Using the best ingredients in a logic way.\n\n\u00a0 I believe in combinations of flavours without making it blurry. I believe in textures and that every bite has to be interesting and make sense.\n\nThis will be an exchange of knowledge and inspiration between us. It will be fun and bring a smile on our guests. It will be real and it will become a memory that we will share until the end of time.\n\n\u00a0 The goal is just to share my knowledge and myself to make people happy through food and a great dining experience. To make this happen I will need funds. I am currently doing all this by myself and paying for myself. I need money for ingredients, I need money for equipment and I need money for travel.\u00a0 I am not expecting to earn a lot of money from this project it is more like gaining experience and meet new people. Eventually my dream is to open my own restaurant and thats the maingoal. But you have to invest in yourself first and the reward will not just show as money but as happiness and satisfaction.\u00a0",

  "Have you ever walked into a coffee & donut shop for there to be a whole 5 stale donuts left at 11am? I definitely have. It was many encounters as such that caused me to set out on a new start-up! A start-up with freshly roasted coffee daily, as well as daily cooked donuts & bagels all day long with no run outs! Our goal is not only freshness but customer satisfaction. We are from a town where the local bakery closes at 2 and the dunkin' donuts is either packed full or nothing left, and i am here to change that!\u00a0",
  "Hello and thanks for checking out our kickstarter campaign for a truly unique recording project called Joty Drums! My name is John Churchville and back in 2010 I was lucky enough to spend a day at Sage Ct. Studio in Ann Arbor Michigan recording an album with the legendary drummer Muruga Booker and world renouned tabla master Pandit Samar Saha.  It was a magical day, the connection between the musicians in the studio was immediate and deep.  Egos were put to the side and the only driving force was making great music.  We spent the next three years plugging away, adding tracks and other insturments, but at core this album is an improvised world percussion experiment gone right! Now we need your help to get the album in print.  This coming Fall Pandit Samar Saha will be coming to Ann Arbor on Tour and our hope is to have a C.D. release party for Jody Drums. So check out the rewards and let\u2019s make this happen!

  "INTRODUCTION in the company of growing women. Dear Lois is a bi-annual independent magazine for all women, starting as young as 12-years-old. We believe we continue to grow and learn through all stages of life, so why not have a place to pursue and encourage that together. Each issue invites everyday storytellers, casual life changers, and unassuming heroes to share their stories. In a world filled with comparing and competition, we wanted to create something different. Here you don\u2019t need to be the best or the first at something to be given a platform to talk. We feature all voices, big and small. We meet you where you are. ISSUE #2 This is the home issue. We decided to focus on the theme of home because whether we feel like we\u2019ve found it, we\u2019ve always had it, or we are still searching for it, we all have our own definition of home. Inside, we talk about the people who make up a home. The people who make it messy, and the people who tidy it up. We talk about the feeling of home \u2014 why some people feel uncomfortable with the home they are given, and how they discover a new home in new places. We talk about how certain memories remain in our brains forever, and how ultimately you have the ability to shape your home and create a place of belonging wherever you go. We learn that home is much more than a physical structure. It\u2019s about comfort and safety, a place where your true self can shine. Houses can come and go, but your home moves with you. OUR JOURNEY Issue #1 was fully funded on Kickstarter\u00a0and since releasing the issue in November 2018 we\u2019ve been blown away by the seemingly endless support and kind words from our growing audience. We are super proud of our first issue, which was originally a school project primarily aimed at learning more about typography and layout. However, we were clearly on to something and it caught on, becoming so much more than we ever could have imagined. It\u2019s now found all over the world. With issue #2, we are hoping for an even larger reach. We\u2019ve tried out new things, met new people, and we\u2019re ready to share these new amazing pieces with you. So why another campaign you ask? Because\u00a0printing and shipping is expensive (70% of our budget!), and Kickstarter helps us secure funds in advance while we grow organically with your support. In addition to production costs, we\u2019ve also made a commitment to have the money necessary to pay our contributors for their time and talent. Because we are currently ad-free, we rely entirely on our readers\u2019 support, and we find kickstarter to be a fun and safe way to gather the necessary funds. By supporting this Kickstarter, you\u2019ll be putting us in a better position to keep making and releasing issues, to keep growing our readership by printing more copies, and ultimately to make Dear Lois a sustainable project. The more issues we create and the more readers we gain, the more opportunities we have for grants and sponsorships in the future. WHY PRINT There is a lot of great work online, and we hope to add to that space sometime in the future. However, we strongly value the idea of sitting with the work within Dear Lois for as long as you need. You can take it with you wherever you go, or you can keep it on your bookshelf until you need to revisit it later on. While Dear Lois isn\u2019t considered a self-help publication, we understand certain articles will impact different people at different times. Consider it a friend you can call on when you need someone. REWARDS CREDITS + THANK YOUS As always, projects like this take a village, and Dear Lois issue #2 is no exception.\u00a0 Our sincerest thank you to all our contributors: Artemie Li, Adrienne Oliver, Alejandra Macouzet, Amy Huber, Anna Nguyen, Bonnie Alderfer, Breeze Pollard, Dayna Behrens, Divya Das, Ella Lama, Ellen C. Caldwell, Gulligull, Enya Last, Emilie Jajonie, Blobs Feeling Things, Jen Garcia, Jessica Bose, J.W. Kwan, Julia Nagatsu Granstrom, Julie Jarema, Katie Johnson, La Lin, Lauren Gallow, Jo Edmondson, Olivia Driggs, Madeleine Longoria Garcia, Megan Sexton, Mia Romani, Natalie Briscoe, Olya Tsikhanchuk, Tess Guthrie, Yumnia Duarte, Natalie Hartkopf, Hannah Provisor, Sarah Pasillas And endless love and admiration for every single pal that helped us prep this campaign: To all our friends and family, thank you. Truly couldn\u2019t do any of this without you. And finally, our deepest thanks goes to our Grandmother Lois, the magazine's namesake. Dear Lois is our way of sharing our desire to connect all generations of women together and to pay tribute to one the strongest ladies who ever existed. She was also one of the most talented crafters we will ever meet, and we can't think of a better way to spend our creative energy than by producing this magazine for years to come. ABOUT US Dear Lois grew a little bigger this time around, and now it's 100% a sister dream team. Mariah Behrens is a graphic designer, illustrator, and toy maker, insistent on always finding ways to empower young people. Hannah Behrens joined the team and has been an incredible second eye throughout the process of building issue #2. Hannah is a fitness guru with all the knowledge on oils, acupuncture and self-care you could ever need.\u00a0 read more on our IG: @dearlois_mag",
  "Tropic Zine\u00a0is a forum for critical engagement with contemporary culture that seeks connections between Hawai\u02bbi and the tropical diaspora worldwide. Based in Honolulu, we are a print publication, digital platform, and creative collective. Our editorial content includes visual art, essays, poetry, interviews, photography, new media, and research-driven explorations; we are a collation of new cultural material that defies any singular narrative. We embrace queer modes of thinking, discontinuity, and hybridity, while prioritizing under-represented, emerging, and under-recognized artists. In March 2018, Tropic Zine raised enough funds to produce our first issue thanks to the generous support of our friends, families, strangers, and extended community. We released Issue 1 in September, started a non-profit publishing imprint,\u00a0Tropic Editions, and received our 501(c)(3) tax exemption from the IRS.\u00a0 We have continued to evolve and expand our reach and our mission through online publishing (e-Tropic) and print\u00a0stockists\u00a0across the United States and abroad in Mexico, Japan, Canada, and the Philippines. We've partnered and collaborated with N\u0101 Mea Hawai\u02bbi, Lil' Deb's Oasis, Aupuni Space, TRADES A.i.R., Tropical Futures Institute, HIZAB Library, Analog Sunshine Recorders, and have built relationships with many other organizations. With our second issue, we seek to decolonize, deconstruct, and reimagine the Filipino(x) diaspora by posing a series of questions about what it means to identify as, and to be, a contemporary citizen in an age of movement and dispersion (both tangible and virtual). Rather than speaking to national identity, the editorials present complex, entangled, multi-generational stories of place.\u00a0More than half of our contributors are from Hawai\u02bbi, but they are, as you might imagine, located all over the world; in Hawai\u02bbi and across the continental US, in Germany, Brazil, and in the Philippines.\u00a0 Our 20 contributors are Catalina Africa-Espinosa, Calla Camero, Azur\u00e9 Keahi, Leah Danze, gentofish, Jasmine Grace, Taissa Fromme, Rebecca Maria Goldschmidt, Jourdan Simmonds, Myka Arnado, Kristoffer Arde\u00f1a, 856G Gallery, Vincent Bercasio, Reise Kochi, Risa Hoshino, Lise-Michelle, Nake\u02bbu Awai, Cristin Lim, Jarrod Caranto, and Sonny Ganaden. These creatives are digging deep, unearthing, excavating the material and emotional realities of their cultural identity. It is our hope that their efforts will inspire you to gaze inward, outward, forward, and reconsider aspects of your own relationship to the places and communities around you, where-ever that may be. Before we can share this work-in-progress with you all, we need your help. This publication is a labor of love that needs financial support to go to production; we have a number of expenses that need to be covered, including materials, design, a small honoraria for newly commissioned works, and printing. By hitting our initial goal of $3,000 in three weeks, we will be able to effectively fund the pre-release costs and be able to focus on the public programming we have planned for the issue's June release, including an exhibition at Aupuni Space and an artist-in-residence from the Philippines. For those of you who have the financial capacity to consider a larger donation, we are seeking to create a patron program of 10 individuals who will donate at the $500-$1500 level. These micro-grants will support our publishing program, which now includes an open call for proposals. We consider the gesture of a pre-order to be a very meaningful show of support. We also welcome in-kind donations, volunteers, and new collaborations and partnerships. All forms of support, financial or otherwise, give us the energy, inspiration, and drive to continue making our project happen. With aloha\u00a0and gratitude, Marika Emi and the Tropic Zine + Tropic Editions teams. Tropic Zine is the namesake project of Tropic Editions, a non-profit publishing imprint that produces artists' books imbued with a sense of place. Our publishing program supports artist-driven printed matter that forges connections between otherwise disparate locales and identities, with a curatorial emphasis on experimentation, queer and postcolonial critique, and community collaboration. We hope to draw Hawai\u02bbi into an existing global discourse on tropicality and creative production in the tropics.

  "About Queen Since i was 13, cooking has always been something I loved to do in my spare time. With the right ingredients and just a little bit of imagination, you can create a masterpiece. I\u2019ve fed countless friends, family, coworkers and friends of friends, yet the look after the first bite of a meal I\u2019ve created has never changed. \u00a0It\u2019s a look I\u2019ve learn to appreciate and is something I look forward to. It\u2019s a mix between satisfaction and peace . It\u2019s only there for a brief moment, but it can\u2019t be missed. I\u2019ve recently decided to make my hobby a reality. I\u2019ve \u00a0open up The Queens Kitchen to the public and couldn\u2019t be any happier. I\u2019m here Today to raise money to buy my very own food truck. After doing extensive research, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that this is something I want to do. If you could have a chance at doing something you love, wouldn\u2019t you take that chance? After creating my business plan, I realize that the start of any new business t a hefty investment.\u00a0 What is my goal? My goal is to raise $50,000. All proceeds will go to the start up of The Queens Kitchen: a food truck \u00a0This will include vehicle costs and food supply. All licenses and certifications are in the process of being complete. I have already created what you would call a growing fan base via social media. My next step is the actual purchase of the vehicle, and this is where this awesome community comes in. Having already complied with state and federal regulations, the purchase of a food truck would be the next step in getting my dream off of the ground.\u00a0 Video shown above is one of our combo seafood platters. The combo includes Cajun fried whiting, fried shrimp & a crab cake next to 6 cheese baked macaroni & delicious sweet candied yams. What do we make? Not only do we make delicious soul food but we also create delicious vegetarian meals as well.\u00a0Some of our foods range from lemon butter salmon to Philly cheesesteak egg rolls. From jerk salmon tacos to seafood Alfredo. The lists goes on and on. I feel as though it is very important for the community to have a wide selection of foods. Being a vegetarian, I had to transition to become a pescatarian because of the poor food choices in my neighborhood. I would love to offer my community a choice of various foods ranging from healthy salads to hearty soul food. We also make desserts, specializing in cheesecake and cheesecake jars.\u00a0 I would like to thank each and everyone of you for helping my dream come true. Ready to take my business out of my home and into the world. Thank you for taking the time out to read my story. Follow the Queens Kitchen on instagram @theequeenskitchen for updates.\u00a0",

About Woodland's SECRETS TOLD Kickstarter:\u00a0For the last two years we have been writing and developing a new conceptual album called SECRETS TOLD, which is a musical exploration of the myths, lore and legends of the ancient world. Now in the final months of production, we invite you to share in the climax of our creative and spiritual journey as we prepare to release the latest album this Summer at Faerieworlds. The album is a rich, poetic tapestry that includes 13 tracks of original music featuring instruments from around the world including harp, hurdy gurdy, overtone flutes, cello, six and twelve string guitars, violin, bouzouki and a variety of drums and percussion instruments. \u00a0Thanks to you, our Woodland community, the album will be an \"independent\" release, with Woodland retaining full creative control of the music and art, as well as direction over the reproduction, which will be a \"Zero Carbon\" eco-disc package. THE CONCEPT: SEEKING A NEW HORIZON Our first CD since SEASONS IN ELFLAND: SHADOWS in 2010, SECRETS TOLD delves deep into new regions of inspiration and\nancient landscapes of legend. Rich with romantic Mediterranean and classical themes and imbued with the mythos and folklore of Southern Europe, our music and lyrical poetry have incarnated within new songs and new instrumentation. The music of SECRETS TOLD is exotic and evocative, rhythmic and romantic, sensual and mysterious.

We invite you to join your energy with ours so that together we can all be an integral part of manifesting this adventurous musical experience.\u00a0 THE BAND: A NEW INCARNATION\nTo capture the mercurial muse of SECRETS TOLD required us to expand and enrich our band with new members and bring back some of our most talented players from past band incarnations.  In addition to ourselves, Emilio and Kelly Miller-Lopez, the band's founders, we have assembled an amazing lineup of world-class musicians including the internationally acclaimed ethereal cellist Adam Hurst and former Cirque du Soleil drummer, Jarrod Kaplan.\u00a0 The project also includes Woodland veterans Donald Brodsky on bass and Ken Sokolov on drums as well as new additions Jesse Whitworth on bouzouki and Tiffany Holiday on violin. The CD features guest vocal tracks by award winning Barcelona musician, Priscilla Hernandez and Australia's celebrated songwriter, Louisa John-Krol.\u00a0 CD PRODUCTION: DEDICATED TO ECO-CONSCIOUSNESS\nAll Woodland projects strive to honor and serve the planet creatively, spiritually and practically. As an independent band free of corporate protocols, Woodland has the ability to control the quality and means of production of all aspects of our projects. This Kickstarter will fund the album's final professional studio production and mastering to assure the highest quality for our fans.\u00a0 The reproduction of the CD digipack, will be a \"zero carbon\" product printed with green inks on green forestry paper, utilizing recycled water bottles for the packages plastic. The final product will be wrapped in sustainably produced corn plastic. This 100% ecological packaging is in harmony with Woodland's core inspiration and beliefs that are deeply linked to both the mythic and ecological aspects of nature.  Woodland hopes this type of eco-conscious production will inspire other bands in our genre to do the same, so that the art of this musical movement may truly reflect the ideals expressed therein.\u00a0 ALBUM ARTWORKThe album features the artwork of visual artist, Stephanie Lostimolo. \u00a0For years, Stephanie's talents have been featured on the posters and\u00a0graphic sites of Faerieworlds and FaerieCon, in addition to her beautiful personal artwork and her work for Imaginosis Media Design and Michael Curry Design. The design is a depiction of the story of the sacred walnut tree of Benevento from the old world Italian legend of Aradia. STRETCH GOALS If the project reaches its financial goal, Woodland will expand into stretch goals to include an record marketing plan and a supporting tour for the album in the US and Europe.

  "Hello friends! I'm [kittyalyst], an illustrator from Ontario, Canada. Outside of my time as a student in healthcare, I like to paint and design pins! This will be my 3rd enamel pin campaign. You can see some of my previous pins and other work in my shop! Hanyabi is a set of hard enamel pins based on cats celebrating Japanese festivals. The title combines the words \"Hanabi\" - meaning fireworks - and \"nya\", the Japanese equivalent of the word 'meow'.\u00a0 There isn't much else to explain. I just thought the pun was cute. I love cats.\u00a0 Kickstarter is a pledge now and pay later platform where you will only be charged if the project is successful. I offer pins at their lowest ever price during the Kickstarter - $15CAD (Early bird) to $17 CAD (Kickstarter special) per pin. The pins are valued at $16USD+ retail so it's quite a bit of savings given the exchange rate! Now is the best time to get them. There are 3 planned designs in the initial campaign. The first one unlocks at $400 CAD!\u00a0 Hanami (hanyami?) is the sakura blossom viewing festival where the iconic tri-colour dango is commonly served! Did you know that the green dango is traditionally flavoured with mugwort? Matcha is a common substitute nowadays.\u00a0 Mochitsuki is the New Years mochi pounding festival! Sweet glutinous rice is kneaded and pounded into smooth and chewy mochi, said to give you strong teeth and bones for the new year. Many east Asian countries have similar glutinous rice foods, but mochi is the one that went with this set thematically. The two cats here are based off my two cats in real life, although they would never willingly team up like this.\u00a0 Our titular design, Hanabi ! Fireworks are festival staples everywhere. This pin will have glitter enamel detailing to capture the dazzling lights. The first add-on is this lantern kitty vinyl sticker! She is geared with a kitsune mask and probably on her way to eating some tasty snackos. The sticker will be approximately 3in tall, made of \u00a0matte laminated vinyl. I make all my stickers by hand in house and use a waterproof vinyl sealed with a uv-resistant, scratch resistant matte laminate for a durable and smooth finish.\u00a0 This sticker will be included for free in all pledges of 3 pins or more, and available as an add-on for $4 CAD. Also for this campaign, I am offering my popular Seasons of Japan lanyards from my last Kickstarter campaign as add-ons at an exclusive price. They're extra wide lanyards made of a silky smooth polyester that are more comfortable and durable than your standard lanyard. They're 45cm long (folded length) and have spacious oval clasps. They're perfect for carrying keys and badges while displaying enamel pins! Their extra width makes them resistant to warping, even with pins attached. Below is my rough estimate of this project's timeline, with extra time added to account for possible unforeseeable delays. ***I CANNOT GUARANTEE THESE PINS FOR CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAYS, SO PLEASE PLAN ACCORDINGLY***. I will be providing a free printable holiday card with the pin images for those of you on the \"late holidays gift\" team.\u00a0 Late October - November 2021 \u00a0Kickstarter campaign November \u00a0- December 2021 \u00a0Pin production January 2022 \u00a0Pins received + quality checking Late January - February 2022 \u00a0Rewards sent out!\u00a0 Canadian shipping: Canada Post oversized lettermail [UNTRACKED] USA: USPS First Class Mail [TRACKED] Everywhere Else: APC shipping logistics or Post NL [TRACKED to most countries, please contact me in advance for tracking availability to your country specifically] ***UK and EU backers! By pledging to this Kickstarter you understand that there may be additional VAT fees charged by customs upon import of the rewards. I am not responsible for reimbursing these charges and additional shipping delays due to VAT collection may occur. Pledging to this campaign means that you agree to these terms!",
  "My name is Mark. \u00a0My wife and I have many dreams, one of which is to own a restaurant that offers delicious food and many fun activities. \u00a0Our goal is to \u00a0have a pleasant dining atmosphere, outdoor eating space, volleyball nets, bag toss, horseshoes, badminton, pool tables, golf simulators, etc to keep our guests entertained and active. \u00a0Also, to have a great sports atmosphere with plenty of televisions and to be the go to spot! \u00a0We would host tournaments and leagues. \u00a0Our goal would be to build an atmosphere of a fun and festive place to hang out during the day and into the night. \u00a0At night, we envision a band playing to keep our guests entertained and relaxed. \u00a0None of this is possible without your help. \u00a0We would be so appreciative of any and all donations to help our dream come true. \u00a0Unfortunately, we have used up a lot of resources and feel like we are so close yet so far! \u00a0 Since Mother Nature and our environment are very important to us, our goal is to be a VERY environmentally friendly and energy efficient business.

  "I am recording a 10 song CD called \"Laughing Buddha.\" The tunes are steeped in African, Latin, and reggae rhythms, with versatile guitar parts, while the lyrics have Buddhist themes. I've recorded the basic tracks in my home studio, and now am doing vocal and drum overdubs at Skyline Studios, in Oakland, CA. The Kickstarter funding will pay for overdubbing, mixing, mastering, and making copies of the CD and rewards.  A portion of the sales of the CD will go to Abhayagiri and Amaravati Buddhist Monasteries to show my appreciation to the monks there who have been teachers, guides, and inspirations to me. If I'm able to raise extra money I'll be able to create a music video to help promote the CD as well as a longer form video with the complete interview that the Kickstarter video was based on.  Though I'm best known for my books and retreats bringing Buddhism and the 12 Steps together, I've been a musician for most of my life, playing lead guitar in all kinds of bands. The CD brings together that devotion to Buddhism with my love of music. I thought about releasing what I've recorded at home, but realized that I wanted the music to sound its best, so I decided to risk a bigger project. When I went into the studio to do vocals, I thought I'd get everything done in one day. Instead, I only got through two of the 10 songs. That's when I realized I'd need help paying for the project.  Up to now, I've played all the instruments, including lead and rhythm guitars, bass, keyboards, and vocals. But now I'm excited that Russ Lawton, an old friend who records and tours with\u00a0 Trey Anastasio and many others, is scheduled to overdub the drum parts when Trey's band passes through Oakland in April.  Here is a little about the songs: Laughing Buddha, the title cut, is a danceable Afro-Latin groove with playful lyrics and a rocked out guitar riff. I'm Alive is a joyful, upbeat song about simply enjoying life.  Vipassana Blues, I wrote after my first meditation retreat, describing the rigors of silent meditation. It seems a lot funnier now than it did at the time. A slow, minor blues with slinky guitar licks. Ajahn Chah, which was the name of a great Thai Forest Meditation Master whose main message was, \"Just let go.\" His name seemed rhythmic to me, almost like a chant in itself, so I wrote this reggae-funk tune about him. The guitar solo is the wildest one on the CD. Wake Up, is a reggae song I wrote for my daughter when she was still asleep at the Spirit Rock Meditation Center Family Retreat. I added doo-wop vocals and acoustic guitar to give it a more diverse and nuanced feel. Metta Samba, takes the traditional words of the Buddha's teaching on lovingkindness and gives them a Brazilian lilt. Refuge is another traditional chant put to reggae with folky guitar overtones. Enough, Enough is a bluesy number that makes fun of consumerism. The guitar runs through a tremolo, while the bass line echos Sonny and Cher's \"And the Beat Goes On.\" Kabir Says was inspired by Robert Bly's \"Kabir Book.\" These lyrics are about searching everywhere for a spiritual connection, only to realize that it was there inside me all along. I wrote this in 1982, and I think you can hear a few influences from that era in the guitar and bass lines. Don't Know is a playful lyric expressing a key Zen idea: we never know what's going to happen next, so we better pay attention now and not makes assumptions.",
  "ABOUT THE ARTIST Hey there! \u2728 My name is Paige, @Hextapes/@hextapes.art on Instagram! Some of you may know me from my last Kickstarters - Scout Daggers! and the Brood X Collaboration! We successfully created 13 different pins and I couldn\u2019t help coming back with a new project, this time with a pin design by Brandon F. Ottenbacher and ElectroMojo! My last project helped jumpstart art as a full-time job, but art is a forever moving journey which is why I\u2019m back with a new set. The goal is $600 to fund this design - if funded will add variant and other stretch goals! \ud83d\udc96 ~ Pledging towards the campaign is 100% risk-free! Payment will not be taken from you until after the campaign has come to an end and only if it is successful! If the campaign is not successful and we do not reach our goal then no money comes out of your pocket.

We want the best of the best for you when it comes to creating a quality art pin and our prices reflect that. Please note that we produce extra to act as a safety net (i.e. product defects etc). and so we can offer to the general public after the campaign.

  "Samurai - Reunion is a collection of artwork featuring work from 16 artists from all over the world who have joined their efforts to celebrate male beauty in all its forms. From humans to demons, from elves to cat-men, Samurai is a treat for the eyes for those who appreciate the male body in a semi-realistic style. It is also a tribute to the Japanese drawing style that has influenced and united entire generations. While the title of the book is \u201cSamurai\u201d, the final work will contain far more than medieval and early-modern Japanese military nobility. This anthology will go beyond the stereotypical images that many think of when they see \u201csamurai\u201d to include iconic images of strength and beauty to celebrate Japanese culture and its inestimable artistic value shared by illustrators from all over the world. Since its first release in 2013 as an independent publishing label, Samurai has always featured pin-ups of male figures as well as stories and style studies, carried out over time by the numerous artists, from hobbyists to some popular professionals, who have crossed its pages. For years, the series remained independent to ensure that all the participants could print their own copies to sell at local fairs and conventions. The first three volumes, now almost unobtainable, have sold about a thousand copies. But what's new? With this Kickstarter, we are reviving the Samurai project involving different artists, adding a new hardcover version, and entrusting the manifacturing to an exp\u00e8rienced editorial label that could only enhance the product: Shaman publishing. Each volume of Samurai is different from the ones that came before, but our goal with each is to focus as much as we can on the beautiful detail. If this Kickstarter is successful, we\u2019ll be able to pay the costs of putting this collection together, costs which had to be borne by the artists themselves. This funding will allow us to focus on what we\u2019ve done best: providing high-quality, detailed images with a solid editorial basis. And now let's move on to the centerpiece of this campaign: the book itself! Samurai - Reunion will be a 90+ page A4 with hardcover and will host 16 artists from all over the world, each of whom will create 5 works for the project for a total of 80 illustrations. The rating of the works will be 16+. For printing we will rely on our trusted printer Skillpress. The featured artists for this latest edition of Samurai are: Dotswap - MadCursed - Miq - MLarty - Orsob - Paexie - Robynn Frauhn - Sam Schechter - Shaku - Solthrys - Vale - Vicious Mongrel - WendiBones - Yoss - Zara H - Zolaida Here are cropped samples of just a few of the interior illustrations.\u00a0 For the cover illustration we relied on Natto - Vulpetrope, who created their tattoed Samurai for us. \u00a0Also, if we reach some of this Kickstarter\u2019s stretch goals, we could unlock the UV coated cover and printed endpapers to give you a higher-quality Samurai than ever before.\u00a0Take a look at the stretch goal section to see a preview. \u00a0Here is the list of the rewards we are offering. \u00a0By supporting this campaign, you can get a Samurai - Reunion digital copy starting at \u20ac12 or a physical copy starting at \u20ac30 + shipping. If you want to secure some of our exclusive and limited merchandise, you can grab it for \u20ac15 + shipping. From \u20ac45 + shipping up you can have both the printed book and the merchandise. From \u20ac55 + shipping up, the most succulent rewards begin, such as the blank sketchbook with the cover designed by Paexie, a set of 2x enamel pins designed by MadCursed, the wooden standee designed by MLarty and a limited number of handprinted linoleographies by MadCursed. Or, if you have a friend interested in the project but you want to save a little on shipping costs, for \u20ac60 + shipping you can select the DOUBLE perk and thus get two books instead of one. If you want the postcard or book signed by WendiBones, we recommend that you keep an eye on the perks with the asterisk (*): from \u20ac50 upwards, the postcard will be signed; from \u20ac100 upwards, the book and postcard are both signed. The signed perks are limited in number - hurry up before they're all gone! We know that the pictures above do not do our products justice, so we decided to use the magnifying glass so you could look at our perks more closely.\u00a0Look at the close-up images below for more detail of this merch you do not want to miss! 15\u20ac + shipping In the merch pack you will find 1x A5 sticker sheet by Solthrys, 1x 35mm wooden enamel pin with backing card by Miq, 1x A5 blue foiled postcard by WendiBones, a set of 3x prints made by Dotswap, Soltrhys and Sam Schechter. The merch contained in the pack is not sold separately. If you want these amazing items you\u2019ll have to get the merch pack as a reward or an add-on! \u20ac10 + shipping The sketchbook with cover designed by Paexie will be A5 spiral with 50 blank pages and rough touch cover for a 100% grip while you draw or take notes. The paper for the interior will be Oikos extra white 150g, for brilliant and precise designs. \u20ac25 + shipping These two 40mm enamel pins dyed black with backing cards made by MadCursed will have 5 colors + 1 glitter color and the butterfly clutch. It is a set of two, and, you can tell by their design, they are inseparable. Starting at \u20ac50 + shipping (Limited to 30 pieces) Not available for purchase outside of the WOODEN STANDEE * and LINOLEOGRAPHY * limited perks. This standee with 3 uprights made by MLarty, will be printed on birch plywood from sustainable sources. The wood has an ever-changing grain, making each piece unique in its kind. The dimensions of the standee will be 10x15cm. Starting at \u20ac30 each + shipping (limited to 10 pieces)\u00a0 Not available for purchase outside the respective LINOLEOGRAPHY * limited perk. This 17x24cm print is a limited edition created exclusively by MadCursed for this campaign. To make it, MadCursed will carve a piece of linoleum with special tools and use it as a matrix to make this print, of which you can see an example below. As the process is entirely manual, the results may differ from this mockup. As a special reward for the first supporters, we will give a A5 postcard made by Miq to every backer who has signed up for a physical perk within the first 24 hours of the campaign. Thank you so much! If our campaign reaches a certain goal, we would be able to give you limited merchandise created exclusively for the campaign. These goals will help us cover more of the costs of printing the books and getting these rewards to you! Some stretch goals are specific to certain tiers. If you want to receive them all, you will need to select a MERCH tier of \u20ac45 or higher. If our Twitter post reaches 500 or more retweets, each backer who has selected a physical perk will receive a 14x14cm postcard by Vale printed on Sirio pearl paper. Retweet this post to help us reach this goal! \u00a0Do you want a product but it is not available in the perk you want to select? Do you want faster shipping or tracking to make sure you don't lose your package? Here is the section for you. At the time of the pledge, you can add the following products to your order and also change the type of shipment. However, we recommend that you read the 'shipping' section below to see if shipment tracking is already included in your shipment. If you do not select an add-on when you pick your reward, want to wait \u00a0before doing so, or if you prefer to pay with Paypal, you can also wait for us to send out the BackerKit surveys, currently scheduled for January 2022. From there you can order all the add-ons you wish and pay with Paypal or credit card! The money raised through this campaign will cover the production of the 64 remaining illustrations, the printing of the book in a minimum run of 200 copies, the labor and shipping costs. A small part of these funds will be used to pay the graphic designer and proofreader in the English language. Part of the revenue - around 10-13% - will be reserved for Kickstarter, Stripe and BackerKit for management costs and other services, including sending surveys and managing add-ons and digital rewards. In addition, 20% of the earnings (excluding taxes) will be shared among the participating artists. The more we can raise - such as through stretch goals - the more these artists can be paid! Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that helps creators fund their ideas. The creators usually offer something in return to the backers who supported them. If you support our campaign, and if the campaign is successful, you will get digital or physical rewards based on the perk you have chosen. With the success of the campaign, and around January 2022, we will send you a survey to fill out with your email address and home address. Please make sure that the email address you entered on Kickstarter is one you use often, because we will send you notifications about your rewards to that address. Digital rewards will be sent starting February 2022 and physical copies will be sent out starting April 2022. We\u2019re hoping that you will have your packages by April 2022. We will use BackerKit to collect surveys from our backers and send digital content, which will not expire like any normal link! For physical rewards, we will send you a survey asking for your home address, the shipping options you have chosen and the add-ons you have selected. Shipping costs on add-ons will vary based on the weight of the selected product. We will send you the surveys around January 2022 so, if you plan to move, wait until March before filling them. Digital rewards will be delivered starting in February 2022. Physical rewards will be delivered starting in April 2022. Shaman publishing is located in the European Union. For this reason, international shipments and in particular those directed to Asia, America and Oceania, may suffer delays that are beyond our control. We also do not ship to certain countries. Also, some countries may close for Covid. We ask you to be patient or, alternatively, to select the tracked shipping option to always know where your package is. We will try to send updates as we can, but without tracked shipping, we cannot tell you where your package might be. Additionally, you can select the priority or registered shipping option at the time of pledging. Select only one, not both! In case you select both, we will send you the package by registered mail but it will not be as fast as shipping with priority mail. When you select the tracked shipping option, be sure that your country is not included in our 'tracking shipping only' list below. This is a list of the countries we ship to by registered/tracked mail only:\u00a0 SAUDI ARABIA, ARGENTINA, BOLIVIA, BRAZIL, CHILE, CHINA, COLOMBIA, ECUADOR, EMIRATES, HONG KONG, INDIA, MEXICO, PUERTO RICO, PERU, SOUTH AFRICA, URUGUAY, PARAGUAY, VENEZUELA, VIETNAM. Shaman was born as an independent dark and alternative label in 2019 from an idea of MadCursed and WendiBones. The first artbook + comic anthology project 'The Four Horsemen' has sold over 200 copies worldwide. Now, Shaman is a full-fledged publishing label and property of Kudos Publishing.

Notre revue d'art HEY! modern art & pop culture est bilingue (FR+ANGL) et s'adresse au monde entier. Elle pr\u00e9sente les arts outsider et figuratifs pop hors normes (Lowbrow, Surreal Pop, Visionary art, Tattoo art, Graphic Novel, Comics, Rock Poster, Post Graffiti, Art Singulier...) et l\u2019ensemble des arts graphiques d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de la culture pop en tant qu\u2019expressions majeures de notre temps ; \u00e9manations nobles, issues de l\u2019intelligence populaire.\u00a0\u00a0 www.heymodernartandpopculture.com We have a devouring passion for landscapes that are freed from the norm, we are fighting to create an alternative vision of a one-sided culture, helping to unveil a whole mass of contemporary art looked down upon by critics and the big market. This approach supports artists to get through the locked doors of museums and art galleries. To fulfill this mission, we have created a unique magazine. Dedicated to contemporary figurative pop art and born from the codes of worldwide counterculture, our mag transmits the very energy of our time. Our art magazine HEY! modern art & pop culture is bilingual (FR + UK) and is aimed at the whole world. It presents outsider and figurative pop art (Lowbrow, Surreal Pop, Visionary Art, Tattoo Art, Graphic Novels, Comics, Rock Post, Post Graffiti, Singular Art ...) and graphic arts derived from pop culture as meaningful expressions of our time; noble escapes, coming  from popular intelligence. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pour une connexion efficace entre artiste, public, collectionneur : nous devons maintenir une action indispensable \u00e0 l'ensemble des courants mondiaux et artistes internationaux dont les r\u00e9alisations ne passent pas les barri\u00e8res institutionnelles et m\u00e9diatiques.

The figurative pop art defended in HEY! modern art & pop culture is at the exact crossroads of scholarly culture and pop culture, where there is a reconciliation of \"knowledge\" and \"self-taught experience\".

  "This collection is inspired by our daily struggles of doing house chores. Chores are mundane and never-ending, and we never could really get away from it, especially so now that we are spending more time at home.\u00a0 Since we have to do it, why not let's find the joy from within? If you have been doing lots of chores already, I hope these designs will bring you joy and spur you on!

  "For Questions, Interviews, & Photo Requests: rootsofcreation@gmail.com We have heard you loud and clear...YOU WANT NEW MUSIC! That's exactly what we want to give you; but in order to make that happen, we asked for some support and you really came through. Today, your OVERWHELMING SUPPORT has helped us reach out INITIAL GOAL to make \"Dub Free or Die\" a reality...THANK YOU SO MUCH! If we can hit the $35,000 STRETCH GOAL in these FINAL HOURS, we will have enough support to start the recording process for: We will deliver AT LEAST TWO SINGLES from EACH PROJECT for backers to hear...BEFORE THE GENERAL PUBLIC! \ud83c\udfb8 CLICK HERE for a SNEAK PREVIEW of 2 SONGS from these 2 RECORDS \ud83c\udfb8 We're ready to prepare this new music, but the only thing that changed in our equation is that we don\u2019t have the SHOWS and merchandise sales from the road that we'd normally have at our disposal to help release all the NEW MUSIC that we've been working on and getting more and more excited to share with you. 7NA - Dub Version 7NA - Vocal Version featuring Hayley Jane We're currently at 78% of our goal & CLIMBING. \u00a0Thank you, so very much!!!\u00a0 To celebrate reaching 75% in ONE DAY, we're NOW INCLUDING a Limited Edition RoC guitar pick to EVERY REWARD PACKAGE OF $25.00 (and up) as a BONUS ITEM! Kickstarter allow us to team up DIRECTLY WITH FANS to bring our ideas to life. If you want to hear all the songs BEFORE the rest of the world (and make sure the RoC train doesn\u2019t fall off the tracks), choose one of the many rewards laid out on the project page to the right. \u201cDub Free or Die\u201d is our first self produced album made for our DIE HARD fans who love that progressive rock and jam meets reggae sound. It will be released once we reach our initial project goal and your support will help us promote the record, press the vinyl, hire graphic designers, and everything else that goes into a new album release. It\u2019s pretty simple how this project works\u2014 we meet the initial goal and we can put \"Dub Free or Die\" into the world. The more support we get, the more NEW RoC MUSIC we can make...will there be: Kickstarter is ALL OR NOTHING, so if we don't reach or surpass the initial goal of $20,000 by the deadline...NO ONE GETS CHARGED & THE PROJECT DOES NOT FUND!!! That means no t-shirts, definitely no vinyl...NOT A THING.

We\u2019re done talking about last year and we\u2019re not gonna let it all happen again THIS YEAR. Roots of Creation spent AGES building ourselves up, touring like crazy, all while still making records. We can\u2019t really play shows now, so this is us saying \"Hey, we\u2019re going to continue to adapt.\" To translate: I am a single dad with two daughters who like many of you, fought, learned, and adapted with livestreams and online merchandise sales to this new reality. We need to keep creating for you and for ourselves by any means necessary.\u00a0 Dramatically shifting from doing over 150 shows a year for more than a decade and hugging each & every one of you at the merch table night after night to live streaming from the basement, going through a divorce, and becoming a remote learning teacher slash principal for my 8 year old daughter....man, it was jarring.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get me wrong! This extra time with family has been a BLESSING, but we can\u2019t let this seismic life shift stop RoC from creating, writing, producing and releasing new music for you. Please support, check out the project, and spread the word!\u00a0 Your help in bringing this to life has officially been requested.\u00a0 ANY TYPE OF SUPPORT HELPS. That support can be sharing this project on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and anywhere you can to help spread the word. Thank you.

  "We are Eternal Ascent, a power metal band from the United States (yes, we do in fact have power metal here in the states). \u00a0 We're embarking upon our very first full length album. \u00a0All of the music is written and we've even recorded the first single titled \"The Lie,\" which we shot a music video for and you should 100% check it out in the video below. \u00a0We hope that this single along with our very first song, \"Take to the Skies,\" will give you a good sneak peak of what an entire album would sound like from us. \u00a0 We consider ourselves a culmination of bands like Helloween, Kamelot, Megadeth, and Lost Horizon. \u00a0To summarize: a combination of powerful choruses, thrashing riffs, unforgettable melodies, and ripping solos. \u00a0Who doesn't want that? We have been working on this album for over 2 years, and now the only thing left to do is hit the recording studio. \u00a0Because of the advancements in home recording we've been able to get all of the pre-production completed for guitars, bass, and drums, but still need to get guitars re-amped, vocals tracked, and of course get the songs mixed and mastered.\u00a0 \u00a0To note, we've also already paid for guest musicians, orchestrations, and all of the artwork.\u00a0 As noted above we've already gotten so much done, but the final stage of the process is where we are hoping you can help us out. \u00a0Of course treasures await those who will lend their aid! We've got some really awesome merch for you to enjoy in exchange for your support. \u00a0If you're thinking of pre-ordering our album, you may want to consider donating to the $10 reward package which includes a digital copy of the album. Tier 1: \u00a0The Supporter For just a single dollar you can get TWO songs! \u00a0Get a digital copy of \"The Lie\" and \"Take to the Skies.\" Tier 2: Charitable Hero! Get a miniature version of the album. \u00a0This will include what we consider the \"top 5\" songs on the album. \u00a0We'll also send a personalized thank you and give you exclusive access to our Discord! Tier 3: The Digital Knight For those of you who prefer your albums in digital format, this is the BEST way to order the album. \u00a0Get the entire Reclamations album in mp3 format. Tier 4: \u00a0The Collector (US and Canada only!) For those who want the best of both worlds, get the Reclamations album on both physical and digital format. Tier 5: Master of Merch - BEST VALUE - (US and Canada only!) Get this limited edition T-shirt PLUS a digital copy of the album. \u00a0This T-Shirt will NOT be going back into production so this will be your only chance to grab it. Tier 6: The Merch Collector Did you like all the stuff in the previous tier's and wish it was all in one package? \u00a0Wish granted. \u00a0Get the limited edition T-shirt, as well as a physical and digital copy of Reclamations.\u00a0 Tier 7: Standard Bearer (US and Canada) For the hardcore fans, get your hands on a huge 6'x3' banner with the bands logo on it. \u00a0Of course this will also come with a physical and digital copy of Reclamations.\u00a0 Once this album is fully funded we plan to have it released on December 3rd Worldwide. \u00a0We are truly looking forward to sharing this album with you all. \u00a0It's been a labor of love and it is something we are extremely proud of. \u00a0If you have any questions about us or the project, please don't hesitate to reach out and we'll be more than happy to speak with you about it. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you.",
  "Hello. We are The Sweetheart Revue, a band from Glasgow making music for the love of it. We've been working on our second album for a while and we're looking to raise enough money to release it on vinyl and to ensure it gets the production and promotion it deserves. We're hoping to release three \u00a0digital singles and make videos for each of them. Our first album, The Silence and the Common Sense is on Spotify etc, if you want to check it out. We've faced a variety of obstacles recording this album, Covid just for starters, but the joy of making music with each other has held us together as a band.\u00a0",
  "\n\nAt Plant Food for People, our mission has always been to bring together food, family and tradition. Thats why we\u2019ve put our heart and soul into every recipe we share with you, whether it's our slow cooked pinto beans, zesty house made nacho cheese or our smokey jackfruit carnitas. We believe in giving you the very best plant based ingredients. Add in our fresh made salsas and you have \u00a0a recipe for well balanced, multifaceted flavors full of life force and tasty goodness! When we started in 2011 on the sidewalks of Highland Park, we helped change what it meant to be a food vendor on the busy boulevards of Los Angeles by adding our own version of real street tacos\u00a0to the neighborhood. It's not always easy being first, but being true to ourselves was number one in our\u00a0decision to remain at the forefront of the movement. It was truly a turning point not only for ourselves, but for our community as well. We like to call ourselves Taco Activists because we use our food to bring attention to bigger ideas like world health, human rights, and animal equality without even saying a word. We respect everyone's journey and do our best to lead by example. When people try our food for the first time, they wonder HOW it tastes so good! It sparks a curiosity and opens the doors of possibilities. It creates a hunger for knowledge! We are so grateful, because it's how we've met some of our closest friends! In the process of our rigorous campaign we have outgrown and worn out our little blue trailer. We have a short lived opportunity to make a permanent home for our Plant food for People family at a spot in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, just a few blocks from where we first started, but we need to act FAST! We need $150,000 to buy out the current owner, add new equipment, and an outdoor drain for our trailer so we can keep it there, all in a matter of 30 days! $150,000 is A LOT to come up with when time is limited, and we liked the idea of having our community and friends be a part of this major step!\u00a0 With our goal reached, it will be a WIN WIN situation! You\u2019ll be able to enjoy our T-N-T(TACOS, NACHOS and TORTAS) 7 days a week, along with a BRAND NEW weekend and brunch menu! Friday nights will have BEER AND TACO SPECIALS, and we\u2019ll be PERMANENTLY adding TAQUITOS and GUACAMOLE to our famously small menu! Our team craft beer expert will be sure to have only the best and most delicious vegan craft and microbrew beer from all over Los Angeles. No beer for you? We\u2019ll always be sure to have a fresh Kombucha on tap.\u00a0 This brings us to our vision for Plant Food for People. Ultimately, we see a franchise opportunity in our family brand. Our recipes are wholesome and simple, our menu is small, fresh and delicious, and the space we need to operate is minimal. Our brand is quickly becoming recognized, and has become a standard in the vegan street food community. We want to help entrepreneurs all over the USA and the world start a revolution IN THEIR \u00a0OWN communities!\u00a0 Help us move from street to stand and pioneer another movement in our beautifully diverse city! ALL PLANT BASED, INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS, MOUTHWATERING TACOS, NACHOS AND TORTAS FOR ALL!\u00a0 Check out one of our proudest moments! Plant Food for People serves their JACKFRUIT tacos to PETA Latino",
  "All growing up, my grandmother Bobi has shared memories with me describing her encounters with aliens and UFOs. These were intense, personal, metaphysical experiences that profoundly affected her. Beginning when she was a teenager and recurring into her 60s, the\u00a0experiences range from sightings to full-on physical encounters, the causes of which remain unknown. With Bobi's help, I am filming 3 dramatic reenactments of her extraterrestrial experiences. In the first, the role of Bobi will be performed by my cousin Tracy, in the second my mother Diana, and in the third, Bobi herself. Each reenactment will utilize prosthetics, costumes, lighting and practical effects to vividly render her memories in a dreamlike, expressionist style. Our production team will film them all at Bobi's home in Long Island, New York, throughout the summer of 2022. They'll be cut together with interviews and staged B-roll into a 15 minute short. The goal is to make a standalone artwork that documents Bobi's memories and expands on the experience of hearing her tell them. Personally, this is an opportunity to collaborate on an art project with Bobi - who has long\u00a0painted, sculpted and sewn - and the rest of our family, that will result in something I couldn't come up with alone. These reenactments are largely non-verbal, so their impact will rely on the ability of the cinematography and sound design to shine.\u00a0$14,000\u00a0is the lowest amount of money that will allow us to produce something close to the quality required of this project while paying everyone involved. This covers our expenses for the 2 weekends it will take to shoot these reenactments, with some left for post, taxes, and various incremental fees: Director: Ian Faria -\u00a0Ian is a filmmaker from Long Island, NY. In 2021 he co-directed the short film Nicole with Edy Modica, which premiered on Eternal Family and screened at the Bushwick Film Festival. He makes films with the comedy group Simple Town; their work together has been featured on Adult Swim, NoBudge, and the New York Television Festival. (My website) Cinematographer/Producer: Alex Bliss - Alex is a director, editor, and cinematographer, whose 2020 short Journal was selected for the Brooklyn Film Festival and the Bushwick Film Festival. He co-runs Life World, an arts/performance venue in Brooklyn. (Alex's website) Producer: Sarah Wilson - Sarah is a producer and comedian based in Brooklyn. She co-hosts the comedy podcast Raisin Man Arena and recently produced a feature adaptation of Tynan DeLong's Dad and Step-Dad, set for release in 2022. Production Design: Becca Brooks Morin - Becca is a production designer, art director, and set decorator from Baltimore, Maryland. She's worked on Strawberry Mansion (Sundance 2021), Rat Film, and The Art of Self Defense, music videos for Angel Olsen and MGMT, and various shorts from Wham City. (Becca's website) Music: Kaye Loggins -\u00a0Kaye is a composer and producer from Atlanta, Georgia, who records music under the name Time Wharp. Kaye's work has been described by Pitchfork as \"radiant, giddy, some real standing-on-top-of-a-waterfall shit.\" Her next album, Spiro World, will be released in June 2022 via Leaving Records. (Time Wharp on Spotify) I'm aiming to convey the emotional truth of Bobi's experiences from an empathetic, personal perspective. While the reenactments are at times unsettling or pretty or funny or fantastical, they're always sincere. Bobi's stories will be delivered and expanded on with a sense of wonder, using romantic visual effects to express the more abstract, difficult-to-describe qualities of her encounters. The events being reenacted occurred largely without a word spoken - so the performed scenes will use many of the same tools as silent films to create a heightened sense of reality. We'll take advantage of theatrical lighting, emotive sounds, dynamic blocking and a music score expanding on diagetic sounds specific to Bobi's home to build a remembered world verging on the magical. Interstitials between the reenactments will include staged B-roll shot throughout Bobi's house and neighborhood, as well as interviews with Bobi and other family members. The nature of this material may vary depending on the outcome of the reenactment shoots. June - August September - October September - December January - March, 2023",

Eleanor has already done a multitude of interviews on TV, radio including the Guilty Feminist podcast at the BFI - there\u2019s so much support already for it. Our film has a website where you can find out more: www.xtrillionfilm.com WATCH THE TRAILER: Never has a film been more important - only recently scientists found that plastic is omnipresent in our environment and our bodies. The world is at a crossroads where we can encourage system change, enabling a healthier future for our planet and us. This has been a labour of love and dedication. Please help us achieve this!\u00a0 X Trillion follows the journey of 14 women as they sail a gruelling 3000 miles across the North Pacific Ocean to one of the most remote places on Earth, but also the location of the densest accumulation of ocean plastic - the North Pacific Gyre, or the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\u200b\u00a0 A crew of scientists to packaging designers, engineers, teachers, artists and more, they carry out cutting edge research into the impacts of plastics and microplastics both on the natural world and on human health, and explore the practical and emotional responses to one of the biggest global challenges of our time. This is the 10th eXXpedition mission and its most ambitious yet. With the realisation that there is no silver bullet to solve this monumental problem, the voyages, led by Emily Penn, aim to inspire women from a broad spectrum of professions to dedicate their lives to finding solutions, creating an army of ambassadors to transform our future. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is a story of hope, filled with life, magic and a call to action that burns with optimism. One thousand miles from land. The closest humans orbit above in the space station.\u00a0A lone boat awakens to calm. Then, a fragment. Followed by a toothbrush, a washing basket, a garden chair. Surface samples bring up handfuls of tiny microplastics. Looking out over the ocean, a few pieces of plastic float visibly in sight. But a realisation dawns \u2013 we\u2019re looking at a dense soup of tiny pieces. The crew record an average of half a million pieces of microplastics per square kilometre here, and that is only on the surface. Who knows how much is in the 5000 metres of water beneath. \u00a0\u201cWe are about as far away from civilisation as one can get. \u00a0Yet here, all around us, is evidence of our daily lives on land. \u00a0Our choices. Our purchases. This is your old toothbrush, my empty shampoo bottle, the lid to his coffee cup.\u201d \u2013 Michelle Byle, packaging designer There are thought to be 500 times more pieces of microplastic in the sea than stars in our galaxy. And every tiny fragment of plastic in the the Great Pacific Garbage Patch has come from somewhere. Some things are so vast, complex and far away that they seem impossible to grasp, and harder to recount. But change is wrought through personal testimony, and heroes are made at sea. X Trillion takes us aboard with the all-women crew of eXXpedition as they sail out of their comfort zone and into the unknown, becoming witnesses to a global problem and emerging transformed. The scientist. \u00a0The activist. The circular economist. The designer. From stargazers to slide analysers, impossible problems call on us all. This is the story of a boat of strangers in a vast ocean, cutting a course from despair to hope; through research, discussions and personal journeys. In a crew built of artists, engineers, teachers and thinkers we find a floating model for moving forward. Embarking upon the adventure with goals and motivations both personal and professional, the crew members tackle extreme emotional and physical challenges. As we get to know our characters on the wild sea, relationships between them develop through the daily rhythms of life aboard. We follow them as they gather scientific data for ten international research projects, witnessing their emotional highs and numbing lows as they uncover explosive truths about the impact of toxics on our bodies \u2013 female bodies in particular \u2013 and come to terms with the gaping holes in existing research. From observational footage of life on board \u2013 freezing night shifts, seasickness and solidarity \u2013 to sweeping documentation of the wilderness \u2013 soaring albatrosses and a pod of miraculous dolphins \u2013 X Trillion reframes the exploration narrative to fit a contemporary crisis, where the untouched is untouched no longer. First-hand accounts enable viewers to share in the incredible adventure of the women who sailed right through the most catastrophic environmental disaster created by humans, and to realise just what it will take to emerge at the other side. Post Production: We have locked picture which means that the edit is exactly as we want it. It's ready to go - we just need some final funds to finalise the colour grade, sound, music and graphics to make the film shine. We will be working with an award-winning musician and sound designer on music and audio for the film. We have a colourist onboard to make the images as beautiful and rich in colour as they deserve to be. We have a fantastic designer to create the final titles and graphics as well as create promotional and educational materials get the message to as many people as possible.\u00a0 Any extra money raised would enable us to organise public screenings in the UK, Europe and to as many countries as possible (and to subtitle it into relevant languages). The life of the film:\u00a0 Once completed, the film will have its own journey - this is what we're aiming for... - World Premiere to be announced - Festival rounds - we'll be screening the film in international film festivals. - Broadcast: We have a sales agent onboard who already has streamers and broadcasters around the world excited to screen the film. This is a brilliant way of getting the film seen by as many people as possible. - Community and educational screenings: Alongside this, communities around the UK and the world will be able to use the film for organised screenings. We want as many people to see the film and to spark a debate. Stories about our environment are plastered all over the news daily and there is a growing awareness of the need for change.\u00a0 But with that awareness is a deep feeling of despair which often leads to paralysis. This film is an inspiring, optimistic story for our times.\u00a0 It will not only show that a better understanding of the problem and a multi-faceted collaboration can change the world, it will also inspire all people to get involved in whatever way they can and will especially show young women, who are traditionally underrepresented, that working in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Maths) can help to change the future of our planet! This is a story of adventure, exploration, joy, wonder and possibilities for our future. We have worked with a brilliant team of talented musicians, editors, story developers and more to reach this point.\u00a0 OUR CORE TEAM IS: Director: Eleanor Church/Lark Rise Pictures\n \u00a0\u00a0Eleanor has a solid background in documentary \ufb01lm-making, with a particular focus on environmental/human stories.

  "I'm excited to announce that my next single release will be a song I wrote with David Micheal and Taylor Baynum called \"House.\" It is one of my most favorite songs I have ever written and I believe in it so much. It's deep, it's vulnerable and I can't wait for y'all to hear it. \u00a0That's why I am asking for your help. I want to create enough content to back up my next project but that comes at a cost. Between the music video, lyric video, album artwork, distribution and many other things the price does add up. I can sit here and tell you how hard this year was but I know it was a hard year for everyone. I'm hoping to create art that will move you and show you into my life. I can't thank you enough for walking this journey with me and I hope that I can make you proud.",
  "I grew up to be an engineer. \u00a0But deep down I knew that one day I needed to write music. \u00a0Well I\u2019m 40 (which is a great age to start something new), and I just wrote and produced the hybrid orchestral score for a short film. It\u2019s a Star Wars fan film with a little feel of fantasy, called Secrets of the Trials. \u00a0It\u2019s the second of three, produced by Lachlan McClain, with the work of lots of talented creatives and artists.\u00a0 The cast and crew did a fantastic job and evidently had fun while making it!\u00a0 It seems producing it was a great time for all involved last year and this year fans (including myself) got to experience some of that excitement in the theater or by viewing and interacting online .\u00a0 I love it! It's so beautiful \u00a0- Lachlan McClain, Producer I want to make a copy of the soundtrack available to be able to remember and relive those moments. \u00a0I want to make a physical copy as a permanent momento for those involved as well as for the fans, and at the same time provide higher quality audio files instead of just mp3s. Andrew this was fantastic! - Mary Caulkins I plan to include all 15 tracks plus a bonus track of the trailer music for 16 total. \u00a0They contain several themes and melodies, with some that reappear, sometimes in a different arrangement. Some tracks are more cinematic in nature and some are more atmospheric or background, as you would expect for music written for a story. Your music kept the viewers focused,\u00a0 emotionally and visually, on the story. - Craig Ferrin, Phd Music Professor There is even an electronic piece during the credits that came out of the score. Oh and I can't forget the romantic and mysterious numbers. Since this is an action sci-fi adventure there has to be heroic and intense music with enough suspense to keep us engaged. By itself this music is great to get your own creative juices flowing. \"That soundtrack was great.\" Ricc Harding\u00a0 A HUGE shout out to Andrew Thiriot, composer of the original music soundtrack...a stunning job that creates a professional film! - Brian McNatt\u00a0 The minimum contribution is $10, plus $6 to cover shipping in the US and a little more for other countries. And you get your own copy of the CD Album of course! In a shrink-wrapped plastic jewel case, complete with pictures of the cast in costume, shipped to your door (or your mailbox). If you contribute more, well...you get more copies. Plus you'll get a digital downloadable mp3 version by email. \"Wow! Incredible job Andrew!! The music is beautiful.\" - Crystal Thiriot Like usual on kickstarter it only gets funded if we reach the goal. We have a shorter than normal time frame so we can get fans their CDs soon -\u00a0 Only 23 Days!! After the successful campaign closes April 1st (April Fools Day) it takes two weeks to clear the funds, then time to manufacture and ship. \u00a0 Which means you'll get your very own copy by the beginning of May if not before. So don't wait for time to slip by - pledge right now so we can get this funded and you can get a surprise in May. \u00a0\"As a HUGE star wars fan and knowing you're awesome this'll be great!!!\" - Ben Brockbank",
  "Horizontal Drift is an album of new works for unusual solo instruments written over the last decade. This focused collection marks a shift in music-making strategy for me: As a follow-up to my debut CD, Waterlines, which featured a collection of pieces medium-sized ensembles, I wanted to redirect the focus to solo works. Working closely with specific performers on their custom-made instruments, I would create individualized, crystalline showpieces\u00a0for a few gifted soloists who share my passion for rare tunings and timbres. This album is the fruit of those collaborations.\u00a0 Many of the works on the CD feature electronics, which are similarly custom-crafted to explore different paradigms in each piece. T\u00e2rgul, for the Romanian stroh violin, replicates the sound of the instrument's metal horn using two megaphones for a scratchy, low-fi veneer.\u00a0 In Tesserae, the sympathetic strings of the viola d'amore are paired with\u00a0synthesized models, creating a resonance-drenched echo chamber for folk-inspried modal meanderings. In contrast, Linear A, written for the Bohlen-Pierce clarinet, deals exclusively with canons, sculpting live-captured\u00a0phrases around a solo line. Another foregrounded aspect\u00a0is my interest in microtonality.\u00a0Each of the pieces on the CD explores a particular microtonal tuning. The retuned piano of\u00a0Lost Time Triptych\u00a0resonates with four quarter-tones, while Nancarrow-inspired flourishes spew out\u00a0from the 31-tone Fokker Organ in Forty-Nine, Forty-Nine. Finally,\u00a0electronic and microtonal strands intertwine, as\u00a0folk inflections on the quarter-tone guitar are stretched into loops and\u00a0languorous\u00a0phrases in\u00a0Horizontal Drift. The brilliant featured soloists are Amy Advocat (Bohlen-Pierce clarinet), Marco Fusi (viola d'amore), Maximilian Haft (vioara cu goarna), Daniel Lippel (quarter-tone guitar), and Marilyn Nonken (retuned piano).\u00a0 With luck (and funding secured), the record is slated for release in the Fall of 2021 on New Focus Recordings.\u00a0",
  "What It Is The Misc. Magazine features beautiful photography, forgotten histories, unknown professions, new experiences, road trips, random facts, books (always) and of course, baked goods. The Misc. is for people who, like us, don't fit into one category. Each volume of The Misc. contains a variety of engaging, quirky, artistic features for explorers, history buffs, fiction junkies, and people who like puns. The Misc. is intelligent but never stuffy, original and creative but never obtuse, witty but never mean spirited.  Our publication is about exploring the many categories the world has to offer with a hefty dose of lyricism and plenty of whimsy. You will never leave our pages without having gleaned something new. Hopefully, you'll feel more lighthearted, too. \u00a0 Who We Are We are creatives, photographers, writers, explorers, makers, and travelers who like so many things we needed a magazine to put them in. And we need help building our tribe. The content is  ready for Vol. 01, but we need funds to get The Misc. into print and into your hands. (We'll have a digital version too!) We already have much of Vol. 02 planned and lots of ideas for coming years. There is no shortage of topics to discover, and we value all who would buy a ticket and come on this journey with us. Table of Contents I don't want to spoil it all, but here are few things to expect in the Vol. 01. The Specs \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "Occult Detective Quarterly is an exciting new venture for enthusiasts of those who dare to probe beyond the Veil, those who face the psychic, the supernatural and the strange. Arrogant amateurs, scholars and philosophers; hardened detectives, and innocents who have no choice - these are the characters who will fill our pages. Think Carnacki, John Silence and Flaxman Low. Think pulp and noir, and the disenchanted PI \u2013 Sam Spade staring into Hell itself. Or stand in contemporary shadows and watch the John Constantines of this world battle the next one.  Even more than this, we want to rip apart the boundaries, and explore the limits of occult investigative fiction. We're already looking for, and finding, new approaches, new characters in unlikely settings. From First Nation female investigators to gay detectives scouring a decadent 19th century Paris, from the South American bruja to the hoodoo-woman \u2013 we want all these to join the time-honoured ranks. A perfect-bound print magazine, along with an e-version for day-to-day browsing, ODQ will bring you fabulous fiction by great names from the field, and introduce you to exciting new writers. All accompanied by fearsome art, fascinating articles and reviews.  Editing the journal will be Sam Gafford, an experienced writer of dark fiction, editor and William Hope Hodgson scholar, from the United States, and John Linwood Grant, a lifelong addict of supernatural fiction, blogger of the weird and a writer of strange period horror, from the UK.  We already have a great line-up for the first couple of issues, and now we want to make sure that we take it to the next level. Your pledges will ensure that we can bring this together. We want our contributors to get a fair deal, our journal to be stylish and our readers to be delighted. This Kickstarter will ensure that we get off the ground running. It will guarantee not only that we can offer subscriptions with confidence, but that we can expand our plans, such as: Contribute now and you'll be in at the start, with extra rewards and recognition, ready to come with us as we journey into forbidden territories... $2800. At this level, we're going to add some incredible art from two outstanding book illustrators. All backers will receive an exclusive 10x14 poster of M S Corley's The Hog, an illustration from his 'Carnacki: Recorder of Things Strange' comic, which should be out later this year.  And there's more - we will commission a tailor-made B/W illustration from M Wayne Miller for the interior of the magazine. Not only is Wayne a master of the 'weird adventure' illustration in general, but he's already worked in partnership with Willie Meikle for many of Mr Meikle's excellent Carnacki and other period stories.  Quality and satisfaction are our watchwords, so we're not going to add dozens of Kickstarter goals for the sake of it. But we love both art and fiction, so our Second Stretch Goal is a double again. If we can achieve $3100, we're going to add a brand new piece of commissioned B/W art from the talented Mutartis Boswell, AND we're going to publish the entirety of Ted E Grau's novelette 'Monochrome' in Issue One, rather than doing it in two parts as originally announced. More horrors for your dollars (and pounds, of course), folks. Share, pledge, celebrate! If you have already joined us, please give a thought to sharing the Kickstarter on Facebook, Twitter or elsewhere. Or tell a couple of friends about it and what's on offer. In the last ten days, every penny counts towards making ODQ the best it can be. ",
  "Who we are!\u00a0 Hello! Welcome to our Kickstarter! In English Please is a non-profit printing a free magazine for the people of Madrid to learn English. Learn through context, build your vocabulary and immerse yourself in the English language in a new way. The project is a magazine that can be used by students to learn English. Given out as homework by teachers, collected at academies by students, or used by workers to improve their level. All for free. \n It\u2019s also a way for teachers to do activities in class, through listening, pronunciation, reading, building vocabulary and playing games. Above all, it\u2019s a fun, easy way to add an extra layer into students learning.  \n So, that\u2019s who we are. In English Please is a free magazine that will teach you English. We want to print at least 1000 copies.\u00a0Note: The exclusive digital Magazine is not the PRINT magazine. It is a different magazine only for contributors.\u00a0 About our magazine \"In English Please\"\u00a0 In English Please contains articles on any topic that\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s not a grammar book!\nThe magazine is perfect for levels from intermediate upwards and each article has an indication of its difficulty. We guarantee there will be new vocab for every reader of the magazine, and even if your level isn\u2019t high, the magazine is easily accessible and lower levels can gain from it. \u00a0 Our magazine works with our Facebook Page, we\u2019re here to help you with your learning, clarify misunderstandings and to immerse you, in another way, in the world of English. \n\n\u00a0 As we\u2019ve said, the magazine is perfect for teachers and self motivated learners, you have difficult vocabulary defined for you in Spanish, questions to test your understanding of each article and suggestions for you and the teacher to do more with the material.\u00a0 Why paper? Many people have spoken about making a digital resource, but aside from all the competition, having something physical that you can complete is more powerful, motivational and has more presence. It\u2019s satisfying to fill it up and complete it. We\u2019re all guilty of being distracted by our phones and the internet, reading something separate from our digital world can help separate our guilty pleasures from our long term goals.And, I know those goals, learning English is obligatory and really desirable. I've spoken to hundreds of students and more or less the theme is the same.\u00a0 \"I want work abroad\"\u00a0 \"I need it for my job\"\u00a0 \"I like languages\"Everyone is interested, engaged and enthusiastic to learn. But class isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough to just watch movies or series either. Students have to immerse themselves in more ways than one and being motivated to study, doing homework and investing time is important. \u00a0\u00a0 \nWhy we\u2019re here! I was in England around New Year\u2019s Eve when the idea struck me. My friend owns two free magazines in Plymouth, my home town. And I thought, \u2018what if I could run a free magazine for people in Madrid to learn English?\u2019. I asked her for her help and she agreed. That was the seed. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019ve found ourselves looking for ways to fund such a project. Paying for this project and printing a free magazine was originally a question of attracting academies, teachers and other serious parties who were serious about targeting a large group of Spaniards interested in learning English. Advertising, basically. Interest is huge, however academies, teachers, teaching applications and websites are all nervous about investing in an unmade project. \n\n\u00a0 This is why we chose Kickstarter. We want to get this project up and running and show that academies, teachers and people are interested in this product. Our short term goal is to have a monthly magazine that\u2019s used by at least one thousand students. Our long term goal is to have every single academy in Madrid sharing and using our magazine.\u00a0 --------------------------\u00a0 Although our magazine is for Intermediates and above. It's better if there are no doubts! Here it is in Spanish.\u00a0 \u00a1Sobre nosotros!\u00a0 \u00a1Hola! \u00a1Bienvenidos a nuestro Kickstarter! In English Please es una iniciativa sin \u00e1nimo de lucro que busca lanzar una revista gratis para que la gente de Madrid aprenda ingl\u00e9s. Aprender conociendo el contexto, aumentar el vocabulario y facilitar la inmersi\u00f3n para que aprendas ingl\u00e9s de forma diferente. Esta revista es una herramienta \u00fatil para estudiantes de ingl\u00e9s. Tambi\u00e9n pueden usarlas los profesores de ingl\u00e9s como deberes para sus alumnos, las academias, o los profesionales para mejorar su nivel. Todo ello, gratis.\n\u00a0 El material y las actividades son \u00fatiles para los profesores en sus clases: ejercicios de comprensi\u00f3n auditiva, pronunciaci\u00f3n, lectura, vocabulario y juegos. Sobre todo, es una forma divertida y f\u00e1cil para estudiantes de complementar el aprendizaje del idioma.\n Este es nuestro proyecto. In English Please es una revista gratuita que te ense\u00f1ar\u00e1 ingl\u00e9s.\n\u00a0 Note:\nLa revista digital que entregamos a los mecenas, no es la misma que la revista impresa de In English Please. Es exclusiva.  M\u00e1s detalles sobre In English Please Magazine In English Please contiene art\u00edculos sobre temas interesantes. \u00a1No es un libro de gram\u00e1tica! La revista es perfecta para aqu\u00e9llos con nivel intermedio o m\u00e1s, y en cada art\u00edculo se indica la dificultad. Garantizamos que todos los lectores descubrir\u00e1n vocabulario nuevo, e incluso si tu nivel no es demasiado alto, la revista es accesible y mejorar\u00e1s tu nivel. Nuestra revista se complementa con la P\u00e1gina de Facebook; ver\u00e1s que te ayudaremos a aprender, clarificar tus dudas y\u00a0fomentar tu inmersi\u00f3n de forma original.\u00a0 Como hemos dicho, la revista es perfecta para profesores y autodidactas. Hay definiciones de palabras, preguntas al final de los textos, y sugerencias para que le saques el mejor partido a la revista.\u00a0 \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 en papel?\n\u00a0 Mucha gente me ha preguntado \u201c\u00bfporque no la revista digital?\u201d  Aunque hay competencia, tener tu propia revista impresa, te da la oportunidad, escribirla, completarla, subrayarla, y ser\u00e1 motivadora e influyente. Es agradable de rellenarla y utilizarla. Todos podemos sentirnos culpables por distraernos con nuestros tel\u00e9fonos e internet. As\u00ed, hacer algo que nos desconecta del mundo digital, puede ayudar a que nos concentremos en nuestros objetivos a largo plazo. Y s\u00e9 que entre esos objetivos se encuentra aprender ingl\u00e9s. He hablado con cientos de estudiantes y la mayor\u00eda coinciden en la necesidad de aprenderlo.\n \u201cQuiero trabajar en el extranjero\u201d\n\n \u201cMe lo exigen en el trabajo\u201d\n \u201cMe gustan los idiomas\u201d\n A todo el mundo le entusiasma aprender. Pero asistir a clase no es suficiente. Tampoco lo es ver pel\u00edculas o series. Los estudiantes tienen que buscar la inmersi\u00f3n de diversas formas y estar motivados para estudiar, practicar e invertir tiempo.\n\n\u00a0 \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 estamos aqu\u00ed? Yo estaba en Inglaterra por A\u00f1o Nuevo cuando la idea apareci\u00f3. Mi amiga ha lanzado dos revistas gratuitas en Plymouth, mi ciudad. Y pens\u00e9, \"\u00bfY por qu\u00e9 no lanzar una revista en Madrid para que los madrile\u00f1os aprendan ingl\u00e9s?\". La semilla estaba plantada. \u00a0 Hemos estado d\u00e1ndole muchas vueltas para encontrar la forma de financiar el proyecto. En un primer momento, la financiaci\u00f3n del proyecto se iba a hacer gracias a anuncios. Aunque el inter\u00e9s por parte de las academias de ingl\u00e9s, profesores y dem\u00e1s interesados es grande, generaremos m\u00e1s confianza para invertir si el proyecto ya est\u00e1 en marcha. Es por ello que elegimos Kickstarter. Porque queremos que empiece a andar el proyecto y demostrar que es atractivo. Nuestro objetivo a corto plazo es tener una revista mensual utilizada, al menos, por mil estudiantes. \u00a0",

  "You are invited to become a part of \"Miracle Year,\" the new album by The Sitka Rose Band. Yes, the project needs money to take the final step of becoming reality. But, every bit as much, it needs a community of support around it, people like you who care about independent art. This is the traditional backbone of creative endeavors of all kinds and allows new ideas and inspirations to come into this world.\u00a0 It takes a village.\u00a0 Music from Wildfire Country Like many creative projects in 2020, \"Miracle Year\" is a hothouse project, literally. \u00a0This music was conceived around the time of the 2015 Valley Fire in Northern California, gestated in the aftermath of wildfire evacuation, and has come to completion in Ashland, Oregon, with the help of a virtual band of international musicians, in the time of COVID-19 (and the Almeda Fire in Southern Oregon in 2020).

What you hear on this new album came together from contributions by musicians from near and far, something that the Internet now makes possible.\u00a0 I would like to acknowledge the gaggle of good spirits around this project, beginning with producer Daniel Sherrill of the folk wonder-duo Hollis Peach in Ashland, OR. Dan is this project's go-to person for all things production, sound engineering and mixing.\u00a0 And then there are the musicians who have put so much life and color into these songs . . . let me name them for you:\u00a0 My thanks and appreciation to each of these musicians. And also to you for your support of \"Miracle Year: Songs from the Land of the Valley Fire.\"",
  "Sono gi\u00e0 sette anni che insieme al bassista Pietro Pancella e al batterista Michele Santoleri condividiamo progetti e palchi, e da circa tre abbiamo intrapreso questo nuovo viaggio musicale. Tutto nasce nella meravigliosa casetta insonorizzata di Michele. In questo studio ci sentiamo come a casa, \u00e8 l\u00ec dentro che siamo cresciuti musicalmente, sperimentato e creato materiale infinito\u2026 Insomma, il posto perfetto per registrare un disco live! In tutto questo tempo passato assieme abbiamo sviluppato un modo del tutto personale di stare sul tempo permettendoci di avere un grande interplay e una forte coesione sonora. Anche per questo il trio \u00e8 la formazione che preferisco, oltre al fatto che offre maggiori possibilit\u00e0 nel creare sequenze armoniche in modo estemporaneo e permette di improvvisare in maniera pi\u00f9 libera e imprevedibile sui cambi. Un altro aspetto che mi affascina \u00e8 l\u2019idea di avere tre strumenti a disposizione e combinarli a tal punto di avere l\u2019impressione di ascoltare una Big Band! Il mio volere compositivo \u00e8 stato quello di scrivere brani che raccontassero le mie esperienze, i miei studi, i miei affetti e la consapevolezza di un\u2019amicizia cosi speciale. Cerco sempre di scrivere nel modo meno chitarristico possibile. Mi piace pensare a due mani, come fossi un pianista, in modo da ottenere sonorit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 interessanti. C\u2019\u00e8 un grande lavoro da parte di Pietro e Michele nell\u2019interpretazione delle parti pi\u00f9 dettagliate, ma allo stesso tempo un notevole senso di creativit\u00e0 e di vitalit\u00e0 estemporanea nei momenti pi\u00f9 \u201cfree\u201d. Proprio in questi momenti riusciamo a creare intense quantit\u00e0 di energia, una vera e propria macchina che genera un suono unico e concentrato nel caos dell\u2019interplay. Da qui nasce il titolo dell\u2019album: \u201cEntropia\u201d. Ringrazio Pietro e Michele per aver dato il massimo e per continuare a supportarmi; Simone Schirone e Simone Grifone per la loro straordinaria simpatia e per la massima professionalit\u00e0 in fase di ripresa; Domenico Pulsinelli e Claudio Esposito per aver magistralmente missato e masterizzato il disco, sono stati preziosissimi; Greta Burtini, per la realizzazione della copertina e per i magnifici scatti; Infine un immenso grazie a tutte quelle persone che ci supporteranno. Buon ascolto! ---------- I\u2019ve been playing with bassist Pietro Pancella and drummer Michele Santoleri for seven years now, and about three years ago we started this new musical journey. It all began in Michele\u2019s soundproof studio: that\u2019s where we have built our musical foundations, experimented and created\u2026 In other words, the perfect place to record a live album! All the time we spent together resulted in a unique sense of interplay and a very cohesive sound. That is also the reason why the trio is my favorite lineup, besides the fact that it allows more harmonic possibilities and freedom in improvisation. Another fascinating aspect is the idea of having three instruments and make them sound as if they were a whole big band! As a composer, I wanted to write songs that could tell something of my experiences, my studies, my affections and the awareness of a special friendship such as ours. I always try not to compose as a guitarist. I like to think as if I were a pianist, developing chords with both hands, in order to have more interesting sounds. Pietro and Michele did a great job with the interpretation of the most detailed parts, but at the same time they kept an outstanding creativity when playing something more \u201cfree\u201d. Those are the moments in which we create an intense energy, an actual machine that generates a unique sound in the middle of the chaos of interplay. That\u2019s why the album is called \u201cEntropia\u201d, entropy. I\u2019d like to thank Pietro and Michele, who keep doing their best and supporting me; Simone Schirone and Simone Grifone for their amazing friendliness and their expertise when we were recording; Domenico Pulsinelli and Claudio Esposito for having masterfully mixed and mastered the album; Greta Burtini, for the cover artwork and the wonderful photoshoots; Finally, I\u2019d like to thank all the people who are going to support us. Enjoy the music! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Christian Mascetta",
  "Don Giovanni Records was founded in 2003 by Joe Steinhardt and Zach Gajewski. At first, the label\u2019s primary purpose was to document bands within the New Brunswick, NJ basement scene. Over the years, however, our roster has gradually expanded to include a diverse lineup of visionaries and weirdos like Screaming Females, Laura Stevenson, Moor Mother, Chris Gethard, Keith Secola, Mourning [A] BLKstar, Teenage Halloween, Jeffrey Lewis, Bad Moves, Lee Bains III & the Glory Fires, Bat Fangs, Alice Bag, Peter Stampfel, Worriers, Waxahatchee, Sammus, Aye Nako, Paisley Fields, Mikey Erg, and many more. At the end of the day, we\u2019d love to make the world a more wild, tolerant and diverse place. That may not be possible for an independent record label, though. So, the best we can really do is to put out records by wild, tolerant, and diverse people. If you\u2019re not familiar with our work, here\u2019s a few features on our recent releases. As you can imagine, this has been a challenging year for us. And yet, rather than slow down, we\u2019d like to put out more music. In particular, we\u2019d like to put out more music by emerging artists. After all, what good is it to run an independent record label if you can\u2019t take a chance on the underrepresented, untraditional, and seemingly unplaylist-able? As music fans, we\u2019re drawn to misfit records. They\u2019re important to us and they should be important to you, too. Weird records help to illuminate our lives and give depth to our experience. Just to be clear: This is not a save-the-label type fundraiser. Times are always tight, and the pandemic has only made them tighter, but as The Black Knight once said, \"I'm not dead yet.\"\u00a0 Rather, our goal is to use this fundraiser to create a bit of financial breathing room for the label after an incredibly challenging year and looking toward what may be another one. The resources we gather here will allow us to pay down our existing debt, which will allow us to put more projects into production, which will mean that more records come out more quickly. In other words, it will help us to step on the gas. Clearly, the best part of giving to Don Giovanni Records is the satisfaction of helping an independent record label survive and thrive. We know that's not always enough, though, so we've also loaded the rewards up with highly desirable art and ephemera. In the next year or so, we\u2019re hoping to release new music by Laura Stevenson, Lee Bains III & the Glory Fires, Bat Fangs, Moor Mother, as well as a number of other records we aren't ready to announce quite yet from artists you may not have heard of but may soon change your life. $5 - One Random Digital album -- A random digital album** $8 \u2013 One Random CD -- A random CD**. $10 \u2013 One Random T-shirt -- A random shirt, in your size**. $15 \u2013 Don Giovanni Records Tote Bag \u2013- High quality canvas tote bag designed by Nolen Strals $15 \u2013 Random Vinyl Record \u2013- A Random LP**. $15 \u2013 Three Random Cassette Tapes \u2013- Three random tapes**. $15 - Mal Blum - See Me 7\" -- remaining copies from a limited pressing that originally went out with early copies of Pity Boy --NEW-- $20 - Two art books by Faye Orlove -- Both collections of Faye Orlove's art released by the label, SHRINE and SHRINE volume ii $20 \u2013 Giant Moor Mother \"Analog Fluids\" Poster \u2013- 18x24 Moor Mother poster, with her lyrics on it, shipped in a tube $20 \u2013 L7 - I Came Back To Bitch 7\" Single \u2013- Purple vinyl, from one time pressing of 1000 $25 \u2013 2 Random LPs \u2013 2 random LPs** $30 \u2013 5 Random CDs --\u00a05 random CDs** $35 - Screaming Females -\u00a0Shake It Off / If It Makes You Happy 7\". \u00a0-- Warehouse Find!

  "WHY WE\u2019RE DOING THIS The roots of this magazine come from what we\u2019ve experienced. We got started with GROSS Magazine about a year and a half ago, after both of us had been operating in our own artistic areas. As designers and creatives ourselves, we both thrive on discovering new, out-there brands, creators, artists and musicians. When we were starting out, we had a million questions, from how our favorite artists got their first shows to how bands made enough money on the road. We wanted to meet these people and get to know them. We read many existing interviews, but found they didn\u2019t get very far; we wanted to dig deeper. We began looking around us and noticing we were part of a huge community looking for the same thing. That is why we are here, to bring out these gems and nuggets of knowledge that will help push our creative community forward, and hopefully inspire a lot of those who call themselves \"not creative.\" Oh, and we both have been obsessed with stickers since we started skateboarding in our early elementary school days; that obsession has never left. Let\u2019s put some tangible life back into print. We put our heart and soul into designing high-quality layouts, curating out of the ordinary content from a wide variety of contributors, and sourcing the best materials and printers; all to create a publication that our readers will cherish for years to come. We want GROSS Mag to be a piece of art that lives on your coffee table and inspires engaging conversations. As seen on: \u00a0 Everyone loves stickers, and what better way to bring content, art and brands to life in a publication? Every issue will have 20+ stickers, all which will contain original content featuring brands, artists, musicians and more to slap on your laptops, boards, cars, toasters, etc. The stickers will be integrated throughout the magazine to reveal additional content when peeled. Through our material research, we\u2019ve sourced the stickiest and most durable, dual-release stickers that will take the content beyond the binding. Booyah! When preparing for an interview, we make sure to do extensive research to ensure that the resulting content is delicious, unique and intriguing.  \u201cThank you for taking time to do the research. That is truly a lost art when it comes to being interviewed.\u201d\u00a0-Jesse Cory, co-founder and CEO of 1xRUN \u201cI loved the format of this. Most interviews can be repetitive but this was fun!\u201d\n-Tyler Spangler The running theme for VOL. 1 is The Introduction. Since we\u2019re entering a new era of our own, we thought it fitting to ask our contributors to reflect on their early experiences for this first issue; when they had no clue what they were doing and their desire to explore was what pushed them to proceed. We searched far and wide to find contributors who are diverse in disciplines and had them answer kooky questions, fill out inventive worksheets and draw us pictures to bring you the most original content, stickers and photos.  Our printers are the best. One company already prints many popular art books, as well as other independent and limited edition magazines and publications. We\u2019ve worked closely with this printer to get all of our materials selected to best fit our vision - supple velvet cover and short grain interior stock.\u00a0 Our sticker printer usually produces extremely specialized medical device labels that are accurate and precise to the highest standards of quality. We\u2019ve become close friends with their production team and after a couple of visits, we\u2019ve arrived at the best possible sticker materials for this project.  To bring the stickers and print together, the stickers are hand-placed by an organization that specializes in employing disadvantaged individuals. We insisted on having this portion done by hand, and specifically by this group, because we strongly believe in contributing to local communities and helping others.  We have been personally funding and bootstrapping since day one. The funding we receive will go straight to printing, hand-assembling and delivering copies of VOL. 1. Our goal is simply to get this thing printed. We wish printing was free, but it\u2019s not. This campaign\u2019s success will enable us to make this vision a reality, and will lay the foundation for GROSS as a platform. Your backing will help this campaign go far past just reaching our Kickstarter goal. This magazine is just the beginning and your support will give us the momentum to proceed onwards and upwards with VOL. 2; to continue our path to showcasing exceptional talents through the GROSS creative community.   Pick your pleasure, we've put together a variety of rewards for you. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Many thanks for reading,  Gross Team",
  "Click Here to go straight to the Jen Miller Music Collective website, or keep reading to learn a little bit about our project and our sound. Two years ago, you helped us make our first full-length album, Brave is One More Step in the Dark, an acoustic, melodic collection of songs which has held a light of hope for so many people. \u00a0We pray that this follow-up album, The Architect, does the same. \u00a0 While the Brave album was largely about hope in postpartum depression and anxiety, this album centers on God's sovereignty and love over our minds, especially in their brokenness. \u00a0We are including songs from many years ago, when I walked through a different kind of darkness as a teenager, as well as brand new songs that explore what it means to keep trusting Him for healing. \u00a0And... while we are excited to bring back many of the musicians from the first album, we are also thrilled to be adding percussion for the first time. We've all been through so much in the past year. \u00a0And in many ways, we are still in the midst of surviving and coping, with many questions left unanswered and the path before us seemingly impossible. \u00a0We feel called to use music to help us take more steps in the dark. \u00a0To trust the Architect who is not ashamed to be our God. \u00a0And to lift our eyes together toward the City with Foundations that is our true home. We would be honored if you'd join us on this journey, dear friends. \u00a0And we can't wait to share these new songs and new sounds with you.\u00a0 Come and build us, O Lord. Love, Jen, Keith, and Gail Here in this land of enemies, I will keep on singing. I'm a stranger in a foreign land, but the Architect is building. * Find our album, Brave is One More Step in the Dark, as well as \"The Flat on Church Street,\" on any major streaming platform. \u00a0#braveisonemorestepinthedark #thearchitectalbum #jenmillermusiccollective \u00a0www.jenmillermusiccollective.com",
  "Project Goal | $9,500: REACHED! Album funded and all rewards fulfilled! Stretch Goal #1 | $14,000: Every backer will receive early streaming access to a high-quality music video of Ledah Finck\u2019s In the Brink recorded and produced by Four/Ten media. Check out an example of their work here. This does not affect our $9,500 all-or-nothing goal - we have reached $9,500, \u00a0which means the album will be funded and you will receive your rewards! Hooray! We\u2019re so happy to share with you the plan for our debut album, In the Brink, coming Spring 2022! Over the past couple years, we\u2019ve fallen in love with several works that don\u2019t have a studio recording, and we decided it\u2019s time for them to be out there in the world. The album will feature: We love these composers\u2019 work, and as a major plus, they\u2019re some of our favorite people. In fact, Ledah is one of the violinists in the quartet, so her piece In the Brink, after which we\u2019re naming the album, is full of very personal Bergamot touches! Check out the links above to learn more about them and keep reading for more info about us, our recording plan, and the music you\u2019ll hear on the album.\u00a0Scroll down on the right to see Rewards options to support this campaign. You\u2019re also invited to join us throughout the month of March for Bergafest, a series of online concerts and events to celebrate music and the launch of this project we\u2019re so excited about. Starting March 5, we\u2019ll be going live each week at these times: You can find more details about Bergafest and where to access livestreams on our website, Facebook, and Instagram. We are a string quartet based in NYC fueled by a passion for exploring and advocating for the music of living composers. We love bringing brand new music to life, helping\u00a0it grow, and sharing it with the world. Bergamot comes from the name of a plant as an homage to the spirit of growth that we strive to embody. The name serves as a constant reminder of the inspiration that we draw from the natural world and the care and respect it necessitates \u2013 an inspiration that can especially be heard in In the Brink.\u00a0 Some of our recent projects have included co-commissioning a new work by Darian Thomas in collaboration with So Percussion, working with Baltimore-based middle school composers through the Junior Bach program, and recording new works by the composers of CNSNC for their new album, Hearing Stars. We\u2019re so glad the time has come for us to record and release our first album, and that it will feature music we love by people we love. Even better, we get to go on this journey with all of you and look forward to keeping you updated as this project comes to life. We\u2019ll be recording the album in Fall 2021 at Troy Music Hall in Troy, NY and Reservoir Studios in NYC. The album will be recorded by Sam Torres and Matthew Sullivan, \u00a0mastered by Sam Torres, and produced by Paul Wiancko. We\u2019re so happy to have these brilliant people on our team! Your support of this project will make it possible for us to record this great music and send it off into the world! We have external support from The New School College of Performing Arts to secure our recording venues, so our Kickstarter budget includes everything else we need to bring this album to life: fees for our team of engineers and producers; artist fees for ourselves and our awesome collaborator Terry Sweeney, who is the percussionist for our title piece, In the Brink; album production and distribution fees/licenses; album artwork; travel costs to Troy, NY; album promotion; and all the Bergamerch you see listed in the Rewards section. We\u2019ve been wanting to make some Bergamerch for a while now, and this is the PERFECT opportunity! In the various Rewards Tiers, you\u2019ll see a range of Bergamerch, from the $5 Tier BergaSticker to the $75 Tier BergaHat. The BergaSticker and BergaTee will feature a brand new hand-drawn design by artist and designer Vivien Chong. The BergaDrink recipe card will include a cocktail and mocktail recipe created and beautifully drawn by our cellist, Ir\u00e8ne Han. And, finally, the limited edition BergaScrunchie and BergaHat are handmade exclusively by violist Amy Tan and violinist Ledah Finck. In the Brink We commissioned our very own Ledah Finck to write In the Brink for string quartet + drum kit in 2019 with support from New Music USA. We\u2019re thrilled to be joined by percussionist Terry Sweeney, who premiered the work with us. In Ledah\u2019s words, In the Brink \u201cuses environmental metaphors to address communication between large entities of people, particularly in light of the intolerance and lack of consideration for marginalized populations that permeates the current sociopolitical climate of the United States of America and its government. The \u201cbrink\u201d references an observation that I have heard many times since the 2016 presidential election: that we are on the brink of some tipping point in America, that perhaps it will either go up in flames or that the wave of positive activism that has been sparked will inspire further generations for real change. I interpret this brink as a no-man\u2019s-land, a swamp that might dry up or become a lake; a state of being that we are very much in.\u201d Undecim In 2019, we were lucky enough to meet the wonderful Suzanne Farrin at The Banff Centre and work together on her piece, Undecim. Check out our most recent performance of Undecim below and get a glimpse into the beautiful idea of memory in music through Suzanne\u2019s words: \u201cUndecim was written in 2006 during a time when I was thinking about how memory could be applied as a process in my music, especially when considering the long lifespan of stringed instruments. I liked to imagine that these objects remember all of the repertoire from the past and\u2014like an active memory\u2014the bow could temporarily take over the arm of the player and utter articulations of older pieces while left hand stays in the present. It is as if the bow and arm become marionettes that are controlled by remembering. Memories are partial, incomplete and fragmented. They can intrude into \u201cnormal\u201d thinking and change, forget and twist around temporality in a constantly changing psychological landscape that effects both the present and its sense of self: re-hearing, forgetting, trying to hold on to something that cannot continue to exist without the aura of its moment of creation.\u201d Esencia, para cuarteto de cuerdas The piece that\u2019s newest to our repertoire, Esencia, is a vivid and exciting 3-movement work by Tania Le\u00f3n that we\u2019re getting to know for the first time! As soon as we read through this piece together, we knew we wanted it to be part of our first album. Tania lets us into the sound world of this piece in her words below: \u201cEsencia para cuarteto de cuerdas, reflects influences of classical genres of music in the Caribbean and Latino America. The word esencia, in English is the essence or initial point that determines the behavior and the style and an ensemble of needed characteristics for something to become what it is. The more obvious traces of these influences is in the myriad of syncopated gestures indigenous of: son, danzon, guajiras, montunos or echoes of a melodic line in the \u2018Aguas de Rosas\u2019 movement. A melody that hearkens the sound of the quena, the traditional flute of the Andes. At times there is a crossover of Coplandesque harmonic overtones, influences of American culture, traces of a syncretic tendency in the musical language that depicts \u2018here and now\u2019 while I composed the piece. A sort of commentary where the \u2018esencia\u2019 of the piece merges, the same way that my personal musical language has syncretized my cultural experiences.\u201d Ode on a Broken Loom We heard the Eybler Quartet\u2019s premiere of Paul\u2019s Ode on a Broken Loom in 2019 and were inspired by the piece\u2019s energy and textures. Paul is a cellist, composer, producer, and all-around awesome person, and we can\u2019t wait to bring this piece to the studio together with Paul as our producer. We couldn\u2019t say it any better than Paul himself, who says, \u201cGet lost in the dense inner machinery of [Ode on a Broken Loom] or let its evolving, canonic tapestry wash over you. Or both.\u201d",
  "My name is Dan, I am 26 years old and currently a student at Blekinge Institute of Technology, where I am studying Digital Sound Production to become a sound designer. I have been producing music for some years now, and last year my band called \"Communist Sex\" released our debut album called \"Lada Riva\", but now the time has come for me to start my on project as a solo artist. It's time for me to release my debut EP, called \"Pinewoods\". Like the name of the EP might reveal, the theme will take place in the woods, the pinewoods. It will be an EP where i express my inner feelings like i never done before. And since I am studying Digital Sound Production, sound design will have a big part in the EP. This EP containing seven tracks will be the biggest creation of my life so far, where I will include some of my close friends to collaborate and take part. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I.",

Thank you all so much for your support and let's keep it going! // Woven is a tri-annual printed magazine that exists to celebrate and inspire artists, craftsmen and women, and makers to share their stories of risk and triumph, fear and finding.  After over a year of investing all we have into traveling, hearing and sharing stories, hosting a wealth of content online, and investing in makers we\u2019ve met along the way, it\u2019s time to expand. We want to include more contributors, more makers far and wide, and expand our support of the handmade economy. We want to continue educating readers on the value of small businesses, and keeping craft alive. Our role in this mission is small but unique, bringing together a wide variety of art and craft mediums along with contemplative essays that suit an audience grounded in or ready to being a more conscientious approach to consumption.  Woven exists to share the joys of experience, and the value of not yet knowing, but going anyway. Why Print?\u00a0 Despite the accessibility of an online format, it is temporal. We want Woven to be experienced, shared, and kept as you would a good book. A printed version embodies the experience we hope our stories will foster: intimate, contemplative moments that challenge and encourage. We also believe in retreating from purely digital consumption, in removing ourselves from distractions to allow more room for thought and discovery.  Issue One In our debut issue, Woven seeks to explore the essential first step in creating meaningful work: finding your medium. There is no linear path, no foolproof guidebook, no single source of inspiration. Issue One explores the road to Finding Your Medium through the stories of nine individual maker features from across the United States, as well as a set of essays written to encourage you on your own journey.\u00a0 Makers and Thinkers We believe in work; hard work. The kind that builds you as you\u2019re building it. Our work is connecting those who labor for meaning and value to a world who needs their example. We want to showcase artists, craftsmen and women, and makers of all kinds who are creating a culture where meaning is more important that money, and the metric of success is creating something that matters, be it a chair, a meal, or a positive relationship.  Not only do we value makers, but the thinkers of our age, as well. Woven is for those who are eager to engage in the philosophy of design and creation, and go beyond mere construction to discover what lies between form and function - that something greater that transcends time and geography.  Sharing Common Threads\u00a0 Going into print has been our hope since the beginning, but we\u2019ve taken the first year to discover what binds these narratives together - their common threads. A printed version of Woven moves towards the heart of our calling - to connect wisdom of the ages to a present moment. As we collect more stories, conduct more interviews, and hold more conversations with this talented, growing community, we recognize a pattern of risk and triumph, fear and finding that defines each of our stories. Woven is about tracing these common threads that weave through all of our lives, in hopes of emboldening a lifestyle of creativity that lies within us all.  Why Kickstarter? After publishing online for a year, we\u2019ve taken Woven as far as we can on our own. Using Kickstarter is an invitation to collaborate with us and the makers we support. It\u2019s a way to offset the cost of sharing theses stories widespread through print so that we can continue bringing together more from all over the world! \n Issue One In our first issue, we feature nine makers of both craft and culture. You\u2019ll also find a set of thoughtful essays written to engage the creative mind, encourage and challenge wherever you find yourself on the journey to finding your medium. The Woven Tote\u00a0 Sport the vision of connecting and supporting makers and thinkers with the exclusive Woven Tote! Mini Print Post Cards\u00a0 As particularly huge fans of sending and receiving letters, we\u2019re including a set of 10 postcards designed by us with some of our favorite landscapes from the past year\u2019s travels.  Posters Good design and compelling photography are essential to Woven\u2019s stories. These Kickstarter exclusive posters were designed by talented design contributors Sean Davis, Spencer Huddleston, and Andrew Whited, each with a unique expression of our stories to hang in your home or studio. Link to Your Choosing We\u2019ll feature a link to your personal or professional website on a special contributor page on wovenmagazine.com. Anything goes within good taste (no profanity, spam, etc). Sponsored Post\u00a0 Sponsor an upcoming feature on our online publication! We\u2019ll include your name or the name of your company and link to your personal or professional website. Sponsored Ad in Issue One Get your brand featured in Issue One with a full page colored ad! Photography may be provided by us or one of our contributors, plus we\u2019ll include your brand name and web address. Optional space for three lines of description copy.  Issue One Release Dinner Party!\u00a0 The dinner is our most exciting reward. It\u2019s a time for us all to celebrate the beginning of Woven over fine food and drink in Seattle\u2019s Historic Pioneer Square! Meet the team, share your story, hear from others, and leave with a few extra tokens of our appreciation. After the event, we\u2019ll also send you 10 high-resolution digital downloads of moments captured from our evening together. Join us for this very special night and be a part of our story! Project Consultation with the Woven Team\u00a0 The most exclusive reward is three dedicated hours with Woven\u2019s Lead Designer and Editor. We\u2019ll discuss direction and branding through writing and photography, as well as provide feedback for your business, project, or portfolio. For makers just setting out, we\u2019ll get you started with loads of helpful discussion and advice tailored to you! Many thanks to the designers and videographers who helped us prepare this campaign!\u00a0",
  "In Canada: Action Figure Adventure, Season One Rest of the World: Action Figure Adventure, Season One Jay Bartlett dares to go on another quest for the coolest, rarest, and most talked about action figures and playsets ever created in hopes of putting together the ultimate action figure auction with all the proceeds going to support the Children's Health Foundation, a local charity that supports critically and terminally ill children.\u00a0 Dovetailing Jay's adventure, you'll hear from several collectors, creatives and people of note discuss popular action figure, and toy-centric topics such as Holy Grails, Collecting Rules, The Perfect Action Figure, Lesser Known Lines, The Future of Action Figures and much more! Action Figure Adventure SEASON TWO will be a 10-episode journey with each episode running 22-24 minutes - that's close to 4 hours of action figure goodness! With plenty of attention on figures, playsets and vehicles across franchises such as Masters of the Universe, G.I. Joe, Transformers, TMNT, and Star Wars, you'll feel apart of the quest every step of the way! We've shot the bulk of the second season and are part way through post-production with a little bit more to film. This is a great chance to be a part of things like getting your name in the credits, snagging associate producer honors, being a part of bonus materials or getting signed copies on alternate artwork! While we are offering some digital rewards, this is your chance to own this exciting series on Blu Ray or DVD! Only a low percentage of indie documentaries and indie series get released on physical media nowadays, so we wanted to make sure that collectors and fans of our work have a chance to add this second season of our series to their current collection. We're currently in post-production with a few more moments and interviews to capture. This campaign is to provide funds for physical copies of the series and help with legal, insurance and distribution costs. We need to be successful here to see the series get a physical release and any additional funds help cover the above costs which we estimate to be another $20,000. We're committed to covering all costs, but the more we can raise, the sooner we can release the series! Rob McCallum serves as the series creator, writer and director. His previous credits include \"Nintendo Quest,\" \"Power of Grayskull,\" \"Video Game Box Art: The Stories Behind the Covers,\" and \"Kittie: Origins/Evolutions.\" He's also behind the exciting upcoming documentary, \"Faking Filmation\" which explores the history, evolution and impact of cartoons and cartoon culture while following James Eatock, who attempts to release his fan film despite legal objections. Most of our rewards are self-explanatory, but we urge you to contact us with any and all questions. Here's a bit more information just in case: All disc-based rewards come with access to our digital content which is DRM-Free and accessed through a hidden Vimeo page. You must have or create a Vimeo account in order to access the digital material. Our standard disc packaging features our poster art and will come with all our discs. You may have to fill out affidavits attesting to their lack of participation in the actual production, confirming it is a courtesy credit. This is important because in order to qualify for tax credits and satisfy Canadian content regulations, we need all our credentials transparent. If you are not willing or unable to do this by a timeline set forth in the future, please do not select this reward tier. We will be unable to refund your pledge amount for these or any tiers, so please choose wisely! We have a couple options that allow you to be on camera and a part of the things we're trying to create. A couple caveats of course: we really need to preserve technical standards so high quality video and audio are a must. And, we reserve the right to censor, eliminate or exclude any material that WE deem inappropriate. Most of the footage that you send us will be part of the bonus content though there is a chance it makes it into the main series. That said, we create a number of supplementary series and related content that allows us to explore everything we didn't or couldn't cover in our 10 episode season two run. How does it work? We'll send you questions and you film yourself answering them! We'll provide a link to upload the footage as well as a release form we will need signed in order to use the material. Alternatively, we can have you on one of our live stream shows or a separate interview over Streamyard to save any technical hassles. We'll share these streams and interviews with all our backers and our community! There's an opportunity to join Jay and/or Rob on a toy hunt! Please note: the toy hunt is dependent on mutual times and availability and travel, food, lodgings to Jay and/or Rob is at your own expense. There's no guarantee cameras will record the toy hunt - though we would like to - or any minimum duration of the hunt or specific location the hunt for the toy hunt. Everyone will work in their combined best efforts to make something manageable but awesome happen. These reward tiers are very limited, so don't delay if you want to be on camera talking about action figures, showcasing your collection or whatever else we think of :) We're got a variety of ADD-ON items to round out your reward pledge. Some of those details are here: In addition to Action Figure Adventure, Jay and Rob have created a companion series, called \"The Jay and Rob Toy Show!\" It's a suped-up version of their live stream and features interviews with industry icons, toy room tours and discussion segments featuring community members! It's been broadcast across Canada and will debut elsewhere in 2022! Get a signed copy of the series with alternative art work! Essentially, if you add-on this special packaging, you still get the standard packaging but you'll also get this, signed by Jay and Rob, and included loose, in your shipping package. While we cannot offer digital copies of Season 1, we can offer Blu-Rays & DVDs!!!\u00a0 DISC RUN OF THE SERIES: Our main goal is to have our second season released on physical media and to help cover our remaining costs. Our base goal of $5,000 really helps us out and allows us to finish within six months time. TOY ROOM TOURS: In addition to our other planned bonus content like extended scenes and unabridged interviews, we will craft six toy room tours featuring some of our series participants. These would run about 5-10 minutes each and showcase some pretty cool collectibles and awesome displays!\u00a0 *Since we don't know the full scope or length of these toy room tours, we can only commit to a digital release at this time. MINI-QUEST: While not the focus of this campaign at all, if we manage to hit this mark, we will hit the road again for another adventure that will run six episodes. It's a lot of work, but something we'll craft over the course of several months once Season Two gets finished. Expected release for these episodes is entirely dependent on when we can shoot them + 6-8 months for post production: possibly Summer-Fall 2023 for release.\u00a0 *Since we don't know the full scope or length of these new episodes, we can only commit to a digital release at this time.

  "There are two Sebastians in this story. One turned 100 years old on Christmas Day 2021. The other is on a mission to tell the story of old Sebastian\u2019s life. Or so he thinks. Hi, Sebastian the Younger here. I didn't start out as a person interested in documentary filmmaking. I wanted to create an escape from life - not to capture it. But sometimes, the planets align, the air is exactly right, and you get named after your Grandpa. It all started out as a small task of putting together a family video to capture my ancestry, but it grew to something bigger than just an interview with my Grandpa - it became a story of its own. It became my own personal path to gratefulness. Sebastian the Elder was born December 25th, 1921, to a father he would struggle to live with and a mother that he would be torn away from for 27 years. Early on he was subjected to harsh living conditions in the hills of Italy - no electricity, the rise of fascism, and eating anything you could find... A cat? Yes. He made it to the United States before Mussolini could get him, but there weren\u2019t shiny gold streets waiting for him. Yet he managed to find a wife, start a family, and 53 some odd years later, Sebastian the Younger was born. But my life was rough too! I didn't like vegetables, so I became a fat kid who got bullied one time. I spent all of my time playing video games and watching movies. Being lazy in school and flunking out of college landed me here, making movies. I've always liked listening to my Grandpa's stories and realized if I could learn a thing or two, you could too! The Team and I are currently conducting as many interviews with Sebastian the Elder as we can. We have outlined the scenes we want to recreate as well as the pivotal scenes for Sebastian the Younger. I have come here on my hands and knees to beg. I want to shoot recreations from my Grandpa's life to assist the story visually and to create a cinematic experience for you. Most of my crew is working for free and that neighbor's cat is looking mighty tasty right now, I mean I want to be able to take care of them by providing meals. I don\u2019t know, maybe we uh, take care of that guy/gal that\u2019s been bothering you. Huh? No no no, we are not that kind of Italian. We make focaccia bread and drink wine. Any contribution comes with the ability to follow along with Sebastian the Younger's journey and gain insight into an old wise man's life. Thanks for your interest in the Sebastian way of life.\u00a0 This is an important project to me and my family. With your pledge, it could be the best film possible. If I can learn something from this, then you sure can too. \u00a0",
  "Its time. We have had too many experiences, too many late nights with music and nectar, too much new music, too much travel, to not produce something new that can express all of this. . . its time for a new album. We have decided to start this October and will be called 'Edge of the World' . . Studio time, equipment, mixing, mastering, printing, design, all of this is going to be a thrill to create but heavy on the pocketbook. Thats where you come in.     At this point in time, we feel we have been to pockets of the world that many musicians who stick to the bigger cities are not fortunate enough to have ever seen. We have dived off cliffs at the edge of the world and meet people that we will always remember. Including you. Why not, we thought, ask all the people with whom we have connected through our music, to participate in this upcoming endeavor? This way we are sure it will happen, and that the community that we have so lovingly felt ourselves to be a part of since we begun can be a part of our creation.  We are a completely do it yourself group, but we would not change it for the world. Instead of getting back in a tour bus after a festival, we have always been able to hang out, meet people, and jam long into the night under the stars and create magic.    Please help us to continue this magic, to be an independent group that can continue to create music  you love. We have 30 days to meet our goal of $15000. Can it happen? We believe anything is possible! Much love!Fishtank Ensemble",
  "My name is Benny McChrystal Plimmer aka sugarybenny, born and based in Manchester, UK. I have been a multidisciplinary artist for 10+ years and an illustrator selling on market stalls, Etsy and my website since 2017. My illustrations focus on weirdo creatures, trippy patterns and psychedelic colours. Slime Cat has been my most popular design, originally in the form of a single green holographic sticker, I have expanded the Slime Cat range to a 4 colour holographic sticker pack, a small and large patch, a cat button badge pack, a sticker sheet and one-off hand painted ceramic cats. The funding rewards include various products from the Slime Cat range. Often on my market stalls I get requests for a Slime Cat enamel pin badge. However the initial outlay costs for a run of pin badges is the most I would have spent on a single product and not something I can reasonably afford to pay in one go. Which is where this kickstarter campaign comes in incredibly handy! The funding amount has been chosen to match the most reasonable price per pin from a local supplier (300 pins). It also includes an amount to cover a logo stamp on the pin reverse and a backing card. My main social media platform is Instagram, where I currently have over 600 followers to promote this campaign with. To achieve our funding goal this means only 13.33% of my followers would need to fund the campaign at the first reward point of \u00a35.",

  "Most tours of fascinating cities just hit the highlights. In Washington, D.C., for instance, tourists typically hurriedly drive by the Washington Monument, the Lincoln, Jefferson, and Martin Luther King Memorials, with maybe a quick stop at several. Then perhaps bus over for a quick peek inside the Capitol Building, or at the exterior of the White House. Not very fulfilling.\n\n\u00a0 The Lafayette Square Tours of Scandal, Murder, & Intrigue aim to change all that. Our tours are all on foot, personal, and up close. They examine in detail the famous and less-known personalities, events, and architecture of intriguing locales. We visit fun sites in cities such as Washington, D.C., Alexandria, Virginia, and Annapolis, Maryland--places that drip history, style--and not a little bit of scandal. \u00a0 \u00a0 The tours are led by an expert in the field: a former presidential speechwriter and author of many books on politics and history. Who\u2019s able to take subjects that many find dull and present them in a fun and riveting way\u2014partly because he\u2019s also a former Tonight Show writer!\n Here's a select list of our tours: \u2022\tLafayette Square and White House Area Tour of Scandal, Assassination, & Intrigue\n\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of the Civil War \n\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of the Life of Thomas Jefferson\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of the Presidents\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of African-American History \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of the Presidents at War \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of Famed Females\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of Famous French-Americans\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of Famous Irish-Americans\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of the War of 1812\u2019s British Invasion & Burning of D.C.\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of Abraham Lincoln\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Tour of Deadly Duels\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Ghosts and Murders Tour\u00a0 \u2022\tLafayette Square Children\u2019s Tour\u00a0 \u2022\tWhite House Area Tour of the First World War\u00a0 \u2022\tDowntown D.C.

  "Sharing your photos online with your friends and family is easy.\u00a0 There are literally HUNDREDS of websites and mobile apps to do this.\u00a0 But have you ever found a site or an app that allowed multiple people to contribute to a single album?\u00a0 That's the core of what we intend to do with PhotoHive. The average person taking photos with their mobile device has no idea how to use file storage solutions, nor do they want to educate themselves on how to utilize them for this purpose. \u00a0And let's face it, not everybody wants their photos plastered all over Social Media! We are eliminating the mess that is texting and emailing of photos back and forth just to somehow gather the photos we want to see! Imagine the possibilities: Here is an early video we did to obtain testimonials of the idea! Here's our website! Don't forget to follow us on Twitter @PhotoHives! With your help, we can get this dream of ours accomplished. \u00a0We'll be creating an MVP that will ship as our beta. \u00a0Basic functionality will exist in this mode....but listen to what's next! What if businesses could use this too? \u00a0Yep. \u00a0We've thought of that.

  "\"Imagine Tim Burton if\nhe were to become a photo editor, make-up artist, a hair-stylist, photographer\nand costume designer\u2026as well as still being a director\u2026\" One project involves a\nnightmarishly sensual world involving \"doms and subs\" and is set in a\ncarnival/circus in which the dom and sub are BOTH portrayed by the same person.In some cases there are THREE characters in a\nset, all portrayed by the same person.There is also a \"giant\" who appears sporadically.The final result of this project will be a\nsubmission to publishers such as Dark Horse and Fantagraphics for a series of\ngraphic novels for a monthly release intended to last over 4 years.Each release will feature a different\ncharacter found in carnivals and circuses as the sub beginning with \"The\nRingleader\".Each set will have its\nown specific storyline and dialogue. If it were a movie, this\nproject would NOT be for children, but for those 18 and over. The other is a series with\nthe working title \"Depictions\".My intention with this series is to help enlighten audiences to facts\nthey either do not know or choose to ignore.The average American thinks that a geisha is a prostitute.Exploring the triangle between Madame Du\nBarry, Princesse Marie Louise and Marie Antoinette and the horrible circumstances\nbehind all of their deaths and how Lucrezia Borgia was more or less a pawn to\nher brother's and father's greed.Who\nwas/is \"La Llorona\"...?Why\ndid Jeanne d'Arc have to die...?And no,\nErzsabet Bathory, known as \"the Blood Countess\", NEVER bathed in\nvirgin's blood to retain her youth.These are but a few of the nearly 50 characters I will be exploring over\nthe course of three proposed books.The\nfinal product of these profiles and explorations will be a photographic book\nthat will include biographies.I\nconsider the book half photographic/half educational as I intend to teach and\nenlighten audiences about the various characters I am covering as well as\nhelping to dispel myths and misunderstandings. I encompass a broad range of\nmediums such as dance, drama, photography, costume design, set design, lighting\ndesign, film, infra-red visuals, even computer generated images (CGI\u2026used to\ncreate special effects in films).Because\nof my diversity, it is impossible to select just one category for myself here\non Kickstarter. I write all of the shooting scripts, design\nand make all of the costumes, I do all of the hair and make-up, I do all of the\nphotography and all of the post edit.I\nam basically a one man show...which makes these undertakings very time\nconsuming and in dire need of funding as everything it takes to go into each of\nthese tasks comes from one person and it has become difficult to afford\neverything myself. Funds accumulated for this\nproject will go towards the further development and creation of the first book in\nthe series (there will be 50 in total for the Carnival series and 40-50 for the\nDepictions series) and the hiring of models. Sample photographs can be seen on the website\nlisted. I ask that you join in our vision,\ntune yourself in, become a part of and watch this exciting development process\u2026 In Saecula Saeculoruum\u2026 Dreamhouse",
  "The concept and basis for the project comes from the Norwegian philosophy of Friluftsliv, an idea rooted deep in the Scandinavian history, this single word encompasses a culture that embrace the natural world.  Friluftsliv or \u2018free air life\u2019 is best described as a feeling of being empowered by the landscape, to emotionally connect with a space and to truly feel at one with the landscape. Mastering skills to survive in these harsh environments but never trying to conquer or beat nature, instead being a part of nature\u2019s rhythms and cycles, living in total harmony with the wilderness.  The project started life with a fascination for the way we connect with space in the modern day, many of us rarely spend much time in the open spaces, on forest walks or just absorbing the landscapes around us. In this ever growing technological world we spend far too many hours at our desks or in our cars, never truly connecting with the world; trapped behind glass. The urban man has lost his past ability to experience the landscape as anything other than objective, disconnecting from feeling, only venturing out into the wild simply to have been there and nothing more. The modern man is unable to hear the warning cries in animals, read the sings in nature or find their way by the stars.  The Aim and How:\u00a0 The aim of the project is to travel to create a body of work that tells the story of the Norwigien way of life and its rarely seen people. My plan will be to spend time documenting this vast and powerful landscape, along with the people who inhabit such a beautiful yet hostile and unforgiving place. The trip will last around 10 days travelling from the UK to Bodo and from there taking the 4 hour boat trip across to the remote Lofoten Islands. Once here the rest of the journey will be taken largely on foot, simply exploring and getting lost in the land. With the hope of meeting new people along the way and finding out how Friluftsliv effects their way they life, learning just what this word means to the people of Norway. I hope to return with their words and images creating a story of a culture steeped in passion for the natural world.\u00a0 I plan to capture the project using my medium format camera, the Mamyia RB67, this cumbersome camera might not be anyone first choice for a project primarily undertaken on foot, however this camera is able to capture a beautiful tonal range allowing for stunning landscape shots and portraits. The softness of this camera and its response to natural light is somewhat magical and by far the best choice for such an emotive photographic story. The Outcome: \u00a0  \u00a0  The final outcome for this project will be a large hard back full colour photobook, around 9 x 9 inch square with approximately 100 pages. As well as an array of images, I hope to also include some text and quotations from the people I meet along the way.  Where your money goes and why we need your help: As a recent graduate money is tight and funning small photographic projects is tough enough as it is, let alone a large scale project such as this. This is where we need your help!  Your money would enable me to make this trip and create a large scale body of work that I hope will inspire people and get us all thinking about our daily lives and what we do with our time and our landscapes. The money would fund every part of this trip from the travel to the outdoor living. From the development of film to prints on return, all the way to the creation of the book. Every part of this trip is vital to its success and with your help it can become a reality.   Kistarter is ALL or NOTHING meaning for this project to go ahead we need to reach our target of \u00a37500 to be able to make a great success. ",
  "Hey, My names Scott Roberts and I'm currently a student at East 15 Acting School studying on their BA Physical Theatre Degree. As well as being an inspired performer, I've always enjoyed being behind the stage focusing on film, editing, photography and so on. I'm coming up to the end of my second year and over the past year I've been planning my own production company called CutLeaf Productions. The idea stemmed from the fact that it's ridiculously difficult for new emerging artists or any artist in general to break into the arts industry. Especially those less privileged. CutLeaf productions is and will be all about the artists that bless our stages and TV today. The aim for this company is to branch out and become more popular and accessible to people around the UK. For now we're sticking in the one location due to studies and time availability but as soon as I graduate we will be looking at the bigger picture. For me its important to start now, so when I graduate there is a solid business in the making as opposed to just starting one up. As we progress new skills will be learned which means we will be more versatile for people's needs. Its early days so much more can come from this and I strongly believe something will.\u00a0 I do work in the term breaks, but I don't make enough money to pay for all the equipment needed unfortunately. The money I'm asking for will impact us hugely, as it will improve the quality of our work. The amount I ask for covers just about the bare minimal I need to start this up, but I'm prepared to work as hard as I can to provide the rest. Even the littlest amount will help so I ask you to share this with friends, family or anyone you think may have an interest to help this project. To give you an insight what the money will be used for I've listed the main things below, the money made won't cover all the items but will get the essentials. - Panasonic G7 - 14-140mm Lens - Rode VideoMic Pro - Rode Deadcat VMP Furry Windshield There's a lot more equipment we'll be looking at investing in but for now this will help us to start out. You can find and support us on other social media sites too such as: - Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/CutLeafproductions - Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/cutleafprod Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope you will see big things happen in the future with CutLeaf.

  "The idea is to publish an ongoing 100 page full colour glossy coffee table magazine that has 100 photographs supplied by contributors like yourselves from around the world who have taken that one photograph that they want the world to see. Here's how it works.Everyone, especially these days with phones having high pixel cameras in them, has taken \"that one\" picture that has turned out so beautiful people are always commenting on how great it is. Well, with this idea you can get that picture into a limited edition of less than 1,000 x 100 page 1st edition full colour glossy hard cover magazines with your own personal editorial for the picture you have submitted on the page that your picture features, and your name will also feature in the index at the front of the magazine and we deliver via post directly to you free of charge, and all for $100.00.\u00a0If extra copies are desired by you when submitting your first photograph just include an extra $25.00 per extra copy ordered plus postage and handling with the names and addresses of the recipients of the magazines and we will post them directly for you to them or they can be all sent to the one postal address supplied by you.\u00a0( postage & handling for any additional copies you and your friends may wish to order will be $5 within Australia & $10 for overseas orders per magazine.)\u00a0What we will do is take the original photograph that you have sent in and edit it for the page ( not altering or touching it up, just making it fit a magazine format) then we will check your editorial for grammatical errors and edit it accordingly ( again not changing the content of your description ) and setting it to print for the page.\u00a0When we receive the first 100 random photographs from you our supporters, we send those to our printers in South Korea and have them printed and back in the country within 2 weeks.\u00a0 The photographs must be of a good resolution (pixel count), be of a PG RATING and that you personally own or have the rights to use to be \u00a0included in these magazines.\u00a0Dependent of how our supporter contributions, online sales and pre orders have gone, we might have to do a reprint of the original magazine, but they will always be printed in 1st editions of 1,000 copies or less.\u00a0SO IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE FIRST 100 PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THIS MAGAZINE YOU AREGUARANTEED TO RECEIVE YOUR 1st EDITION, 1st COPY(IES) OF THIS HIGH QUALITY PUBLICATION DELIVERED TO YOU WITHIN THE TIME FRAME PROMISED WITH YOUR PHOTOGRAPH AND EDITORIAL INSIDE FOR YOU AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS TO SEE AND CHERISH!\u00a0The bread and butter of this ongoing project will be the continual flow of pictures from people on the net from all over the world who have seen or heard of this fantastic magazine offer, all starting through kickstarters world audience. This is for anyone who wants a picture of their own in a glossy magazine that has been bought by 1,000 people then seen by friends and family of those 1000 people and whoever else around the world who picks up one of these magazines and has a look and that's good for anyone's ego! \u00a0And the ongoing success of the magazine.\u00a0Remember these photographs and editorials will be coming \u00a0from contributors from all the corners of the world and will have content and subject matter as diverse and unique as the people and places they come from and your photographs will be in these magazines that will be sent back out to these same contributors from all around the world and because of this and the varied content and subject matter due to its origins through kickstarters audience and our clever online placement once this project is up and running, your photographs will be getting world wide exposure as well as the magazine reaching the same world audience for future contributors to see and be able to use this amazing new format to show off their photography.\u00a0 We could do limited or themed editions of the magazine down the track, who knows?\u00a0WE ONLY NEED 100 PEOPLE who want to get their picture in a glossy magazine to get this project off the ground and then as their friends and others around the world see this unique opportunity they might want to submit a photograph themselves, then as their friends look at their magazines they might want to get a photograph of their own published maybe, then exponentially grow? \u00a0I think so!\u00a0We will keep the rights to use the photographs you have sent in case there is a need for them to be used again in a different publication, (themed edition or an anniversary edition), \u00a0but you will automatically be informed and receive a copy of the new edition your photograph has been used in free of charge.\u00a0I see this ongoing publication as a magazine of complete variety and uniqueness available and open to anyone and everyone. I see amateur photographers wanting to show off how their photography looks in publication who would never have the opportunity otherwise. Imagine if one of those photographers becomes famous and they had featured in the magazine your photograph has been published in?\u00a0I think this magazine will take on a life of its own and will grow beyond belief!Be one of the first!\u00a0GLIMPSES OF TIME.........\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Everybody has that one photograph\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.............SNAPSHOTS BY YOU .\u00a0",
  "Hello,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I am a young up and coming producer looking to increase opportunities on and off the stage. This is my very first self written and produced project and a lot of the cast first time doing online work. We need funding for important equipment such as cameras, production spaces, costumes, etc. This project will be an online web series about the lives of working to live actors who are also fighting to accomplish their dreams. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The project has been in effect for over four months now and we are ready to move to the next level. I have already cast a principal cast that I've been rehearsing the first episode with since November. Our goal is to get our first season recorded and uploaded within the next six months. We are planning to record and release at least one episode per month once we start rolling. We will also be holding auditions for additional parts within the community in the next few weeks. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our goal of $8k will pay for all of the needed equipment as well as materials. With the money I plan to purchase filming products, rent spaces to shoot, sound and lighting if needed. I would also like to give some money to the cast and crew as a thank you. Everyone who has participated in this project thus far has done so for free. While I graciously appreciate them I would like to say thank you in other ways. We will also be using the money to purchase apparel to sign and give back as prizes.\u00a0Anything you can do will be greatly appreciated! Thank you for your support!! \u00a0 \u00a0Kareena N.

El grupo de Danza Folklorica Mexicana Huitzillin reune a un grupo extraordinario de personas que, por amor a Mexico y sus tradiciones, se embarco desde hace 2 a\u00f1os en esta gran aventura paral promover los colores, sonidos y movimientos del folklor nacional. Bajo la guia de Davisrael Beltran y Marco Tulio Vazquez, descubrimos, aprendemos y comunicamos la belleza de nuestro pais a nuestros amigos, familiares y publico en general aqui en Tijuana: la frontera mas visitada del mundo. Nuestro grupo es joven, y para poder cumplir con diversos compromisos, recurrimos al apoyo de grupos hermanos solicitando vestuarios prestados (algunos rentados).\u00a0 \u00a0 Gracias al esfuerzo de todos los integrantes, hemos adquirido vestuario propio mediante rifas, ventas y otras actividades . Sin embargo no es suficiente. Vivir en Tijuana hace que el conseguir el vestuario sea mas costos que en el resto del pais. Esto debido a la lejania de nuestra ciudad. Sin embargo, el esfuerzo bien lo ha valido pues la satisfaccion que recibimos al mostrar a nuestra gente y todos aquellos que nos visitan, la diversidad y grandeza de nuestra cultura aqui, en la esquina del mundo, es mas grande de lo que podria describir. Para este a\u00f1o tenemos un proyecto el cual consiste en presentar 3 cuadros nuevos: Huasteca Hidalguense, Durango y Campeche Sarao. La inversion aproximada en total es cerca a los $150,000 pesos. Solicitamos a ustesdes, la comunidad cibernetica su apoyo para reunir $50,000 pesos, los cuales nos ayudara a arrancar este ambicioso proyecto. Por favor, su apoyo sera escencial para seguir propagando la riqueza de nuestro pais. Recordar a la sociedad Tijuanense y al mundo entero lo que un Son, Huapango y Mariache hacen al corazon y mostrar al pais vecino lo maravilloso y grande que es la cultura Mexicana, donde no importa lo que pase, siempre saldremos adelante, con alegria y la frente muy en alto! \u00a0VIVA MEXICO! ENGLISH Version. DANCING THE STORY OF MEXICO The Folkloric Mexican Dance group Huitzillin brings together an extraordinary group of people who, for love of Mexico and its traditions, embarked 2 years ago in this great adventure to promote the colors, sounds and movements of the national folklor. Under the guidance of Davisrael Beltran and Marco Tulio Vazquez, we discover, learn and communicate the beauty of our country to our friends, family and general public here in Tijuana: the most visited border in the world. Our group is young, and in order to fulfill various commitments, we resorted to the support of other groups requesting borrowed costumes (some rented).  \u00a0Thanks to the efforts of all the members, we have acquired our own costumes through raffles, sales and other activities. However, it is not enough. Living in Tijuana makes getting clothes more costly than in the rest of the country. This is due to the distance from our city. However, the effort has been worth it because the satisfaction we receive in showing our people and all those who visit us, the diversity and greatness of our culture here, in the corner of the world, is bigger than I could describe. For this year we have a project which consists of presenting 3 new paintings: Huasteca Hidalguense, Durango and Campeche Sarao. The approximate investment in total is close to $ 150,000 pesos ($75000 dlls). We ask you, the cybernetic community, your support to raise $ 50,000 pesos ($2500 dlls), which will help us to start this ambitious project. Please, your support will be essential to continue to spread the wealth of our country. To remind the Tijuanense society and the whole world how a Son, Huapango and Mariachi can inspire the heart and show the neighboring country how wonderful and great is the Mexican culture, where no matter what happens, we will always go forward, with joy and our head up high!

  "THANK YOU EVERYONE! \u00a0We have made our goal with time to spare. \u00a0Any additional funds will go to much needed\u00a0repairs at\u00a0the theater. \u201cOn our first visit to the Paradise, the guy behind us had a big Golden\nperched on his lap. Both man & dog were well-behaved and courteous. Movie\nwas great, neighbors friendly, and cocktails available. I never had such an\noutstanding theatre experience in all my days as a city dweller. What can we do\nto save the Paradise?\u2028\u201d A.F. It's no secret, small theaters all over the country are facing closures because the big movie studios have changed format from 35 mm to specialized digital projection.  You won\u2019t see an impact at a big Cineplex in the city, but here in Paonia, Colorado, in the North Fork Valley, it's a big deal.\n The Paradise Theatre has served our community for over 80 years.  It has been a center of the community for movies, concerts, theater productions and local gatherings.  It is where families come together and share a bowl of popcorn. It is where young people meet to view the latest adventure film. On cold winter evenings,  people gather to watch independent films at our Cabin Fever series. Over the holidays, kids of all ages marvel at the latest Disney film. \n\n\u201cIt is a place where everyone in the community can gather for shared joy as they have an experience. A place where can see our loved ones perform. It is a piece of beautiful history, central to our downtown, that has provided entertainment for it's community for 80 yrs.\u00a0As far as movies, it's the closest place in over 30 miles to watch movies - getting people out of their insular world to again, have a shared experience. And yes, it helps keep a community alive and interacting with each other.\u201d Andrea Lecos, local business owner.\u00a0 \u00a0But that could all change.  The Paradise Theatre is undergoing a transition.  Without the new digital projection format the theater will likely close its doors.  While we are still able to book a few first-run films, the time is fast approaching where there will be no supply of 35-mm films.  The Friends of the Paradise Theater intend to raise a total of $63,500 to make the necessary digital movie format conversion to keep the doors open at this important community asset.  In our small town, the loss of our Theater will greatly affect many other businesses.\u00a0 Fortunately, the State of Colorado and the Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) have offered the Paradise Theatre a $20,000 grant to help with the costs.   This crowdfunding campaign is critical to our fundraising plan to match the grant and raise the additional $43,500. \u00a0As Tom Wills, a Local Business owner said \u201cA theater is one of those touchstones of local culture. Like a public library or a town park. If you lose it you've lost a chunk of small town soul.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0We thank you in advance for helping us meet our goal, and keeping The Paradise as a viable cornerstone in our community. If we exceed our goal, all extra funds will be applied to Act 2 of our Paradise renovation. You may also send your contributions to the Paradise at P.O.Box 886, Paonia, CO \u00a081428. \u00a0We have set up a bank account for this fundraising effort. \u00a0",

Media Update: Nebraska Ace, Ensign Donald McPherson, USN (Ret), reflects back on his on military experience and becoming an Ace with the Omaha World-Herald on March 30. Media Update: Lt. General Charles Cleveland, President of the AFAA, featured in the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper on March 21.\u00a0 Media Update: Video message from Ace, Lt. General Sanford K. Moats\u00a0 __________________________________________________________________ The Aces of World War I, when this concept was born, were knights of the sky, obeying an unwritten code of noblesse oblige. The romance of flight still clung to the Aces of World War II, Korea and Vietnam, but they had a different and more decisive mission. Less figures of chivalry now than their predecessors, they were hunters trying to survive in the jungle warfare of the skies, stoic heroes asking no quarter of the enemy and giving none as they scored the five enemy kills that made them a special breed.\u00a0 Unlike the equally heroic ground forces they protected, the Aces of these wars were on their own, relying on their individual skills, determination and daring to prevail in engagements that were the aerial equivalent of a bare knuckle brawl. The stakes\u2014control of the airspace over which the battles that would determine the course of history\u2014couldn\u2019t have been higher. No wonder the Ace is an iconic figure with such a strong and durable hold on the American imagination!\u00a0 The Ace is also an endangered species. American air superiority has become so complete, and the technology of unmanned aircraft so compelling, that it is hard to imagine a future air war that will produce a new generation of Aces.  Of the hundreds of Aces who served America from World War II on, fewer than 90 are still with us. And they are likely to be the last of their breed. The men and women who sit behind computers operating the joysticks of drones will play a crucial role in our national defense, but it is hard to imagine that they will ever have the emotional claim on our country that these remaining fighter Aces have. \n\n Wings of Valor will take a last look at these larger-than-life fighter pilots, enter the timeless drama of their dogfights one final time, and make their achievements a living legacy. The book will consist of museum-quality, contemporary black and white photographs of these historic aviators, along with dramatic stories of the aerial combat that that made them heroes and the lessons each of them learned from his rendezvous with destiny.\u00a0 The format and look of the book will be similar to that of the commemorative book,\u00a0Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty, also by Nick Del Calzo and Peter Collier and published in collaboration with the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation.\u00a0(Wings of Valor\u00a0has a similar relationship with the American Fighter Aces Association.) For the most part, publishers seem to have shunted our Aces into the memory box of history, despite their mythic status and despite the fact that the War on Terror has inspired a rebirth of general interest in all facets of the US military. \n\nThe Aces\u2019 enduring relevance, however, is reflected by the fact that they will be bestowed the Congressional Gold Medal on May 20 in the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0 The lack of competing books and the continuing interest in our Aces are strong arguments for Wings of Valor. It will be a summary literary event\u2014an authoritative record of their military accomplishments and a window into the lives they led before and after fighting for our country, with the personal narratives given poignancy and depth by formal photographic portraits that capture the content of each Ace\u2019s character. As in Medal of Honor, the faces of these Aces will tell a story all their own, particularly with some of the portraits that are juxtaposed with snapshots taken decades ago when they were young men in the thick of combat. Each of the individual narratives and portraits will be unique in its drama and human interest; taken together they will form a sort of Iliad of American aerial warfare in eras when everything rode on the outcome of duels between American pilots and the enemy. \n\n Every week or so, it seems, brings news that another of these Aces has left us. That is one fewer story that can be told, one fewer of these faces that are each worth a thousand words, that can be captured. Because time is a determined enemy of this book and will rob us of the opportunity to memorialize these Aces, we must move quickly to complete this important work.\u00a0 \nWith your help, you can be part of something historically important! Join us on this noble journey.\n\u00a0 Nick Del Calzo [Executive Producer & Lead Photographer] Nick Del Calzo is the Creator and Photographer of Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty, published in collaboration with The Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation. The book became a New York Times Best Seller. The Medal of Honor collection of portraits is on permanent display in the Hall of Heroes at the Pentagon, the only such exhibition in the Hall of Heroes. In 2008, he served as co-chairman of the Medal of Honor Convention in Denver. Del Calzo is also the creator and photographer of the critically acclaimed photographic book, The Triumphant Spirit: Portraits & Stories of Holocaust Survivors. __________________________________________________________________ Peter Collier [Book Author] Peter Collier is the founding editor and currently a consultant to Encounter Books.

Lieutenant\nGeneral Cleveland currently serves as president of the American Fighter Aces\nAssociation.\u00a0 \u00a0 __________________________________________________________________ Additional\u00a0Professional\u00a0Photographers The photographic challenge to complete this project is a race against time because of the high mortality rate of the Aces, most of whom are now in their 90s. In fact one of the Aces, Brig. General Frederick R. Payne (Ret), is 103. To ensure that as many Aces as possible could be included in the project, other photographers were recruited to complete the portraits of these Aces located throughout the country. For a list of our participating photographers, please visit our website's blog:\u00a0Our Supporting Photographers \u00a0The Wings of Valor print shown above was created as a commemorative offering to highlight the significance of the Congressional Gold Medal. Awarded on behalf of Congress, the Gold Medal represents our nation\u2019s collective recognition of the American Fighter Aces heroic military service and extraordinary achievements. The award ceremony is scheduled to occur on May 20, 2015, in the U.S. Capitol. The actual Gold Medal will be presented to the Smithsonian for permanent display. A bronze replica is likely to be minted for purchase by the public. The poignant phrases above are an adaptation from the poem \u201cHigh Flight\u201d and are most appropriate to memorialize the many Aces who have passed on. The poem was written by John Gillespie Magee, Jr., an American pilot who joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1940, prior to the United States involvement in World War II. He was killed in action over England in a \nmid-air collision in 1941. The 19-year-old pilot wrote the sonnet in a letter to his parents shortly before his death.\u00a0 \u00a0Both the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Royal Air Force adopted \u201cHigh Flight,\u201d as their official poem. This enduring sonnet was carried by astronaut Michael Collins on the Gemini 10 flight. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan read the poem in a speech to the nation after the Challenger space shuttle disaster. Fourth Class Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy are required to recite the poem from memory. The poem is on display in the Cadet Field House.\u00a0 During a recent gathering of Aces, Nick Del Calzo captured this symbolic image to \u00a0honor their fellow Aces who have passed on. This commemorative print, titled \u201cThe Final Flight,\u201d is being offered ONLY to our Kickstarter backers.\n The print,\u00a0The American's Creed,\u00a0features\nthe enduring image of Uncle Sam, paired with an abridged version of the\nAmerican's Creed, which was adopted by Congress in 1918:\u00a0 \u201cI believe in the United States of America...\nestablished upon those principles of freedom, equality, justice, and humanity\nfor which American patriots sacrificed their lives...

  "BrakeAce is the world's first braking sensor and app combo, designed to help mountain bikers get faster without getting fitter. The sensor measures every aspect of your braking, while the app crunches the data. Like any great coach, it cuts through the noise by showing you three Key Opportunities from every run you do - the three places on the trail you can improve the most. For mountain bikers, our brakes are our throttle. Yes we pedal uphill, but braking is much more important than pedaling once we head back down. Braking is one of the most important aspects of mountain biking, and even small changes in braking can save over one second on every turn.\u00a0 Unfortunately, no mountain biker knows where or how they brake, or why their friends are faster - not even the pros. BrakeAce helps you make changes quickly and easily, as if you had a coach with you around every corner. Measuring and analyzing braking is the mountain bike equivalent to measuring power in road cycling \u2013 power meters progressed cycling, and BrakeAce advances MTB. Once you finish your ride or run, the app will show you three Key Opportunities. This is where the rubber hits the trail and you can start improving. You\u2019ll get a FlowScore evaluating your overall braking performance, a definitive way for you and your friends to compare braking. You can also easily see your braking Duration, Intensity, and Modulation for all braking, as well as front/rear balance, caliper temperature, and enough meaningful metrics to keep you busy until your next ride! Automated braking analysis FlowScore to easily compare between friends and track progress Key Opportunities show you WHERE and WHAT to improve Works with any brake\u00a0 Any riding style - XC, Trail or DH compatible Rechargeable battery Lightweight - only 87 grams Advanced cornering analysis BrakeAce is for any rider who has limited time but still wants to beat their buddies. BrakeAce is designed for any mountain biker, regardless of their riding ability or what kind of bike they ride. BrakeAce is equally as valuable for XC hardtail riders as it is for burly DH rigs. On the XC side, few riders know that they are braking away 25% of all the energy that they put into the pedals. Improving by only a small percentage can save time on every corner, allowing you to pedal harder when it really counts. Gravity and trail riders already know their braking needs to improve, but they have no idea where to start. BrakeAce users have gained an average of 5 seconds per 2 minutes of trail in just one session. Using very sensitive strain gauges inside the sensor, BrakeAce samples your braking 100 times per second on each brake. Various algorithms process the raw data, and the app combines this information with aspects of the trail to make it super simple to analyze. Brake events are analyzed for Intensity, Duration, and Modulation, and BrakeAce determines the three sections of the trail where you have the most room to improve on. These 3 sections are called your Key Opportunities, and BrakeAce tracks your progress through these sections. Because BrakeAce measures the direct interaction between the brake caliper and the rotor, you can rely on its accuracy time and again. The sensor is small, lightweight and waterproof, so you can use it on every ride. Thanks to a sleek, rugged design, you won\u2019t feel or even notice BrakeAce on your bike. BrakeAce is designed to be used on every ride - just like a power meter. Because every ride is stored in the app, you can view it at any time on your phone or computer and track your improvement. BrakeAce fits exactly like a normal spacer. You can install BrakeAce or swap it to another bike with only a 5mm allen key. BrakeAce mounts directly between your frame or fork and your brake caliper. Here, BrakeAce can sense how your brake caliper is interacting with the rotor every time your brakes are applied. There is no movement in the sensor and you won\u2019t notice it is there. BrakeAce is protected from damage due to its unobtrusive design.\n\u00a0 To ensure proper fit on your bike, ensure your bike has: Once BrakeAce is mounted to your bike, you can head out to any trail and start getting faster. Connect your sensors wirelessly to your phone and ride as you normally would. The BrakeAce recording feature works with any Android Pie (2018) or newer, or iOS 12 (2018) or newer. Final details are in development.\u00a0 Once you've finished your ride or run, BrakeAce takes the complex raw data and turns it into simple, comparable metrics for each brake event. All rides are stored for you in the BrakeAce app. BrakeAce knows the Duration, Intensity, and Modulation of each brake event. Things like brake balance, total kilojoules, average power, FlowScore, and even brake temperature are shown for you.\u00a0 The app cuts through all of the hundreds of places you braked, and shows you just three Key Opportunities where you have the most room for improvement.\u00a0 The BrakeAce PRO app plots all your braking events on GPS across the whole trail. You can view details on any of your hundreds of braking events, view your overall FlowScore or Braking Performance scores, or just focus on improving your Key Opportunities. You can view your rides on any device with an internet connection, including phone, tablet or computer, making it easy to analyze at any time or to make trailside adjustments to your riding. BrakeAce doesn\u2019t tell you to let off the brakes. The app shows you your Key Opportunities, which are the 3 places on the trail where you have the most room for improvement. BrakeAce shows you whether your Modulation, Intensity or Duration can be improved, and even if you are doing Brake Checks.\u00a0 For every new line or strategy you try, you can see your FlowScore to easily know if you were able to go faster or ride with more control. BrakeAce was created by a team of world-leading MTB scientists in New Zealand. Our team pioneered research into the physiology, vibrations and power output in mountain biking, and have published worldwide. Taking it even further, we created the first ever brake power meter and researched braking for over 6 years. Results from our research has been published in scientific journals, checked by international experts, and presented in conferences worldwide. BrakeAce was created in New Zealand by passionate riders just like you. Matt, BrakeAce\u2019s founder, grew up in the family bike shop in Pennsylvania, USA. After years of racing at the elite level, he got the idea for BrakeAce during his PhD in New Zealand when he was racing neck-and-neck with a very fit roadie - Matt could hear his squeaky brakes and knew this was the only way he was keeping up!\u00a0 Matt spent his entire life racing, and has spent the last 10 years coaching riders. He left his University job and is focused on bringing BrakeAce to you. Our team is further made up of leaders in the industry.\u00a0 For BrakeAce, it was never going to be good enough just to record your braking and pump out some squiggly lines on graphs. That\u2019s why we spent years testing out the best way to show riders how to improve! BrakeAce takes every single braking event and filters them down to the 3 places on the trail where you can improve the most. Things like the brake intensity, duration, modulation, and trail speed all come to play to help BrakeAce show you this as accurately as possible. By focusing on improving the FlowScore on their 3 Key Opportunities, riders have been able to go 1-7 seconds faster in just two runs of a normal decent. Without BrakeAce it\u2019s impossible to know which braking events are OK, and which parts of the trail can be ridden with more control. We\u2019ve all heard of Modulation, but what is it? Before BrakeAce, there had only been claims by magazines and companies about this magical feeling of modulation, so we developed a way to measure the modulation of every brake event. You even get an overall Modulation Score. Brake Balance is the percentage of front to rear energy being taken up by each brake. Even though we've always been told that the front brake is the most powerful, many riders use the rear brake much more! Brake Checks - we all do this when we aren\u2019t confident about what\u2019s ahead. BrakeAce shows you where on the trail you did this so you can get in control and gain confidence. The FlowScore is like a rolling tally of all your braking as you ride, and you can use this score to compare with your friends at the end of the run or to decide who buys drinks. Since it's super simple but very powerful, you can use this one single score to determine where and why your friends went faster, and even use it to settle arguments about which type of pedal is best. Other unique braking metrics include: You have the option to either use the free BrakeAce free app, or upgrade to BrakeAce PRO as an add-on at 45% or greater savings. All of these features are in our development pipeline, with some already functioning and all of them tested to some level. By hitting these stretch goals in our campaign we will be able to expedite development of these features. $125,000, we will expedite the ability to export your braking data to sync with your POV camera. This feature already works well. We will create detailed instructions and video tutorials on how to create videos like this one: At $150,000, we'll expedite the ability to compare your rides side-by-side. So far riders comparing rides side-by-side open multiple windows of the app and it works great (check out our webinars on YouTube). We want to make it super easy to see how you've improved by showing your rides side-by-side in the same view.\u00a0We've already discussed implementation internally. Expedite video tutorials for your Key Opportunities when we hit $200,000. Based on the trail profile and the braking you can improve, BrakeAce will automatically suggest skills you can work with the help from professional skills coaches. \u00a0To release this feature we need to spend more time with our coaches to make the right videos for our AI. We have already been in touch with a number of coaches who are interested in helping complete this feature. BrakeAce started as a university research project where we looked to unlock all the unknowns about mountain biking. We had an extremely small budget, but we tested dozens of riders with this first prototype over thousands of tests on the trails. Our findings were checked and reviewed by scientists all over as we published in the science community. No one had looked at braking in bikes to this extent before because raw data was difficult to understand or use. Since we had learned so much about braking, we had the opportunity to provide advice to bike companies around the world. From here the focus was on making the data easy to understand and use for everyone. We created unique software that made braking easily comparable between riders, and developed and tested unique scores. Dozens of riders used this new BrakeAce app to get faster on their local trails. We partnered with a world-leading power meter manufacturer to create a smaller prototype, and have used this on trails around the world.\u00a0 A number of major brake companies use BrakeAce to make better brakes and make their riders faster. One of the major aspects of development was to make the data simple to understand and easy to compare between riders or trails. It was impossible to do this with raw data, so we spent years testing the right things to measure and the easiest way to show this to riders so that they could improve.\u00a0 Below you can see a video we did with MTB legend, Jeff Lenosky, while our software was still in development. To date we have tested over 100 riders in over 1000 tests, and the BrakeAce system has been used with some of the largest companies in the bike industry. Now the sensor is tiny, and fits between your frame and fork like any standard spacer! BrakeAce is compatible with any 74mm post mount frame or fork, which is the standard mount. BrakeAce fits like a spacer between your frame/fork and the brake caliper, and requires you to utilize a rotor that is one size up from the smallest that your bike will accept. Any wheel size or rotor thickness works. Examples: XC bikes with 160 post mount use 180mm rotors with BrakeAce (e.g. Fox 32 fork and Transition Spur frame, etc.)\n\u00a0 Trail/enduro bikes with 180 post mount use 200mm rotors with BrakeAce (e.g. RockShox Pike or Lyrik fork and Norco Sight frame, etc.)\n\u00a0 \u00a0DH bikes with 200 post mount use 220mm rotors with BrakeAce (e.g. Fox 49 fork and Intense M29 frame, etc.)\n\u00a0 BrakeAce isn't going to stop here.\u00a0 BrakeAce will never take the place of a skills coach, but it will change how you approach getting faster and how skills coaches work with you. When cycling power meters were first introduced, coaches were worried that they'd be replaced. Fast forward to today, and fitness coaching has never been better thanks to software companies like TrainingPeaks who made it possible to coach remotely. This is where we are headed with BrakeAce. BrakeAce has already started building a network of coaches so that riders on any kind of bike around the world can improve their skills. \u00a0\u00a0Join our email list on BrakeAce.com to stay up-to-date",
  "An Auspicious Birth 1939 is widely considered the most outstanding year in American cinema.\u00a0 Classics such as Goodbye Mr. Chips, Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, Wuthering Heights, Love Affair, Babes In Arms, Of Mice And Men, and Jesse James took the country by storm, and the year was topped off by two of Hollywood's most iconic films - The Wizard Of Oz, and Gone With The Wind.\u00a0 It was also the year that the Historic Lewis Theatre opened its doors. The Heart Of Town Originally built as both a cinema and vaudeville house, The Lewis has shown an estimated 5000 different films and countless live performances over the last 74 years, and is a charter member of the WV Historic Theatre Trail. With seating for 500, it was the entertainment center for not just the citizens of Lewisburg, West Virginia, bur for all of the people of the Greenbrier Valley.\u00a0 Cadets from the Greenbrier Military Academy met their Greenbrier Women's College wives on dates at The Lewis. Senior citizens, who saw their first motion picture here decades ago, are now introducing their grandchildren to the joys of the silver screen.\u00a0 On the eve of the death of 35mm film, we stand at a crossroads: do we let this cherished institution go quietly into that good night?\u00a0 Or do we come together as a community and ensure that The Lewis will be here providing the very best in cinematic experiences for years to come? Live At The Lewis, Again When ALL Arts purchased the facility in 2007, it was both to serve as a home for Trillium Performing Arts Collective and to continue showing movies, thereby reviving The Lewis Theatre's original purpose of showcasing live and cinematic performances.\u00a0 With Trillium and the community's help, we built a beautiful hardwood stage and added a section of stadium seating so that people could see better and more comfortably no matter what they were watching, and that a performance space existed that was accessible to everyone.\u00a0 Since then, concerts, plays, dances, classes, galas, and weddings have all graced our stage and though the loss of the movie business wouldn't directly effect these events, the indirect cost could be huge: the movie theatre subsidizes the rest of the facility; it's what keeps the lights lit and the heat on, and people like to see and stay warm! We're Keepin' It Real..Cheap! One of the traditions that we love, passed down to us from former \nowners, is that The Lewis has always been affordable.\u00a0 Our tickets are \nalmost 30% cheaper than the other theatres in our region and our \nconcessions are 40% cheaper, on average, than our competitors.\u00a0 The \nreason for this is simple - ALL Arts is committed to keeping The Lewis a community center for education, participation, performance, and entertainment; we are a for-profit business whose not \nreally focused on making a profit.\u00a0 As long as we can pay the bills, pay\n our staff, and keep the theatre looking clean, warm, friendly, and \ninviting, we're happy.\u00a0 Our managers work hard to pick movies of merit, not just what will sell, because the people of Lewisburg and our \nsurrounding community deserve the chance to see the highest quality films that the \nindustry has to offer, regardless of box office numbers. The Final Pitch... We can't do this alone.\u00a0 Converting to digital is an expensive process and has already been the death knell for hundreds of small town theatres like ours.\u00a0 Though technology has made some improvements and the cost has decreased dramatically over the last few years, we are still looking at about a $65,000 investment for a new DCI-compliant projector and sound system.\u00a0 Knowing this was coming, we've been stockpiling resources for the last few years and have raised nearly half of what we need, but time is running out; movies are already being released without any 35mm prints being made, and nearly all cinema will be exclusively digital by the end of this year.\u00a0 For us to make it to our 75th anniversary next year, our Diamond Jubilee, we're going to need a little help. ...And a Promise Some Kickstarter projects are overfunded, especially when a community is invested in the outcome.\u00a0 Should that be the case, there are two things you can be sure of: first of all, that we really do live in the coolest small town in America, and secondly, that ALL Arts, LLC will commit any excess funding towards additional Lewis Theatre improvements.\u00a0 Any size donation is greatly appreciated and if you can't afford to give, please share our story with your friends.  Some Of Our Friends Community partners who have held live and/or cinematic events at\u00a0 The Lewis include the following: American Civil\n  Liberties Union, WV,\n Carnegie Hall,\n Charleston Blues Society,\n Fairness WV,\n Fiber Network,\n Greater Greenbrier Chamber of Commerce,\n Greater Greenbrier Valley Community\n  Foundation,\n Greenbrier East High School,\n Greenbrier Episcopal School,\n Greenbrier River Watershed Association,\n Greenbrier Valley Convention and Visitors\n  Bureau,\n Greenbrier Valley Hospital,\n Habitat for Humanity,\n Lewisburg Chocolate Festival,\n Lewisburg Elementary School,\n Lewisburg Literary Festival,\n National Association for Mental Health,\n Robert C Byrd Clinic,\n Ronceverte Elementary School,\n Serenity Now Outfitters,\n Trillium Performing Arts,\n WV Filmmakers Festival,\n WV Historic Theatre Trail,\n WV School of Osteopathic Medicine",
  "This is our 2nd attempt to kickstart our digital conversion. Our first attempt was not successful due to unfortunate timing within our community. This summer our community was the victim of what has turned out to be one of the most devastating events in recent history. A wildfire destroyed the surrounding area and 48 structures at the Royal Gorge Bridge. Fortunately the bridge survived and the area surrounding it is currently being rebuilt. The fire was going at the same time as our kickstarter project and as as expected the community was focused on our famous landmark and the uncertainty of the wildfire as it moved closer to our city. We appreciate a second look at our project and have reduced our goal because of continued local fundraising. This is still an urgent matter to us as our timeline to go digital is approaching quickly. In June the local 4 screen cinema closed it's doors leaving us the only screen in town thus making it that much more urgent. Ninety five years \nago the curtain rose for the first time at the Jones Theater in downtown\n Canon City, crowds were ecstatic to have a modern day playhouse in \ntheir quaint little town. Several years later the playhouse was \nconverted to a theater and decades later it was remodeled and the name \nwas changed to Skyline Theater. My mom, Kate, lived here in the 50's and\n had many fond memories of the theater and it's beautiful balcony. \nLittle did she know that one day the beloved Skyline would belong to our\n family. Last year, eleven days after being diagnosed with breast cancer\n my mom, Kate Kelly-Voss died, leaving our family in shock and despair. \nWe quickly rallied together and decided as a family that we will do our \nbest to save this theater and her legacy. Skyline Theater is \nlocated on main street in Canon City, Colorado. For the past several \nyears our main street has lost several businesses including one that was\n here for 105 years. Our downtown is in dire straights and preserving \nviable businesses is crucial to it's future. For those that do not know, the movie industry will no longer use \n35mm film by the end of 2013. Every theater will be forced to upgrade \nto digital format which is extremely costly. If funds are not raised the\n curtain will close on Skyline Theater leaving us with an uncertain \nfuture. Meeting our funding goal will allow us to purchase a \ndigital projector, digital screen, digital sound system, lenses and \nbulbs, installation and training. If we exceed our goal any and all \nextra funds raised will be to repair the historic neon sign, update \nconcession area, and remodel the balcony in hopes to reopen it to the \npublic. Be part of preserving history and securing the future of \nthis fine old movie house. Thank you for visiting our page and taking \nthe time to read our story",

  "The Nova project was created in memory of a foster kitten that we lost to flea anemia. Nova was a 6 week old kitten who was the size of a 4 week old. She was completely malnourished and had lost most of her fur due to fleas and a fungal infection. She had been in the shelter for days, her body slowing giving up: by the time we got to her, she couldn't be saved (despite our best efforts). Everyone had given up on her as there was nothing practical to remove the fleas. A bath put her at risk for hypothermia, and she was too small for topical flea treatments. Combing was ineffective as the fleas just jumped straight back on. The fleas had destroyed her red blood cells and literally sucked the life straight out of her. We gave her everything we could; injections, force feedings to keep her blood sugar up, heated beds to keep her warm. Unfortunately, nothing we did stopped the fleas from draining her. This is the sad realty for so many kittens in America. One in seven kittens die before they are 6 weeks old. These kittens are being skipped over as they are the weakest and most fragile, but they are the ones that need the most help. The Nova Project is a device that uses a vacuum suction and flea comb combination to safely remove fleas from neonatal kittens. The fleas are stored in a bag that is then to be soaked in a dawn water mixture to kill them, as chemicals could potentially harm the kittens. The device is designed to be easily disinfected, as rescues were a main priority. Although Nova's fate can't be changed, we can honor her with your donations so that no one else has to suffer. This fundraiser's goal is to provide funding for a functional prototype, so we can show the world not only the reality of fosters and rescues but a viable solution as well. Once we have a functional prototype, we will launch another fundraiser to produce and offer this product for rescues, fosters, shelters, and anyone else who needs it.",

Pick up THE TUBE instead of smoking a cigarette or chewing on a pen - just flip THE TUBE in your hand and feel the movement of the small metal magnetic system inside of THE TUBE that creates a pleasant rattling sound due to the rotation of it. Thanks to the clever design, the movement of the magnet resonates in your hand and you are able to control it and let it flow whichever way you prefer and at whatever velocity, depending on the angle you are holding it at. THE TUBE is also perfectly portable as it is the size of a pen - it is useable in any place and at any time and it could also be a decent addition to your style. \u00a0\u00a0- play video for the sound! Inside of THE TUBE, there is a magnetic system of our own creation that gives out a particularly calming sound due to the movement of the magnetic element itself. While the element is in movement, one flipping it feels the flow of the element\u2019s weight from one side of THE TUBE to another accompanied by a swish.\u00a0 Having carefully reviewed the concept and thoroughly prepared the renewed product for launch, we are back on Kickstarter to show you the newest details of our THE TUBE. So let us proceed with telling you what it is that we are so excited about! Taking time to review everything in detail, we had really managed to,firstly - notice, and then to actually better the whole product \u00a0- from THE TUBE's inner system to our approach to production - \u00a0developing, fabrication, polishing - all these stages are a lot more automated now, for: 1. Renewal of our own inside magnetic system that is now smoother in movement; 2. Renewed plugs - now containing amortization system + they are now being actually plugged in without usage of glue - easier to assemble; 3. Our new THE TUBE polishing machine - created by our fellow IT engineers specially to polish the inside of THE TUBE which really makes the inside of the aluminium tubeall smooth and shiny with no bumps in sight (that could have been occuring when polishing manually) - just what we needed! We had also had much fun during the filming process - it was way bigger and THE TUBE had become so much more interesting to capture on camera for, of course, its smooth anodized aluminium surface, but also - for its new beautiful plugs of a neat shape sealing both ends of the tube, that are also rounded and soft and are made to ensure comfortable usage. \u00a0\u00a0While our THE TUBE Original stays trending - we love trying new things! Therefore - in the Rewards section above we are presenting you all existing modifications of THE TUBE - that, all previous campaigns put together! Our option for add-ons had proven itself to be quite popular among customers! Check it out! The picture above demonstrates all of our THE TUBE's timelines from different projects put together in order to clearly show the big picture of launches The first one is The Original and the very first THE TUBE that had been launched last year and that had successfully collected more than 10.000$, which turned out to be a huge support for us to initiate further development of the product; The second tube shows our THE TUBE Color Edition's timeline, and the last tube (that of renewed plugs and therefore shape!) demonstrates this very project! Please note that all stages - from production to shipping - \u00a0will be taking place according to the timeline.\u00a0 THE TUBE is our team's very first project and it is therefore very important to us -it's conception, its success and it's constant growth.\u00a0 This is the last part of the text that we are editing right now and we would want to share it with you that we are a little bit shaky, but this is rather for our shared excitement! And so, it is about time to share it with you! As a group of friends, we are also looking forward to coming up with many new ideas and to working together in order to continue to share our creativity, which up to this day remains our main goal. We are hoping you will share our love for this product! From production to packaging, from us to you, from Kyiv with love! Alex, Andrii and Anastasiia SHARE OUR PROJECT WITH FRIENDS!",

  "Welcome to a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d style of haunted scavenger hunt for adults 18 and over. We have a sprawling 40-acre property with the historic Weldon House at Blackthorne Resort designed to be tailored to each camper and ranges from mild horror to a non-stop, twisted trip of overnight terror. For 14 years, Jakal Blackwell has been working in and with haunted attractions on the East Coast. In the beginning of 2016, he teamed up with Jeff Mach of Jeff Mach Events and Dale Handel of Blackthorne Resort to create this fully immersive horror experience for all who wish that Halloween would never end. \n\nBut first...we have to build it. This largely entails money and support. Money is the wonderful thing that helps us buy lumber, paint, wiring, and helps us get people qualified to put these things together into structures like the fun house, the hospital, and the prison-style escape cell. It also pays for the tents (we could hardly expect our campers to bring tents that will likely get slashed, could we?), props, promotion, and the scavenger hunt items to be found, and hiring the very best zombies, insane clowns, demons, demented doctors, and other horrific creatures we can scare up.  \n\nWe\u2019ve invested $3,000 of our own money in this project so far, but need at least another $5,000 to reach the minimum goals to raise this haunt from the dead. We\u2019ve amassed some rewards we think will make your hair stand on end such as an \u201cUnexpected Guest\u201d backers-only  lunch with Cleve Hall, star of SyFy reality television series \u201cMonster Man\u201d and the Red Zone creator Dr. Jakal Blackwell, a unique VIP scare that no one but \u201cRed Zone Elite\u201d backers can experience, the chance to design a character in the Red Zone, and even the ability to create one of the haunts inside the Red Zone!

  "Melbourne was officially colonised and sanctioned in 1837 and it is thanks to that long history that we now have a plethora of beautifully eerie buildings and sites scattered throughout our lovely city! 'Haunting Melbourne' is a project created by two sisters who are passionate about history, architecture and the occult. We aim to create a photo book that captures the sinister beauty of some of Melbourne's oldest buildings! From 100 year old manors to dark, dank cemeteries, we will choose 12-16 sites in total and aim to provide a photo book that captures Melbourne in all it's 'creepy' glory! The money raised will help to launch our project into overdrive! It will be used for the production of the photo books as well as a better flash for our camera & any entrance/admission fees associated with the sites we visit. We have already begun our journey at the stunning 'Ripponlea Estate' nestled amongst the leafy suburban folds of Elsternwick. We plan on making another visit soon so that we have even more options to choose from for our final product! View all images here. We are looking to have this photo book completed and ready for sale by August 31st. With a planned total of between 60-80 pages, we hope to create a beautifully presented hard cover book.

  "Low Poly Sharks: Origins Edition Add-on now available! Our Kickstarter-limited Origins deck pays homage to the very first concept designs for the Low Poly Sharks series. On the back design, the Origins Edition features a wireframe skeleton of our signature sharks and a low-poly crystal shatter at the center. We stripped down our design to its basic elements, simplifying the design while still maintaining the low-poly aesthetic. To celebrate the final series release of the Low Poly Sharks series, we found it fitting to include a piece of history that started it all. The Origins Edition is now available for $30 USD each. The high price is due to the increased production cost of an anticipated low production run, as well as the effort we spend personalizing each and every one of the Origins decks. What lies beneath the moonlit waves rolling under the night skies? Unlike most people who misidentify the sharks circling underneath the ocean\u2019s surface as bloodthirsty predators of the sea, we at Unrivaled Decks recognize sharks as beautiful works of mother nature and wonderful examples of evolution at work. As cardists and artists, the grandeur of sharks inspired us, and we took it upon ourselves to exemplify this in the form of a completely custom low-poly deck. We have drawn from our V1\u2019s and reimagined it, contrasting the sunny summer light of the tropics with the unclouded glow of the stars in the night sky. During this time, the phenomena of the ocean\u2019s depths begin to reveal themselves. Like the aurora borealis of the sea, we were gravitated to the idea of bioluminescence, and the colorful illumination given off by dinoflagellate. Abridging the divide between style and functionality, we\u2019ve created a deck suitable for all purposes that we hope lives up to the expectations that comes with our final instalment of the Low Poly Sharks. Unrivaled Decks is proud to present to you, the second and final series release of the Low Poly Sharks. The night time theme present throughout the entire deck places a great emphasis on the impact of light in the dark, reflecting and refracting off the water. Staying in tune with our Low-Poly Sharks V1, we\u2019ve continued to use our unique style and use of the low-poly artwork to complete every aspect of each card with artistic precision and beautiful design. On the back of the cards, two great white sharks can be seen, arched in a circular motion, their dorsal fins knifing the water in their wake. The darkness of the surroundings shroud the sharks in mystery all the while the moonlight reflects off the water, illuminating the great whites from below. While the sharks swim through the water, they agitate the dinoflagellate within the ocean, causing a bioluminescent kaleidoscope of icy blues and sea greens to bloom on the ocean\u2019s surface. Much like our V1\u2019s our back design features a broken border, utilizing an extended wave to enable beautiful flourishes and fans. The combination of these nighttime colors and design choices make sure the Low-Poly Sharks V2\u2019s artwork stay as atmospheric and immersive as possible while providing the utility for spectacular flourishes and displays. Similarly to our Low Poly Sharks V1, we\u2019ve included a completely custom tuck case with a design that mimics a diorama, the stars projected into the water as to illuminate the dark gradient. We\u2019ve designed our tuck case to be as immersive as possible, all the way up to recreating the same three dimensional light distortion seen when light refracts through a glass of water. Each side of the tuck case presents a different side of the scene, giving you the feeling of holding a fishbowl in your hands. Atmospheric and stylish, our Low Poly Sharks V2 tuck case design continues to ensuring our decks remain an addition to any collection or table. From the backs, faces, and even pips and indices, the Low-Poly Sharks V2 continues to provide the same immersive low-poly feel to every single one of our cards. Each card is custom tailored to ensure that our designs are not only easily recognizable, but also able to perform well in any given situation: during flourishes, games, and magic tricks all the while maintaining its visual appeal. In tune with our promise of complete customization, we\u2019ve even transformed our pips and indices into our low poly style. We\u2019ve also changed the colors, replacing the traditional black spades and clubs with a deep, dark green, and the traditionally red hearts and diamonds with a steel blue to fit the nighttime theme. As we also value the usability of our cards, we\u2019ve retained each pips\u2019 and indices\u2019 recognizable silhouette for ease of use and readability. Not only do these details add depth to the cards themselves, but also find a balance between being visually pleasing and being usable in card games, cardistry, and magic. The Low-poly Sharks\u2019 court cards feature our selection of royal sharks all adorned with intricate crowns of their respective suit: Behind the court sharks themselves, there is an asymmetric splash of polygons that emphasize and bring out the sharks\u2019 colors. This lack of symmetry alludes to nature, with beauty in randomness and chaos, allowing the natural species to evolve into wonderful colors and develop spectacular traits. Jacks Thresher sharks are unique among all sharks as they do not hunt using conventional means such as biting. Instead, Thresher sharks hunt other fish by whipping them with their long tails! With a quick strike from their tail to take down their prey, thresher sharks are the Jacks of our deck. Queens Identified by their yellowish colored skin, lemon sharks are widely known as one of the friendliest bottom dweller sharks, if not the friendliest sharks in the entire world. Their gentle and social disposition are deserving of the spot of Queens in our deck. Kings The second largest shark species in existence, the tiger sharks, are the Kings in our deck. Donned with tiger-like stripes, tiger sharks are incredibly ferocious predators capable of eating anything and whose hunting prowess are only bested by the great white. Following our Low-Poly Sharks V1, the Low-Poly Sharks V2 also features - not a mermaid but a mershark! This time with a much more elaborate and elegant design, this mershark\u2019s dark palette parallels the deck\u2019s nighttime aesthetic while retaining the liveliness of the original mershark\u2019s design and color scheme. Unlike gaff and art cards in other custom playing card decks, Low-Poly Sharks aims to combine aesthetic and functionality. One of our art cards features an illuminated shark hiding in a crescent moon with stars glittering in the background. Much like the life preserver art card of our first deck, this circular design makes the art card have the unique ability to be excellent to use while performing twirls and isolations in cardistry. As a direct callback to our other original art card that features a whale shark in the night sky, this art card is the reversed version of it: the same fishing boat sailing during the day instead of the night, and a massive whale shark coming up from the depths of the ocean. Stretch Goal at $6,750 \u00a0- UNLOCKED - In addition to our newly released deck, we\u2019ve included an extra treat for those who\u2019ve been following our development from the start: a Kickstarter limited Origins deck that pays homage to the very first concept designs for the Low Poly Sharks series. On the back design, the Origins Edition features a wireframe skeleton of our signature sharks and a low-poly crystal shatter at the center. We stripped down our design to its basic elements, simplifying the design while still maintaining the low-poly aesthetic. To celebrate the final series release of the Low Poly Sharks series, we found it fitting to include a piece of history that started it all. The Origins Edition is now available for $30 USD each. The high price is due to the increased production cost of an anticipated low production run, as well as the effort we spend personalizing each and every one of the Origins decks. Stretch Goal at $14,000 \u00a0- LOCKED - Backers with pledges including 6 decks or more will receive a FREE, complementary Low Poly Sharks half-brick box with their reward. A mixture of sharks from both the Low Poly Sharks and the Low Poly Sharks: Starlit Seas decks adorn the sides of this half brick box in a filled-in wire frame design. Not only do the sharks reference the two different decks, but the colors do as well. From left to right, the bright teal from the Starlit Seas fades into the darker blue from the original Low Poly Sharks. Contrasting with the black background of the box, these colors allow the designs to pop off the box! Low Poly Sharks: Starlit Seas Stickers - Each pledge comes with 1 random sticker (3\u201dx3\u201d) FOR FREE that features Unrivaled Decks\u2019s Low Poly Sharks: Starlit Seas design!

They will be given upon request by the backer. Requests will be made available through the campaign survey at the end of the campaign. Signed Deck - If you want a personalized signed deck by all three members of Unrivaled Decks of either the Low Poly Sharks or Low Poly Sharks: Starlit Seas, you may add it on for $20 USD! Signatures will be located on the tuck box, and all signed decks will be shipped with a complementary Carat Case DS1 Deck Sleeve. Please note that the signed deck add-on counts as an additional deck on top of what is already included in the reward. (e.g. You want 2 decks, one regular and one signed. You would choose the One Deck Low Poly Sharks: Starlit Seas reward and add-on the signed deck for $20) Uncut Sheets - Uncut Sheets for the Low Poly Sharks: Starlit Seas and the original Low Poly Sharks will be made available for $30 USA/ $35 Rest of the World. Card Potions - Much like our first campaign, we worked with @forest-of-spades to deliver three new card potion designs! Card potions are decorative glass vials with a real card placed inside, and sealed with a cork. The designs we used from this deck are: The back design, the new whale shark art card, and the moon shark art card. A maximum of 10 of each version will be made, and each backer can only request to add on one potion of each design at most (basically, a backer may not add-on two of any design). Card Potions will cost $15 each, and $25 for all three together. Individual Decks - Individual decks of both the Low Poly Sharks and the Low Poly Sharks: Starlit Seas are available as add-ons for $13 USD, just in case you want one extra! The Low Poly Sharks v2 will be printed by The United States Playing Card Company (USPCC). We printed with them previously for the Low Poly Sharks v1, and we feel confident that The United States Playing Card Company will ensure that the cards have an incredible handling experience. Unrivaled Decks will self-fulfill this Kickstarter campaign. Since we have successfully self-fulfilled our first Low Poly Sharks campaign, we have the self-fulfilling experience and knowledge. In addition, we have an online store where we continue to self-fulfill orders. As cardists and card collectors ourselves, we take the time to examine each deck, and carefully pack each deck in order to ensure that the cards are delivered in pristine condition. While shipping times may vary around the world, Unrivaled Decks will provide tracking through the United States Postal Service (USPS) to all backers through email. Please note that if you live outside of the United States, USPS tracking may end when the shipment reaches the destination country. First, we want to extend a special thank you to everyone who visited this campaign. No matter how you arrived here, we\u2019re really grateful to have you, and we want to thank you so much for your support! We also wanted to give an extra special thank you to the people who have helped us put together our Kickstarter campaign. First, thank you to everyone who is part of the Cards and Beards group. You know who you are, and thanks so much for your support! You can go check out their group at @cardsandbeards Next, we want to give another special thank you to Kyle McIntosh. Thank you for sticking with us since even before we released the concept art for the original Low Poly Sharks, and for helping guide us to where we are today. Kyle also provided our first backer reward, a deck cut of the Low Poly Sharks! We really couldn\u2019t have done it without you! You can find him at @diesel_illusions and @deck.cuts We want to give another big thank you to the man himself, Luke Wadey, for being such a genuinely nice guy, always being helpful, and for letting us steal his picture-header format. If you don\u2019t know who he is you can find him and all his decks over at @luke_wadey_design Another special thank you goes out to Neo Patel, the person who helped us film our trailer. Thank you for staying up with us in the cold to get some really nice cardistry shots! You can find him here: @neoshaunak Last but not least, big thank you goes out to Jeff Ritter for producing music for us. He captured the feel of our deck perfectly, and really helped enhance this campaign. You can find more of his songs here!",
  "Spells are not just letters engraved in a book, spells are essential beings that exist in the planes. When a wizard casts a spell, it only manifests one instance of it. But what happens when these disembodied beings manifest themselves on the prime material plane? Furthermore, can a player interact with the extraplanar essence of a spell in any other way? Maybe make a pact with it?\u00a0 The Tiny Tome of Living Spells is the new entry in this series, after the amazing reception of the previous ones. But this Tiny Tome isn't not just for Game Masters! In addition to including eight different Living Spells as monsters, and their respective scalable versions, The Tiny Tome of Living Spells contains a new option for players called Essence. An Essence can be chosen when a character is created, much like backgrounds. But they can also be acquired during the adventure by a character that meets the requirements. At GM's discretion, Essences can be used instead of Backgrounds, or in addition to them. Characters with both options are a little more powerful than normal, but that has never been a problem. If added to an ongoing campaign, Essences can be rewards for achieving specific goals.\u00a0 Nothing better than a list of content to understand what this product is about. Why eight instead of the extremely popular number six? Because there's one living spell per magic school and there are eight magic schools. I'll be revealing more details about the rules on updates during and after the campaign. The first two Tiny Tomes didn't use the 5e Monster stat blocks, and instead used tables for scalable monsters. But since the previous one, the tiny tome of dangerous food, I'm using both. And it seems people really like it. As always, if you are new around here, you can get all the previous Tiny Tomes for a discounted price compared to their price in store.\u00a0Each of those three Tiny Tomes are $2usd in the store, but here you can have those and the new one for about $5usd ($100mxn). You can also get each one separately in the addons for about $1.50usd ($30mxn). NOTE: Even though I'm calling it a collection, it doesn't mean it's finished. Most probably I'll keep writing these as long as people enjoys them. I'm using Kickstarter Addons. That means that while you \u00a0pledge for this new project, you can optionally purchase older products \u00a0of mine. These are not only at a discounted price, but also available \u00a0right after I have the needed information from Kickstarter, that's about \u00a0two weeks after the campaign ends. As addons you can purchase any or all of the three Dark Scrolls Zine \u00a0volumes in their PDF versions at a never seen before price. These are \u00a0the available addons. Their addon price is only about $2.5usd ($50mxn) each. Their price in store is $7usd each. I'm planning to release The Tiny Tome of Living Spells in May, but I'll send the other rewards and addons as soon as \u00a0Kickstarter gives me the needed information, since those products are \u00a0already released. This new volume and the previous ones are published on DrivethruRPG, \u00a0you need to create an account there (if you don't already have one) to \u00a0get your rewards. After the campaign has ended you'll have to answer a survey asking for the E-mail where you want to get your rewards. NOTE: If you don't answer the survey on time, you \u00a0will still get your rewards, but they will be sent automatically to the \u00a0e-mail you have registered in Kickstarter.",
  "VENUS AS MEN I want to\nphotograph man because my admiration to the human shape, trying to reveal the\nmasculine as part of that beauty\u2026 of humanity\u2026 of nature. \u201cVENUS AS MEN\u201d is a\nbook about beauty and through the beauty of masculine nude. It is an attempt of braking the idea that Men are only holders or producers of wealthiness and power and those as their only elements for seduction. Men can be sensual, seductive an sensitive jus for being a man (naked). Photography\nabout nudity has being for a lot a celebration to woman beauty and sensuality,\nan idea that to me is sexist or male chauvinist from every point of view, even\nwomen, that are not only the photographic object, but also consumers of that\n\u201cwomen object\u201d idea and standardised concept of them selves. This some\nkind adoration of women (farther tan the corrupted aesthetics cannons) has\nunqualified man\u2019s body as an aesthetic value, and is so few (specially in our\nlocal culture) and almost inexistent the artwork about man as a representation\nof beauty, that even the words \u201cbeauty and Man\u201d seems antagonist as it would be\nan exclusive word for women. In almost\nall of the occidental societies is not bad seen that women look at other\nwomen\u2019s bodies, express likeness for its aesthetics or sensuality, but its a\nreal taboo the same behaviour between man or about man. If a complement is to be\nsaid, it would be in a hidden tone of voice specially if it\u2019s from an other\nman. It is absolutely censored for me to tell a friend \u201cyou have pretty arms,\nmuscles or hands\u201d even worst would be to tell it to a complete estranger (you\ncould get a\u00a0punch in the\nface) as if a complement would be the equivalent of an insult deserving a violent\nreaction. Man don\u2019t\nget dressed together they don\u2019t go in couples to the bathroom, they don\u2019t\ninterchange clothes, they don\u2019t palpate or feel each other\u2019s chests muscles\n(not even between gay friends). It is like\nheterosexual man and women were condemned to silence about man body beauty as\nif there were some implicit command that prohibits such appreciation. Why? Why is\nthis admiration for masculine body so rare? Is not\nestrange to me. Inside that silence of the conservative command, I my self have\ntaken refugee in the silence, hidden from male chauvinist society meditating\nabout shapes, body shapes, proportions, harmony, textures and details of woman\nand man body without being able to tell.  I have being\nphotographing woman nudes, because it is \u201cnormal\u201d and well accepted, it is even\na complement for some woman when you offer them to make them nude photos, you\ncould even tell that some of them are expecting for you to make them an offer\nwhen you tell them you are a nudity photographer, it is practically a\ncomplement. Today it is\nvery much an issue the inter-gender violence post or comments on social\nnetworks, but only man to woman violence, as if it wasn\u2019t real to the other\nway; its strongly said and confirmed the female virtue increased by other\nmodern achievements like being professional over being a mother only. But not\nthe man as a sensible being in same conditions (they would say there is no\nequal conditions). There is some kind of devaluation of man virtue, and general\nopinion is only condescendence with homosexuality more as a posture, a \u201cwell\nseeing opinion\u201d between liberals at least, a proselytism position that\u2019s\ntrendy, but its no more tan a male chauvinism or sexism at inverse; from far\nyou can see that is not a truly interest in gender equity. NO (that\u2019s\nwhat they say) Why not?\nBecause it is ugly, at least that is what they say, specialy in some countries\ncensorship legal arguments. In a short\nbrief of questions to a group of woman I asked them about their opinion of\npenis aesthetics and many, most of them answered with sympathy but hardly they\nadmit or expresses aesthetic likeness \u201cit is beautiful, I love it\u201d it can\u2019t be\nsaid or at least I haven\u2019t Heard it; its almost only and solely an sexual\nobject, a \u201cthing\u201d but there is no manifestation about this \u201creification\u201d\n(thing-being) of man or his penis in social networks. Hollywood admits butt\n(man or woman), vaginas, breast, but penis NO. Does it\nreally have a lack of aesthetic, not to say beauty? Is it about\nthe complex of size created on men? Or is it just for the sexual fetish that it\nrepresents? Why is it then that women pubis are photogenic? Would it be precisely, because at least apparently there is nothing there? Because its hidden between\nlegs with out really exhibiting? Isn\u2019t also a fetish the invisibility or the\nobsession with penetration? I find that\nit\u2019s right on details where the beauty of our bodies lies. Wrinkles, slits, the\nway muscles organizes together around bones and not really volume of muscles\nenlarged by steroids or excessive exercising.  I really love this divine\ncreation that is human body, a living being so stilized and harmonic, with golden\nproportions that master Davinci admired comparing to those patterns that are\nwonderfully repeated on nature regarding to the gold number of the classic Pit\u00e1goras frame,\nflowers, stars and galaxies. Espa\u00f1ol: \u201cHombre\nVenus\u201d es un libro de fotograf\u00edas sobre la belleza y a trav\u00e9s de la belleza en\nel desnudo del cuerpo masculino. Es la ruptura de un tab\u00fa sobre el hombre y la\nperfecci\u00f3n humana. El Hombre en su desnudez como objeto de arte y de\nsensualidad usando fotograf\u00edas bellas. Quiero fotografiar hombres por mi\nadmiraci\u00f3n a la forma humana y en el intento de revalorar lo masculino como\nparte de la belleza\u2026 de lo humano y lo natural. Adoro esta creaci\u00f3n divina y natural que\nes el cuerpo humano, un ser tan estilizado y arm\u00f3nico de proporciones \u00e1ureas\nque tan sutilmente el maestro Davinci admira compar\u00e1ndolo con las formas\nnaturales que repiten los patrones \u00e1ureos pitag\u00f3ricos, en las flores, estrellas\ny galaxias\u2026 lo perfecto. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se va a ver? Es un libro de\nformato mediano (24 X 29 cm) impreso en alta calidad de blanco & negro con\np\u00e1ginas desplegables y f\u00e1ciles de desprender para exhibir como piezas de arte\n\u00fanicas que puedes enmarcar para poner sobre la pared. \u00bfCu\u00e1l es la motivaci\u00f3n de fotografiar hombres desnudos? La fotograf\u00eda sobre el cuerpo humano es por\nmucho un elogio a la belleza y sensualidad femenina, lo que me parece una\nvisi\u00f3n bastante machista desde todo punto de vista, a\u00fan el de las propias\nmujeres que son, no s\u00f3lo en el objeto fotogr\u00e1fico, si no tambi\u00e9n espectadoras o\nconsumidoras de esta imagen, de este valor est\u00e9tico feminizado o de la mujer\ncomo objeto. Esta especie de adoraci\u00f3n femenina (mas all\u00e1 de estar corrompida\npor la sobrevaloraci\u00f3n de ciertos c\u00e1nones establecidos) ha descalificado el\nvalor est\u00e9tico del cuerpo masculino y son muy pocas obras las que resaltan al hombre\ncomo una forma de belleza; hasta chocan como disonantes las palabras \u201chombre y\nbelleza\u201d como si se tratara de una calificaci\u00f3n exclusivamente femenina. En casi todas las sociedades y culturas\noccidentales no est\u00e1 mal visto que mujeres observen a otras mujeres, que\nexpresen gusto por la est\u00e9tica, sensualidad o cuerpo de otras mujeres, sin\nembargo es casi un tab\u00fa decirlo de un hombre y generalmente, si se hace, es en\ntono oculto, mucho m\u00e1s de parte de hombres sobre o hacia otros hombres. Est\u00e1\ncompletamente censurado que yo le diga a un amigo \u201cque lindos brazos,\npectorales o manos tienes\u201d, m\u00e1s grave ser\u00eda dec\u00edrselo a un extra\u00f1o, uno hasta\npodr\u00eda recibir un golpe, como si la admiraci\u00f3n fuera un insulto de tal magnitud\nque merezca una reacci\u00f3n violenta. Los hombres no se visten juntos, no van al\nba\u00f1o juntos, no intercambian ropa y no se palpan los pechos, (ni siquiera entre\namigos homosexuales). Es como si los heterosexuales, hombres y\nmujeres, estuvi\u00e9semos condenados al silencio sobre la belleza del cuerpo\nmasculino por alg\u00fan tipo de mandamiento impl\u00edcito que lo proh\u00edbe. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? \u00a0\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es rara la admiraci\u00f3n del cuerpo\nmasculino? Para m\u00ed no es extra\u00f1o. En ese silencio de\nla condena conservadurista y las prohibiciones de las sociedades machistas me\nhe descubierto meditando sobre la forma, la armon\u00eda, las proporciones, las\ntexturas y los detalles de hombres y mujeres sin poder decirlo y como la\nmayor\u00eda, me he recluido en la fotograf\u00eda de cuerpos femeninos, pues resulta\nmucho m\u00e1s simple proponerlo y que lo acepten sin que parezca una especie de\nperverso. Las mujeres no s\u00f3lo reciben la propuesta sin sorprenderse mucho (a\u00fan\nsi no lo aceptan o no la aceptar\u00edan) e incluso hay quienes esperan recibir la\npropuesta cuando se enteran que eres fot\u00f3grafo y que tu trabajo gira en torno\nel desnudo o la sensualidad del cuerpo y la forma, es pr\u00e1cticamente un piropo. \u00bfSe puede fotografiar el pene? NO. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no? Porque es feo, por lo menos\nas\u00ed lo dicen muchos y muchas, especialmente en las argumentaciones de algunos\npa\u00edses en sus leyes de censura. En un breve sondeo a un grupo de mujeres\nles pregunto sobre su percepci\u00f3n est\u00e9tica del pene y muchas, casi todas\nresponden con simpat\u00eda pero con dificultad asumen o expresan aprecio est\u00e9tico\n\u201cEs lindo, me encanta\u201d, es algo que definitivamente no escuch\u00e9. El pene es casi\n\u00fanicamente un objeto sexual pero no hay ninguna manifestaci\u00f3n sobre esta\ncosificaci\u00f3n del objeto hombre o su miembro. En las pel\u00edculas de Hollywood es\nespecialmente notorio ya que es una norma, una regla de oro, se pueden filmar\nsenos, vaginas, traseros, incluso masculinos, pero penes NO. \u00bfEs realmente carente de est\u00e9tica o atractivo, para no\nhablar de belleza? Dice el dicho que, el racismo empez\u00f3 el\nd\u00eda que un hombre blanco vio el pene de uno negro. \u00bfSe trata del complejo creado sobre los hombres y su pene? O \u00bfes simplemente por el fetiche sexual\nque representa?, \u00a0\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 entonces es\nfotografiable un pubis femenino? \u00bfSer\u00e1 que es precisamente porque en apariencia\nno hay nada? Por que se esconde entre las piernas sin exhibirse realmente? \u00bfNo\nes tambi\u00e9n un fetiche la invisibilidad o la fijaci\u00f3n con la penetraci\u00f3n sexual? Encuentro que es justamente en los\ndetalles donde se halla la belleza de nuestros cuerpos, en las hendiduras de\npiel y fibras entre los m\u00fasculos m\u00e1s que en el volumen, no en la hinchaz\u00f3n o\nvoluminosos morros que se forman con la fuerza y los esteroides. Me gusta ver\nel conjunto de los m\u00fasculos que se exhiben sutiles en esa su uni\u00f3n y orden\nperfecto alrededor de los huesos, las arrugas de la piel, de las axilas, de las\nentre piernas y el propio pene en sus pliegues o los isquiones, huesos que\nparecen proyecciones del tri\u00e1ngulo de venus.",
  "Well... we didn't quite hit the ultimate goal but we are so thankful for all of you amazing backers and supporters of Jellybean Games, especially the last 48 hours that were insane. We talked about it as we were wrapping this up and agreed we HAD to reward you all with the complete set of everything planned for the campaign! We couldn't leave you all one or two cards short. Not after the amazing effort today. We will still be taking late pledges and add-ons in the pledge manager as soon as it opens. You will get notified so keep an eye on your email for that in the next couple weeks. If you pledged OVER the amount of your Robbin' Hood pledge level you will be able to apply that overage to any of your chosen add-ons when you get that invite. So please keep sharing the campaign page with folks. The more we can get Village Pillage into new folks' collections... the more we can develop it in the next campaign for all of you. We are hoping enough new folks come in to make us to the $50k behind the scenes with late pledges and add-ons (from those $1 folks) ! You'll see a link to how you can buy the game afterward at the top of the kickstarter page as we open up the pledge manager. Hold onto your turnips, because Village Pillage is back, with a brand new expansion! Kickstarted and released in 2018, Village Pillage immediately became a favorite for families around the world. It's a robust filler, great for groups of all ages. But don't take our word for it \u2013 this is what people are saying about the game: \u00a0\"SUPER easy to pick up on, with enough rules to make it a satisfying play for more seasoned gamers. This is the lightweight, between-heavy-games game that I would use for pretty much every group I've played with. Takes only 5-10 minutes to learn, and only about 20 minutes to play. Lots of fun, lots of take-that action, and lots of ways to get what you need in different fashions by adding specific cards to your hand. The artwork is amazingly cool and whimsical, and the rules are easy to understand. Jellybean Games hit themselves a home run with this game. Bravo!\"\u00a0 \u2013DJZachLorton, BoardGameGeek Robbin' Hood adds more than a dozen new cards you can buy for your village and add to your hand, making every game different! \u00a0When we were designing Village Pillage, we wanted to make it the cleanest, most streamlined experience we could. As a result, the original game is one of the most quick-to-learn, accessible games you'll ever play. For the Robbin' Hood expansion, we focused on dynamic interaction. The game is still fun, fast, and easy-to-play, but we've introduced cards with two new keywords \u2013 rich and poor \u2013 which have different effects depending on how many turnips your opponents have! In order to put it together, we dove deep into Robin Hood lore. If you're a Sherwood Forest buff, you'll be delighted by the references and allusions throughout the set! We also allowed this set to get a little weird. Farmers that steal (under the right circumstances), Walls that target other Walls, Raiders who care about your opponents' other card, and as many new Merchants as the original game + Surf & Turf had combined! We've playtested Robbin' Hood with experienced village pillagers and new players alike, and they've all said the same thing: they never want to play Village Pillage without this expansion again! This turnip-tastic expansion adds everything you love about the original game \u2013 and more! Over the last two years, many people have asked us where they can get their hands on the juicy, juicy, Kickstarter-exclusive wooden turnips. Well, this is your lucky day! Just add $10 to your pledge (or select SO MANY TURNIPS) and you\u2019ll get a pack of wooden turnips AND a beautiful metal chicken coin (for flipping)! If we can get to 900 ratings for Village Pillage on BoardGameGeek.com, we'll add a new farmer to the game! George A. Greene, who farms different amounts of turnips based on whether he's against a starting card or a market card! To help us unlock him, just click through to BoardGameGeek and leave an (honest) review of Village Pillage! If we can hit 1000 ratings for Village Pillage on BoardGameGeek.com, we'll add a new Raider to the game \u2013 Red Roger of Doncaster, the knight who collaborated with Robin Hood's dastardly cousin (the Prioress) to kill him! WE DID IT ! We have 1,800+ followers so we have gone ahead and added a brand new Wall character to the Robbin' Hood expansion. Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe (We have not done the art yet for this goal). Take a look at his power and how he will gain a special bonus when up against the nobility cards - such as a Merchant. NOW... since blowing past 1,700 followers and at 1,800... when we reach 1900 followers on Facebook, we'll add a brand new FARMER to the game \u2013 The Bishop of Hereford. The Bishop gains a huge amount of turnips each turn \u2013 but only if he's up against one of the simple starting cards. To help us unlock this card, all you need to do is click through to Facebook and hit 'like' or follow. It's that simple! If we can reach 1400 followers on Instagram, we'll add a brand new Merchant to Robbin' Hood \u2013 Alan-A-Dale! You probably know him as the rooster from Disney's Robin Hood, Alan-A-Dale was a traveling musician. When you play him to buy a relic, he also gains you a turnip and a new card from the market! But if you can't afford to keep him, he'll go straight to the poorest player... To bring Alan-A-Dale into the game, just follow us on Instagram, and be kept up-to-date with all our Jellybeanish shenanigans! Design \u2013 Peter C.

  "Downtown Dirty is a philanthropic venture that uses fashion as the vehicle to raise money for specific charitable causes. Each new Downtown Dirty collection will benefit a specific charity. Downtown Dirty is entering the market with the gender fluid B*TCH Collection (Are you Bitch or Butch?): sexy, comfortable underwear, tees/tanks, socks and hats, with a portion of proceeds designated to Anti-Bullying Efforts.\u00a0 Through extensive market research, the founders determined that Downtown Dirty was entering the market one step ahead of trend. The Gender Fluid movement is quickly becoming the future of fashion. Please see below for how Downtown Dirty merges pop culture INFLUENCERS, CURRENT TRENDS & SUCCESSFUL LIFESTYLE BRANDS.\u00a0 Each collection will have a represented charitable theme throughout its campaign. For instance, our featured model in our video campaign and print ads is transgender, and all charitable proceeds will benefit anti-bullying organizations.

Downtown Dirty doesn't want to use the crowds just for funding; we want to engage the crowds to actually help develop the brand. Our rewards are specifically geared towards giving other aspiring entrepreneurs and artists the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to further develop their brands and fledgling careers. \u00a0 Fashion is a global multi-trillion dollar industry. While many fashion companies support charities and do give a nominal % to such charities, often \"behind the scenes,\" our goal was to reverse the model and create a brand whose focus is on highlighting the very organizations that we are contributing to by incorporating those causes into our products, both concretely and via marketing/advertising efforts. The collaboration with our backers will be so hands on, from rewards that include remotely taking part in our print and ad campaigns, as well as having the opportunity to participate in the creation of future collections and the charities for which they benefit.\u00a0We wanted to come up with what was the most profitable and cost effective way to enter the fashion industry, and after much research, launching a line that starts with basic underwear and tees/tanks and socks and hats was what we felt would be the winning formula.\u00a0 We are looking for funding to manufacture our first run of the Downtown Dirty B*TCH (Are you BUTCH OR BITCH?)

  "\u00a0Polynesian ethnoastronomy and the Rapanui planetarium If the superb seafaring abilities of Polynesians are any indication, their knowledge of celestial phenomena was vast. Some 3,500 years ago, the ancestors of the Polynesians led the speediest human expansion of the pre-historic world, guided by nothing more than their complex astronomical observations and an understanding of natural signs. This knowledge, coupled with tremendous navigational skills and human ingenuity, allowed the Polynesians to explore the vast Pacific Ocean and develop highly sophisticated cultures on hundreds of different islands, their most remote settlement being on Rapa Nui (a.k.a. Easter Island). Yet few people know about these feats, and fewer still that Polynesian skywatching also served a far more important function: to establish a cycle of yearly activities, the heavens being the inspiration for cultural principles so significant that Polynesians saw in them the work of the gods. \u00a0 Our aim is to enlighten our visitors regarding the Rapanui vision of the cosmos, the practical application of astronomic observation as well as its role in local mythology and religion. However, we are also committed to research and education, sharing educational programs with students free of charge, inviting qualified guest lecturers to do workshops and presentations, and carrying out projects that shed light on Rapanui and Polynesian archaeoastronomy by evaluating data using the planetarium and photogrammetry/3D-modelling. We started building the main facilities last year, putting together the dome, buying the necessary furniture and equipment, and working with experts who could make and produce our film. Unfortunately, an increase in cargo delivery prices led us to exceed our estimated budget and we now need an additional US $11,000 to complete the project. This will be spent on finishing the floor, painting and polishing the dome, and completing the roof. \u00a0Toilets, windows, and doors also need to be installed. In addition, the access that leads to the planetarium needs to be repaired and also a small car park must be enabled. Finally, there are fire escape signs, extinguishers, etc., that need to be placed in order to comply with local regulations. We have received much support from the local community mainly because the planetarium is a means of supporting and furthering the cultural revival being experienced by the Rapanui at present. In this context, the planetarium will serve as an educational tool for the children, to showcase the ancient wisdom of their ancestors and how they used their extensive knowledge of the natural world to find their place in the universe. Support for our worthy cause at this critical time in Rapanui history will be remembered for many years to come. Furthermore, ALL US-BASED DONATIONS are TAX-DEDUCTIBLE via our NON-PROFIT FOUNDATION. We hope this planetarium will bring to life the essence of the ancient Rapanui people, their culture and religious beliefs, starring the natural beauty of Rapa Nui, its people and its pristine skies. We wish to stir the emotions deep inside the hearts and minds of our visitors, invoking those feelings that pervade us when we observe the immensity of the night sky, that which encapsulates our past and future dreams. \u00a0\u00a0 To learn more, visit us as www.rapanuiplanetarium.com.

  "THE STORY\u00a0 \u00a0At the age of 14 I embarked on the mission to create a better bikini line. I found out that unique swimwear was too expensive and the affordable ones were generic. So, I drew a few designs that would flatter, yet support the many different female bodies. I quickly realized that many swimsuits are mass- produced in foreign countries, with poor labor standards. Inspiring Karma Bikinis to be a fair trade brand.\u00a0 \u00a0THE DIFFERENCE \u00a0It is a style that appears seamless, creating more comfort when worn. This is a style comparable to luxurious Bikini Lines like Acacia and L Space. Another aspect to my swimwear, it will not only benefit the customer, but also the environment. To make this happen, I will make a 7% donation of all proceeds to ocean conservation efforts.\u00a0 \u00a0THE BIKINIS\u00a0 \u00a0I have spent many hours in making and designing the bikinis. I determined early that I needed to make my pieces not only beautiful, but functional and of the highest quality. I came up with a new way of making swimsuits that would distinguish us. Furthermore, suits are sewn with a special type of stitching called \u201cbagged\u00ad-out stitching,\u201d which allows the suits to appear stitch free. With a stitch free look comes a stitch free feel, which means the comfort and overall fit is greatly improved. This is a style comparable to luxurious Bikini Lines like Acacia and L Space, which have pieces that retail over $150. Karma Bikinis in comparison is aimed to be at a mid-market price point. We predict this to be a key aspect to being a competitive line in the swimwear industry. Most importantly I take great pride in helping my customers stand out with flattering yet eye popping pieces, I designed my Bikini Line to be very versatile, with styles that span the gamut, from sporty, to those that are more elegant and even some that are very sexy. \nKarma Bikinis is also available for Tweens (ages 9-13). I collaborated with Epic Sky, (http://epicsky.co) as Karma Bikinis for Epic Sky for 2016 line. These bikinis have been specially designed by me for Tween girls, altering some of the current 2016 styles to conform to that of a young girl\u2019s. OCEAN CONSERVATION \u00a0My swim line is one of the few if any that are commited to donatating 7% of total proceeds to ocean conservation. For the 2016 line we plan to donate to Shark Stewards, a nonprofit shark conservation and marine biology preservation center (http://sharkstewards.org).\u00a0 \u00a0MONEY IS TO\u00a0",

  "The Electric Eel Wheel Yarn Counter is an accurate, versatile, and affordable yarn length measuring tool. It is great for knitters, crocheters, spinners, weavers, and anyone else who uses yarn. Knowing how much yarn you have in your stash is very useful for many reasons. Join the amazing Electric Eel Wheel (EEW) community and help bring this new fiber tool to life.\u00a0As with all my Kickstarter projects, I will keep everyone informed of the journey of this product and provide lots of interesting behind-the-scenes updates on how this product is made. I'm planning some polls so your input will help make the yarn counter even more awesome. Accuracy for a yarn counter is crucial. So how accurate is this yarn counter?\u00a0If you're looking for the short answer, this yarn counter showed a measurement error of only 0% to 3% with our latest prototypes. This is very good, and I expect the final version to be about the same. You can find more information about accuracy in the \"Accuracy Details\" section below. The EEW yarn counter handles thin to thick yarns.\u00a0In my testing I found this counter works well for any thin yarn. As long as your thin yarn doesn't fall apart this counter can count it. It also handled every yarn we tested up through bulky yarns (8 Wraps Per Inch (WPI)). The upper limit was set to handle the vast majority of the yarns the EEW community requested. \u00a0However, being able to measure even thicker yarns would have increased the cost and size.\u00a0This yarn counter can also measure stretchy, inelastic and slippery yarns. The yarn counter can measure your yarn at any point in your workflow. It works in line with bobbins, swifts, ball winders, skein winders, cones, and balls of yarn. The counter does not need an extra pass just to count your yarn. As a result, you'll be more likely to incorporate this yarn counter into your fiber workflow, and you won't need to waste extra time measuring yarn. I always strive to make the best possible product at the most reasonable price. Some yarn counters are less expensive, but they are usually counters based on measuring fishing line that doesn't work well when they measure fiber. Other yarn counters cost hundreds of dollars. The EEW community said $50 would be a good price point.\u00a0I've designed this yarn counter with that price in mind.\u00a0I have not settled on a final retail price because of fluctuations in manufacturing costs, but I am working towards that $50 target. There is a Kickstarter discount because it helps me fund a large initial order at the factories that manufacture my designs. This large initial batch is one of the ways I'm able to keep this affordable so I am very thankful for everyone who backs this Kickstarter campaign. Below is a list of all the different menus currently in the yarn counter. Some additional menus may be added, and the menus shown below may be modified in the final product. A clamp mechanism lets you clamp the yarn counter to a table so it doesn't move around while measuring yarn. This clamp is a lot longer than other similar clamps I've seen allowing it to handle tables up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick. The counter has rubber feet on the bottom, and the clamp has a rubber grip strip that ensures it's stationary when clamped in place. The clamp fits on the front or back of the yarn counter, giving you a variety of clamping options.\u00a0Using the clamp isn't required, but I used it most of the time during testing because it was so convenient. The picture above shows you the inside of the yarn counter. It is held together using eight strong magnets so it won't open accidentally, but you can easily open it to change batteries or access the three keyhole slots for additional mounting options.\u00a0There is also a small switch on the inside that lets you flip the text on the screen so you can read it more easily when the screen is upside down. In the photo above, you can see how the yarn enters and exits the yarn counter. This open design makes it easy to load different thicknesses of yarn. The metal guide hooks are an open pigtail design rather than closed loops. This lets you put the yarn on without threading it through any holes, and remove the yarn without ever needing to break it. I designed this yarn counter to have a long battery life using 2 AA batteries.\u00a0With typical use, I estimate the yarn counter will work for well over one year on a single pair of AA batteries. To break this down a little more: when the display is on, it should run 1000+ hours.\u00a0In this state, it uses 1.9 milliamps from the batteries. When the display is off, it does use a tiny amount of power (10 microamps from the batteries). In this state, the device will last normally as long as your batteries (generally 5-10 years). The device will save all your progress and turn itself off when you either press the power button or after 30 minutes with no activity. Having it automatically turn off turned out to be really important in our testing because testers would forget to turn it off so we added this feature to the software. Everyone loved this auto off feature. At this time, we are planning to ship the yarn counter without batteries. The version of the yarn counter used in the video and shown in these photos was the first sample we got from the factory that makes our plastic molds. The keypad and disk colors don't match, and at a minimum, I am considering adjusting the colors so they match better. However, I plan to allow the community to give feedback on the colors.\u00a0If there is some other color that is more popular by a significant margin, then the color might change. If you are the kind of person for whom color is critical, and you won't want it if the colors don't match your preference, then it might be best to wait until it's available on my store after the Kickstarter has finished because then the colors will be final. Several aspects of the design of this yarn counter inherently make it highly accurate. Other yarn counters make ridiculously low error claims. Most likely, they are using a mathematical model to calculate error. Using this method for the EEW yarn counter yields an error rate of less than 0.02%, but in the real world of yarn measurements, the error is higher. One major additional source of error that other yarn counters don't even try to address is the diameter of the yarn. The drawing below illustrates how the pulley the yarn goes around is one diameter, but the effective diameter increases when you measure real yarn. This effective diameter increases by the diameter of your yarn. Put simply, the thicker the yarn you are measuring, the more error you introduce because of the increase in diameter. I found this was the dominating error for heavier weight (8 WPI) yarns, accounting for nearly 6% of the error with bulky (8 WPI) yarn. To correct for these yarn diameter errors, I added a menu option called \"Yarn WPI.\" WPI stands for \"wraps per inch,\" an industry standard for measuring yarn. You can set the diameter of yarn by selecting from common WPI sizes in the menu. I ship a card with the EEW Yarn Counter that makes it easy for you to pick the correct WPI of the yarn you are measuring. If you prefer not to play with this setting, you don't have to. By default, thin yarn will measure more accurately, and bulky yarn will undercount by around 6%. If accuracy calculations interest you, I provide the calculations spreadsheet. It has all the calculations used in the microcontroller to make the math work with full accuracy and without overflowing 32-bit fixed point math. The spreadsheet also has full details about the different types of errors and exactly what those errors are. Another consideration is how fast a device can measure accurately.\u00a0If an electronic yarn counter doesn't measure quickly enough, it will undercount your yarn! This is because it will miss counting some of the disk rotations. The electronics and software on this yarn counter are designed to handle speeds up to 14 yards/second or 13 metres/second. If you were driving, this would be 30 mph (48 km/h), so as you can see, this is quite fast.\u00a0I didn't come up with a method to pull yarn through the counter this quickly and suspect you'd have a lot of issues going this fast because the smallest tangle would result in broken yarn. If it turns out people can come up with a way of moving yarn even faster, I would consider changing this limit in the software. However, going faster would consume more power, and I wanted to maximize battery life. I appreciate everyone\u2019s interest in backing this project! Hitting the target retail price point is dependent on adequate backing in this pre-market stage. Backing the Kickstarter is definitely the number one method of bringing this project to market. In addition, it would be very helpful if you could share links to this project with your friends in emails and on your social media channels. The Electric Eel Wheel community is a large and helpful group of spinners, but this project really goes beyond spinners. I don't know how far beyond my core group of spinners this Kickstarter will spread. If you could share this project with friends who use yarn, that will help immensely to spread the word to others. Thanks for your support!",

Ich wollte eine private Wohnung online buchen aber ich besitze leider keine Kreditkarte und die ganzen Unternehmen die online private Unterk\u00fcnfte anbieten verlangen was? genau, eine tolle Kreditkarte. \n\nIch hab mich gefragt:\u00a0 WARUM GIBT ES KEINE WEBSITE BEI DER ICH BAR BEI ANKUNFT BEIM GASTGEBER ZAHLEN KANN? Die einzige Website bei der  Zahlung per Bankeinzug m\u00f6glich war, war eine die nur Hotels und Hostels anbot. Lange Rede kurzer Sinn. Ich hab von denen ein Hostel gebucht habe massenhaft Geb\u00fchren und Provision bezahlt und................ Die Unterkunft war unterirdisch. \nIch hab mich gefragt:\n\nWarum muss ich daf\u00fcr ach noch so viele Geb\u00fchren zahlen? Und jetzt kommen wir zu dem Punkt an dem wir das Buchen von Unterk\u00fcnften auf das n\u00e4chste Level bringen. \nWir erschaffen UNSER EIGENES Unternehmen mit einer Website die es erlaubt private oder gewerbliche Unterk\u00fcnfte zu buchen oder zu vermieten und das OHNE GEB\u00dcHREN. \nDie Anbieter der Unterk\u00fcnfte k\u00f6nnen diese KOSTENLOS auf dem Portal unserer Firma anbieten mit ihren Daten so dass sie von Interessenten kontaktiert werden k\u00f6nnen.\u00a0 OHNE GEB\u00dcHREN OHNE PROVISION OHNE KREDITKARTE OHNE SEINE DATEN KOMPLETT OFFEN ZU LEGEN REGISTRIEREN KANN ABER KEIN MUSS BAR ZAHLEN UND BAR BEZAHLT WERDEN\u00a0 Wenn du willst kannst du deinen Gastgeber so bezahlen wie ihr beide euch das vorstellt wie Bitcoin, einen Goldbarren, Bank\u00fcberweisung oder eine Stange Zigaretten.\u00a0 Verifizieren k\u00f6nnt ihr euch direkt bei eurem Gastgeber wenn ihr pers\u00f6nlich die Schl\u00fcssel abholt. \n\nNach dem Aufenthalt haben der Gastgeber und der Kunde die M\u00f6glichkeit eine Bewertung \u00fcber den jeweils anderen abzugeben und so zu zus\u00e4tzlichem Vertrauen innerhalb der Gemeinschaft beizutragen.\u00a0 Ihr k\u00f6nnt nat\u00fcrlich auch euer Hotel, eure Wohnung, euer Kinderzimmer, euer Zelt an jeden beliebigen Menschen auf der Welt vermieten und ein bischen BAR\u20ac$ verdienen. Es hei\u00dft\n\nCASHPRIVATEHOTEL Ich m\u00f6chte CASPRIVATEHOTEL gr\u00fcnden weil ich die Leute weltweit mehr als nur verbinden will ich m\u00f6chte dass sie  miteinander interagieren miteinander kommunizieren und sich helfen und realisieren:\u00a0 ZUSAMMEN SIND WIR STARK  Die Crowd hat die Macht.\u00a0 Alles f\u00fcr die Crowd.\u00a0",
  "Hello Friends from around the world, Thank you so much for your amazing support and inspiration as I have pursued my passion and love for photography while touring with various acts around the world. \u00a0Your encouragement has been the driving force to continue learning about photography. \u00a0It has been extremely rewarding to share these photographs with you. Many of these photographs have significant meaning for all of us. \u00a0They represent amazing experiences and friendships that have lasted years. \u00a0 Please help me raise funds to further develop my photography practice and enhance my skills as a photographer. I am hoping to upgrade my equipment and eventually create the Centermic photo book to share with friends and fans around the world. Again thank you so much for any support you might be able to provide. \u00a0I think you will enjoy the Kickstart rewards that I can offer. Very best, Lef_iv",
  "\u00a0Our Goal... To create a large high-quality hardback book filled with stunning images, panoramas and written content to document the following topics: Growth has been so rapid and enormous in Dubai that it is easy to forget about the detrimental effects it is having on the environment. The nature of the construction itself has made it all too easy to overlook the damaging long term implications of climate change. Dubai has been named one of the most environmentally unfriendly cities on the planet for several factors; congestion caused by lack of public transport,\u00a0the dredging of coral reeves and the construction of impressive skyscrapers \u00a0which are built\u00a0with\u00a0disregard to typical environmental standards. These are just some of the major issues caused by the dramatic exponential growth in infrastructure since 1990.\u00a0 Check us out on Instagram! Charles - @charleswlewis\u00a0& Nick - @nicklykiardopulo \u00a0The \u2018Dark Side\u2019 of Dubai\u00a0 If funded, we intend to campaign against this violation of nature through the use of striking photography, video and interviews designed to raise awareness for the dark side of rapid urbanisation in our new hard-back.\nThe project also questions the necessity of many of these amazing structures, which, in a society fuelled by hedonism, there are many. This lifestyle is dependant upon the excessive consumption of fossil fuels inevitably resulting in pollution and climate change causing sea levels to rise.\u00a0Dubai is at an increased risk of flooding due to it's coastal location and low-lying land. A self inflicted forecast that stands testament to the hedonistic gospel the rich maintain in this desert metropolis. The Social Divide\u00a0 The expedition also aims to explore the social divide between the rich and poor to which the gap is ever widening. There is a huge disparity between the wealthy and impoverished and little in the way of \u2018middle ground\u2019, thus resulting in resentment between the classes. We wish to interview people from each working sector in order to discover their thoughts on the state of their home city.  This project also wishes to dismiss the na\u00efve \u2018tourist\u2019 perspective of Dubai and focuses on what remains in the shadows of the skyscrapers and the environmental impact of climate change. Book Format The high-quality\u00a0photobook will be large, filled with a plethora of images, quotes, interviews, written studies and panoramas of the city. We will base the volume of production on the popularity of this Kickstarter project (the more donations, the more books)! It's sales will help boost the campaign towards the prevention of many of the issues previously raised. Excess Funding\u00a0 Any excess money we make, or is left unspent will be donated to the Emirates Environmental Group (EEG), a voluntary, non-government organisation devoted to protecting Dubai\u2019s environment through the means of education, action programs and community involvement. We will also be visiting the charity on our trip and spend a day aiding their cause. Itinerary\u00a0 Our trip will last 7 days. From LHR to Emirates International Airport. We expect to go in late December 2014 or early in the New Year (2015). All together there 8 of us travelling, split into pairs and going to different locations in Dubai. They will range from the humble streets of Naif to the gleaming roads of Sheikh Zayed. In each area we will photograph the epitome of wealth, poverty and destruction while talking to those who live there in order to gain a social perspective on life as a local and their awareness of environmental degradation. We will also create a high quality compilation video contrasting the success of Dubai\u2019s rapid urbanisation and the destruction it has left behind. The group will also be talking to local environmental experts regarding Dubai\u2019s pollution and discuss several possible solutions to the ever-growing problem.\n \nOn our return from Dubai we shall begin to compile the book; the trip having given the appropriate content and expertise to fuel this awareness project and in the long term, open the eyes of those who are oblivious to the vulnerable coast line and giving a voice to all in  Dubai, through the photobook. The funds raised in Kickstarter will highlight the underlying problems in Dubai and hopefully give you all some kind of insight into the current state of this spectacular city behind glitz and glamour through our photo collection. The book and other merchandise will be available for purchase from our website, SyntheticCity.com, around 1 month after the journey concludes. All the content (including photographs, videos, interviews etc) will also be available on our forthcoming website: www.syntheticcity.com ...and on Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/pages/Synthetic-City/578908298880622?fref=ts Though the sky may no longer be the limit, the destruction of our future has to be.

We are unable to ship Ryozen to Russia, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. The streets of the Capital are bustling with excitement. The sun is setting and the three Moons of Ryozen, nearly full, are beginning to rise through the mountaintops. Far away, but still in line of sight from everywhere within the walls, the Phoenix Palace glitters slightly, as if to greet the citizens who occasionally stop and interrupt their hectic activities to cast a glance full of anticipation. The time has almost arrived and the same words are whispered at every turn, with different inflections and variations, but always with the same enthusiasm: \u201cShe\u2019s about to wake up\u201d. Along the steep and almost forgotten paths of the Rim, at the edge of the Realm, the sound of the wheels of builders' carts does not stop even at this late hour. New villages are being opened, for the glory of the Clans and the prosperity of all. Of course, in your heart you know that you are the most worthy and will have no hesitation in pursuing your goals, but it is always joyful to see how everything seems to be reborn, as another cycle comes to an end. Tomorrow will be a busy day for all of you, Clan leaders and their Kin with no exceptions, but you still have some time left to step by the Clanhouse, and see all the aspiring Kin at training. Some of them will be chosen and make you proud, they need to see you before the final nights. Your rivals are there, too. \"Remember how important the Phoenix Palace is to you,\" explains Old Master Crane. \"There will surely be, for some of you, the opportunity to witness the Rotation, and this will be decisive for your Clan. Wherever the light of the Phoenix spreads, you will reap great benefits. Always be ready and neglect no detail, her sleep must not be disturbed until the cycle is complete.\" The students are all ears. Elusive Crows, Foxes with delightful manners, agile and strong Monkeys, majestic Tigers and cunning Frogs, everyone has their own specialty at which they excel and can't wait to have a go at it. No matter how many times they have heard these lessons, finally all of their efforts can be recognized and put to good use. Each of them, like you, aspires to the Favor of the Radiant Phoenix above all else. When she awakens, she will observe the state the Realm is in and reward only one of the Clans who have been working hard these days. Will it be you? Will you earn the prestige you deserve? With all the tension you've built up, you realize you're going to risk making mistakes. You know that controlling the Kin becomes difficult, especially the new ones, they can be very competitive and incautious in these decisive moments. You need all your concentration. It must be for this reason that, almost without realizing it, you started to move your steps towards the Springs. It is near dawn and dew covers the vegetation, making the glare of the cold light of the ending night even more impressive. In this ancient place, through centuries of history, Clan leaders have always been comfortable meditating, gathering energies and maturing insights that were crucial to their success. Here you feel at home, in harmony with everything on Ryozen. You immerse yourself in the warm, beneficial water of the nearest pond, close your eyes and begin to relax. Each cycle, the Radiant Phoenix dreams of the greatness of Ryozen and some of her energy is released into the Palace itself. This is what makes it so majestic. It is not just made of stone and wood, but of pure spiritual essence, it is a dream of peace and fortune that has taken shape, to inspire everyone in the same way. Each Clan is equal within the Palace, where they find refuge in times of trouble. Your presence there will be crucial, as the spiritual forces of the Kin will also contribute to its embellishment until the last day. By then, no matter who won or who lost, everyone will join in the great feast of the Awakening and celebrate a new beginning. Among all the Clans there will always be one that will rise above the others, it is because of this competition that the Realm continues to grow, but the Awakening is not just that for you. Perhaps, you all are part of the dream. There is no other way to explain the deep and joyful connection you feel with the Radiant Phoenix as she stands from the top of the Palace to admire the result of your hard work. You all are one. The reflection of the Moons spreads at the foot of the waterfall, you notice they are almost set, your time is running out. Tonight you have gone over the reflections that have always accompanied you in your actions, but you know well that this place will have different effects on the Kin, when they will have the chance to visit it. You have rested your mind and contemplated the splendor of your world, you feel ready for all that is about to come. Your last stop is the Gates, the entry point to the Realm and also its most carefully guarded place. Ryozen rises among high mountains and fears little adversity, but it is still necessary to remain on guard. It will be from here that you will admire the sunrise and greet your rivals to begin your contention, which will be made up of both fair fights and subterfuge. Who among you will prevail this time? Our team is made of creative minds, gamers and geeks that sustain the whole process, to create games that are fun to play and beautiful to look at.\u00a0 During these years we have built a solid community of enthusiastic supporters and it continues to grow. In fact our backers have always been the backbone of our projects ever since our first campaign.\u00a0 This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.",

  "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My name is John Punt and I'm a operatic tenor and on-the-side composer from Idaho. Over my years at Idaho State University, I have learned many, many songs in languages too many to count; I've heard some of the best music in the world from some of the best musicians in the world; and I've made some of the greatest friends a guy could hope for.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In learning songs and arias from the \"Great Repertoire,\" I have come to a great appreciation of all of the music that came before us, and will come after us, in the classical tradition. Moreover, I have also been inspired time and time again to write music that reflects this viewing into our joint humanity, and I would like to take the time to share that with you.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Over the course of two years, I was able to compose a series of pieces based on some of the great English poetry on the eternal subject of: love. You can read more about them here: http://johnmpuntmusic.weebly.com/current-projects.html. In short, \"Musings\" is a unique set of pieces and the culmination of my studies at ISU. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have also had a strong desire to share with the musical world the poetry of Emily Dickinson and her affinity for birds. One afternoon, I sat down and found three poems that I thought would make for a nice set of music. I promptly set them aside. The next morning, I woke up, sat at my piano, and in 8 hours, \"BirdSongs\" was complete and in the hands of one of my dear friends and colleagues from ISU, whose voice I had in mind when writing the pieces. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0These friends have agreed to present a variety of pieces from the classical idiom - all readily accessible and easy to understand, as well as premier these works for and with me. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your support will not only provide young singers and local artists with a venue for the presentation of some of their favorite (or new) messages, but also provide them with an audience to enjoy their work and mine.",
  "Asteria Active combines high performance and confident style in activewear that is made in the USA.\u00a0 As activewear becomes an increasingly important wardrobe staple, Asteria Active aims to redefine the way that modern women dress as they move seamlessly through all parts of their life. My name is Sena Yang, I graduated from The Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 2006 with a BFA in Apparel Design. I've worked in the fashion industry for over a decade at companies like Alexander McQueen, Catherine Malandrino and LaROK amongst others. Over the past ten years while founding my own fashion line SENA NYC, I began to focus on my own health and wellness and noticed a lack of activewear that addressed my needs and desires for form and function. In short, I noticed that women's athletic clothing tended to either be unattractive (cloyingly girly or dull) or carelessly made from shoddy fabrics under questionable conditions. I wanted to change that. \u00a0 When I started Asteria Active in 2014, I set out with one goal in mind: The Perfect Legging. By then I was living in workout gear and I wanted to make a cherished unit of clothing even more indispensable. I wanted unparalleled fit and construction. I wanted a legging that would move and recover its shape from warm up to cool down. I wanted to use my years of expertise in pattern making and I wanted to produce ethical clothing in my beloved city of New York.\u00a0 I need to raise $15,000 to be able to go into Production for the release of the new Spring/Summer 2016 Collection that will include the Perfect Legging as well as fund Development for the upcoming Fall/Winter 2016 Collection including a premiere version of the Perfect Legging to present during New York Fashion Week.  I will need support from funds to cover Pre-Production, Materials, Production and New Development. Pre-Production To make it possible for the Spring/Summer 2016 Collection that includes the Perfect Legging to be available to everyone, I will need to complete a number of steps. This includes final fittings with fit models to assure excellent final fit, pattern corrections, proper grading for sizes XS-L for the correct fit with each size, and precise markers for waste-free fabric cutting.  Materials Buying all specialty performance fabric and trims, hangtags and care labels for garments in production.  Production: Cutting and sewing all garments with responsible and trusted manufacturers in New York City's historical Garment District. Development For the upcoming Fall/Winter 2016 Collection that I will be presenting at the next New York Fashion Week in February, I am looking to use advanced technical garment finishes in design + construction to take Asteria Active to the next level. I would also love to work with a local artist in creating a unique print to further express and share the Asteria Active world with everyone.  This campaign will run for 30 days to raise 15K. If I do not meet my goal I will not receive any funds. I have created a variety of rewards levels where you can shop the Asteria Active collection including unreleased styles and Kickstarter exclusives. Every dollar you pledge will help us fund Spring/Summer 2016 Production and new development for the upcoming Fall/Winter 2016 collection. All the money I receive beyond the goal will go towards producing additional Spring/Summer styles from the collection and development for the new collection. You can send your rewards to a friend/family member/significant other this upcoming Holiday Season! After selecting your rewards, we\u2019ll send you an email about choosing colors and styles, and we\u2019ll ask you if you would like this sent as a gift. We\u2019ll send them a card with sketches detailing what items they will be receiving and when. Share Asteria Active with someone special! Video by Rebecca Davis.

  "Staged Heroism is a comedy/action tabletop roleplaying game about legacies and failure, a rules-light love letter to Saturday morning cartoons of years past as well as contemporary super-hero cartoons that bend (and sometimes nuke) the tropes of the genre.\u00a0 It\u2019s a game filled with hilarious heists, super-heroics, and absurd plans for world domination gone delightfully awry. In short, it's a love-letter to and inspired by The Venture Bros.\u00a0 (Just to be clear, familiarity with The Venture Bros. is NOT necessary to play and enjoy this game. You don't even need to give a crap about the TV show. ) You have four ability scores: Charm, Luck, Physicality, and Thinkery. Whenever you try something important where failure would be bad, you roll 2d10, add them, and add the appropriate ability score's bonus. The roll result determines whether you succeed, fail, or suffer a partial failure -- where you probably didn't achieve what your were trying for, but you achieved SOMETHING.\u00a0 The Failure Bank: In Staged Heroism, you fail at things, sometimes spectacularly. To take the sting out of those failure, each time you blow it, you build up currency in your Failure Bank. You can spend points from the bank to help you avoid failing when you really need to get it right.\u00a0And you can build up your Failure Bank in other ways, too.\u00a0 \u00a0Let's add some content to the book.\u00a0 Here's some other stuff you get, along with the game book. Here are some places you can learn more about the game.\u00a0 This Kickstarter is pumped and ready to go. Look at those cobras! BAM! The game is fully designed, playtested, edited, and currently in layout. Artwork is finished. Your pledge will go toward reimbursing the expenses previously incurred and covering remaining expenses, including printing and shipping for those backers who select that tier.\u00a0 There are no special backer levels to create something to be added to the book later. \u00a0No non-game swag to cause unexpected delays and headaches. Nothing to slow us down in getting the game to you. The Kickstarter will fulfill as quickly as we can wrap up the layout and get proof copies approved. Incoming soon... PDFs will be fulfilled with DriveThruRPG.com. You'll receive a download link when the game is ready.\u00a0 Go, Team PDF! Softcover books will be fulfilled with DriveThruRPG.com. We'll get your shipping address at the end of the campaign and send the book right to you when it's done. No muss. No fuss.\u00a0 Go, Team Softcover! If you back at the Go Team Art Prints tier, in addition to the PDF and softcover, you'll get an 8-1/2x11 print of each of the illustrations below, printed on 100# stock. The prints will be shipped to you. US shipping only.\u00a0 PDF download links for add-ons will be sent out a few weeks after the campaign ends, as soon as we've collected backer surveys from everyone. Here's what's available. Note: If you want to grab any add-ons for physical books, you MUST back at the $20 Hero level, as this tier puts your shipping address into our backer report. Note that there will be no Backerkit or other way to pick up these add-ons later. If you want any of them, include them in your pledge now. The following heroes and villains built this game.\u00a0",
  "The UTILITY Jacket is:\u00a0 1) Made from premium eco fabric and lining. \u00a0We used high-quality hempcel fabric that softens over time, along with eco-friendly cupro lining (read on to learn more).\u00a0 2) Convertible 4 ways, wearable year-round.\u00a0The jacket option works in temperatures over 45 degrees, and can also be worn as a blazer-like layer underneath a winter coat in cooler temperatures. 3) Made in America.\u00a0Sewn in Denver, Colorado.\u00a0 4) Sold wholesale.\u00a0This jacket would typically retail for over $300. Because we're selling direct to you \u2014 and cutting out the middleman \u2014 we can offer it for much lower, $162. Hi there! I'm Kristin, the founder of Seamly.co \u2014 thoughtfully-made womenswear manufactured in Denver, Colorado since 2013. Earlier this year, our community co-created this amazing 4-in-1 UTILITY Jacket, named for it's many uses in all seasons, for any occasion. Many of us are paring down our wardrobes, but we still want options \u2014 and that's where the stylish and functional UTILITY Jacket comes in. We have enough fabric on-hand to produce 250 jackets in black hempcel \u2014 a certified Sustainable Biodegradable Product \u2014 right here in Colorado. (We only have black \u2014 but if we reach a streeeetch goal of $100,000, we can custom-dye neutral fabric and offer another color!)\u00a0 Pre-order yours in the right-hand panel; we're offering an early-bird special to our first backers!\u00a0 ZIPPER REPAIR PROGRAM: Longevity is important. We've used YKK zippers on our jackets that are strong yet comfortable. But, yes, sometimes zippers get wonky. If you need a zipper repair down the road, send us a photo and we'll send you $10 towards repair or replacement at your local tailor. *In most cities, there are now eco-friendly dry cleaning options. Choose a cleaner that uses methods like \"wet cleaning\" or CO2 cleaning. Avoid traditional dry-cleaning that uses the chemical perchloroethylene (perc) - that's the stuff that's bad for people and environment. Here's a sample of some of the MANY ways to wear and style this jacket. For a full look at all of our images in high-resolution, click here. Extreme thought and care went into every decision behind this garment, and we\u2019re extremely proud of the contents and spirit of the finished product.\n This jacket is made with a blend of hemp (55%) and lyocell (45%). (Lyocell is a fabric derived from the pulp of hardwood trees.) It is manufactured in China solely for, and overseen by, Envirotextiles \u2014 a woman-owned and family-run company in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. The fabric is certified Sustainable Biodegradable Products\u00ae \u2014 which offers transparency on raw material origins, manufacturing process, and labor conditions. The hemp is grown as a companion crop on small co-op farms, and because of it\u2019s inherent properties, no pesticides are needed or used. Effluent water used in production is contained in a closed-loop process. Water is solar-heated. Factory workers get five months paid maternity leave, and daycare is provided by the factory. Pay is approximately $700USD per month.\n The lining of this jacket is biodegradable, made with cotton linter \u2014 a fiber that is found around the cotton seed and is usually discarded. Made in Japan, the lining is warm in winter, cool in summer, and wicks moisture to keep you dry. Jackets will be sewn in a family-owned sew shop in Westminster, Colorado. We've already produced a small batch to test quality, time, and cost:\u00a0 We won't collect sizing information until we're fully funded, but this is the size chart we adhere to \u2014 bust is the most important measurement for this style. Because this is outerwear, size XS can get away with wearing a size S.  Made with surplus fabric (excess from factories and mills in the United States) the 'Vallynne Tank' is one of our favorite staples. With a flowy, forgiving fit, breast pocket, and a guaranteed bra-covering back, this is a great piece for layering or rocking solo. Colors available are BLACK, PLUM, and BLACK AND WHITE STRIPES. See size chart above for measurements. I founded Seamly.co in 2013 as a way to bridge the gap between affordable, stylish, functional clothing and responsible manufacturing. Along the way, I try to document our process, creating as much transparency around fabrics and manufacturing as possible.\u00a0 My first-ever Kickstarter campaign was for the Versalette \u2014 at the time, sold by {r}evolution apparel, and now manufactured under the Seamly.co label. I've been interested in versatile, minimalist clothing ever since!\u00a0 Major thank-you to the people who truly made this garment come to life \u2014 designer Kristin Dedorson, patternmaker Iris Garcia, fit model / friend extraordinare Jesse Syswerda of Eenvoud, and of course, the 350+ people who weighed in on the design of this jacket!\u00a0 Find our press kit here, and feel free to contact me (Kristin) directly at hello (at) seamly.co.\u00a0",

  "Welcome to Plague Grave, a soundscape for use with most fantasy roleplaying games. This five-track album includes a single encounter hook for each track, and a GM may string all five together to form a short adventure. As a systemless work, most gamemasters can adapt the ideas to almost any roleplaying game of their choice. This time around, I've created the physical edition of the work as a MiniDisc. The Sony MiniDisc (Wikipedia) was never a popular format, but it makes for a fun physical artifact. Even if you don't have a MiniDisc player, you can still use the j-card insert and the Kickstarter reward will include MP3 files for the five tracks included on the album. If you are unfamiliar with the MiniDisc format, please see this Wikipedia page.\u00a0 Once the Kickstarter campaign is complete, I'll release the digital edition of Plague Grave as a free PDF and MP3s. Supporting this project at the $1 reward level is purely to show that you enjoy my work and like to see these oddball, out-of-the-ordinary creative efforts succeed.\u00a0I'll release the free digital edition at DrivethruRPG and itch.io. In addition to being free to download and use, the five tracks included in the Plague Grave digital edition will be available for use as royalty-free music in your podcasts and streaming sessions. All I ask is that you credit me and link to either the Plague Grave page at DrivethruRPG or itch.io. Would you like to listen to the Plague Grave tracks today? Please visit this Soundcloud page to hear all five of the tracks included in the album. The tracks were created using the Soundtrap software, a tiny MIDI keyboard, as well as royalty-free loops, samples, MIDI files and other tools by ADSR, Black Octopus, Ghosthack, Loopmasters, and Titan Filmscapes.\u00a0 First released in 2020, I've expanded the free Atticus Tower adventure (download at itch.io) with five tracks of music and designed a CD edition of the adventure. The 12-page booklet details the tower and its occupants while over 30 minutes of music is ready to set the atmosphere when running the adventure for your friends. NOTE: The free digital edition also includes the five songs. I'm down to the last copies of The Unclean Leporello of the Foul Wizard Baum, an accordion book that I'm unlikely to reprint. (The manufacturing process was more stressful than I'd like to go through again.) The PDF is free at DrivethruRPG and itch.io, so you're welcome to download and explore the contents and use them in your game sessions. If you want the print edition of the book, this may be your last chance to get it from me; they're almost gone! Did you miss the Kickstarter campaign for Curic's Cursed Chapbook, my third-party micro-hexcrawl for use with the M\u00f6rk Borg roleplaying game? This is your chance to get this 36-page, A6-sized booklet that also includes a mini-poster (adventure), a 2.5\" square plastic card (encounter ideas), as well as a micro-GM screen for use with the adventure content suggested in the Curic's Cursed Chapbook booklet.\u00a0 This MiniDisc project is weird enough as it is, so I won't be offering any stretch goals during this campaign. This time around, the focus is on finding out whether or not there is enough interest in this bizarre album and then -- if the answer is \"yes\" -- making it happen. If the campaign closes successfully, then I will send survey notifications shortly after the project has ended. At that time, I'll issue a survey deadline. Any surveys not completed by the deadline date will be refunded and removed from the project. Surveys are necessary to completing campaigns, and I use the deadline/refund approach to reduce future stress. Surveys are only required for print rewards. If you choose a reward level that only offers PDFs, you will not receive a survey. None of the project's rewards will ship outside of the US. It isn't that I do not want to ship to other nations, it is that the time, money, and various local laws make it simply not worth the effort.\u00a0 No international shipping. If you live outside of the United States and choose a print reward, you must provide a US address. Failure to provide a US address by the survey deadline will result in a refund and removal from the project.",

This will help fund a few miscellaneous expenses but more importantly, will go towards finishing an amazing animated music video by Lillian Kology (a sample of which you can see in the launch video), who has also done the amazing cover art and graphic design for this project. If you want to help but have already donated, sharing this project with others would mean so much to me. Thank you again for all of your support! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- About five or six years ago, I started hearing music in my head. It was folk music, traditional ballads that I'd grown up hearing, but infused with more experimental sounds and flavored by my new found love of jazz. I asked myself what Rain and Snow would sound like if a jazz trio covered it? What if David Brubeck played piano for old music hall songs? What if the weird and eerie lyrics of a song like Stretched on My Grave were replicated with weird and eerie sound effects? And could we maybe put a bird on it? I'd started thinking of this category of music as \"spooky jazz inflected folk\" but when Rob Flax came on board as producer, recording engineer and side man extraordinaire, it quickly became SJIF and the shorthand has stuck ever since.\u00a0 This album is a \"slow music\" album, recorded over the course of several years whenever I had a little money and Rob had a little time. We usually only tackled one or two tracks per session, laying down the bones of the vocals and any accompaniment and then letting our ears run wild telling us what else the track needed. Among other things, we used mallets on a guitar, a saucepan hooked up to a transducer, a laundry basket, phone recordings of birds, and lots of effects pedals to play around with sound and mood. Each track is very carefully crafted, with meticulous attention paid to every detail. That one weird sounding note? Oh yeah, we did that on purpose, or at least Rob says so. The pandemic ended up getting in the way of finishing this album but turned out to be a blessing in disguise. When we returned to the eight tracks we had previously recorded once we were both fully vaccinated, we were able to listen with fresh ears and realized that minus a few details, the work felt complete, and more importantly we were proud of it.\u00a0 I had initially planned on only releasing this album digitally, figuring it wouldn't have much crowd appeal. But the more I listened and relistened, the more I wanted to share this work with the world and give it the treatment I felt it deserved. It is in this vein that I am fundraising to properly mix, master, and print this album. Mixing: $800 Mastering: $450 CD Printing: $200 Album Artwork & Design: $250 Kickstarter Fees & Taxes: ~$800 Total: $2500 This album has been a labor of love and I would love to have you be part of it. Won't you join us? Thank you! Hannah",

  "Yesterday was a day that shocked the world.Robin Williams took his own life.How could this happen?Somebody who seemingly \u201chad it all\u201d decided\nhe would \u201cend it all.\u201dWhy?What would cause somebody with such fame and\nsuccess come to such despair in his life?I decided after watching the news talk about his death all day that I\nwould like to make a movie about the problems stars deal with in a similar\nfashion.If people have seen recent\nmovies like \u201cAmerica\u201d and \u201c2016,\u201d you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s possible for a\ndocumentary to be shown in the movie theatres.That\u2019s my goal.I want to make a\nmovie called \u201cThe Hollywood Zoo.\u201dAmong\nother things, I want to expose the darkness and chaos that many stars feel in their\ndaily lives.My goal is to interview\nactors and family members of deceased actors who can attest to the troubles\nactors often feel.I also plan to\nhopefully interview judge and Supreme Court justice\u00a0Scalia to see about how\nlaws can change to protect the privacy of stars.Please help me fund the movie to be able to\nhire the right crew, pay for distribution rights, add background music, and to be able to put\ntogether the best movie possible.The plan is for the movie to open in theatres\nin 2015.If you pledge $25 or more, I\nwill put your name in the credits at the end of the movie.\u00a0 I will also give you a free copy of the dvd, once it is made.\u00a0 Here is a little more about the plot: Here is what I\u2019d like to happen in the movie, from beginning\nto end:  I\u2019ll start by giving a brief history of how Hollywood\nstarted, showing early photo and movie clips from old-fashioned movies, showing\nhow Hollywood began with such innocence and excitement.I will then begin to show how, even in early\nHollywood, how those who were considered \u201cmovie stars\u201d were sucked into the\npitfalls that this world has to offer, including drugs, excessive alcohol\nconsumption, etc. We often times in life want to come up with a diagnosis for\nthe behavior of people, such as saying they have ADD, or dyslexia.However, very few people have sympathy for\nthe problems movie stars have.Most\nthink \u201cThey have money.What\u2019s the\nproblem?\u201dHowever, stars have to go\nthrough things on a daily basis that NOBODY would want to go through.How many people would want to be worried\nabout a camera man jumping out of some bushes to take your picture when they\nsimply want to go for a drive?Or a\ncamera man joining you at your favorite restaurant, to take a picture for a\ntabloid magazine?I sure wouldn\u2019t!We\u2019ve come a long way in society.African Americans and women can vote, when\nthey previously were unable to.Opportunities exist for many classes of people that previously were unheard\nof.And yet, there is one class of\npeople in which we still treat differently, even with our laws.Those are movie stars.Why do we make exceptions for what is allowed\nwhen it comes to the privacy of them?That is another thing I\u2019d like this movie to cover. I also plan to interview actors and family members of those\nactors who died early.I know some\nconnections in the Hollywood industry who deal with Hollywood actors frequently\n(Such as one of the top acting coaches in Hollywood).I am hoping they will be inspired by this\nstory and will help me to get in contact with some of these actors.I don\u2019t see that being an issue.I also know a lawyer who has a history of\nhelping distribute films.I think he\nwill be able to help me distribute this film. I also plan to contact an experienced film crew to help\nshoot the film, and to hire a screenwriter to help me make sure the final\nscript is in tip-top shape.There are a\nlot more ideas I have to include in this movie.But for now, I just need the money to get this project started.Please help me fund what is sure to be an\ninspirational story.",
  "Team twisted started as an outreach and we had volunteers who were troubled teens or just friends that felt like misfits or and didn't have many family members or friends in their lives, we all started recruiting more people like us and a lot of youth members signed up and said it kept them out of trouble so here we are as Twisted Ent. We feel like it helps everyone and it is so fun to scare people but we need help with funding for a\u00a0 few projects for next years haunt and we will be ready to put our teams to work! Please help us out so we can take it to the next level! We will be ready to support in return TY!",

Dive plans to offset all costs through subscriptions, sponsorships, in-platform currency, and more diversified options. Targeted ads are the last thing we would ever want to do Design \u2014 You've never seen a platform like Dive before. With our multi-panel layout, navigating the site is much more efficient from other websites we have seen. Optimized it for every device, user, and uploaded file. No need to go to your computer or mobile device to get the full Dive experience Upload almost anything \u2014 On launch, you will be able to upload photos, videos, audio, text, and more.

The profile card is both accessible on Dive (with a few extra features), and our already released platform, Hydrin Can you think of a social media platform that doesn't track you? Or any large website? The reason websites track you is for only one thing, money. If it's to sell your data to advertisers or keep you on the site longer, they want money. That is not our primary goal. We want to create a platform where communities form, hang out, and post unique content! We are willing to take the challenging route of no targeted ads, no tracking algorithms, and no browsing history to keep you protected.

Here are some features that you will see with the base subscription: *Subscription features are subject to change before launch Luke Fabricatore \u2014 I fell in love with the internet about seven years ago when I started making terrible tech reviews on YouTube. Since then, my interest in technology, design, and creativity has grown exponentially. In mid-2019, I had an idea for a better type of social media platform\u2014one that actually looked good and addressed the complaints I had with every other one. With a focus mainly on design, I was able to dive (sorry) deep into the world of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. With this project, I get to make something that is literally brand new. After all, coding is the definition of an ultimate sandbox. When I'm not working on Dive, I'm getting a degree in Interactions Design, working on freelance graphic, animation, or editing projects, and just watching TV Ronny Grover \u2014 I'm your average 18-year-old that happens to be a programmer. I started working on Discord bots in Python roughly three years ago. I mainly did it for fun and to get a little coding experience. When I started working on Dive in June of 2019, that's where I started my web development career. I started with PHP and SQL, back-end programming languages that deal with storing and processing server and user information. Working with servers also meant that I needed to learn a new operating system, Linux. Server-side Linux is an odd concept in modern times where almost everything is either done through a terminal or file manager (no UI). Besides programming, I don't do that much, just the normal work, video games, and binging TV shows Base goal: $1,000 \u2014 This is the minimum funding required to run Dive for roughly a year. At first, this may seem like a lot to run just one website. But, it adds up when you look at the costs of web hosting, domains, storage servers, backup servers, and other necessities\nStorage: $1,001-$2,500 \u2014 More storage means more backups. We want to store as many of your files as possible without filling up our drives almost immediately. We need larger servers to keep multiple backups of the bytes to terabytes of files you upload\nPhysical: $2,501-$3,750 \u2014 We want to do more than provide you digital products and services. We also want to make tangible goods that you can bring into your home, including apparel, collectibles, Dive integrated technologies, and other physical products\nOriginals: $3,751-$5,000 \u2014 As you can imagine, creating an original production isn't a simple task. Even on a smaller scale compared to Hollywood, there's so much that happens. Purchasing props, costumes, film equipment, editing gear, and so much more. This goal is to help fund an upcoming Dive Originals production!\nAbove and beyond: $5,001+ \u2014 All contributions are appreciated disregarding the amount! If we happen to demolish our goals, the additional funds will go towards expanding our team, storage, services, and Dive Media as a whole Launching 2021",

Then he becomes Cliff's biggest enemy. When the Morrison estate and the Courson estate were asked recently\u00a0about the DNA\u00a0where was it..\u00a0Our attorneys asked for at least the negative results then from the DNA test Cliff did In the 90's, the answer was they didn't have that document anymore and didn't know where it was. Based on the importance of that negative result for Alan Graham, it should be in a frame over his fireplace by now.\u00a0 We want to show the doors fans as well as cliff's fans what happens when you are given this legacy and how it changed history forever. There has been a little girl that has been born from Cliff\u00a0with his finance' her name is Clara Morrison after Jim Morrison Mother.

  "The Joy of My Life CD The Joy of My Life is the name of a jig often played at contra dances, is included on Celticladda's new CD, and serves as the title for the album. What brings joy to your life? For some, it's a life partner or sweetie, for others it's an evening of contra dancing with friends, and for our band it's the great joy of playing for dances! I formed the band, Celticladda, in 2006 with original band members Tom Hodgson (guitar), Eric Anderson (piano), and me on fiddle. Tom grew up just west of Boston in Massachusetts, Eric is from California, and I've lived in New Hampshire all my adult life. We share a passion for contra dancing and the music to dance by - tunes from New England, Ireland, Scotland, and French Canada. From 2006-2008 we toured extensively, playing dozens of dances throughout the country, in the heyday of the great revival and westward spread of New England contra dancing. We were welcomed by wonderful dance sponsors, worked with some of the finest callers in the land, and played for many lines of enthusiastic dancers! They all inspired us and shaped our approach to the music. The band kept a notebook of tunes and medleys, more than enough for one evening. With experience, we found the ones that really worked, that brought energy and joy to the hall. This CD is a selection of our most popular medleys, the ones we loved to play night in and night out! During our tours we were able to record our music directly from the boards of the sound systems in the halls where we played, mixed on the spot. There are many hours of archival audio tracks. It was only recently that I dusted off this collection and gave a listen... Wow! What exciting, energetic, high-drive dance music! The reason for this new CD is to share with you the great sounds of Celticladda, from our archives, recorded live with all the raw energy and spontaneous musicianship we brought to the dance hall. This is music for dancing, but can also accompany you in the workplace, in the gym, on a walk or run, or in a car ride to ease the miles of roadway! There will be 1000 CDs in this initial run, produced through the online services of CD Baby. Randy will be handling the production, layout, and jacket design, and arranging the tracks. The CD will be mastered by audio engineer Everest Witman, based in Montr\u00e9al. Everest is himself a contra dance guitarist and member of the band Nova. Thank you, and we hope you will want to support Randy Miller and Celticladda's contra dance music CD! Fiddler Randy Miller has received the following awards: -Folk Heritage Award 2021, from The NH State Council on the Arts/Governor's Arts Awards -Ewing Arts Advocate Award 2021, from ArtsAlive/The Keene Sentinel -Designated a Master Teacher of Contra Dance Music, by The NH State Council on the Arts NOTE - updated August 9: My fundraising campaign continues in hopes of raising enough funds to: *1) Sign up beyond National to Worldwide Distribution through CD Baby *2) Use CD Baby for faster services including speedy production time and Priority shipment of finished CDs *3) Enhance the CD jacket with an additional 4-page insert with photos and text Please consider a pledge to support all the above and receive your copy of The Joy of My Life.

  "The League of Planets has maintained peace throughout the Solar System for over 700 years. As the fortunes of worlds have risen and fallen, the Guardian of the Solar System has remained a neutral arbiter, keeping order with a brave force of Radium Rangers. But now that power hangs in the balance. The current Guardian - King Leonidas - is dead. The wise monarch had maintained peace for decades from the neutral ground of Luna City on Saturn\u2019s forest moon, Titan. Now, as custom dictates, Leonidas\u2019 son, the Crown Prince Leon, will take on the mantle of Guardian until his father\u2019s term of office is concluded. However, the Uranian Emperor Ro is determined to marry his daughter, Princess Xuri, to Prince Leon to gain greater influence for the Uranian Empire throughout the \u00ad\u00adSolar System. Fearful of the threat posed by the Emperor, the other League worlds agree to the marriage, hoping that the adage \u201ckeep your enemies closer\u201d will maintain peace. The political alliance between Leon and Xuri was agreed to secure stability\u2026 but on the eve of their wedding, the daring Saturnian Scarlet Pirates kidnapped Prince Leon! Can Rick Rhodes and the Radium Rangers track down the prince and reveal the perpetrators of this sinister plot against the League? Or will the Solar System descend into war?

BEHIND THE SCENES In 1946, during the Golden Age of the cinema serials, Spenser Packard's Pinnacle Pacific Pictures produced 'Rick Rhodes and the Pirates of Luna City', a twelve-chapter serial \u00a0charting the daring exploits of their most popular rocketship hero. Seventy years later, Crooked Dice researchers working in the Sidney Barron Memorial Archive at the BFI rediscovered a near pristine print. Over the last two years, Crooked Dice have adapted 'Pirates of Luna City' for 7TV: PULP. PLEASE NOTE This campaign hopes to fund over 30 new sculpts designed to use with the feature pack - but also suitable for any retro-sci-fi or pulp gaming. Miniatures will be cast in white metal, with larger figures and small terrain pieces cast in resin.\u00a0 All Crooked Dice miniatures are 28mm scale. This means they are 28mm from the base of the foot to eye - so stand approximately 32mm tall. Comparable ranges are Hasslefree, Copplestone and Artizan. There is also an opportunity to add miniatures from the existing Crooked Dice Pulp range. Feel free to browse the website for all our pulp products. This is our first foray into providing STLs for a campaign. The home printing market has exploded in the last couple of years, so we are hoping to offer something for dedicated digital fanatics too. The models in the digital terrain bundle have been designed with home 3D-printing in mind, ready-to-print right \u201cout of the box\u201d.\u00a0Models have been parted to fit on the most popular printers and tested on a range of machines. Some models use OpenLOCK under licence. Please note that STL files are NOT available for the figures in this campaign. All stretch \u00a0goals listed are for physical products. STL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\u00a0 FDM printing The terrain kits are designed to print on primarily FDM printers and have been designed to print without supports or include pre-supports where appropriate. Models have been designed and parted to get around some of the limitations of FDM printing to give you the best result.\u00a0 Resin printing - all pre-supported! We have also included pre-supported files for resin printing for those of you who wish to print on a resin printer rather than FDM.\u00a0 DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO 3D PRINTING? If you really love the digital part of this campaign and want physical prints, but don't have a 3D printer - then never fear! Crooked Dice have partnered with Proteus 3D Modelling to offer prints of all terrain pieces once we have supplied you your files. We'll share full details of this once the campaign has ended. If you would like an overview of the pledges and rewards, then join us as we chat about the inspirations for the campaign with the Wee Gamers. There are a range of hero or villain themed pledges or a chance to get all 16 miniatures at a discount. Plus we hope to unlock further add-ons and freebies packs as the campaign progresses! There are EIGHT simple pledges to choose from: There's always room for some extra rewards! So as a thank you to our loyal backers, we have some extra sculpts that will hopefully get unlocked along the way. At key milestones, your contributions will unlock: Please note that all stretch goals listed are for physical products. STLs are NOT available for figures. As new Add-Ons get unlocked, they will be added to each pledge level as optional extras.\u00a0Purchasing these helps drive the funding total higher and unlocks more goodies! Don't forget that you can also over-pledge for any - OR ALL - of the Add-Ons right now!\u00a0 To include any Add-Ons follow the instructions below - ideally using Option One. OPTION ONE: ADD ON LIST - ALWAYS USE THIS IF YOU CAN! You will find Add-Ons listed under the Manage Your Pledge/Change Your Pledge buttons.\u00a0 OPTION TWO: INCREASING PLEDGE VALUE Alternatively, you can just add the value of the product using Manage Your Pledge too. Included here are both new packs, some of which will be added as we unlock them during the campaign, and existing models from the Crooked Dice pulp miniatures back catalog. For backers who just want miniatures - or want to purchase single packs \u00a0- just follow the instruction above to add these to your pledge to get these rewards. Please note that all Add-Ons listed are for physical products. STLs are NOT available for figures. These packs of miniatures are already in production, but can be added to your rewards - as can the value of any items from the Crooked Dice website. You will need the 7TV: PULP boxed set to use with the Pirates of Luna City Feature Pack, but we are offering \u00a35 off the boxed set exclusively during the campaign. The 7TV: PULP rules are standlone and don't require any of the previous 7TV games to play. And with 180 profiles packed in the box, there are endless pulp gaming possibilities at your fingertips: jungle adventures; weird menace; gangsters and G-men; rocket-ship romances; and crime-fighting crusaders vs diabolical fiends! So grab your bullwhip and jet-pack and come and join in the fun! You can find out more about 7TV: PULP on the Crooked Dice website plus we offer a full range of pulp miniatures to help bring your tabletop to life. HOW TO PLAY To get a better sense of the 7TV skirmish rules, we also have this handy to instructional \u00a0video for How To Play 7TV: PULP. WHAT MODELS DO I NEED TO PLAY LUNA CITY? While 7TV is miniature agnostic, the range for this kickstarter has been designed to support the game with miniatures for as many of the characters and troops as possible. Plus we have tried to use existing models from the Crooked Dice range. So for the discerning gamer, here is a breakdown of models by scenario to help you plan your games. Some will hopefully be unlocked as the campaign goes on! Crooked Dice Game Design Studio has been part of the wargaming hobby since 2010. We specialise in wargames rules and 28mm miniatures inspired by the many and varied iconic worlds of Cult TV. We have a range of over 1000 miniatures and an extensive selection of resin terrain and vehicles. We also publish the 7TV series of wargames. These fun and flexible skirmish rules allow you to recreate any type of cinematic action on the tabletop. FUNDING TARGET We have set our initial funding target at \u00a32000 which will cover production costs for the new miniatures and Feature Pack. WHY KICKSTARTER? Kickstarter has been chosen as a way to help fund production of this new set of miniatures and rules. Successful funding via Kickstarter will be the quickest way to deliver more products than if we used our traditional release schedule. So simply more stuff, much faster! Plus the reach of Kickstarter is huge, and a community in itself, so we hope it will introduce Crooked Dice to a whole new audience. THE TEAM We are lucky enough to work with some very talented folks and this project would not have been possible without them. The painting of display models (sorry folks - the minis all come unpainted) has been brought to you by the talents of Simon Bradley, Callum France and Mystic Spirals.\u00a0 PRODUCTION SCHEDULE This is how the production schedule will run for this campaign: SHIPPING As a long standing mail order business with a successful web store, we ship packages all over the world, every day. So you can rest assured that your parcels are in good hands and will reach you safely. We always try and charge a flat rate - or pack in multiple parcels if cheaper for you - but as I am sure you have you may be aware shipping costs have risen significantly since lockdown - especially to Rest of the World and the USA. The shipping will be added AFTER the Kickstarter, so is not included in your pledge. Shipping cost will be calculated by weight and size of your pledge plus any variables that you may add in the webstore. Where this requires multiple small parcels to fulfill, additional costs may be required. All pledges requiring shipping in a small parcel. Crooked Dice are not responsible for any additional shipping, handling or custom charges. BOXED GAMES PARCELS You can choose to add the 7TV: PULP box to your rewards. Please be aware that this set weighs 1.4kg and is classed as a small parcel - which does attract a heavier shipping cost. Non-UK shipping will start at the highest band in the table above for this item. PERSONAL LICENCE Pledging on this campaign gives you access to the STL Only pledge reward files as they are released on a virtual drive. The STL files are:",
  "A plain-text version of this page is available here. The Slow Knife is inspired by stories like The Count of Monte Cristo, where a simple death is too good for all those years the villains took from their victim. This isn't a John Wick-style action flick, no\u2014this is curt whispers over fine wine, jewelled masks of jade and bone, half-buried scandals and half-heard truths, and yes - sometimes - a quiet blade in the dark. You'll establish a promising young soul whose life is ruined by a handful of grasping scoundrels, then you'll tell the decades-long story of the victim's overdue and inevitable vengeance. You'll tell this story from the perspective of the villains, with the protagonist - The Knife - moving in the shadows or behind disguises. You'll answer card prompts about your villain's life as you add notes and connections to a pinboard of sin and scandal. These prompts are split into four acts to help guide your story to a satisfying conclusion. As you progress through these acts you'll also tell the story of The Knife as they rise from depraved captivity to high society and begin to enact their revenge. By the end of the game you'll have constructed the conspiracy that destroys your wretched character as they find themselves broken and utterly ruined, face-to-face with The Knife for one last reckoning. Then, as the sun rises on a land free of those avaricious scoundrels, you'll consider what solace - if any - The Knife might find for the rest of their days. The Slow Knife is a roleplaying game - in that you're playing the role of one of the villains - but it doesn't demand much from you in terms of improvised oration or dramatic narration. Even if you've never played an RPG before, this game is designed to make your first experience with the hobby a great (and comfortable) one. All you need is a love of good stories and a willingness to ask curious questions. If you're a seasoned RPG player, maybe with a long-running D&D campaign, this would be a great game to play if someone can't turn up one week or you're looking for a break between campaigns\u2014simple, self-contained and zero prep. And of course if you're already on board with playing a bunch of unique, often-strange story games, well then you know what's good already! At the core of the game is a 52-card deck of prompts that asks probing, establishing questions about your villainous characters and their dishonourable lives. You'll take turns answering from this deck, building out the story of your character as you pass through the years. After resolving each card, you'll consider the board in front of you and add cards and connections to reflect what you've added to the story. The board is the other major component of the game. As you progress through the game your host of characters and events will swell\u2014the board is how you record that information so you can maintain and complete story beats. It's also a really fun artefact of play, something you can imagine hanging on the wall of your single-minded protagonist. By the time you reach the fourth and final act, you'll have a knotty web of cheap lies, bad blood and dirty money that The Knife can twist and expose to exact their revenge. When your story is complete, you could even use the rich world you've built as a setting for a story in another game, taking place as the dust settles from your explosive finale. The Slow Knife is inspired by games like For the Queen that are rules-lite enough to start playing immediately. Since you always proceed through setup in the same order, I'm providing a simple booklet to teach you the game step-by-step as you play. This, along with a guided setup process that takes you through the creation of your world and characters, means that you don't have to do any kind of prep going into a game\u2014just open the box and get going. Here's what you'll find (subject to change!): The cards will be printed in a gloriously large tarot-sized format (2.75\" x 4.75\") on 330gsm black-core cardstock. Heavy stuff! The use of 'cores' is a standard card production technique where a thicker sheet of paper is sandwiched between the printed sheets, which makes them easier to shuffle, opaque and (most importantly) more durable for repeated plays. Black-core is a couple of steps up from the standard stock \u2014 designed for 'premium casino quality' (!). ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT tl;dr \u2014 this game is printed in an environmentally-neutral way, which is expensive. Even for a larger, tarot-sized deck with a nice box, I get that \u00a330 is more than you might be expecting for a deck of cards. So, I wanted to talk you through how I got here.\u00a0 I started my search for a card printer here in the UK, but the pricing wasn't even remotely viable. I would've needed to charge at least \u00a340 for the deck, if not more, for something very standard in terms of quality. So then I looked abroad, and of course by choosing to print overseas (in China, primarily) I could bring the price of the game right down to maybe \u00a320, or even less from some factories. Good stuff right? But, as well as the practical concern of massively fluctuating shipping prices, I started to feel increasingly uncomfortable about the 'true cost' of printing my game. I couldn't find any options for printing with recycled materials, or without toxic printing chemicals, or renewable energy. I also couldn't be sure, in part because of my inexperience dealing with overseas labour, how to properly assure working conditions for the people making my games. So, instead, I've chosen to go with Ludocards in Italy as my printer of choice for this project. Their factory runs on 100% solar energy, they use 100% recyclable CE certified papers, and food-grade (non-toxic) inks for printing. They also seem like lovely folks, from the interactions I've had with them\u2014a family-run business with solid values. Of course, this stuff also makes them more expensive, so here we are. I hope that works for you. So that's the cards. But Jack! you cry, You can't just mail me sixty loose cards, you maniac! Oh yeah, there's also a box! A nice two-piece container to keep all your cards safe. Again, also produced with recycled paper, renewable energy and non-toxic inks.\u00a0 Oh, and there's that lovely artwork again\u2014let's talk about that. This time around we've got the inimitable Rafael Nobre on board for the illustrations. I came across his work when looking at Count of Monte Cristo covers, and as soon as I saw his take I knew he'd be perfect for this project (check it out, it's great!). His bold use of colour and form is really striking, and I'm really glad he said yes when I reached out. So, the box has everything you need to play a game of The Slow Knife. But sometimes you don't want to spend an hour of your evening (or more, if your group is anything like mine!) building a world & characters from scratch. So, I'm also writing three playsets that will provide an original, pre-written setting and define all the major characters of your story\u2014the Knife, your villains and the setting itself. These playsets are designed to be a quicker experience than the 'from scratch' approach in the box, and they will fill your story with beats and possibilities that make starting play effortless. Let's talk about them! THE COUNT OF SAINT-LAZARE The first of these is, of course, set in Revolutionary France, 18XX. It's called The Count of Saint-Lazare, the inspiration for which should hopefully be pretty clear at this point! Fans of Alexandre Dumas or Victor Hugo, this one's for you. In the playset you'll get an introduction to the setting, a few quick choices to make as a table about the time period and The Knife, and then you'll choose from four pre-written characters. You'll make a few more quick choices to personalise them, and then get started with your story.\u00a0 The playset will also have useful things like lists of names and locations to help you answer cards as you play. And don't worry if you don't have much historical knowledge of the period\u2014you can engage with it as much or as little as you like, and even choose to introduce magic and other weirdness into your setting if that sounds fun. But sure, I get it, The Count of Monte Cristo is a big book and a bad film, and period drama might just not be your thing. Don't sweat it. You see, the world of fiction (and the world) is not short of awful rich people. Pretty much every setting you can imagine has enough money-grubbing leeches to tell a thousand stories in The Slow Knife. So here's what I've got planned for the other two playsets: ARCADIA PRIME Arcadia Prime is a luxury space station orbiting the terminally-polluted Earth. On it, you'll find a coterie of the ultra-rich and forever young living beautiful, easy lives amongst astonishing technology. Of course, to make the kind of money you need for a ticket to Arcadia, you might need to leave a few loose ends behind you on Earth... If you like hard sci-fi and stories about atrocious mega-corporations, this is the setting for you. This playset will feature illustrations from Torben B\u00f6kemeyer, long-time favourite here at Mousehole Press for his stellar (\ud83d\ude09) work on Orbital and Bucket of Bolts. COURT OF ARANDIL The Court of Arandil is the premier dominion of the high elf elite. Every notable elf aspires to make their way to the moon-touched glades of Arandil, but what they find is far from the lofty place of democracy and learning they are taught about as children. No, this is a cutthroat world of deals, scandal and plots where courtiers vie for the favour of their capricious Queen by any means necessary. Elves can live forever, sure, but they're as vulnerable to a sharp blade in the back as the rest of us... If you like Elrond, but also think he might be kind of a dick, this is the setting for you.\u00a0 This playset will feature illustrations from Hortense Mariano, who I'm really excited to work with. Their expressive character art is going to be great! Both of these playsets will have the same structure (setting, characters, play aids, etc) as the Count of Saint-Lazare setting. Playset Printing Each playset will be printed as an A6 wiro-bound booklet\u2014a format inspired by Tyler's awesome Possible Worlds project. I think it's a really practical format for play, as the booklet lays nice and flat and it's easy to flick through to find what you need. The books will be printed on recycled paper, and each will be themed around a single colour\u2014though you'll find full-colour work from the illustrators throughout! If you like the sound of these, backing the 'Playset Edition' will get you all three playsets for the price of two! Timelines The game is written, and I've been running weekly playtests with willing folks (if you'd like to get involved, drop me a message!). In the meantime, I'll be liaising with my partner for card printing to get things ready for the final files, so we can hopefully have a fairly straightforward ride towards delivery. Accessibility As with previous projects, the digital files will be made available in accessible formats. This will almost certainly involve screen reader-compatible PDFs and plain text versions, but we'll also be investigating options for presenting the prompt cards (which is new for this project). Community Copies Every backer of The Slow Knife, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks! BackerKit As with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. It's what I'm used to and it's really handy for managing all aspects of delivery. I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons. Tracked Shipping To keep costs down, I'm calculating shipping using untracked prices. This means I'll only have proof of postage for your order, not tracking or proof of delivery. If your order goes missing and it's not your fault, I'll send another copy out free of charge. If it's due to an incorrectly entered address or some other similar error, I'll ask that you pay cost price + shipping to send out another copy. If you'd like to add tracking, you can purchase it as an add-on. Hi, I\u2019m Jack, a tabletop game designer from Southampton, England. I make\u00a0small, story-driven games, games that you can play in an evening with some friends (or even on your own!). Over the past couple of years I've taken some of those games to Kickstarter. I launched the Artefact zine for Zinequest 2020, and it did gangbusters, much to my surprise! This gave me the confidence to fund the Orbital zine in August 2020\u2014cementing my love for riso printing and fancy paper. Most recently, I funded Bucket of Bolts for Zinequest 2021, where it once again topped the charts! With Zinequest moving to August this year, I thought I'd take the opportunity to fund a card-based game instead, so here we are. And hey, people seem to actually like playing my fancy zines too! As well as loads of lovely comments from players on itch.io, I've had the absolute joy of seeing my work featured by my faves Shut Up & Sit Down and Dicebreaker. But y'know, just generally I really like making nice things?!? That's the main motivation here. And it's only possible thanks to you and your support\u2014so, thanks! Oh! And it's not just me running Mousehole Press. It's a family gig these days. Rachel, my wife, is my co-pilot for all print and design decisions, and she also does a lot of the branding work. She did all the cool titles on this page too!\u00a0 Oh, and if you want my 3 or 1-year old to personalise your copy of the game, just let me know \ud83d\ude09",
  "We are for peace! We\nwant to organize an event with the help of many people from around the world,\nto declare our position of supporting peaceful processes and peace on Earth.\nThe sign will be visible from space on Google Maps satellite photos and this will be a work created by the Internet and\nthe global community.\n We are building a PEACE sign and are inviting all those who want peace on Earth and want to say something about it.  The sign will be built of natural environmentally friendly materials. The structure will be stable and clearly visible on a Google Maps photo and will not be affected by the elements.  \nThe sign will be at least 305 feet (93 meters) long. If the amount collected exceeds expectations, then we will increase the size of the sign. The more you contribute, the larger the sign will be!  The land for building the PEACE sign and accompanying objects will be purchased or leased for the duration of the project in accordance with local laws. The land plot will be the least expensive, in a sparely populated area and that is unsuitable for any commercial purposes.  We plan to construct the sign within a few months of fundraising. The specific place with GPS coordinates will be published for all those who want to see it after the Google Maps photo appears. Right now we have a few potential places that are suitable for our project. We will select the place for building the sign based, among other things, on the frequency of previous photos of the specific area by the Google Maps satellites.  We are also taking on the work to maintain the structure, needed repair and restoration at least until the Google Maps photo appears with the visible sign. The most generous backers will be able to write their names next to the PEACE sign that will also be visible on satellite photos.  We will be certain to stick with environmental protection regulations when building the PEACE sign. Not a single large plant or animal will suffer while it is being created.  The projected budget for the project consists of the following elements:  1. Search for the necessary plot of land and documenting its purchase or lease  2.\tPurchase and delivery of building materials  3.\tPayment for work to build the structure  4.\tWriting the names of backers on plaques and installing the plaques on the letters of the construction  5.\tPurchase and installation of the necessary video and photo equipment for observing the object with Internet connection  6.\tCreation of a project Web site 7.\tCosts to maintain the structure\n",
  "The Circus Arts Communities of Nebraska hope to establish a nonprofit community circus center that is open to the public.\u00a0 Help Flightmotion Studios Become Omaha Nebraska's First And Only Circus Arts Training Center and\u00a0Bring the Circus Arts to Omaha!\u00a0 \"Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.\" - Neale Donald Walsch Omaha, Nebraska has witnessed an exponential growth in the circus arts community. Additionally, there is a resounding amount of widespread community support. However, none of the various circus arts collectives have ever been able to have a space they all can call home.\u00a0 Currently, we rent space around town, train in parks, or even our own backyards. When renting, we are treated less than ideal due to scheduling coordinator's tendencies to prefer traditional sports over circus arts. This leaves us with extremely odd hours and no prime time scheduling. Further, our equipment is routinely mishandled,\u00a0 and we are rarely able to share knowledge and collaborate. This would all change overnight if we had\u00a0access to a communal practice space for everyone to share. We at FlightMotions want to be that change. Currently, if someone seeks safe and professional level instruction; they are left to commute to neighboring cities such as Chicago, Kanas City, or Denver. As a result potential students are left with high membership fees as well as unreasonable commute times.\u00a0 Over the last few years we have talked about how to improve the circus arts community Omaha, NE as well as make the circus arts more readily available for public access. As a result we have located the perfect training space in a large warehouse with high ceilings that are perfect inversions, dangling, flying, and dancing.\u00a0 Our Goals We have such high hopes for FlightMotions and how it can benefit the community.\u00a0 In brief we would like to: FlightMotion Studios is still very much a work in progress, albeit we have been working on it all around the clock. Several friends and volunteers that are passionate about our mission have shown up to help us clean away all the dirt and grime. They are also helping build a training environment with the utmost emphasis on safety and community. Where You Come In! Currently we have no paid work and this is all being conducted by ourselves and volunteers.\u00a0 Unfortunately, we cannot manage all of the startup expenses all on our own. For FlightMotion Studios to transform from dream to reality we really need your help.\u00a0 By supporting our campaign you will have direct impact on the following: \u00a0Where Your Money Will Go As professional circus artists we have a tremendous appreciation for money, this is because we rarely get to see too much of it! Our work is really a full time job, especially considering the amount of training, conditioning, choreography, and planning that goes into every single project. We commit to our work because we are passionate about it; not because any sort of monetary incentive. Therefore, we know how to budget responsibly and spend wisely. Here\u2019s what your donations will help fund: Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! Your Donations Are Appreciated! Without your help, FlightMotions studios will remain a dream, with your help we can make it a reality. Words cannot describe what your support means to us.\u00a0 Your contributions whether they are one dollar or one thousand dollars will directly finance our ability to get this facility fully operational as soon as possible. We have some pretty awesome rewards that show our appreciation for those that pledge; but we appreciate every contribution no matter how small or large. Please check out all of our rewards at the column on the right\u2014we can\u2019t wait to share them with you to show how much we appreciate you being part of our team. As it stands right now, FlightMotion Studios is a very high hope but anyone that knows someone in the circus arts knows that we will always reach for the sky! Thanks to you we are getting closer to our dream everyday. We are dealing with startup expenses that will initially be around $5,000 and we have a stretch goal of $10,000. Even if we exceed our funding goals please keep donating, your contributions will always be on a one way street from you to the improvement of FlightMotion Studios. Please share this page with friends, family members, and other arts supporters, and know that we are so grateful to you for helping us create our dream space!",
  "If successfully funded, Parative will transfer production of its merchandise to create sustainable job opportunities for women who have been empowered out of the trade in partnership with organizations like The Aruna Project and Freeset. Help us make this happen and share the message that these women are loved. T-shirts have been telling stories for decades. Whether it's your favorite band, sports team, logo, or graduating class, what we wear makes a statement. I (Drew, the founder of The Parative Project) have always had an affinity for t-shirts. My love started with a t-shirt I printed in high school that said, \"My Love for You Goes on For Ages.\" The intention was to wear it around my crush to show her how I felt. Sadly, she didn't show up for school that day... However, I realized something that inspired me and hopefully will inspire you. I learned that t-shirts can communicate. Years later I started The Parative Project, we make tees to spark conversations about what can be done to eradicate human trafficking and give hope to those who are fighting for the cause and to those who have been victimized by it. It was later that I discovered two specific organizations that have worked alongside women who have been trafficked, exploited, and forced into labor: Freeset and The Aruna Project. After a conversation with the founder of The Aruna Project, I was inspired to move production of Parative's shirts to India. Here, the tees wouldn't just tell a story; they would be made by the hands of those whose story is being told. These women are hardworking, talented, and we believe in them. We can communicate this to them them not only by hiring them, but in another way too. We want to tell these women of their deep value in the best way we know how: a t-shirt. For the Kickstarter, we made t-shirt designs that speak backwards. The messages on these specific shirts are not for the consumer, nor the people who will see you wearing them (although of course we think you will love them too). Instead, we designed these shirts to speak to their maker. The woman who is working to end the cycle of poverty for the generations after her. The woman who is diligently fighting the ghosts of her past. The woman who might need some encouragement to know she is remembered. We know that a t-shirt isn't going to erase everything that has happened to her, but like a greeting card can turn around someone's day, these tees will serve as comfort and support to her. As she works, she will read the messages, \"You are loved\" and \"Our freedom is tied together.\" So when the product she made is purchased, she will know that we believe in her freedom and want to help grow her business.  This Kickstarter is allowing us to begin a partnership with Freeset and The Aruna Project. Both of these organizations give rescued women an opportunity for freedom through employment. The women are given the chance to heal from their past, grow in the skills they need to live their new life, and have the freedom to dream. With the shirts designed and the relationships started, all we need now is to fill the orders! If successfully funded, Parative will transfer production of its merchandise to create sustainable job opportunities for women who have been empowered out of the trade in partnership with organizations like The Aruna Project and Freeset. Help us make this happen and share the message that these women are loved.",
  "Lazlo is a response to a system that says making cheap goods and fueling consumption is the pathway to success. We know this narrative comes at a cost to our communities and our planet, so we\u2019re making menswear that tells a different story. It starts with a tee unlike any you\u2019ve ever worn. Because the t-shirt has been done so many times, the easiest way to make our garment stand out would be to do something bold, but what we really wanted to do was to pay attention to the subtle details. We\u2019re always looking to simplify, so each adjustment has to add value and be done very consciously. The slightly curved hem and the side vent encourage the drape of our slightly longer, slimmer fit. The relaxed neckline allows us to use the same fabric for the body and the collar. We spent a year developing a custom fabric using extra-long staple Supima\u00ae cotton, grown in the American Southwest. Supima cotton represents the top 3% of the US cotton crop, and only 1% of Supima is organic. We were told we were on a wild goose chase to find organic Supima as a new company, but were able to develop a partnership with a yarn spinner in Switzerland and a mill in LA. To stay true to the workwear roots of the white tee, we created a 6.5oz jersey using 100% organic Supima cotton.  We compacted the yarn and prewashed the fabric to prevent shrinkage; it\u2019s built to be worn, with a soft hand that will only get better with each wear.\n\n If we reach our fundraising goal, our next run of fabric will be made entirely in the US.  Nearly all of the organic Supima cotton is sent overseas for processing and manufacturing, but with a larger order, we will be able to have the yarn spun at a top facility in Georgia. We are committed to toxin-free production from farm to finished product. In addition to using organic cotton, we will be hand-dyeing garments in natural indigo. Each shirt will be made in white, and some will then be dipped 10+ times by hand in an indigo bath. It\u2019s a traditional practice that goes back thousands of years and leads to a rich finish. Each shirt will be unique and will age beautifully. We are setting up production in Detroit, the heart of American manufacturing. We are currently in the process of building out our space at Ponyride. It\u2019s a 30,000-square-foot foreclosed building in the historic Corktown neighborhood that has been transformed into a collaborative space and creative incubator for socially conscious businesses.\n\nDetroit boasts a do-it-yourself attitude and a creative community unlike any we\u2019ve been a part of. There is no other place we would rather be. Setting up our own production facilities will allow us to deliver you a product that meets the highest standards for quality. It also creates a personal connection to every order that goes out the door. There\u2019s a reason we\u2019re calling our first offering the Heirloom Tee; we feel so strongly about our materials and construction that if it doesn\u2019t meet your expectations for durability, we will repair, refund or replace it free of charge.\u00a0 We believe everyone deserves access to living wage jobs and will have a company minimum wage of $15 per hour. \n\n Lazlo founder Christian Birky has an academic background in prison policy, and has spent time tutoring in prisons. When he learned that the Michigan Department of Corrections has sewing programs within state prisons, he saw an opportunity to hire trained sewers who would otherwise face tremendous barriers to finding employment. Lazlo will be hiring formerly incarcerated men as part of our team in Detroit. If disposable fast fashion made by exploiting workers and the environment is at one end of the spectrum, it is our goal to push as far as we can in the opposite direction. We are focused on creating the best possible product and developing a business model where every decision is considered for its potential impact on the people and environment around us. We designed the Heirloom Tee with a slim, tailored fit. If you are between sizes or like a looser fit, we suggest you size up.  Note: While we've designed the fabric to minimize any shrinkage, shirts will shrink up to 3% during the indigo dyeing process. Our indigo shirts will fit just slightly smaller, but unless you are exactly between sizes, this will not be enough to affect what size you order.  Proper care will allow you to get the most from your Lazlo garments and significantly reduce your impact on the environment. Wash garments in a cold, gentle cycle with a small amount of natural detergent. Lay flat or hang to dry. If you prefer to use a dryer, use a low heat setting. Using fabric softeners and high heat will break down the cotton fibers more quickly. For repairs and re-dyeing, you are responsible for shipping costs to us. We will cover the cost of returning back to you. International customers will be responsible for shipping costs both ways. \n\nRepairs due to product quality (fabric or construction) will be on us. For repairs due to normal wear and tear (ie. you catch your shirt while hopping a fence or rip it on a nail), we will charge a small fee to cover our costs.* To extend the lifespan of your Heirloom Tee, if your white tee gets stained over time, you can send it back to us and we\u2019ll hand-dye it in indigo for the cost of labor. Instead of becoming a disposable item, it becomes a fresh blue tee. Shirts may shrink up to 3% in the dyeing process.* *We will begin offering these services early 2016 once our Detroit facility is fully functional. Disclaimer: All product images are of samples. We reserve the right to make small changes (improvements) as we go through production.",

  "My name is Kristina Wong and you may know my work as a performance artist and comedian.\u00a0 Ok, most likely you DON'T know my work,\u00a0 but whatever, I'm still asking you for money anyway. For the last two years I have been publicly vying for the attention of NBA Superstar Jeremy Lin so that I can get married and have babies already.\u00a0 It's been something of a durational performance project where my anxieties as a childless woman approaching the last of her childbearing years play out as a public spectacle that subverts gendered approaches of courtship and the otherwise emasculated media images of Asian men.\u00a0  All these efforts proved unsuccessful until a few days ago when I got word that Jeremy Lin was being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers!\u00a0 Literally, Jeremy Lin would be playing down the road, a few miles from my home in Koreatown!\u00a0  MY VISUALIZATIONS WERE WORKING!!! I messaged Jeremy offering him a shared room for rent at my house and still no response.\u00a0 So now, I have no choice but to make the GRANDEST GESTURE OF LOVE.\u00a0  With your Kickstarter support, I will be able to purchase 2 Court Side tickets at $2700 a piece for one Lakers game this season.\u00a0 I will be escorted by a Maid of Honor (person of any gender, TBD) who will keep an eye on my dress and on security.\u00a0 I will follow and adhere to all rules of conduct in the Staples Center as I will Jeremy to notice me.\u00a0  I will keep detailed documentation in my blog and Instagram\u00a0 for my audience to follow. BTW, why the hell are basketball tickets are so expensive?!?\u00a0 For that kind of money, you can commission a theater company to make a brand new show, keep a youth serving non-profit org going for a month, and offer a lot of microloans to women in Northern Uganda.\u00a0 But I am not here to lambast how rich people choose to blow money, I am here to sit among the rich... for a day... in pursuit of love. 1.\u00a0 Buy Court Side tickets for myself and my Maid of Honor. 2. \u00a0 Borrow a wedding dress to wear (since I won't have money left at this point). 3. Go to the game in a wedding dress. 4.\u00a0 Jeremy Lin will fall in love with me when he sees me. 5. We get married in a public ceremony for all my donors. He moves into my place in Koreatown while we save up for a bigger house. 6.\u00a0 We have babies and live happily ever after. TO BE CLEAR:  This project is a self-satirizing critique of fandom, class and access, racial stereotypes, gender and the institution of marriage.  Jeremy Lin is a public figure who many people are obsessed with and project the meaning of their own lives onto.  There will be other fans in the stadium who will yell his name, wear an outrageous costume, or scream \u201cI want to have your baby!\u201d-- this is all within the bounds of being a basketball fan. Everything that I am proposing in this performance art project also falls within the bounds of being a basketball fan. I will not forcibly make contact or threaten Jeremy Lin, nor break any laws or rules of conduct in the Staples Center. I will do as I have done in previous iterations of this project... WILL him to notice me with tongue-in-cheek humor.\u00a0",
  "The Above Ground Project is an open-source artist collective that reinforces and promotes art education and literacy in our community. We believe the arts has a transformative quality and can be used as an avenue to educate and empower.\u00a0 What are we raising funds to do?: We plan to produce a 60 minute documentary that covers the transformative nature of art in the lives of 5 New Jersey students. We will take a look at how they both find and use art as a tool in an era of dwindling arts education programs. How are these students finding art on their own? How does it help them in the long run \u2014 even in non art related fields? We plan to explore why the arts programs are disappearing in our state and take an honest look and examine the values and virtues of art education. We follow 5 New Jersey students that excel in the arts across various disciplines and explore the importance art has in their lives in molding who they ultimately become. We examine how theories and concepts taken from hip hop, dance, music, and visual art (through interviews with working artists in those fields) can be applied to non related fields and why art education often times can be a catalyst for life long learning. The Above Ground documentary: How Art Changes Lives How do we plan to pull it off?: The proof is in the pudding. Watch: We follow tap dancer and Newark, NJ native, Maurice Chestnut \u2013 our guide on\u00a0a series of interviews and performances with working musicians, artists and students over the course of a month. We hope to use this as a tool to hopefully shed more light on the issue.",

  "One of Steven's most popular designs, we are excited to be able to reproduce Steven's Djinn series pact stone d10s. \u00a0Brimming with potential these dice are custom made to help your eldritch blasters shine. \u00a0Steven's dice, especially the most complicated, have always been hand made with care. \u00a0Even now, these will be hand made and polished at the Udixi factory to bring the highest quality to your tables! Because it takes a large amount of effort and manual time to create sharp edge resin dice, even in bulk quantities these dice cost us over $6 each and that is as the designer and with no profit at all and with orders in the thousands. \u00a0We had a couple of attempts to get the cost down, but none of them lived up to our expectations of quality for a Steven's Original. \u00a0Steven sold his pact stones for around $30 each when factoring in his own creation time, effort, and materials. \u00a0We want to get you the best discount possible, and are excited to get these unique dice into your hands! You can see more videos in the project video above. We polled our supporters and have decided to run this similar to our last kickstarter (Healer's Dice Rainbow Edition) in order to unlock as many dice as possible together. \u00a0Once the campaign funds only the first design will be unlocked. \u00a0We have set the stretch goal tiers so that as soon as we get enough to fund the next design it will be unlocked for the first 4 (Earth, Fire, Water, and Air). \u00a0We will then alternate between addon goals and a few additional non elemental dice designs as we reach higher numbers. \u00a0It was a hard process, but we were were able to unlock all 8 Healer's dice color options between the campaign and backerkit and we need even less overall to get the 4 main elements released in this campaign! Reaching this goal will unlock the following: According to our surveys, the most popular element was the granite looking earth and we will fund it as soon as we receive sufficient money. \u00a0At this tier you can select earth pact stones anywhere your reward says select one unlocked design. \u00a0These marbled gray, black, and blue resin d10s look and feel amazing. \u00a0 We will also unlock a silver color Arcanist's Armory Warlock coin. \u00a0We are still getting it designed, but here is a placeholder picture of the Healer coin from last campaign. \u00a0The back will be the same logo and the front will be a simplified version of Steven's Warlock logo. \u00a0One will be added to every order with other items requiring shipping for free but will be sold separately after campaign fulfillment. \u00a0You may order additional as an addon. Once we reach this tier you will be able to select Fire d10s as well as any prior unlocked items. \u00a0With a red and orange hue reminiscent to the fireball dice without the yellow undertones, these really glow (shine not glow in the dark) when they hit the light. \u00a0The subtle glitter flecks make them even better! \u00a0This cool blue die looks like clear blue ice on a deep river. \u00a0It is a great representation of the cool power of the water element. Once we reach this tier we will have unlocked all 4 elementals in the djinn series! \u00a0To celebrate we will unlock a gold colored 1\" coin to add with the silvers to each backer order. (THIS COIN WAS UNLOCKED EARLY ABOVE SEE the 3/18 update). \u00a0Air will be unlocked and available to select. \u00a0All 4 sets can choose one of each as well! \u00a0Although these may not be the fan favorites, I think, personally they are my favorites. \u00a0The white haze feels like clouds and the silver inking gives them a silver lining. \u00a0\u00a0 If we unlock this tier, we will be partnering with Session Zero Games (Who made our coins for the last Kickstarter and will for this as well) who makes, among other things, decks of class based magical items. \u00a0Once this tier is unlocked you will have the option of adding a physical warlock deck of 52 custom magical item cards that are themed for Warlocks for $14 ($1 off retail) or a printable pdf for $5. \u00a0Here are 3 of the art pieces for the cards so that you have an idea of what we will unlock and what you will get: Each of the 52 items cards will \u00a0have great art and a custom item with instructions on use and effects. \u00a0These are a fun supplement as a DM for 5e to have class cards in hand to give out as rewards and to help party members remember what they do. You can order PDFs of Session Zero Games's other previously released products on our website. \u00a0They have not yet finished their Warlock deck text, so you would have the opportunity to be one of the first people to get their hands on these as they will expedite finishing these in their priority list to fill this kickstarter once we fund this far.\u00a0 So, your warlocks have transcended the elements have they, this dark gray pact stone can reflect that too once unlocked: One additional die in your choice of unlocked color $15 A metal ring added to the divit in the middle $5/die (Since this adds quite a few more manual steps on our side we decided to leave this as an addon and let people that do not care about the ring choose to get their dice cheaper without it. \u00a0It is only decorative, but they definitely do make the dice pop :) Small decorative metal tin with padding and felt matched to the element of your choice $5. \u00a0Keep your lucky pact stone safe and decorated with a metal element themed tin of its own with padding and felt to keep it safe and gorgeous for when you get to your games. \u00a0Holds 1 die. Large 4 piece decorative tin with padding, felt and matched element or elements of choice in decorative felt on the lid. \u00a0$8 \u00a0Holds 4 dice. Extra warlock coins in metal color of your choice from those unlocked. If enough people ask, we can add fireball and healer's dice sets as addons here too. \u00a0Feel free to ask if you are interested in either as an addon. As we are uncertain on shipping deadlines and as fees change all the time we will be charging shipping after the campaign in backerkit to all tiers other than the retailer which will have free shipping as stated. \u00a0Rates may change and need adjustment, however, the following is an estimate: US $6.75 as of right now we do not have any large or glass addons, but if those are added it will add about $2.\u00a0 Other Countries $16.75 as of right now we do not have any large or glass addons, but if those are added it will add about $4. \u00a0 If rates increase more than $1 we will issue a separate update addressing it. We will send everything from the US except our backers in Europe and the UK which will be fulfilled by Wordforge Games. \u00a0We still need to have those packages mailed an additional time so we need to charge the same international postage, but the actual postage on the package sent to you for VAT purposes will be kept lower by the regional fulfillment.",

  "Greeting: Hello Kickstarter visitor! My name is Matthew Demore and I am the owner of a new startup clothing company called No End Apparel. I want No End to specialize in creating designs that utilize material and embroidery instead of the usual screen printing. We strive to bring quality to our designs as well as a unique appearance so that when you receive our apparel you are instantly blown away. I want to first off say thank you so much for just clicking on this project, it shows me that there is a level of interest that will help drive this to the finish I can't express to you how exciting it is to be able to create a design that people seem to really enjoy.\u00a0 A Litte About Me: I am a father of 2 and a graphic designer by trade. I find that I am not very artistic in an illustrative sense but do have a great knack for creativity. I love my children and consider them to be my two little muses. They drive me to create and enjoy life. Again I want to personally just say thank you for even looking at this project, I can't express how exciting this whole process is. Invested! $1,500 of new equipment! You got to start somewhere! I just recently bought the equipment needed to begin work on The Octohoody and what I hope to be many more future designs! Check them out! The Brother PE770 and Brother ScanNcut!\u00a0 The Octohoody: This is not a graphic or screen print, the octopus legs will be a seperate material stitched onto the hoody itself. This is makes the actual finished look really great. I think it allows for a unique look and feel. Variations: If this project goes beyond its goal then I will make colored variations for backers to choose from! This will take a little extra coordination but it is a labor of love I will undertake to make sure you receive the color and size of your asking. For every $1,500 in backing I can produce a new color combination for you to choose from! Kraken Size:\n\n\u00a0 Kraken size has been made unavailable due to the fact that these hoodies do degrade when exposed to dramatically long periods under water. If you plan on being underwater for at least 1 year with this hoodie \u00a0please do not back this project. :) Designs from No End Apparel:",
  "History (Understanding) \"One-Drop Rule\"\n\n \u00a0 The One Drop Rule, was coined in early 19th Century America as a term for racial classification. Used to institutionally segregate Blacks, the One Drop Rule dictated that any presence of African American blood in ones lineage made you in both the eyes of Society and the Law Black. \u00a0 \u00a0 However in our time this One Drop does not separate us. We through science understand that all Humanity can be traced to Africa. No, not everyone is African or Black explicitly. But throughout every corner of the Planet we are all connected. Background (where did it start?) The idea of starting a clothing brand first came into fruition by Messejah and Gary longtime friends located in Chicago, IL. They both understand the importance of art and its influence on culture. As well as the importance of expressing a positive message, one that everyone can gravitate towards. Our aim is to express this universal message through clothing.\u00a0 Proceeds (Where do they go?) All proceeds will work towards manufacturing the official clothing (t-shirts, long-sleeves, and hoodies) from \u00a0\"Victory\" a screen-printing company located in Chicago. As well as setting up a website to sell the clothing, cover the cost of shipping, and promotional tools to gain attention and spread the message of peace and unity. Our motto is to \"pay it forward\". To pay fourth the message of the clothing brand and the brand its self.

  "Cosplay is short for costume play: It's an art which people wear costumes, and accessiores to represent a specific character or idea. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture centered on role play. \u2606*:.\uff61. o(\u2267\u25bd\u2266)o .\uff61.:*\u2606 I've been cosplaying for over 10 years. I loved dressing up and pretending to be that special character. It helps me escape reality into another world that I don't want to leave. I got into modeling with my aunt when I was 1 years old, and I've been doing it ever since. But as I got older I realized that something wasn't right. I was having fun being in make-up and dressing in beautiful clothes, but I wanted more. When I got to middle school I heard of Youmacon; an anime convention held every year in Detroit Michigan. The overwhelming feeling of being in Otaku Paradise with other people that love same thing as you was the best feeling in the world. And seeing them dress up and getting into character was amazing. Since I was so busy with school I never even got a chance to until after I graduated High School. Even if I did't get to go throughout those 6 years never stopped me from dressing up. I also wanted to be a different type of super model. I wanted to do cosplay modeling, and when I realized that such an occupation exsisted, that's what I wanted to be. I made it offical! So in 2012, I got a good paying job, and found an amazing photographer and made a fanpage. And so far I've been to Youmacon, and Colossalcon. I'm striving to reach out to all the conventions in the tri-state area for now and work my way out. Not only Cosplaying is my hobby it is also a lifestyle. I extremely love to do it. I'm usually working on a really tight budget, and only about to work on Cosplays once a month. Maybe a month in a half depending on the Cosplay I'm working on. I'm so thankful that people are interested in my work and that they support me. If you would love to be apart of this, I would love to have your support. \u2661 My ultimate dream/career is to be a super model in Japan, and ultimate well know cosplay model. I dream to be in top cosplay sites and magazines. And my goal is travel to Cons all over the world to show everyone what Asia Lockhart can do.  I know I can reach my goal. You can be whatever you want to be if you work hard enough at it. And I know I cant do it without all of you! So I thank each an every one of you. You make me strive and inspire me to do my best. And I assure you I won't let you down.  Experience my adventures with me every step of the way~ \n",
  "*****Please view my video\u00a0on YouTube here:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChkjOUkIGO8 Hi, I\u2019m Olivia, some may call me Caspiana. I\u2019m a mermaid. Many of you may not even know what I\u2019m talking about, you may think, \u201cJeez, what a freak!\u201d But no, I\u2019m just a young lady who wants to make a difference while doing something I love. That thing is swimming. Swimming is one of my favorite passions, that and singing, dancing, soccer, reading, art, and writing. I plan on not only using this tail as a relief and fun, but I want to go to children\u2019s birthday parties and give them something they will never forget. I will spread ocean and Earth conservation, fun facts, and safety. And don\u2019t forget about the fun they will have. Adults can have this memory too! I also want to work at a local aquarium or zoo, business events, conservation projects (etc.), fairs, and more! I also know CPR. Now let\u2019s get to the actual project! I\u2019m creating a realistic, fully sequined, fully swimmable, neoprene mermaid tail.\u00a0You can see my materials in the video. I will be needing neoprene, sequins (which are shell/scale shaped\u00a0about the size of a fingernail [from Cartwright's])(see example in main picture), a monofin, a clear Lexan sheet,\u00a0E6000 glue, Seal Cement (for the neoprene), an elastic band for the waist, and iridescent vinyl. If I can I also want to get socks for wearing the monofin, webbed gloves (for certain effects), and a waterproof camera case to, of course, show everyone the live mermaid! Now, this is another extra, a GoPro camera, they have amazing shots and I\u2019m shocked if you haven\u2019t seen what amazing contraptions they are.\n\tI have already made one tail. This one was fabric with small amounts of sequins. I hand made my monofin from 2 flippers, thick plastic folders and duct tape. It came out well, but it killed my back and fingers and I\u2019m not sure how long it will last.\u00a0This time I want to use a Rapid monofin and make a clear Lexan extension.\u00a0I finished this tail in August 2013 and took it to the beach. This was my first swim, photo shoot, and child experience with this tail and at all. It was so much fun and I had at least 10 kids surrounding me for at least 3 1/2 hours until I finally had to peel myself away. I would tell you this amazingly adorable story, but I\u2019m sure you want to get to the point. I also made a top, but sadly had to take it apart due to some problems, but am remaking another one to match this tail and even my fabric one. (You can also see\u00a0my current tail in the video; it had some fading from rough contact and natural damages)\n\tI only ask for a grand total of $400-$450. I have rewards as well, most handmade and authentic. Many are custom and your choice. I hope that I can reach my goal in the very near future so I can begin on my tail and finish before vacation. I hope you can help me reach this goal to not only create something beautiful and worthwhile, but something that will imprint a child\u2019s (or adult\u2019s) mind forever as well as the environment one human at a time. Once I make this one and get something going, a want to make a full silicone tail as well. But that\u2019s in the future, let's get this one done first, haha. \nIf you have any questions, please contact me! Thank You! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t~With bubbles, kisses, and fishes; Mermaid Caspiana (Olivia Buch) *****Please view my video on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChkjOUkIGO8",

  "The Death Church of Wokath Blessed are the dead, for they shall inherit all! Since the Nameless Scriptures\u2019 discovery, a sect of death-obsessed Tvelanders has festered into a full-blown religion, the Death Church of Wokath. Disciples prepare for a new era after the final Misery when the dead will ascend the thrones with Wokath, herald of Nechrubel, chief among the new kings. Weaving Verhu\u2019s prognostications into their beliefs led to tolerance for\u00a0 the church\u2019s continued existence, but the Inquisitorial leash is short and Josilfa\u2019s reprisals are commonplace. The Dismal Church of Nagla We forge our tradition in the spirit of our ancestors! Nagla is a religion of nature worship, shape-shifting skinwalkers, and deified animals. Stories claim Nagla was the name of a goat-headed entity from another material plane, the first skinwalker and progenitor of the current breed. While small sects and individual hermits follow the tenets of Nagla, it does not exist as an organized religion and is beneath inquisitorial notice. The Flayed Church We bow to that which crawls! Older than even the Creton Order, the Flayed Church has existed for millennia in humanity\u2019s shadows. Founded in a more traditional religious experience, the catastrophic death and destruction of their living god shifted the faith away from theological norms. The\u00a0 centuries-long evolution moved from a monotheistic faith to one in which they had literally millions of gods\u2014insects. Oddly, no explanation for the religion\u2019s name exists; it somehow relates to the faith\u2019s early days, but the reasons or meaning have long since been abandoned. What you get Backed at the Patron of Filth tier? All of the above plus the following... Fulfilment\u00a0 I'll be handling fulfillment for all but shipments to the United Kingdom, those will be handled by Rook's Press. Shipping is still ridiculous throughout the world. I have a few places with flat rates via USPS set up now (including the EU), but If you don't see an option to ship to your country when you pledge, send me a message and I'll check what the cost to ship is and we can add a tier for you. Most shipments outside of the US/CAN and the EU, unless you want to pay stupid high costs, I won't be able to provide a tracking number.\u00a0 Any and all local taxes, be they VAT or otherwise, are YOUR responsibility. I can't calculate those, cover them, or work around them. Please take this into consideration when making a pledge.\u00a0 We don't need no stinking stretch goals! Well, this is a complete project, so you won't find any stretch goals here. If I double the target, everyone involved gets paid double. Last time there was a surprise poster map, maybe this time there will be something extra in your shipment, or digitally. Only time will tell. As usual, I've poured my creative guts out for this and I'm leaving the mess on the table for you.

What about other stuff? I also offer super rad tee-shirts (and other clothing options) as well as stickers, shower curtains, beach towels, rugs, blankets, etc. with designs out of the Chapbooks.

  "Stash Wyslouch is a Bluegrass guitarist known for his \"extreme flavor of avant-garde freneticism\" (Music Connection Magazine Jan 2021, Andy Kaufmann) A departure from his past 3 albums of purely original music, \"Plays and Sings Bluegrass Vol. II\" is a collection of re-imagined Bluegrass standards. Notable cuts off \"Plays and Sings Bluegrass Vol. II\" include Jimmy Martin's \"My Walking Shoes\" and Bill Monroe's \"Will you be Loving Another Man?\" which make way for dynamic unisons, whiplash-inducing tempo changes and sludge-metal-like riffage. The band features Sean Trischka on drums, Duncan Wickel on fiddle and Max Ridley on bass. Bluegrass has framed Wyslouch's life for the past 15 years touring and recording with groups such as The Deadly Gentlemen, Bruce Molsky's Mountain Drifters, the Jacob Jolliff Band, Tony Trischka's Early Roman Kings, and his own group, The Stash band. Stash Wyslouch is a devout student and die-hard fan of the traditional Bluegrass genre. Despite this fact, \"Plays and Sings Bluegrass Vol. II\" is a far-cry from a traditional Bluegrass album. Using well-known and obscure traditionals as a jumping off point, great liberties were taken re-writing melodies, inserting riffs, and integrating improvisations throughout.\u00a0 Describing the arranging/composition process Wyslouch says: \"Any little gesture from the original song and recording can be used as a portal for further exploration. A classic melody or even fragment of a melody can be flipped upside down, sped up or slowed down and morphed into a whole new identity, all the while maintaining a core feeling akin to what I first experienced when I fell in love with the music.\" In addition to songs by The Carter Family, Ralph Stanley, Bill Monroe, EC Ball, and Flatt & Scruggs, 2 original instrumental tunes, \"Stash's Turkey in the Straw\" and \"Stash's Fiddler's Dream\" are included.\u00a0 \"For most, radical interpretations of conservative favorites will be declare the creative output of a raving Lunatic\" (Music Connection Magazine Jan 2021) Perhaps a little Lunacy in Bluegrass is just what is needed in this day and age. \"Plays and Sings Bluegrass Vol. II\" will be released April 30, 2021. In addition to digital and physical copies of \"Plays and Sings Bluegrass Vol. II\" this campaign offers shirts, tabs and notation to 12-tone fiddle tunes.\u00a0 As an ultra special offer, a limited early-release digital version of \"Plays and Sings Bluegrass Vol. I\" Featuring Mike Barnett on fiddle, Dominick Leslie on mandolin and Jeremy McDonald on bass is included in some reward tiers. This is a whole other album in a string-band context featuring more straight-ahead versions of Hank Williams, Roger Miller, Townes Van Zandt and Stanley Brothers recorded in 2016. This album will not be officially released until Late 2021.",

  "\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMEDICINAL ART : EAST TO WEST TOUR\u201d is a project where we (Neil, Clint & Patty) will be heading across the US, stopping in major cities as well as smaller communities to host natural dyeing, indigo dyeing and backstrap weaving workshops.  In addition to these educational workshops, we will be installing medicinal art along the way. The public art installations will be naturally dyed weavings and paintings colored with medical dye plants.  Upon the art being installed, the Earth will begin reclaiming the fiber and dye through processes of weathering and degradation.  In essence, the Earth will begin to consume the dyes/medicine.  This creates a healing space upon the Earth as it takes the medicine.  \nAs we travel around the US and we install more of this healing art, a medicinal \u201cweb\u201d will be created restoring the Earth.\u00a0 \u00a0Furthermore, this medicinal concept is multifaceted.  We are hoping that the communities and individuals we encounter will experience a sensation of therapy through the experience of environmental, community-based public art.  Most of these installations will involve the engagement of local communities to come together and assist in the creation and installation of the artwork.  This offers a community-based opportunity to learn age-old processes of backstrap weaving, natural dyeing and herbal medicine. We invite anyone in the area to come join in celebrating the Earth through a unique, artful and medicinal experience.  \n Neil will be leading natural dyeing, backstrap weaving and indigo dyeing workshops during our tour. \u00a0So far the scheduled workshops and installations look like this: If you would like to host us or see us in your city, please contact us here on Kickstarter to schedule an installation/workshop. Documentary: \u00a0As we travel the US installing art, leading workshops and interacting with diverse communities; we will document the entire process. \u00a0This footage will be used to create a documentary focusing on social change through the introduction and use of community-based, environmental, installation public art. \u00a0We will document our interactions with individuals across the US and their reactions to our project as well as the associations and connections that they make between our project and the array of positives and negatives of being a human living in the year 2015. \u00a0We intend to release this documentary and and share it with the world Late 2015/Early 2016. \u00a0We also have hopes and ambititons of getting it into the independent film circuit. \u00a0Notes from the road:\u00a0 In the van will be a communal journal in which the three artists will sketch, write, and draw about their experiences along the way sharing images through social media. We are launching a Kickstarter campaign because we need your help in funding our project to make this tour happen as smoothly and successfully as possible.  Any financial support that you can offer will be greatly appreciated.  Furthermore, you will be personally thanked by the entire Medicinal Art team in addition to some incredible rewards!  (please see below)  We are asking for funding for some specific aspects to the tour.  These things include plane tickets to get Neil to New York and Asheville, lodging while in NY, materials for the workshops to better the attendees experience and education, materials for our Kickstarter rewards and money for gas and vehicle maintenance/repair.  Furthermore, with your financial backing of this project you are making it possible to travel the US to install these environmental public art pieces, supporting the creation of the healing spaces and the medicinal web while sustaining and stimulating community-based art and art education.   If you back our project, your money will go to one of these aspects of the Medicinal Art Tour  Patty is a Spanish graphic & web designer currently living and enjoying Asheville, NC. She graduated from a spanish graphic design school in 2012, and worked in various design studios since then. As of right now she works remotely for the University of Kansas. In addition to Urrutia\u2019s knowledge and strengths as a graphic designer, she is also an educated and gifted photographer with a skilled and attentive eye.   Her role in the trip is to document the happenings, workshops, installations and experiences through photo and artful play while assisting Neil with the workshops and installations. \u00a0 Clint is from Kansas, but lives in Asheville, NC where he is currently a K-12 art teacher in a public charter school.\u00a0Neil is his long time skateboarding buddy. Jackson loves fixing and building things, and maintains a love hate relationship with his VW Eurovan.\u00a0As an art teacher he is passionate about experiencing and promoting art that is accessible and that draws people together.  He believes that the \"right place for great art is among people and not necessarily tucked away in a quiet gallery.  A great piece of art is like a great song, it can can be personal, shared with friends, nostalgic, happy, sad\u2026 but one can\u2019t help but react to it.\" His role in the trip is to document the happenings, workshops, installations and experiences through film and creative intuition while assisting Neil with the workshops/installations. \u00a0He also will be our roadside mechanic keeping the VW in smooth traveling condition. \u00a0He will also skate and surf some new spots along the way. \u00a0 \u00a0  Neil lives in Lawrence, KS where he currently is a practicing professional artist and teaches pottery and natural dyeing at the Lawrence Arts Center. In 2012 he received two BFA's in Design with concentrations in Textiles and Ceramics from the University of Kansas School of the Arts. Goss has focused the last 5 years of his life to researching and practicing sustainable arts processes such as natural dyeing, weaving (backstrap weaving), utilizing hand dug clay, and foraging art materials. Goss has taught workshops, completed public installations and done artist talks from coast to coast in the United States. His role in the trip is to lead the workshops and installations while producing and conceptualizing the documentary.   \u00a0This '95 VW Eurovan will help us make The Medicinal Art tour happen. This camper will not only be our means for transportation but it will also serve as our home for the summer while we are on the road. \u00a0 Furthermore, it will be our documentary and dye studio. \u00a0Clint and Patty will be editing and sharing photos and videos of the tour to keep our followers updated. \u00a0We have been tirelessly preparing it for the journey ahead to ensure a smooth ride and tour. \u00a0 Thank you kindly for taking a look at our Kickstarter campaign. \u00a0We greatly appreciate your support of our project, \"Medicinal Art : East to West Tour.\" Credits: Patty Urrutia - Kickstarter video editing, logo/campaign design, digital guru, artistic visionary Clinton Jackson - Filmed travel shots for Kickstarter video, Kickstarter video editing, artistic visionary, good vibes guru Neil Goss - Organizer/producer for Kickstarter campaign, artistic visionary Special thanks go out to Nicholas Ward for filming Neil for the Kickstarter video.

Pyratrix Circus is a collective of  inspiring and active\u00a0artists and\u00a0performers. We\u00a0write our own scripts, produce our own music and mentor people to help them develop on all aspects of theater and circus skills, everything from the backstage pre production, costumes, set etc to, the performance within the shows by providing a free platform and space for young people to explore their ideas and creative talent. We are environmentally focused with our shows focused on the 3 R's- re-use, reduce recycle! We aim to run our events on solar power, highlighting alternative energies. This is also a space for people to showcase their bands, poetry, cabaret, art, sculpture, sideshows, walk about characters and performances.  We have been developing a stage show for a few years now and have recently teamed up with the Wango Riley Travelling Stage to bring the show to the Brighton Fringe festival this year in May. Roll up roll up! The travelling stage is coming to town, with all the fun of the fair, twisted carny freeks, sideshow games and piano bar in tow including, at the end of the evening an audio and visual show! Once entering the area you will feel as though you are walking into a film, an immersive interactive experience, creating a feeling of a traditional fair with a contemporary twist using sculpture, set design and the sideshow games to focus around an ecological version of a classic tale,\u00a0ALICE IN WASTELAND We have toured with our shows at festivals and events all over the country, including the Boom Town fair, Glastonbury and Brighton Fringe Festival, and even in a huge ship; the MS STUBNITZ with the shows \"Little Red Rioting Hoodie\",\" Reconbobulate\" and recently \"Alice in Wasteland\"  PLEASE SUPPORT OUR D.I.Y. CIRCUS \u00a0AND WE WILL BRING OUR SHOW TO A FIELD NEAR YOU. BIG LOVE AND RESPECT TO ALL! X",

  "We know what it\u2019s like to practice your putting for countless hours and not see results. You probably even lose sleep over it at times (we sure did). But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We\u2019ve spent over 3 years and thousands of hours developing the ChampCap to become the best putting practice tool on the market. If you practice with a ChampCap routinely, your putting accuracy, angle control, and speed will improve dramatically. Touring pros and amateurs are seeing improvements in their short game after only a couple of weeks with a ChampCap. \u00a0Neither one of us are anywhere near rich. We have maxed out 3 credit cards to even get this far, and after life\u2019s bills, we don\u2019t have the ability to buy the substantial inventory needed to launch a webstore. We did converse with a couple of potential investors to try and make this happen, but we soon realized we were going to have to give up a sizable amount of the company in order to work with them. We also are not sure how many Disc Golfers will be interested in this product. The ChampCap is a new concept from a startup company, and we understand that a lot of you might want to wait and see what your friends think of the product before buying one yourself. We decided that Kickstarter was the best option for us and for you. For us, Kickstarter is best because we can gauge intersest in our product without having to give up a large chunk of the company. Supporting our Kickstarter is best for you because of the discounted price, while also being able to get a head start on dialing up your c1x percentage before the ChampCap is readily available. \u00a0By supporting this Kickstarter, whether that is purchasing one ChampCap, multiple ChampCaps, or purchasing one of the add-ons available when you receive your survey, you will be showing us and the rest of the Disc Golf Community a few things: The first thing the Disc Golf Community will see is just how many players are interested in achieving their highest level of performance, and not just playing for fun (which is great too!). The second will be showing future start-up Disc Golf companies that Kickstarter is a viable option for them to launch their product and receive support from the community. And finally, you will be showing that Disc Golfers are open to products and concepts that haven\u2019t been attempted before. The ChampCap received a lot of \u201chate\u201d early on in its development and many people told us it would never work. We persevered but many people in that situation may not. Supporting this campaign will give future Disc Golf product designers something to point to and say it's possible no matter the feedback they are getting. Check out our reward tiers and add-ons and consider supporting our first and only Kickstarter campaign. Also, don\u2019t forget to screenshot your confirmation and share it to Instagram with the hashtag #IBackedChampCap to be entered to win one of 3 reverse colorway ChampCaps. This reverse colorway will never be used again, and entering this giveaway will be your chance to obtain one. Our Logo will make you a more accurate putter as well. We have stamped our logo onto the Gateway Wizard SS and the results have been amazing. As you see in the pictures above, our logo can be used to align and prepare your release point in a way that has never been done on a putter before. The Black with Gold-stamped Wizard will never be made again after this Kickstarter, so get them now if you believe this is the Champiest putter you will see for a while. You can also use our logo on a mini to make sure your feet are properly aligned. This works extremely well for those situations when you are behind an obstacle, or if you use a lot of angle on your putts and sometimes forget to account for that. Check out the rewards section where you will be able to select a Mini,\u00a0a Mini and Wizard Combo, or the Practice Pack which includes 5 Wizards and 1 Mini. The ChampCap Home Edition was designed to fit portable at-home practice baskets such as the MVP Black Hole, Innova Discatcher Sport, Discraft Chainstar light, Axiom, Hive, Yaheetech, Streamline, and DGA Mach II\u2019s. These baskets all have a diameter of ~22 inches across the top aspect of the basket. The ChampCap Home Edition XL was made specifically for Dynamic Discs and Latitude 64 practice baskets. These include the ProBasket, Recruit, Patriot, and Veteran. These baskets have a top aspect that measures about 25 inches as well as a 4-inch band and needed its own pattern to fit properly. The ChampCap Course Edition was designed to fit on-course baskets such as the Innova DiscCatcher and Prodigy T-Series. These baskets have a 4-inch band and a 22\u201d top aspect. A ChampCap Home Edition will fit DGA on-course baskets such as the Mach V, but it will have 4 different sized target holes which will make on course use a bit different than the standard Course Edition. We do plan to make ChampCap Course Edition patterns to fit the MVP Black Hole Portal, Discraft Chainstar Pro, and other basket types that our current sizing does not fit, but we believe the patterns we did create will be able to cover the majority of Disc Golfers needs. If you have any questions about what version of the ChampCap will fit your basket the best, please reach out to us and we will get you the best possible ChampCap for your basket and needs. **ChampCaps will not fit on skinny baskets such as the Marksman, Skillshot, or Strikezone. They also will not work on baskets that have a cloth \u201ccage\u201d such as fold-up travel baskets like the DGA Mach Lite, Dynamic Discs Scout, or Innova Skill Shot. \u00a0The global shipping backlog is a risk factor. We have decided to work with Fulfillrite Inc. (who specialize in fulfilling Kickstarter campaign rewards) to alleviate as much of this risk as possible. Our rewards will be delivered directly to this fulfillment center on the Atlantic coast and should therefore bypass the extreme backlog at the ports on the west coast of America.",
  "I am raising funds to record my next project. This album will be an intimate, acoustic collection of songs written between late 2017 and now. The funds raised will cover recording, mixing, mastering (all done at Blue Rock Artist Ranch & Studio in Wimberley, TX), a couple session musicians, CD printing, and hard costs for my thank you gifts. These past few years of my life have been quite a struggle as I learned to let go, surrender, and find ways to trust in the bigger picture of life that I cannot see. \u00a0I have put my soul into the songs that have emerged and am excited to share them with you. I looked through all the lyrics of the songs set to be recorded and found a strong theme inside them all...the words \"The Truth\" appeared over and over again. I had no idea I was even writing about the truth at all, yet somehow, each song alluded to it. I decided to own this theme and create the album title out of it. Most of the songs were written with the Translitic method, which I learned in late 2017 and have been using ever since. It is a deep dive into the subconscious, and works more like an excavation as opposed to sitting with a blank paper and a pen. As an artist, I was captivated and intrigued by this unique approach and found that I loved seeing what emerged - different every time. Thank you in advance for helping me spread the word, share my work with your friends and family, and hopefully helping me to raise this money for my upcoming heart-healing project... In gratitude and love, Vanessa Lively Austin, TX",
  "Hey everyone, thanks for considering helping to fund Wild Leek Rivers first full length album. In these strange times we have taken the opportunity to record some of our own material (and a couple friends songs too). With the help of recording wizard, Dan Davine, we have 12 songs that we are excited to share with the world. The hard part is over, now the expensive part begins: mixing, mastering, and getting the album pressed. Wild Leek River started in 2018 playing classic country music in and around Burlington Vermont. Eventually the band starting working on some original songs written by singer, Ian Burton, and in the spring of 2019 they recorded a 4 song cassette tape. The band currently consists of: \u00a0Ian Burton - Vocals/Acoustic Guitar Scott Maynard - Drums Ian Mack - \u00a0Lead Guitar Ben Rodgers - Pedal Steel Andrew Stearns - Vocals/Bass Guitar photographs by Andrew Stearns",
  "Early last year, I started writing a song called Poetry. It came in a blaze of creative glory, and I spent two days chasing down what I knew was something special. It's hard to describe the feeling, something like lightning, something like stumbling upon a vein of gold in the river and you wonder, how am I the one who gets to find it? When I wrote Poetry, I knew I wasn't just writing a song, but marking the next season of creating. I knew an album was being born.\u00a0 Since RIVER HOUSE released in 2017, I've spent the last 3 years discovering the real joy of my work: you. I've logged a lot of hours in your homes and living rooms on house concert tours, meeting you at weekend retreats in the woods, hearing your stories each night after a show. The world can be a hard and lonely place, and yet, we can find each other across the chasm of isolation, we can reach out a hand and be met by another. The songs for me are just a vehicle for the real joy of my life, which is being together. I like to think when I'm singing you my story, I'm also somehow mysteriously singing yours. I'm blown away every time you show up for me. I can never thank you enough. I can't believe the caliber of folks coming alongside me to bring this record to life. At the helm is producer Lucas Morton (Jill Andrews, Jordy Searcy, Jon McLaughlin). We assembled a killer band, I mean, just wait till you hear these guys. The lineup: Will Sayles (Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors, Ben Rector, Carly Bannister) on drums, Tyler Burkum (Needtobreathe, The Cactus Blossoms, Ingrid Michaelson) on electric guitar, \u00a0Scott Mulvahill (Keb Mo, Joy Williams, Andrew Peterson), Justin Schipper (Kacey Musgraves, Tim McGraw, Shania Twain) on pedal steel, and Buckley Miller (Thad Cockrell, Mindy Mindy Smith, Katie Herzig) engineering, plus a heap of good friends lending their voices and talents. We are tracking all the songs on this album live, which essentially means we all get in a room together, push the record button, and see what happens :) It's how the best albums get made, in my opinion, and I knew I wanted this record to sound like the ones I've obsessed over: Emmylou Harris' Wrecking Ball, Alison Krauss & Robert Plant's Raising Sand, Brandi Carlile's By The Way I Forgive You. \u00a0You can expect an album that even in its moments of heady genius, is all feel, all personality, all heart. The great news is, we've already gotten started! This February, before the world was thrown into a global pandemic, we packed in the B room at Oceanway Studios in Nashville and started tracking 4 of the 10 songs for the album. The original plan was to run a Kickstarter campaign in the spring and finish the album in 2020, but as we've all learned this year, some flexibility was required. To be honest, it's been a YEAR. I spent a good part of the last 6 months beat down and discouraged, not knowing when we'd pick the album back up, not knowing what was ahead for any of us. Through the encouragement of many of you, through some heart-to-hearts with my people, I remembered who I am and what I think I'm here on this earth to do. You reminded me \u00a0there IS a path forward, even if it's not the one we originally would have chosen. \"The impeded stream is the one that sings\" wrote Wendell Berry, and baby, we're singin. \u00a0 If you're reading this, thank you for caring about me and the music I make. Thank you for being with me all these years (or if you're new here, for taking a risk!) Wherever you are, I'd love you to come along for the ride on this one. I have a feeling it will be something special. Your Kickstarter pledge will go directly to music making, reserving studio space, paying for production, engineering, and the band, as well as printing, distribution, and marketing costs (see outlined budget below). To the right, there are lots of fun rewards exclusive to Kickstarters.

  "*We can handle custom orders at the $1,000 level and above. If you'd like a custom photochromic design for your team or company, please get in touch at Maddy@thecrated.com. *Our garments change back and forth time and time again when exposed to sunlight or shade.\u00a0 AS SEEN ON: THE STORY Every good collaboration begins with a funny story. Ours began with Maddy (co-founder of The Crated) standing up a very pregnant Meredith (co-founder of Print All Over Me) for coffee. Fast forward two years, many late night conversations, supply chain mishaps and \u00a0apologies on Maddy's part, Photochromia was born. ABOUT PHOTOCHROMIA Photochromia is a collaboration between two companies at the intersection of apparel and technology. A collection of sunlight sensitive garments, Photochromia visualizes STEAM concepts such as Schrodinger's Cat and Parametric equations. Through our collaboration, we aim to contribute to a future where clothing is truly responsive to our environment. THE TEAMS: New York is an incredible place that's at the nexus of design and technology. We believe that wonderful products can come our of working between teams and combining ideas. The Crated The crated is a product innovation studio focused on wearable technology and responsive textiles. \u00a0Print All Over Me Print All Over Me makes the web real by providing a platform where designers and create full bleed digitally printed garments. \" Our UV-reactive designs reflect the blend of design and code that has gone into their development and production. From Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat to parametric equations, this collection brings design and scientific concepts together in PHOTOCHROMIA\u2019s engaging and dynamic garments. The aim of the collaboration is to contribute to a future where responsive garments are the norm.\" -Print All Over Me JUST ADD SUNLIGHT: See our garments in action. All pieces in the Photochromia collection react to sunlight. MANUFACTURING Manufacturing of PHOTOCHROMIA will take place in the Print All Over Me production studio outside Shanghai, where each object is made to order by hand. The facility is owned by Print All Over Me, meaning employees work full time and receive full health care coverage; they make at least four times a fair wage.\u00a0 It took us over a year to set up a reliable, ethical and functional supply chain and we're constantly iterating and growing to perfect our garments. THE PROCESS:\u00a0 We begin printing PHOTOCHROMIA designs on fabric with a digital printer, then use screen printing to apply the UV-reactive inks. The printed fabric is then washed, cut and sewn into Print All Over Me-designed garments and accessories before making its way home to you. THE SCIENCE: \u00a0Inks that change color when exposed to sunlight undergo a process called photochromism. These inks are also known as photochromic inks, which inspired the name of our collection.  Photochromism was discovered around 1850 and was originally called phototropy.\nPhotochromic inks are considered to be bi-phasic. This means that they alter between two states, often triggered by electromagnetic radiation. Our photochromic inks alter between clear and opaque, but some photochromic inks change from one colored state to another. \nLeuco dyes are commonly used for creating transitions in photochromic inks. These are dyes whose molecules can acquire two forms, one of which is colorless. This is the sort of dye used for Photochromia.  Lueco dyes can also be used for thermochromism (changing state when stimulated by heat). Generally, the molecular structure of a Leuco dye, when clear, reflects photons, appearing to be white or clear. When stimulated with UV light, the chemical structure of the dye changes to a conjugated system. Conjugated systems are very stable and give rise to strong pigments as they absorb photons. This absorption of photons makes the pigment appear to be black.\n THE CAMPAIGN New supply chains require large orders to stay alive, which is why we're bringing Print All Over Me to Kickstarter. Help us produce our photochromic garments by supporting our Kickstarter campaign by ordering a hat, sweatshirt, backpack, or sweatpants. \u201cWe believe that PHOTOCHROMIA is a small, but sure step towards reactive garments being integrated into our everyday lives. Even more so, we believe that collaboration within the design and technology world is essential and we hope to inspire future collaborations between NYC startups in the future. Let\u2019s create a world full of enchanted objects rather than backlit screens. \u201c -Maddy Maxey, Head of Technology, The Crated \u00a0Rewards!\u00a0 \u00a0PRODUCTION CREDITS\nPhotography: Spencer Kohn \nVideography: Max Lauter\nStyling ,  jewelry and hair: Jenni Hensler \nMakeup and Hair: Eric Vosburg\nModels: Annika White & Tyler Pope",
  "Hello there! I'm a tabletop games addict playing all sort of board, card and miniatures games. Started from that hobby going through professional 3d printing up to this project - bringing more Steampunk theme to everyone! I design all models by myself, I 3d print everything for testing and I even splash some paint all over them to show the details a little better. I've got already tons of further ideas, so help me keep going :)\u00a0 Search for free model link! As you can already see the project is completed - all basic set models are ready and uploaded to google drive for sharing immediately after the payments are cleared by KS. \u00a0EDIT: Obviously there will be no SGs HOWEVER... the biggest one - carriage is now included in the base set. 1. At 250 backers I will add extra top for the tower to turn water tower into watch tower. With enough space for 30mm based models to walk around. Multi pieces. 2. At 500 backers I will make all legs modular and extra weapons options for models that are using them. That's including a different, crawling tentacles pose for NSFW vehicle. 3. Finally at 1000 backers I will release a huge centrepiece - ornamental, steampunk style carriage powered by a locomotive in the front. All on wheels. Hinged doors for models to get inside. Flat top for higher ground. It will be large, multi pieces model. 1st and 2nd Stretch Goals will be showed as renders within 3 days of reaching the level and will be test printed before delivering. Frankly - I'm really not good at the visual aspect of the website but if you want see more or ask more just check my Instagram or find me on Facebook. I post now in every group I can think of so it will be easy :) \u00a0Gatling gun pre supported! GRAB FREE MODEL HERE!!! T&Cs: If you will pledge for the physical models I will start printing them based on the backer's number. It will take a few days per set to be completed and shipped and I will be sending them as soon as finished so first come first served. If you want some contact details for pro painters just let me know - I can send directly to some of them I'm working with so you can save on shipping but the entire deal will be between you and the painter. Please remember the physical prints can always have some minor imperfections or possible leftovers that will need an additional polishing. I will prepare them as well as I can to make them ready for priming straight from the box but make sure you triple checked every piece on arrival. All shipments will be tracked and fully insured. Damages in transport will be replaced free of charge upon providing photo evidence. As a merchant you are allowed to 3d print and sell models at your own rates. No mass production is allowed - please don't make cast pieces, molds etc. Of course it's fine if you've got dozens of 3d printers and you are loving these models so much to run all of them at the same time :) A year licence time starts 3 days after you will be sent your download link. Just to have some time to test print everything you want and make own photos. I will be happy to work with you before on some good looking renders at merchants got an additional SG - if all licences will sell I will make digital painting of these renders for the best possible marketing for your store. Lifetime licence is rather obvious - you can start pre-selling as soon as the payment will be cleared by KS. FEEL FREE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS! And follow my instagram for updates and news. I will try to copy all in here but just in case of further projects ;)\u00a0",
  "Accidental Gentleman values the uniqueness and creativity of individuals, groups, and organizations. It is the company\u2019s mission to provide opportunities for self-expression through variety and customization of neckwear. Our medium for the printing process is screen printing. Screen printing is well known for being a process of garment and apparel decoration. Some of the steps include: burning images into emulsion on various types of mesh screens, then pressing ink through those screens onto the product to create all kinds of images. Here is a quick video of us printing: The Accidental Gentlemen design team has over 18 years of screen-printing and design experience, and we incorporate that experience towards the tie. We feel the tie is the one garment that has mostly eluded customization and individual expression. We have the experience, creativity and customer service to revolutionize the formal wear experience! From Sports to Music, and Art to Pop Culture...Accidental Gentlemen embodies whatever you can imagine...on a tie! Click here to check out more on the Original Gentleman ties. Click here for more info on the Exceptional Gentleman Ties Click here for more info on the Kickstarter Exclusive Tie. What sets us apart from others in the neck-tie industry is the creativity and customization we plan to offer the customer. Our whole team loves art and most of the team considers themselves graphic artists. We each have very different design processes, but many times we start with simple pen and paper. We are developing a new platen system specifically meant for neck-wear. Advanced prints on ties are difficult to complete because the material shifts in-between color changes. Our new patent-pending system will change that. Interchangeable mounting-brackets, allowing us to securely lock down our ties will enable us to print the most beautiful ties, with accurate registration, up to 4x the speed of conventional printing. 'Nuff Said. ____________________________________________________________________ One of the exciting projects that Accidental Gentleman is bringing to the tie game includes what we call, the Accidental Tie Artists. What we plan to do is hand pick artists that are amazing at what they do and commission them to design a tie. We then take their art, make it screen print ready, and create awesome prints!

  "Since 1999 we've been connecting our friends and family with the tailor-made clothing process. \u00a0There is something special about clothes that were made for you, designed by you, and artfully, masterfully crafted with you in mind. \u00a0 Our Kickstarter project has come about due to a new strategy to expand our client base and reach more people. \u00a0While there will always be something to be said for the tailor shop experience, the truth is, most of us don't have time to enjoy it. \u00a0We wanted to figure out a way to still give our clients perfect-fitting dress shirts in a way that's not only budget conscious, quick and efficient, but it's actually very enjoyable as well. \u00a0 Our interactive preview module allows clients to choose from\u00a0over\u00a0200 top quality fabrics, choose various design features such as collar type, pockets, cuff type, fit preference and more. As a particular design feature is selected, the live module illustrates the selected option so our clients can see what their custom, tailored shirt will look like to ensure its exactly how they want it. By answering just a few questions from our very brief survey, the fitting algorithm we utilize will instantly determine your full set of shirt measurements - often more detailed and accurate than what a tailor would provide. Take advantage of our package deals and help us spread the love. \u00a0While our shirts are top quality and our process is smooth and efficient, we are best known for our total and complete commitment to absolute client satisfaction. \u00a0Our promise is that you will be 100% satisfied and we'll do whatever necessary to ensure that. \u00a0Period. The first time I was ever fitted for tailored clothes I was 19 years old. \u00a0I was living in Southeast Asia as a volunteer missionary for my church and I wore dress shirts, ties and slacks every day. \u00a0 From the moment I entered the tailor's shop, I was enamored with the entire experience. \u00a0 I gazed at the endless reams of fabrics neatly lined throughout the entire shop. \u00a0I was measured, fitted and complimented on my clothing and style choices, but politely corrected when I committed any fashion faux pas. \u00a0The clothes came back perfect. \u00a0Absolutely perfect. \u00a0I never bought from off the rack again. \u00a0",

  "Every year Challengers creates an exclusive t-shirt only available during our annual \"I Love You But I've Chosen Comics\"\u00a0sale. This year's shirt was designed by graphic novelist LUCY KNISLEY (\"French Milk\" \"An Age of License\" \"Displacement\") and it was such a hit that we are now making it available to YOU! The design is screened in white on a black tee and it has the Challengers logo on the back collar. It was Lucy herself that decided this version should be white on a black shirt, and we completely agree with her artistic wishes. Also, these shirts are printed right here in Chicago, at the Art Factory, on Gildan brand 100% cotton shirts. Look at that--designed, printed and distributed all in Chicago. Home-town pride, baby! The shirts are available in both Women's or Unisex styles, and from sizes Small thru 5XL. Domestic USPS Priority Mail shipping is $6 per shirt and we unfortunately will not be shipping outside of the United States, but shirts can be picked up in-store to save on shipping.

  "\u00bfDe d\u00f3nde nace Zirku? Cuando nos dimos cuenta del problema de consumismo excesivo en el que vivimos, decidimos hacer una encuesta para analizar el hueco que podr\u00eda haber en el mercado.\u00a0 Seg\u00fan nuestra encuesta, el 86,8% de los participantes afirman que cuentan con varios objetos en casa que solamente usan en ocasiones. No tiene mucho sentido \u00bfverdad?. Esto significa que tendemos a comprar productos con poca rentabilidad y acumulamos cosas que no hacen m\u00e1s que ocupar espacio en casa sin ser utilizadas. Es evidente que aqu\u00ed falla algo y de ah\u00ed nace Zirku. Zirku nace de la NECESIDAD de frenar el consumismo excesivo. Hoy en d\u00eda, cometemos el gran error de comprar todo aquello que se nos antoja sin ser conscientes de lo que esto conlleva para, no solamente nuestro bolsillo, sino tambi\u00e9n para el medio ambiente. Es una emergencia para el planeta Tierra que no produzcamos tanto y as\u00ed disminuir la contaminaci\u00f3n. Para ello debemos cambiar nuestra mentalidad, deber\u00edamos comprar menos y empezar a optimizar nuestros recursos. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es Zirku? Zirku es una plataforma marketplace basada en la econom\u00eda colaborativa d\u00f3nde puedes alquilar los art\u00edculos que tienes almacenados en casa y que solo utilizas ocasionalmente. Tambi\u00e9n puedes buscar aquellos art\u00edculos que necesites para un plan ocasional y ahorrar algo de dinero. Zirku es la nueva forma de frenar el consumismo excesivo, de colaborar juntos, de ayudarnos entre nosotros y por supuesto contribuir a la conservaci\u00f3n del medio ambiente.

  "Hello, I am Robert Howell owner of Superbob, and I need your help to digitally preserve the building that was once McPhail's florist and greenhouse on Barton springs road, here in Austin, Texas. When a local business closes, not only do we mourn the loss of the business itself (the owners, the employees, the service, etc.), we often miss the physicality of the building that the business was housed in. It is often the uniqueness of a location that makes the experience of being somewhere so special and memorable. Here in Austin, that is especially true. So much of what made this city the weird, funky place it is, is/was the charm of the buildings. Threadgill's, Antone's, Toy Joy, Cedar Door, Shady Grove, are just a few of the by-gone businesses whose buildings I'll miss visiting. Sadly, these buildings, because of their age and uniqueness and the economics of remodeling, are often unsalvageable once the business closes, and are typically demolished. Once gone, all we are usually left with are a few photographs and our memories. But there is a blossoming technology that can help capture and preserve the physicality of these buildings, with breathtaking detail, for us and all posterity. The technology is called LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). LiDAR scanners utilize a pulsing laser to gather millions of 3D points along the surfaces of the things in its field of view. The scanner can also gather color. And when the data from multiple scans (more scans = more detail) is woven (registered) together, the resulting \"Point Cloud\" is an exact copy of the location. The level of detail that can be achieved is both unprecedented and captivating. Furthermore, because this data integrates into most 3D software programs, it exists, in its purest form, as archival data. And amongst the numerous applications of this data to the design and construction realm, is the ability to format this data for interactive viewing. (Here's an example of such an interface highlighting a portion of the Sample Data you see above). I want to use this technology to scan McPhail's and make its 3D point cloud data freely available to the public.\u00a0 I've chosen to McPhail's for several reasons. First off, McPhail\u2019s is, indeed, one of dozens of beloved iconic local Austin businesses that has closed in recent years. I loved buying flowers there for a bunch of reasons. The owner, Rex Minyard, and his staff were always patient and super-helpful, the flowers were always stunning and it always felt good to be able to support a local business. But it was also a cool funky space to visit enter into. Maybe it was just me, but I always loved how literally organic the place felt. From the rich, musty, floral smell of the foyer, to the earthy, dilapidated charm of the building itself. I was so dismayed, when I went there last year to buy anniversary flowers for my wife, and found the place boarded up. I suspect lots of other Austinites have experienced that same feeling of loss.\u00a0 But it was not until I heard about the building\u2019s impending demolition and was reading the long thread of Facebook posts from people who were expressing their sadness, not just for the loss of the business, but for the loss of that building as well, that I realized I actually could do something. While I knew I couldn't save the physical building itself, I could at least preserve this building digitally for everyone to visit, explore and reminisce about. Not only can this data be enjoyed in a web-based application, it can also be accessed in a virtual reality platform, allowing people to walk around inside of the building as if they were really there. The data can also be formatted for 3D printing! Furthermore emerging augmented reality technologies will people to go to the old location and be able to visualize the building as it was, and in the exact place it was, after it is long gone. There are two main intersecting interests at the heart of this project. One is the preservation of the architectural history of the city I call home - Austin, Texas. The other is my fascination with LiDAR technologies and the data they gather. I've been fascinated by LiDAR (i.e. point cloud) data since I first saw it in action several years ago. As a CAD designer, I could immediately recognize the value of this data as a design tool. Understanding that value is what ultimately motivated me to start my own business deploying this LiDAR to Austin's architectural community. But in recent months I've become enchanted by the prospect of utilizing this technology as a mode of preservation and am motivated to capture as many of the buildings in Austin that are most vulnerable to being lost. But I need your help. There is a cost associated with utilizing these scanners as well as the softwares needed to process the data, model it, and make it accessible online. I am reaching out you now, to help me seize this opportunity to capture a little bit of the charm this building, and Austin, while we still can. Thank you for your time and support.",

We've cut out the middleman and then spared no expense giving you more of what you need. Inside pockets ! Great product/ great functionality. Our campaign started from noticing too many people constantly distracted by using their smartphones \u00a0\u2026on the street, walking across intersections and, worst of all, when driving. This behavior is a serious problem for everyone. I value your life and mine and a majority of mobile users don\u2019t always make the most brilliant choices for their well-being and ours. Many of us know a friend, family member, cousin, or someone who has been affected by texting and driving and further, have even lost a loved one. We are a team of likeminded creative designers, branders, writers, and executives who wanted to use the model of a fashion company for social impact and take it one step further. Not to just help the people who are doing \"on the ground\" work for change, but also have a call to action.\u00a0 T.H.U.M.B will help us make a much needed behavioral change.\u00a0This acronym stands for Teaching Humans Universal Mobile Behavior and it is a platform conceived with the intent of saving lives. We are fired up and we decided to do something about it.\u00a0The Original Inside Pocket Company\u2019s goal is to provide people with lifestyle apparel and accessories that help Humans make smarter decisions about when & where to use their technology.\u00a0Yes, POCKETS! Think about it. Our devices are getting thinner, lighter and larger and we do not have clothing that accommodates these items easily or in a fashionable way. Lets face it, fashion isn\u2019t following along with these changes fast enough.\u00a0If we had options, perhaps we would be more apt to use them. \u00a0\u00a0 The vision of The Original Inside Pocket Company team is to slowly, but progressively, change this behavior.\u00a0With your help and support we can solve one of the greatest social issues of our time. Our sweatshirts are available in Heather Grey & Navy Made of 80% COTTON / 20% POLYESTER PREMIUM QUALITY BRUSHED FLEECE All seams are reinforced with triple needle cover stitching, allowing for stretch and movability, yet holding all seams securely.\u00a0Our rib is 2x2 knit, with silky feel and added Lycra for maximum stretch and shape recovery.\u00a0Zippers are anodized metal YKK 2 way zippers, the industry standard for highest quality and functionality. Fine Print: If you send your selection back to us, we'll fix it and send it back to you. Return postage is on us (meaning , shipping back to you once you've shipped it to us for mending), please give us a heads up before dropping it in the box. \u00a0Also, international customers will have to pay shipping both ways. \u00a0We also reserve the right to ask for a small increase to ship the sweatshirt out in the first place, once actual and final shipping costs have been calculated. Unfortunately, this cannot be done in advance as shipping costs vary by country and Kickstarter doesn't tell us where you are until after the funding period has closed. We will not be making money on shipping and we will be transparent about these costs. We also cannot fix stains or lost strings. The Team and I THANK YOU SO much for the support! We will not let you down. Please share this video with a friend and help spread the message! Saving lives, one pocket at a time !!",

  "Worlds first \"on the fly\" self adjusting guitar strap that allows one to go \nfrom a playing position to a solo position without interrupting rhythm \nand sound. To see pictures and demo visit the products page of our website: http://thesolostrap.com/guitar-strap-products.html  I,\"Jeff Ball,\" am, at the time sole investor, so I am in the lead on\n this project only by default since this is the brain child of my son \nChandler. He is the one that conceived the idea and led me through the \ndesign process. I am the engineer and spokesman.\u00a0 I've been around the\n block a time or two owning my own business for years so I know more of what to expect, in the way of \nobstacles,\u00a0as we move forward.   In the beginning of the process Chandler began by giving me a mental picture of what his vision was for the project. From there I purchased a box that Chandler felt was the correct size and we both felt possessed the strength that would allow us to drill and manipulate it without destroying the box or jeopardizing its integrity. As we were working on the design and creating a pro to-type we began the process of obtaining the patent pending.\u00a0 After we had the working pro to-type we employed our friends near Georgia Tech campus to help us with the open scad drawings we needed to shop out the design to plastics companies and complete the patent process. I want to take a few minutes to define what we are going to do \nwith your money moving forward. I know, if you are like me you are concerned\n about where you spend your money, you want to know it is going to smart\n use. \u00a0Plan number one,\u00a0 Product Appearance - \u00a0We are going \nto streamline the product's appearance.\u00a0Although we have a working pro \nto-type what we have now looks like a panel van where we want it to look\n like a Ferrari. So\u00a0a\u00a0chunk (approx 60%)\u00a0of the money will be \nsplit between product\u00a0appearance, patent fees, and \ninternational filing fees. We still owe the gentleman helping us with the patent drawings $1000.00.  The money that is left will be spent \npurchasing product components used to assemble the first run and \npurchasing all materials that are needed to fulfill obligations promised\n to backers in the rewards category. Plan number two,\u00a0 Production Plan - We are assembling and shipping\u00a0the product from right here in the Atlanta \narea. The way we have it set up is we order the pieces in bulk and \nhave a team of college students assemble and ship the finished product from an office owned by a Dentist friend of ours near our house. When the product takes off we will eventually rent or purchase warehouse space as we grow\n into a real live business. ",
  "Open Viewing is a Live Action Horror Maze in Stoke-on-Trent, We aim to provide on of the most scary, haunting experiences possible with as small a budget as we can muster. Putting on an event such as this requires a lot of time, effort and consideration, a lot of talks between councils and other such boring stuff, however, the end result will be an attraction for those with a strong will and a passion for Horror.\n The basic storyline consists of Groups being invited into an established Asylum, you have been asked to attend to see how the Asylum owners are running the establishment, though... not everything is going to plan, you will encounter enraged inmates, those that have been treated horrendously, their crimes unforgivable and their trust misplaced, will you get out safely? Or will you be trapped inside? Hide... From the Nightmare inside. An attraction like this utilises MANY special effects, such as Strobe Lighting, Smoke Machines, Wind Effects, Theatrical Lighting, Sound Systems, Costumes and Make-Up as well as numerous Props and Prosthetics, All of this costs money, If you pledge towards the project, you will be funding something that will be remembered for a very long time, forget the picnic in the park Halloween events that many Theme Parks and Attractions put on, this event will test your moral fibre and introduce a new breed of Audience Interaction that we hope will become industry standard. As a record: The Maze has already been plannedStoryline has been writtenPlot has been developed and stressedManagement has been hired. As I explained in the last section, An Attraction such as this requires a lot of time and effort as well as money, Myself and my Co-Owner also run day jobs, as such this project will take a lot of time from us, time that we can use to work and earn money, as such we need your help to fund this. In return you will get to experience an attraction far more terrifying than anything you have witnessed yet. We require \u00a314,000 to host this attraction that pays for: LightingSoundSafety EquipmentToolsConstructionA place to hold the attractionCostumesMake-upInsurancePropsPower SystemsCommunication SystemsSFXSet DesignMarketingAs well as Tea and Biscuits for the Crew...\u00a0 That's a lot of stuff, and \u00a314,000 is the MINIMUM we can do this, That's a budget to be scared of! Don't worry though, your money is being put to a good use, We will be hiring Student Actors around the area giving them the valuable experience and a foothold into the industry allowing more of them to be employed in the future. We've thought about that, In a lot of detail, it's a scary process to have a fantastic idea and then to ask people to part with their hard earned cash. So... If we don't reach the goal, we will then apply for an Arts Grant through the UK Arts Council for our funding, The reason we didn't ask them first, is they like their money, and we also wanted to ask you guys, the ones that will directly benefit from the attraction to fund us, after-all, we're doing this for everyone that visits the attraction! So do not worry, your pledge will still affect us, it will give us even more motivation and you will still see the attraction made! With your help, we can change the face of the Scare Industry, introduce a new range of Audience Interaction techniques and also scare the living daylights out of MANY people! In the long run, this event will allow a lot more Students get jobs in the Theatre Industry as well as the Scare Industry, by building their talents, giving them the valuable experience they need to work in the hard and tough industry as well as building their Portfolio. This will also impact the various Industries and show off Live Horror Attractions in the limelight they deserve. I have a huge passion for Scare Mazes and Haunts, I have worked in Stage Productions and within the Leisure Industry, So no need to worry, I know what I'm doing! With my current skill set I believe I can put on a very real attraction that tests the minds of people as well as their bodies and ability to cope in such an environment.\nI will also be visiting Colleges and Universities in the area to teach people the talent of Scare Acting and how to get a job in the field. Remember, you're helping us, help others by supporting this campaign!\n\nNo money? Or a bit wary?\n\nWhy not Share the page using the handy Kickstarter Share Tools and raise awareness of this idea? Also bookmark us! Add us to your favourites, Post us on facebook! Follow us on Facebook! Every little helps says Tesco and so do we! Remember, any publicity is good publicity and will help us to succeed!\u00a0\n\n Perk Info...\n\nAll perks involving access to the attraction require you to abide by the Rules given upon attendance of the event.\n\nTransport to the event is not included.",

Restore and Perform The Great Houdini's Water Torture Cell to honor The Legacy 99 years to the day it was first introduced by Houdini himself! Born 1953, 2 full months premature\nand smaller than a football. The\ndoctor informed my mother there was nothing they could do and sent me\nhome to die. You see, my lungs were not yet fully formed so I would always struggle to \nbreathe; my legs were also undeveloped so I would surely be crippled \nand I was\ntoo weak to nurse so I would perish of malnutrition. The doctor underestimated my\nmother. \n\nShe took me home and exercised my\nlegs daily. She had my sisters soften\nthe nipples for my bottles by chewing on them so I could nurse.

The\n direction of my life changed in an instant when, in 1963, I saw Tony \nCurtis' portrayal of The Great Houdini!\u00a0 It was at that moment, I \ncommitted my life to emulating the greatest escape artist of all time! I\u00a0 devoured all things Houdini; books, movies, articles, documentaries,\n every account I could find.\u00a0 I decided at ten years of age, despite severe asthma and my weak limbs, that I would perform Houdini's \nself proclaimed \"Greatest Invention,\" the Water Torture Cell, by my \n52nd birthday, the age Houdini was when he took his last breath.\u00a0  For decades, I brought smiles to countless faces by making the \nimpossible possible!\u00a0 Then, as life tends to do, it threw some curves \nand my dream fell dormant.\u00a0 Life whipped past me robbing me of my goal.\u00a0 Now, it was \ntoo late, or was it?\u00a0 I am now 60.\u00a0 An old man, by many standards, who had let myself go.\u00a0 I WAS an obese, aging\n diabetic with asthma who hadn't exercised a lick in a decade!  But that has all changed... I am Becoming Houdini. I feel obliged to share the accounts that informed and inspired my \njourney.\u00a0 Stories of people who escaped mediocrity when the common would\n surrender.\u00a0 People whose very grit inspire all who discover their \naccomplishments.\u00a0 People who inspired me to continue when my feet \nblistered and my resolve waned.\u00a0 People like: \u2022Arthur Boorman, a YouTube\nsensation with more than 9,000,000 views, who went from being a disabled veteran weighing\n340 lbs to a 240 lb healthy runner in six months\u2026 AND \u2022Derek\nRedmond, an Olympian whose hamstring\nmuscle ripped during the 400 meters in Barcelona, which he was favored to win\u2026 If I can inspire one person to follow their dream and change their life I will be a success.

We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support in helping change the face of school safety across the United States. \u00a0BUT WE AREN'T FINISHED.\u00a0 We hit our first goal of $11,000.00, but now we need your support in raising an additional $6,000.00! \u00a0This will allow us to host two K-12 Keynote Conferences this year. \u00a0The virtual conference hosting platform will provide us with a 15% discount if we host two conferences this year. \u00a0This generous offer will save our non-profit nearly \u00a0$3,000.00. \u00a0WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT! Stretch Goal: $5,687.00 Achieving this stretch goal will fully finance the Arizona K-12 Keynote Conference scheduled for August 2021. Overview You will be supporting us in launching our first K-12 Keynote Conference. \u00a0This virtual conference will be a one-day, high impact event featuring the leading researchers in the field of school safety. \u00a0With your help, we will revolutionize the manner in which school safety conferences are hosted. \u00a0No sales pitches, no vendors, no anecdotal solutions to keeping our students and teachers safe. \u00a0We are going back to the basics. \u00a0The conference hosts five keynote speakers that have dedicated their lives to understanding school violence. \u00a0Presenters will be providing their research and evidence-based solutions on how to support students before a crisis. \u00a0We will investigate the most effective and responsible ways to prepare campuses for a violent critical incident. K-12 Keynote Conference Dates: Texas - May 2021 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arizona - Aug 2021 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0California - Dec 2021 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Idaho - Jan 2022 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Florida - May 2022 Why we started. In 2011 my mom survived the shooting at Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords' event in Tucson, AZ. \u00a0A year later, I was shook to my core by the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary. \u00a0It was then that I decided to dedicate my life to understanding these horrific events. \u00a0As a family impacted by violence, the father of school-aged children, and the spouse of an educator, I have focused my efforts on supporting K-12 schools in developing data-driven campus safety programs. \u00a0Many schools do not have the resources to fund necessary school safety measures, so our family founded Academe Grove, a 501(C)(3) educational non-profit charged with collaborating with schools to implement campus safety reform projects. \u00a0Where we are. The K-12 Keynote Conference, powered by Kickstarter, is our flagship event. \u00a0This is our introduction into the world and will begin our journey as a non-profit in supporting K-12 schools across the United States. \u00a0We are not asking for a donation to our organization, we are asking for your support in setting a new standard in school safety reform grounded in research and ethical programs accessible to every community. \u00a0This conference, made possible with your help, will create enough resources for us to host two more conferences by the end of the year and continue to support schools for the life of our organization.\u00a0 What is the K-12 Keynote Conference? The K-12 Keynote Conference was founded on three pillars: evidence-based, topic specific, and audience centric. Our speakers are not only subject matter experts, they are leading researchers in the field. The K-12 Keynote Conference is just that. A single day conference that provides five keynote speakers. Speakers will share their research and findings ensuring attendees receive evidence-based recommendations from advocates leading the charge in school safety reform. Focusing on a single school safety reform topic allows us to establish a panel representing the greatest minds from around the United States. Our aim isn\u2019t to simply inform attendees about the latest research or best-practices in school safety. Our goal is to collaborate with education and community leaders in order to influence policy and legislation based on unbiased scientific research. As such, each speaker is required to submit a Policy Brief reflecting their research and addressing the topic of the conference. Over the past decade, school safety conferences have lost focus and become more about fundraising by catering to vendors, rather than the quality of the content presented. The glorified sales pitches masquerading as unbiased presentations ends here. The K-12 Keynote Conference is centered around the audience, not the vendors. Each conference will have a single Mission Partner, fully vetted by our Board of Directors, whose product or service directly relates to the conference topic. Attendees can rest-assured knowing any Mission Partner at that conference meets our requirements of utilizing evidence-based and trauma-informed programs. Why state or region-specific conferences? The content provided at each conference will impact K-12 stakeholders across the United States. \u00a0However, each state or region is at different stages in establishing campus safety measures aligned to best-practices. Each region has hazards, threats, and cultural considerations that may not be prevalent in other areas. As an example, some states mandate school threat assessment teams or require certain drills. State specific conferences allow us to establish a conference topic reflecting the concerns and challenges of that region guiding our speakers to write Policy Briefs addressing specific state laws or education codes. K-12 Keynote Conference Dates: Texas - May 2021 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arizona - Aug 2021 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0California - Dec 2021 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Idaho - Jan 2022 Why a virtual conference? A virtual conference is not our preferred delivered method. We want to interact with audience members directly and feel the passion of our presenters in person. However, a virtual conference offers a number of benefits. In alignment with our mission to create equity within school safety programs, a virtual conference dramatically reduces the costs for attendees who no longer need to budget for travel, hotels, and per diem. In turn, this expands our ability to share research with educators and community partners who may not have been able to attend otherwise. The virtual platform also allows us to make the content available beyond the conference so attendees can revisit presentations and share the information with other stakeholders. Lastly, it is the safest option for our attendees, speakers, and volunteers during a pandemic. How will the virtual conference be delivered? We will utilize VFairs\u2019 revolutionary virtual conference platform to deliver a highly engaging and interactive experience. \u00a0Speakers will provide presentations in a semi-live format. Presentations will be professionally recorded and produced ensuring the highest quality of content is showcased with an in-person feel. Attendees will be able to chat live during the presentations with speakers allowing the audience to ask questions and interact just like a traditional conference.",

  "This is the story of a Tiki-branded clothing line called Beachdude, Inc.\u00a0 Started by KC Heylin, the original beachdude, and his love of mother ocean, our humble company has one main goal: to make your new favorite shirt. If you love the beach, we have the clothing for you, whether it be a nice button down or a beach tank, and our eco-friendly business will ensure that you and your loved ones can enjoy the beach for generations to come. We've spent the last ten years refining and growing our brand identity, and now we are ready to show the world. That's where you come in. We have so many ideas, and we are eager to begin, but there are many obstacles we have to overcome first, from physical production to marketing to distribution, and we need your donations to make it all happen.  Please read below, watch our video, and consider donating. Your contribution matters! I\u2019ve lived within a block of the beach in Orange County, California for over 30 years.\u00a0 Every single beach town in the county, from Huntington Beach to San Clemente.  The beach is our home and housekeeping is our first priority, which has led us to setting up the \u201cLove Your Beach\u201d group, which will be funded by in part by our company earnings.\u00a0 \u201cLove Your Beach\u201d is not only a company slogan and trademark - - it\u2019s part of our DNA as a brand, and our TIKI logo is the figurehead.  To love Beachdude is to love all things West Coast and Hawaiian, and to find your own West Coast dream in the personality of our brand.\u00a0  Our clothing is well-made, fun and Beachdude-recognizable.\u00a0 We will be \nthe company that makes your favorite shirt. You\u2019ll be one of our team \nmembers; and your investment will go toward ground-level clean beach \nefforts in the most practical way. We see TIKI everywhere at the beach in Southern California\u00a0 \u2013 not just in stickers and products we\u2019ve sold, but in the personality of our hyperactive, mischievous and downright competitive TIKI dude.\u00a0 You\u2019ll get that from the way he\u2019s designed along with his TIKI friends - his buddy TIK, his girlfriend Sheki; as well as the players he\u2019s become as a Tiki Santa, Hockey Tiki, Football TIKI, Water Polo TIKI, and even as a Trojan Tiki at USC.  He\u2019s been part of all sorts of shirts, hats, jackets and shorts and has shown up as a sticker, in paper print, in embroidery, as a clothing patch, in sublimation print as part of fabric and, of course, in screen printing.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just the start.\u00a0 We plan on Tiki Towels, Tiki toys; all sorts of additional gear.Beyond that, he\u2019s in comics and just began to work in animation, which we\u2019ll vigorously promote.\u00a0 Eventually, we even want to put TIKI and his friends in a video game.\u00a0 This is a Southern California/Entertainment Capital branding effort. The \"Trojan Tiki\" has become in itself a well known icon, worn by the likes of Mark Sanchez and the USC football team, as well as many students on campus, making Beachdude products a best seller in the USC bookstore. RIGHT NOW, we need your funding help to strategically raise brand awareness with precision marketing; to expand the product line, and to help with product production. \"Marketing\" is a broad umbrella for extensive operations, including web maintenance and social media promo; larger-scale public advertising, and Event Sponsorship and coordination. Under the umbrella of \"Product Production\" lies the diverse operations involved in extensive cut-and-sew garment construction, purchase of \"blank\" products (mostly t-shirts) for custom dye work and/or screen print; embroidery; sublimation, and many other processes involved in garment construction. Fortunately, even on a smaller level, we've had hands-on experience in most of these areas. Insofar as growing Tiki in media (e.g. animation), that will require working with CGI artists, story writing, story boarding, and aspects of film work. THE GREATEST advantage we have with all of the above, fortunately, is contacts within both the clothing industry and entertainment industry in Southern California. Location is everything - not only does it give us the soul of our brand, but it also gives us the souls who are capable of lending their top-tier expertise to the effort. As our thanks to you, we\u2019ll set you up with a variety of fun, material items, outlined in the rewards section. In the BIG picture \u2013 we\u2019ll list every donor on our webpage, where you\u2019ll also get to pick if you want your name listed with \u201cTEAM TIKI\u201d, \u201cTEAM TIK\u201d, or \u201cTEAM SHEKI\u201d, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll put you. You\u2019ll also be listed, hard-copy, in the lobby of where we set up headquarters; for all time. You are a part of our company at a strategic moment and we will never forget what you did for us. We\u2019re an authentic garage brand, located a short block from some of the best surf in the planet in Huntington Beach, California.\u00a0 Ready to make history that is part of YOUR history and, of course, for all of those TINY TIKIS yet to come.  1.\u00a0 Why is TIKI important to Beachdude, Inc.?\u00a0 - When I started using the company name Beachdude, Inc., I was working full-time in repairing, restoring and refinishing Hawaiian-style furniture (mostly 20th Century product) which involved a lot of tedious working of koa wood, narra, mahogany, and especially rattan. Painstakingly consuming, it fascinated me and I loved being able to bring beauty and life back into solid vintage products.\u00a0 I worked in Southern California with occasional trips to take on larger volume work in Hawaii. To love Hawaii is to love koa wood (native language has 23 words for it) and wood carving.\u00a0 Hawaii is a very small state that is nonetheless well-known throughout the world for the contribution of surfing, tiki and hula to pop culture.\u00a0 I was in love at first sight and literally found myself doodling the original tiki figure on a church bulletin during a service. I still have that bulletin, about 15 years later. While still working in the vintage Hawaiiana industry, I made our first Tiki shirt for Beachdude, Inc. and gave them as gifts to customers.\u00a0 And although we\u2019ve thickened up some of the lines and added in some colors to create his family (Tik, Tiki, Sheki), he\u2019s still the same design we started with.\u00a0 This is a brand born of character AND a character - - not just another person\u2019s last name or some cryptic word screenprinted on a shirt.2.\u00a0 What\u2019s \u201cLove Your Beach\u201d?\u00a0 \u201cLove Your Beach\u201d is trademarked by Beachdude, Inc. not only as a design feature, but moreover, as an intentional environmental effort.\u00a0\u00a0 To say it\u2019s part of our DNA is no stretch of fact.\u00a0 More years ago than I\u2019ll mention here (let\u2019s just say it happened before environmental efforts were fashionable), I was the kid who started the newspaper drive in my Junior High and who made the collecting of cans and glass the focus of my Eagle Scout project. Our goal is to intimately partner with local beaches and sharing profits with the local clean beach efforts (e.g. \u201cLove Your Beach - - my beach is Makaha\u201d or \u201cLove Your Beach - - my beach is Bondi\u201d, etc.) and to return funds to specific, local group actions at those beaches formed to remove trash, add benches, and any other number of meaningful contributions.\u00a0 If there\u2019s a beach, it needs to be loved!!3.\u00a0 How do \u201cBeachdude, Inc.\u201d clothes compare to other brands?\u00a0 Other than the fact that we\u2019re recognizable by our TIKI logo, the quality, colors and styles of our product will in and of themselves set us apart, as they have thus far.\u00a0 Most of the product we see at the beach town is virtually interchangeable from company to company; distinguishable only by the label.\u00a0 Not so with Beachdude.\u00a0 We have never taken our cues from what we already saw and already have a number of entirely distinguishable, embraceable products.4.\u00a0 Is TIKI ready for his close-up?\u00a0 YES!!\u00a0 We\u2019re intimate with the likes of the most well-respected, cutting edge Film School in the world at the University of Southern California and we\u2019re eager to put TIKI and his friends in front of the camera so we can show you what he\u2019s made of.\u00a0 His character elements of good intentions are mixed in with mischievousness, competitiveness, adventure and humor.\u00a0 The more you know him, the more you love him.\u00a0 Guaranteed.!\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Is this another \u201cone and done\u201d crowdfunding project?\u00a0 NOT by a longshot!!\u00a0 Not only do we have hundreds of recorded specs for garments and products (including styles, colors, textures; boys, girls, men, women; hats, shirts, shorts, jackets, pants; plans for an upscale & limited-production \u201cTiki Boutiki\u201d line; hard goods across the board; promo campaigns, additional TIKI characters, storylines, etc. etc. etc.), but we have an uncommon breadth to the concept.\u00a0 It\u2019s ambitious to conceive of clothing and licensed goods alongside film and/or video game product, but this is 2015 and there\u2019s no shortage of workforce talent and skill to involve with our company\u2019s aspirations.\u00a0 6.\u00a0 MORE STUFF you want to know?\u00a0 NO problem!\u00a0 Please send questions to Beachdude@beachdudeinc.com and we\u2019ll set you up.",
  "Salutations!\u00a0 This is Collin Stackhouse writing this here Kickstarter. My band, Stackhouse & The Garden, has made a really wonderful record. Truly, it is the best creative work I have ever done, and I certainly did not do it alone. The last thing left to do is to share it, and to continue to create more visual art around this project. In summer 2019, I finally got the nerve to ask some musicians that I truly admire to come together with me on an album. Emily Anderson (from Fairbanks AK / Los Angeles CA), Erin Esses (from Mission Viejo CA / Bellingham WA) and Julay Brooks (from Portland OR) live over a combined distance of 1200 miles... but I wanted them in my band.\u00a0 Coordinating a time when we could all be together took some effort. We found a week in September 2019 when we could all be together. On the Monday of that week, those mutual friends of mine met, shared a meal, and began putting their faith in me and this album. We arranged 10 songs, practiced 12+ hours a day, filmed a music video, and recorded an album in a week. These humans trusted in my songwriting enough to give me a week of their life, lend me their talents, and listen to me direct them non-stop. It was exhausting and incredible. \"Hottest Summer Yet\" is a folk-pop Americana modern-edge old-time feeling live studio record. Ten original songs, near constant three-part harmonies, and a soaring string section. There are songs about new love. Songs about burning down the establishment, and getting over your stage fright. Songs about death, and songs about deserving life. Songs about dating apps, and the horrors of climate change.\u00a0 We truly try to cover all the bases. We hope you like it.\u00a0",

  "Hello lovely music supporters! I have just finished my third album \"Coffee At The Corner Bar\" after working tirelessly on it for about nine months! \u00a0Some songs have thankfully already been played on the likes of 6 Music (thank you, Gideon Coe!) and many other awesome radio stations and shows! \u00a0There's even a co-write with my friend Matthew Caws (Nada Surf) and a cover of one of my favorite songs \"The Book Of Love\" by The Magnetic Fields. I self-funded the entire recording, mixing, mastering and pressing of the CDs but I really would love to press vinyl, too! \u00a0Unfortunately it's a bit costly for me to do it all by myself, so this is where you can come in! If you are a vinyl lover and like my music (and if you haven't heard it, please check it out), this is a way that we can work together to make my vinyl dreams come true. Just imagine - my new album can be spinning right round, baby right round like a record... oh wait... that's already a song! Thank you for humoring me and reading this! I hope you will join me on this hip-retro-awesome-recordy journey and we can make this vinyl happen!",

We recorded the album in three locations: Montreal, QC, Conquerall mills, Nova Scotia and An Tobar, Tobermory, Isle of Mull with Gordon Maclean. The album marks a significant point in the bands development, celebrating the 2 year anniversary of Peter, Karine and Ewans beautiful friendship and working relationship. A particularly special feature and addition to the music is the art work by Jericho Sanderson Knight, contributing her stellar talent to create visual representations for each song.",
  "\u00a0COVID-19 was initially reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. One year after the outbreak, the pandemic is still wide spreading. Nowadays, no matter it is flu or COVID-19, people are more cautious. You may ask questions like how \u00a0to sterilize your face mask and cutlery, how to touch anything safely and how to sanitize surrounding air when you are taking public transport. \u00a0 There are so many UV products and Ionizers. We have doubts about their efficacy. We therefore conduct our own bacteria test and invent G-Flash. Our sanitizer includes multi-functions and is small and wearable. Most important, it is effective and affordable. Forgive us some of the pictures used in the document are taken with prototypes. We just disclosed the production outlook of G-flash, a beautiful matte black version, The difference are shown below: G-Flash is the world 's smallest multi-purpose air purifier and sanitizer that embraced Plasma, UVC, Ozone, copper \u00a0technologies. \u00a0As a hygiene kit, it helps to clean the surrounding air and sterilize personal items. Disclaimer: This product does NOT claim to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent an illness or condition. The reason why G-Flash has combined three sanitizing technologies is because none of these technologies is prefect. But they can be work in a complementary way and make it better than ever. To sterilize mask with just UVC light will not 100% work because when a mask is folded, light could not reach inner surface of a mask. Moreover, the power of UVC drops significantly at far end. It will cause uneven sterilization due to the location of light source. To overcome this problem, G-Flash use ozone to complement with UVC. Ozone gas can penetrate any mask fibric and there is no dead corner. The UVC/Ozone mode run with a 15 min program which is sufficient to sanitize the mask. This mode make use of pros of both technologies. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7595067/ Just wear G-flash around your neck and switch on. \u00a0Unlike traditional ionizer, it turns water moisture into both hydroxide (OH) negative ion and hydrogen (H) positive ions. The ion plasma technology has been well used for commercial and domestic air purifier but they are usually big. We have miniaturized it , make it portable and wearable. Below products are all use plasma technology \u00a0Pansonic air con with Plasma ion\u00a0 \u00a0Sharp plasma air purifier\u00a0 \u00a0Samsung plasma air purifier\u00a0 \u00a0LG neo plasma air con\u00a0 Most UVC sanitizers on the market offers one UVC LED, G-flash is equipped with 3 UVC and 7 UVA LED. With 3 UVC LED we can increase the light coverage and eliminate any shadow zone, G-flash can effectively sterilize your personal belonging such as \u00a0face mask, phone, earbuds, earring, cosmetic brushes, cutlery or tableware etc. Removes odor with Ozone in enclosed space such as refrigerator, kitchen cabinet, and shoe cabinet and under the sink. Researches show with the present of Ozone, food in refrigerator can preserve for a longer period.\u00a0 It allows you to avoid direct contact with public areas such as the doorbell, buttons in ATM, and elevator and minimize the chance of infection. Besides, we deliberately use pure copper in our design because is it well known that germs will disintegrate on copper surface. \u00a0Hygiene hand function is cleverly designed to use with touch screen. \u00a0 G-Flash and G-Flash Mini had gone through rigorous bacteria tests using 3M\u2122 petrifilm\u2122 \u00a0to make sure they work as expected.\u00a0Visit 3M website and find out how we do the experiment: \u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am30Tq1BT4g\u00a0 G-Flash can also be put into a bag or a box, to sterilizer personal items in a pre-program 15 minutes process. You can make use of any sandwiches bag/cosmetic bag and turn them into a sterilizing enclosure. Any items inside the bag/box/ drawer can be sanitized by UV light as well as by ozone gases. Use one button to switch the different mode of operations G-Flash is a 4-in-1 device. Battery charging time is less than 1 hr. G-Flash Mini is a 3-in-1 device. Battery charging time is about 1 hr. It has a \u00a0built-in electronic lock to avoid mistakenly turning on UVC and Ozone odor removing mode. You may consider to take Gflash with you when you go to the following places. \u00a0G-Flash is available in two size\u00a0:G-Flash\u00a0and G-Flash Mini \u00a0Both G-Flash and G-Flash Mini will be available in below four different colors We will do the laser engraving for you. \u00a0Leave us the name, message or pattern that you want to put onto the G-Flash or G-Flash Mini, to turn your units to be the unique one in the world! \u00a0 As a giveaway to our backer, \u00a0we include a beautiful necklace to match with G-Flash matte black color. The necklace itself worth over US10 2020 was the year of the pandemic and the entire world suffered great losses from COVID-19. With 2021, hope is rising once again in the humanity, and to strengthen that hope, we make the world\u2019s smallest air purifier and sterilizer to keep the people safe in these dangerous times. \u00a0The device was originally developed for our family use and later we realize it will be good to let more people use it. We are a small team of engineers in Hong Kong with over 10 years in R&D and manufacturing experience. We put every effort in engineering a good and functional product. A product that is maintenance free, easy to operate, powerful to sterilize air/personal items and it must be safe for kids. We decide to offer G-Flash and G-Flash mini at extreme low price for this period. (You will not find a similar product ever in this price range.) We aim at making it affordable to mass majority. Every money we spent are paid for product development, testing and manufacturing. NO FANCY VIDEO. \u00a0FEW ADS. It is solely the products and its features we emphasis.

  "Yes, face masks have become a necessity\u2014but most face masks are so poorly designed, that they don\u2019t actually make a big difference. So, what if there was a perfectly fitting, no-fogging, partly washable and reusable, and partly replaceable, face mask that helped to keep you safer and comfortable\u2014being independently certified to offer the best possible results? A bend of effectiveness and convenience with a touch of sustainability. That\u2019s one way of describing the Replaceable Silicone Face Mask, the ultimate face mask that is made from edible soft food grade non-toxic, odorless, tasteless, and ergonomic silica gel. This is the face mask that you can wash, disinfect with hot water at high temperature, and safely and comfortably wear for a long time. And, when you feel it\u2019s time to change it, you\u2019ll be relieved to know that this face mask is recyclable! While it effectively serves its purpose for several days, once it has fulfilled its mission, this filter can be discarded in an environmentally-friendly way without compromising the entire mask\u2014which only requires a new Special Filter to go on protecting you just as you need it to. The Replaceable Silicone Face Mask comes with a temporarily reusable filter\u2014which can be reused for several days\u2014which is also replaceable and recyclable. Two things you want in a face mask: that it is fully sealed to keep you safer and that it feels comfortable, nevertheless. Yes, you guessed it: those masks that make you feel like your eyes are staring at a foggy scenario aren't exactly excellent.\u00a0 The Face Mask as a fully sealed face frame design that softly fits your face as if it was hugging it. While it offers a 100% fully sealed protection which includes the nose and wing parts, which allow for no air leakage to occur, they do prevent the eyes from the typical foggy scenario, increasing breathing space, and being comfort-friendly. For real. Face masks are a necessity, but they\u2019ve also become an everyday accessory that shouldn\u2019t just be functional. That\u2019s why we\u2019re offering you the Face Mask in multiple colors that you can choose from: light blue, light pink, gray, ivory, and phantom black. Oh, and the face mask design per se looks very nice as well! Just like the song goes. Breathe freely and comfortably with no discomfort, no asphyxia-like symptoms, no face overheating for lack of proper ventilation, and no fans. Just breathe in, breathe out, and feel safer.\u00a0 \u00a0These should not be mutually exclusive, but sadly almost every face mask doesn\u2019t let you speak clearly and be easily understood. That\u2019s not the case of our Face Mask, though, because its special cylindrical air hole, designed under the acoustic air hole design principle, allows you to clearly speak and be heard.\u00a0 We\u2019re also proud to say that our very special mask has been independently lab-tested and certified under the world\u2019s most important standards for face masks. Specifically, the worldwide-reputed and ISO 17025 accredited Swiss SGS Laboratories have independently tested and certified the Face Mask under the ISO 17025 standard, in this case for our mask\u2019s passive air filters, which have been tested in accordance with EN 149-2001 and with A1-2009 standards, and also under the UL1598 CRD standard, which, again, means that there will be no UV light leakage. The Face Mask and the peace of mind it will offer you is such a big deal, that we want to be clear about what exactly will contain the package you\u2019ll get in the mail.",

It is more efficient, produces less heat and weighs less than a traditional charger. \u00a0 With this large amount of output, the charger produces a much faster-charging speed. Within 30 minutes, this charger can charge a Samsung S20 Ultra up to 75%. It is 4x quicker than the iPhone 5W charger, and charges an iPhone 11 Pro Max to 20% within 10 minutes and up to 60% within 30 minutes. Having several accessories can take up a lot of space and can easily get tangled into a mess. Using an all-in-one charger takes up the least amount of space while providing the most efficiency. They are simpler to use and can power multiple devices simultaneously from a single power outlet when outlets are limited.\u00a0 Together with the glue filling technology, its heat dissipation capability is maximized. It is compatible with a wide range of modern electronic devices. You can replace all of your conventional chargers with just one DuoX GaN 120W Charger. Don't worry about if your laptop does NOT charge with USB-C, we have prepared some small USB-C adapters below. The USB-C adapters will be made available to backers as part of the final shipping confirmation survey. \u00a0Loopingtech is an electronic consumption brand focusing on producing the newest semiconductor materials, Gallium nitride. Loopingtech was founded in 2020 by a group of tech geeks who wanted to create the greatest GaN products. Most of us have working experience in Intel, DJI.\u00a0 We designed, developed, and manufactured the smallest 65W GaN charger in only 3 MONTHS, which makes us a competitive player in the GaN chargers market. Our next record-breaking product, a 120W GaN fast charger is finally here.\u00a0",
  "In only 24 hours, your incredible generosity has put over the line on my initial goal. \u00a0I'm so very humbled, and I truly cannot thank you enough. \u00a0As I mentioned, it was a hard decision to launch this campaign in the midst of such fear & hardship for so many people, and I decided at the outset to reduce my goal from the $20,000 it will actually take to fully complete all the tasks & get people paid, to a modest $5K just to get it rolling. \u00a0While we have hit our initial goal, our new goal is to raise $15K by April 17th, both to complete this record and to help our new family through this crisis. \u00a0For anyone still interested in contributing or pre-ordering the record & lending a hand, your support & assistance at any level is still greatly needed, and tremendously appreciated, especially during this time. Any funds above and beyond the original goal will go to mixing the record, mastering, manufacturing, producing videos, photographers & artists for record art, and the promotion it will take to get the record heard in the world. \u00a0It also includes going back & paying some of the individuals who donated their time & talents, and who have now lost significant sources of their income. \u00a0 All that to say that if you're someone who's just arriving here, and still feel able & willing to contribute, trust that your support is still needed, and will go to lifting up this entire musical community around this record.\u00a0 Thank you so kindly, David March 15th, 2020 Hello Dear Friends, Family, & Loved Ones,\n\n \u00a0\u00a0So very much has changed since I first planned to launch this Kickstarter and bring you the good news of my forthcoming new record \"Room Enough, Time Enough\". \u00a0\u00a0Now, by the hour, we're gripped further & further with concern and fear for the ones we love, our little worlds showing their connection to the world at large. To everyone who has been affected directly by this virus, my heart goes out to you - please remember, your friends, families, and neighbors are here to come to your aid at a moment's notice.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In times of pervasive need, it can be difficult to ask for help. Perhaps you've seen the postings from musicians who have already lost significant sources of vital income in a profession that relies upon crowds to survive. \u00a0I'm one of them, and together we're just a tiny segment of all those who will be pushed into positions of need from this event. \u00a0For months now, I have been planning this new record, and the Kickstarter that would hopefully make it possible, and I questioned launching it at all in lieu of recent developments. \u00a0But then I remembered very clearly exactly what has gotten me and my loved ones through the most difficult events of our lives: \u00a0art + music. \u00a0So while I have altered my plans for the full-scale campaign to fund all aspects of this project, I have decided to begin the process of making this music available, by taking pre-orders through Kickstarter, and open up the channels and circuits where your support can allow me to offer you something in return that may help our hearts through this terribly difficult time.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This fall, my partner and I received the unsurpassable news that we would be bringing our first child into the world this March. \u00a0Amidst the incredible excitement, I knew I had a sliver of time during our brief stay in Tucson, AZ to capture this batch of new songs before our whole universe shifted. \u00a0The whirlwind of recent developments has changed all of this considerably, and factually speaking, now has us entering these monumental changes during a crisis that is a direct hit on my livelihood. \u00a0\u00a0While the situation has the effect of swelling the heart of empathy for the most vulnerable, it also raises a white flag at home for how to navigate caring for this new life in real time.\n\nFor those of you who are able and looking for ways to step in and support the artists & musicians who help you make it through your days, I would like to offer you a way to keep things moving forward by contributing at any modest level to this Kickstarter, chipping in at any amount, and helping me bring this record to a place where it can do the world some good. \u00a0\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Records are expensive; it would take $20,000 to properly fund this whole operation. \u00a0I set my goal at much less, to get you something sooner than later, and to meet the challenges of this world-wide moment with hope and optimism. \u00a0To be certain, any and all funds above and beyond the initial goal will go to pay and lift up the entire musical community around this project - from musicians & players, to engineers, studio costs, mixing, mastering, videographers, photographers & artists who are helping make it happen, and who are all hurting at this time. \u00a0While this is definitely about generosity, it isn't about charity; I want to offer you what I have created in this record pre-order, and in the meantime I have a gorgeous collection of photos, videos, demos, artwork and merch that I would love to share with you as a respite in the coming weeks.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Tom Waits once said, when the world cracks in half we need doctors much worse than songwriters; but if there's any way my songs or music can help you during this time, if I can cover a favorite song of yours, if I can write a song from your story - contact me (david@davidhuckfelt.com) I'll gladly do anything I can. \u00a0And if your world is shaken enough already from this calamity, please consider this a love note to say the rest of us have your back. \u00a0And if you're stuck at home with time on your hands and want to dive into the beautiful story of this record, the who/where/what & why, it's all at this link & below for your perusal.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the day, if music can't help us through difficult times, what good is it at all?\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peace to you, and thank you for your precious time, from the top to the bottom of the heart... \n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0David\u00a0 \u00a0When the world's on fire, and the seeds of division are sown throughout the land, it's music + ceremony that have always held a sacred space for healing and renewal. \u00a0\"Room Enough, Time Enough\", my second full-length solo record and the follow-up to 2019's \"Stranger Angels\", is a record about restoring balance: \u00a0space and attention, peace and quiet, redeeming the marginalized and remembering the forgotten. \u00a0It's a new expression of the ancient ritual and power of songs to weave a web of resilience and protection over our land, our loves, and our resistance. \u00a0It's a brand new vision I have laid the groundwork for, and I need your help to bring it through to completion! I have just finished initial recording down in Tucson, AZ for my second full-length record, \"Room Enough, Time Enough\", the follow-up to 2019's \"Stranger Angels\", and for the first time, I'm humbly asking for your support to help me finish this record and bring it into the world. \u00a0I assembled a lightning-strike crew of Tucson friends, strangers, artists, outlaws, cowboys, and Native musicians, together in one room for the event of making this album, and in a five day flurry captured the foundations and essence of what will become \"Room Enough, Time Enough\". \u00a0If the impetus and inspiration for new songs is the heavy-lifting of spirit work, it's the monumental task of bringing it all together logistically and financially that I'm humbly asking for your help with, to build a bigger tent and a longer table to all those who helped bring these songs to life. \u00a0Twelve years of touring and recording with my band The Pines has shown me that there is no substitute for being in the physical presence of someone who knows how to give themselves over to a song. \u00a0Opening for legends like Emmylou Harris, Mavis Staples, Rosanne Cash, & Greg Brown to bands like Bon Iver, Arcade Fire, & Calexico reveals the same message: \u00a0passion, minus ego, plus presence, equals transcendence. \u00a0\u00a0No technology can stand in for people together in a room, in person and in real time. \u00a0So for this record I called upon Tucson producer / songwriter / & multi-instrumentalist Gabriel Sullivan to assemble his Mother Higgins Band and open up Dust + Stone Studios to a host of friends & contemporaries: Ojibwe ambassador of Native Americana music Keith Secola, Tucson's own living songwriting legend and big-hearted ex-convict Billy Sedlmayr, Giant Sand founder and head purveyor of the southwestern electric-fuzz border sound Howe Gelb; former Bob Dylan drummer Winston Watson, Arizona Blues Hall of Fame harmonica player Tom Walbank, Danish jazz bassist Th\u00f8ger Lund, and utility members of Calexico Connor Gallaher on pedal steel and Jon Villa on trumpet. \u00a0Together with the unmatched vocal chants of John Trudell's constant collaborator & Warm Springs Nation Native singer Quiltman, these songs found their people and vice versa in a perfect storm of generosity. \u00a0There are no truths but stories, and records are collections of stories that at their birth are fastened firmly to geography in a place and time. \u00a0While \"Stranger Angels\" was written in the mighty northern waters of Lake Superior just a handful of miles from Canada, \"Room Enough, Time Enough\" was created in the borderlands of southern Arizona, the high Sonoran Desert just a handful of miles from the Mexican border. \u00a0The Sonoran Desert is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth, and it's music is like that too; singular and rare, timeless and older than the concept of America. \u00a0I'm so humbled to have been so warmly received into this rich and new musical community. \u00a0\u00a0Aside from featuring a brand new batch of my original compositions written this winter in the borderlands, this record focuses on what my friend Keith Secola likes to call \"the marginal creatures\", the extraordinary & strange beings at the fringe of our fields of vision, on the outskirts of the frame, off the internet and growing like wild, endangered flowers on the edge of the garden. Songs are like that too, and for this record I chose to elevate some songs and songwriters out on the fringes of the mainstream musical ecosystem. \u00a0Secola's hidden gem / healing song \"Book of Life\" is covered here for the first time, as is Lakota / South Dakota unsung Native American music hero Buddy Red Bow's song \"Journey To the Spirit World\". \u00a0Billy Sedlmayr, a man who knows more than most about outlaws and redemption and I re-wrote a public domain ballad both old and post-modern called \"Cole Younger\". \u00a0And a deep-cut track from Patti Smith's debut record Easter makes an appearance here as well, \"Ghost Dance\", infused with new perspective from an Indigenous point of view with vocals by Secola & Quiltman.\u00a0 Song Titles:\u00a0 $5000 - most basic needs to finish production & tracking on the record & deliver digital version for download & streaming $10,000 - this stretch goal is the minimum required to finish the record and create physical vinyl & CD's along with paying fairly the players, producers, engineers, & artists who contributed. \u00a0We may not get here right now, but if we do this is where the funds will go. $15,000 & beyond - anything and everything raised above and beyond the initial goal will go a long, long way toward all the additional essentials associated with getting new music seen & heard. \u00a0This includes the integral aspects of funding and creating music videos and artwork, manufacturing vinyl, paying for publicity and promotion of a new release on-line, in print, & radio, \u00a0and the hefty costs of promoting and executing the touring that will bring this music to you live & in-person. Having already completed basic tracking in Tucson, the list of tasks and skillful means needed to make this an actual, fully formed record ready for the world are ample, and mostly involve me collaborating with highly-skilled musicians, engineers, artists, designers, video makers, photographers and manufacturers. \u00a0These steps are like final negotiations in a peace treaty, every one of them significant to the survival of the project and each one an opportunity to pay someone a fair wage for their professional, timely work. \u00a0I have no record label, no outside funding, and your support is absolutely crucial to this record becoming a living, breathing entity in the world. With your help, I will shepherd this record through the phases of completion by working with this stunning team of collaborators throughout the spring:",

  "LEE JEFFRIES:PORTRAITS From the very beginning, Lee has dreamed about self publishing a book of his portraits. In the years it has taken to produce the project, the book has been regarded as the final and most important aspect, one that has taken a great deal of consideration. For this reason, despite his first book, \u201cLost Angels, being published, Lee has chosen to self-publish the \u201cLee Jeffries:Portraits\u201d book in a manner that will fully reflect the attention to detail that is so key in his work. His close relationship with his international fan base has fuelled a sense of responsibility in producing something truly special, which has led to an exciting collaboration with esteemed French book designers Hemeria. Within the book there will be selected anecdotes which describe the emotions and stories of the subjects, delving deeper into the lives of the unseen. \u201cThe book will be a 240 page, hard back, coffee table book.\u201d The \u201cLee Jeffries:Portraits\u201d Book will be presented in just one option, the \u201cStandard First Edition\u201d book. The production will take place in Germany, and will be overseen personally by Lee. The pre-orders generated by this Kickstarter campaign will initially be the only way for the public to own a first edition copy, and have it delivered in time for Christmas 2019. It will initially not be available in any stores or online, and can only be produced with your help by reaching its target goal. STANDARD FIRST EDITION BOOK - Foreword by Hollywood Star \"Josh Brolin\" Josh Brolin has kindly offered to write the foreword for Lee as Josh is a big fan of Lee's work.

The book will be signed by Lee and he'll add a signed print (50cm x 50cm) of your choice. It is beautifully presented in a black cloth clamshell box. Lee Jeffries leads a double life \u2013 as a full-time accountant near Manchester, and in his free time as an impassioned photographer of the homeless all over the world. A self-taught photographer who started out taking pictures of stock in a bike shop, his epiphany came in April 2008 when, on the eve of running the London Marathon, he snatched a long-lens image of a homeless girl huddling in a doorway, and felt compelled to apologise to her when she called him out for it. Their resulting conversation changed not only his approach to photography; it changed his life. Since that day Lee has been on a mission to raise awareness of the homeless. His work features street people from the UK, Europe and the US whom he gets to know by living rough with them, the relationship between them enabling him to capture a searing intimacy and authenticity in his portraits. He has published a critically acclaimed fund-raising book, Lost Angels, worked with the Salvation Army in Sweden and Seattles Union Gospel Mission on major fund raising campaigns, and donated the half-dozen cameras he's won in prestigious imaging competitions to charity. His images are donated for the use of numerous Charites worldwide. He estimates he's given thousands of pounds of his own money to help those he photographs. Lee uses light and shadow in a religious way \u2013 his images have been described as 'religious iconography', and it's not an accident. A few years ago he went to Rome to get a rosary blessed at the Vatican for a friend's dying mother; she's now buried with it. He describes it as probably the first entirely selfless act of his life and something he was driven to do. That experience had a huge effect on the way he viewed people, images, photography. He took pieces of that experience, and he explains how it informs everything he\u2019s become, both artistically and as a man. Feeling love on a completely different level, ultimately, led to extended periods of loneliness. He began to go out onto the streets to seek refuge from it. When he meets homeless people, he can recognise that same loneliness in somebody's eyes, and that becomes the starting point for their relationship. His images become the final piece of that journey. The act of saying goodbye. Lee Jeffries\u2019 series of portraits, is an ongoing project, which has won international awards, with over 335,000 followers on it\u2019s social media. It has been extensively featured throughout the world achieving a viral status online, and has been published by prestigious names such as Time Magazine, CNN, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, BBC Newsnight, to name but a few. Lee\u2019s work has also been featured in Terrence Malick\u2019s Voyage of Time and Jennifer Lopez\u2019s movie \u201cSecond Act\u201d. Notwithstanding that, Lee\u2019s work has been an inspiration for thousands of people across the world.\u00a0 \u201cI am an Oscar and Emmy winning makeup-artist. Some of my recent movie credits include both Deadpool films, Kong: Skull Island, Foxcatcher, and Blade Runner 2049. I have been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 2004 and have served on the Academy\u2019s Science and Technology Council, Preservation and History Board Committee, and Makeup Artists and Hairstylists Branch - as both governor and chair of its executive committee. I also founded the Digital Makeup Group (DMG) which uses cutting edge technology in creating computer generated (CG) beauty work, age manipulation, and digital make-up effects. My expertise is helping actors become the characters that the script requires them to be, which will then be seen by millions of people around the world in high-definition on the big screen. My work has to be spot on, not only to warrant the many nominations and awards it has received, but also because it plays a crucial role in the commercial success of big-budget Hollywood films. I am constantly on the look-out for inspiration for my work, and Lee Jeffries photographs have been that inspiration for me. I\u2019ve used Lee\u2019s photographs as reference for characters and to inspire and influence actors on films, his photographs are that complex. His amazing photo\u2019s of \u201cBrittany\u201d was my inspiration for Nicole Kidman\u2019s makeup for Destroyer, which critics say is the best work this Academy Award winner has done and even brought her a Golden Globe nomination. Lee Jeffries is one of those rare artists that other artists look to, not only for creative inspiration, but also for what humanity looks like, the highs and the lows. Lee is a universal talent, the type of talent.. Not only is his work exceptional, but he uses it improve the lives of the most downtrodden of society, working closely with the Salvation Army, Seattle\u2019s Union Gospel Mission, and other social groups to shed light on the lives of the most poverty-stricken amongst us.\u201d Bill Corso Delivery dates: The first edition run will be shipped in December, planned to be delivered to EU addresses before Christmas.

  "Hello - we are S\u00f8ren and Anders. Both of us are passionate cargo bike riders. Our bicycles are key to our daily lives in Copenhagen. Bringing the kids. Going to work. And getting home from the wine bar. We have been involved in Svajerl\u00f8bet for the past 8 years. S\u00f8ren arranging and organizing, and Anders documenting with his photography.\u00a0 Our bicycle culture in Copenhagen is well know all over the world. We want to tell the story about the rebirth of a historic event, that formed our city to what it is today. The rebirth of a bicycle movement. Svajerl\u00f8b - Danish Cargo Bike Championships is the annual cargo bike race event in Copenhagen, based on the traditional Svajerl\u00f8b for bike\u00a0messengers between 1930s and 1960. We want to tell the story through Anders' photographs from the past 8 years of the modern version of Svajerl\u00f8bet. S\u00f8ren will write the stories.\u00a0 We want to do a proper offset printed book. No digital prints here kiddos. The publishing industry might use the phrase \"Coffee table book\". Since you people are out biking, this will be a book for you to bring with you on your cargo bike. Into the woods. Out to the sea. With your coffee. Just you and this book. That is why you need to back this project. Talking about the publishing world. We will bypass that phase and do it all by ourselves. This means that this release - if funded, most likely will be a \"one off\", and logically a very limited opportunity for you to lay down your wrench, and get this book in your greasy oily hands. If you join this project, and we succeed with a funding, you will be a huge part of writing cargo bike history. It is very simple. If you join us - you get a book. Right at your doorstep. There is a slight discount if you choose to get two books. And then you can choose a book and a signed print for your bedroom wall. If you are a stockist, have a bike shop or an artzy cafe and want to sell our book, please contact us for chat and we let's discuss the options. The fine graphic designers at Ruby&Red http://rubyandred.com are on board to create this magnificent offset open spine four color printed book for you. They have done the test layouts you see in the film and also below. No guarantees that this will be the finished layout. See it as an appetizer. Don't worry Kevin - we won't leave your fine \"one hour world record on a cargo bike holder\" face out. If this funding succeeds, our summer holidays will seriously be affected. But hey - who needs warm sand and cold Pina Coladas, when you can sit inside and make a book about weird people on cargo bikes? We do this project out of pure love. Love for all the fine people who every year joins us in making Svajerl\u00f8bet what it is. Locals and from abroad. You are amazing. If you want to know more about our real lives here it goes:",
  "Chicago is known as one of the most segregated cities in the country \u2014 and that disconnect can sow prejudice, fear, and misunderstandings. I decided to explore that segregation through photography and video with my \u00a0\u201cFolded Map\u201d project that brings people from opposite ends of the same street, in different neighborhoods, to meet and get to know one another.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My whole life has led up to the \u201cFolded Map\u201d project. I grew up in Chicago's South Side neighborhood, Englewood; attended Lane Technical College Prep High School on the North Side while still living in Englewood; later, I moved to Chicago's North Side neighborhood, Edgewater, for a while, then returned to Englewood where I still live now. So I've experienced of the city\u2019s segregation and resulting disparities between North and South Side neighborhoods firsthand. My lifelong observations motivated me to create \"Folded Map,\" which is a visual investigation of Chicago\u2019s communities, using its grid map system to identify mirroring points of the city and directly compare photographs and videos of North and South Side blocks, such as the 6900 block of North Ashland in Rogers Park and the 6900 block of South Ashland in West Englewood. I just wanted to reveal this inequity and being an artist and a photographer, I thought of a way that would be visually captivating for people to understand how Chicago\u2019s legacy of segregation has impacted the neighborhoods today.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, Folded Map is exhibited at Loyola University Museum of Art (LUMA) through October 20th and has been featured in: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My goal is to widely expand the scope of Folded Map by interviewing 12 more \u201cmap twins\u201d and create a permanent digital home for Folded Map, which will endure as a tool to critically examine American cities from a new perspective. I believe it is important for this project to exist beyond a brick-and-mortar location (such as LUMA) and have an online presence because all of the issues and inequities highlighted in this Chicago-based project also exist in other urban areas.\u00a0 To achieve its full potential, I need your help to create a customized website for Folded Map that can support its multimedia elements as well as beautifully juxtapose the images of featured resident pairs, also known as \"map twins.\" Photographing more address pairs, interviewing residents, taking their portraits and creating a Folded Map website will take time, more efficient equipment, and financial support. $13,000 is the bare minimum I need to continue.\u00a0Just click on the video above or see the sidebar to the right to get the full breakdown of the gifts you will receive as a supporter of Folded Map's future.\u00a0 Below are a few essential items your contributions will help me secure: \u00a0 All funds OVER my goal will still go toward the continued production of Folded Map & its reward costs, plus help me build seed capital for expanding the reach of its future iterations and creation of a Folded Map curriculum.\u00a0",
  "We're a team of software developers, psychologists, creatives and writers who have joined forces to create a mental health app by the people, for the people!

Struggling to meet\u00a0the high demand,\u00a0she turned to co-founder and long-time friend Lydia Chatziioannou for a solution. Lydia\u00a0came up with the idea of a mobile app designed to help people improve their mental health and well-being by completing simple everyday tasks. Have a look at our website here MindTheApp has one mission:\u00a0to support users in their journey towards self-recovery and\u00a0a more fulfilling life.

So we need as much help as possible to make this second album happen. \u00a0Have a look at the rewards, there's something for everyone :) River Roots are a nomadic musician couple. \u00a0We live in a campervan as it's the best way to continue this journey and keep the music flowing to the people :) \u00a0Since travelling Australia back in 2012, our minds were opened to different ways of living life. We were inspired to begin to live a life that we wanted. \u00a0Music found us on our journey, and sparked by the beautiful open road and good vibes our flow of creative writing was ignited.\u00a0 We have catapulted our way into the UK festival scene the past few years. \u00a0Some festivals include: Glastonbury, Boomtown Fair, Beat-herder, Green Gathering, Into The Wild, Buddhafield, Boardmasters, Eden, GoldCoast Ocean, Small World, Something To Smile About, Wilderness Gathering, Stonehenge Solstice, Soul Circus, Audio Farm.

  "Most touring shows that come to your town are music, music, music ...\nBut just imagine a show unlike any other you will ever see.  Imagine a show that features a rockstar, a horn guy, a comedian, a performance artist, an illusionist, and an evangelist - a collection of world class performers under one roof, during one show, with one vision.  Though the Freak Show will entertain you and make you laugh and think, this show is an evangelistic outreach program like no other our country has ever seen! We need YOUR help. \u00a0We set a goal of $50,000, but we believe the vision God has given us will take $250,000+ to really make it happen! \u00a0The way Kickstarter works is this: we only receive the money if we reach our goal of $50,000 (and we also get everything above our goal as well). \u00a0If we fall short of the $50,000 goal by the end of our deadline, then your credit card is never charged and we do not receive any of your generous gifts. We believe with $50,000 we could start tour dates right away. \u00a0With $50,000 we would be able to purchase the backdrops, staging, a trailer, publicity materials, a drum kit, and a keyboard, etc. \u00a0 This is just the bare bones of what we would need to get started. \u00a0This would limit the tour to churches who had the appropriate stage size, lighting, sound equipment, etc. \u00a0We would love to show up at each church or arena with our own equipment! \u00a0That is where the $250,000+ comes in! \u00a0With your help, we could purchase all the necessary items needed to roll up to any community with our own trucks, trailers, staging, lighting, sound equipment and one-of-a- kind stage illusions that would create a must see buzz! We believe shows like America's Got Talent are popular for a reason. \u00a0People love variety acts, with all their diversity, that relate to anyone from kids to grandparents.\u00a0 You will agree, The Freak Show is unlike any other show you have ever seen. You will be impressed with the music and amazed at the large paintings (created with bare hands in just a matter of minutes). The horn guy will astound you and the comedian will make you laugh. The illusionist will mystify you and the evangelist will share the best news mankind has ever heard! Be ready to laugh and smile and cry and rejoice! This collection of world class performers will bring A SHOW UNLIKE ANY OTHER.\u00a0  Imagine this show coming to your city, your town, your church, your local arena. Everyone you know will be curious to come check it out, and so will you!\u00a0 Newspapers and local TV stations will be talking about it and Christians will be excited to invite their unchurched friends!\u00a0 And during the 3+ hour show, everyone will laugh like never before and be blown away by the talent - but most of all they will be BLOWN AWAY by the life changing message of salvation through Jesus Christ! This tour is not just about viewing talents on stage, but it's about JESUS and seeing hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide surrender to an Almighty God. \u00a0 Will you prayerfully consider being a part of one of the most amazing outreach tours to ever cross America, and the world? We appreciate your prayers and financial partnership.\u00a0 Thank you!",

  "Remarkable Lives is a project that serves older people and puts them first, helping to change society's perceptions of later life. Through the powerful medium of photographic storytelling, I hope to offer a refreshing perspective of their lives, rolling back the years to celebrate their most memorable moments as seen through their eyes, told in their own words, remembered through their old photographs. Giving later life its voice, the project tells the untold stories, capturing living memory accounts of history because everyone has a story to tell: the home maker, the farmer, the factory worker, the teacher, the soldier, the nurse \u2013 whether ordinary individuals who have lived through history or the protagonists who helped shape it, all their lives are remarkable in some way, and to someone. I\u2019m Owen McNeir, founder of Remarkable Lives, and I\u2019m on a mission to encourage everyone to reconnect across the generations, to share stories, preserve photographs and save memories.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nI started this project to encourage us to look closer, try to think differently about old age, because we\u2019re so absorbed in our own, busy worlds that we switch off thoughts of later life. \r\n\r\nMy motivation comes from very personal reasons too, having discovered aspects of my grandparents\u2019 lives that I\u2019d never known, after they\u2019d gone and too late to retrieve the memories.\u00a0 I created the Remarkable Lives photo-blog\u00a0to celebrate later life stories for others, to produce a lasting, permanent memory for families, and to open a window on the past, giving older people a renewed identity, dignity and meaning.\u00a0 Every day, I set out with my camera, voice recorder and curiosity to meet and interview people, often in their own homes, also in care homes, hospices and community centres. We sit together and I listen to their stories, take their picture and scan their old photographs, from which I produce short life-story moments.  The stories, easily accessible online, are also designed to help those who care for older people to better understand and connect with them. Carers and nurses are rushed off their feet, so Remarkable Lives provides a quick to read, personal history to help them form a picture of the individual in one click. Care homes who have participated in Remarkable Lives even add the stories to their residents' Care Plans, all of which is resulting in improved staff satisfaction.\u00a0 It's a privilege and an inspiration to listen to stories from the 1920s, 30s, 40s - sometimes even from 100 years ago - to imagine what people have lived through and to record authentic accounts first hand, from a time in history pre-social media and 24 hour news. Real life stories from a time that is rapidly disappearing. Stories like Derek's, pictured here aged 13 with his school friends in 1940: Who then decided, just two years later aged 15, to leave school and family and join the Merchant Navy and a life at sea...in the middle of the\u00a0Second World War: Who rose from the very bottom (literally, cleaning the oil in the tankers), through the ratings to become a first class Navigator as First Mate: Finally achieving his Master's Ticket to become a Master Mariner, a position allowing him to sail any ship of any size in any sea in the world. At 89, however, living in a care home with quite advanced dementia, Derek's is a story like so many I discover: a hidden memory yet so deserving to be told, celebrated and shared, not least so that those around him can truly understand and better appreciate the individual in their care.\u00a0 I hope you will join me on this journey, not just because I can\u2019t do it without your support (it\u2019s all or nothing with Kickstarter), but by sharing this project with your friends and family, you\u2019ll be part of this positive, progressive movement, helping to grow the Remarkable Lives community. A community that is not defined by old age and its associations with mental or physical decline, but by a new, fresh, invigorating perspective of later life and its place in our human narrative. Together, I think we can imagine a better future, by listening to the past. After all, we\u2019re not born old. So far, this project has been self-funded and, even though I've interviewed and photographed over 100 people in 18 months, its scope and reach have been limited.\u00a0 The \u00a315,000 that I hope to raise through this Kickstarter will help fund the project\u2019s expansion over the next 4 months and enable many more people to get involved and have their voices heard: I want everyone to take part in this positive movement that truly reflects the world we all live and grow older in, embracing the diversity of our ageing society.\u00a0 The funding from this campaign will go towards:\u00a0 Stretch goals If the funding goal is exceeded, I will be able to discover and tell even more stories of remarkable lives. Depending on how much we stretch, my ambitions include:\r\n\r\n But before any of that can happen, my first priority is to reach this campaign's funding target. In addition to the project's online presence through my blog and social media, this campaign aims to amplify the Remarkable Lives message through the rewards, while giving every supporter something special at each pledge level. The full list of REWARDS is on the right with lots of ideas for individuals and organisations, but here are some examples to give you a flavour; I hope you like them. The Postcard Set A set of 3 printed postcards featuring images & quotes from the Remarkable Lives project.\r\n\r\n\u00a0 The Wear Your Age with Pride Badge Pack A pack of 4 individual Remarkable Lives pin badges. \u00a0 \u00a0Book of Remarkable Lives: Untold Stories A signed copy of the inaugural Remarkable Lives: Untold Stories. \u00a0 The Remarkable Bundle \u00a0 Don't just take my word for it, here's what others are saying: \u201cWhat you are doing has such value and importance. It\u2019s things like this that make our world better and kind, putting humanity into statistics.\u201d Nicci Gerrard, Author & Founder of John\u2019s Campaign\r\n \u201cAt its heart Remarkable Lives is beautifully simple \u2013 collecting real-life stories and celebrating that older individuals are all remarkable and so much more than the stereotypes people often have.\u00a0But there\u2019s so much more to this.\u00a0The process of capturing the stories (which itself gives value to the lived experience and contact between the subject and Owen) has huge benefits to individuals, and sharing them has significant impact in changing wider societal perceptions of older people.\u00a0The emphasis moves on to their lives, experiences and skills and away from dependency and disability. What I particularly like is that Remarkable Lives reaches out to those often most excluded: the very old, those with dementia, and those living behind the doors of a care home.\u201d   Rob Fountain, Chief Executive, Age UK Gloucestershire\n \u201cI just wanted to say thank you so much for spending time with Mum over the last few weeks she has really enjoyed it and talks about it all the time.\u201d Anne. Daughter of Betty, 89. \u201cOwen\u2019s initiative to capture the lives of our residents has been an inspiration. Our residents have enjoyed fascinating and often challenging lives; being able to talk and share their past affords great joy. Owen is bridging the gap in understanding between the young and old, introducing families to revealing facts and insights for the first time \u2013 without Owen they would have been lost forever.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRemarkable Lives has strengthened our staff/resident relationships \u2013 we know them better and have a deeper understanding, adding even greater meaning and value to the care we provide.\u201d    Peter Gardiner, General Manager, The Hollies Care\n \u201cOwen seems to have the knack of bringing out the best in our residents. He talks to them calmly, listens with compassion and they respond to him with a smile on their faces. The stories are funny, exciting and sometimes sad but touching. We use Remarkable Lives in our care plans which all staff have access to, helping them\u00a0to better understand each person.\u201d   Diane Browning, Head of Activities, The Hollies Care \r\n\r\n\u201cOwen has made a huge difference to the lives of all our family. I met Owen and he was immediately interested in Alan, who has advanced Alzheimers, and told me how his project can help families of those with Alzheimers and other forms of dementia. I\u2019ve been delving into Alan's early life of which I had little knowledge and contacting old friends and relatives. This has been good for all of us. Everyone has a remarkable life, which should be made known to carers so that the elderly coping with Dementia can be afforded the dignity and respect they have dutifully earned.\u00a0Thank you Owen, we both feel that somebody really cares!\u201d Caroline Lumsden. Wife of Alan, 83.\r\n\r\n \u201cUnLtd is convinced that innovative social entrepreneurs like Owen hold the key to ageing well in the UK.\u00a0 We are delighted to have the opportunity to support him to increase and deepen the impact of Remarkable Lives.\u201d  Julie Carthy, Award Manager, UnLtd. The Remarkable\u00a0Lives project has featured in the press & media including: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You can follow progress and keep in touch with the project and this campaign on Remarkable Lives' social media: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Facebook \u00a0 I \u00a0 \u00a0Instagram \u00a0 I \u00a0 Twitter \u00a0 I \u00a0 Tumblr ... but the BEST way you can help is to spread the word with your friends, family, colleagues and total strangers by sharing this Kickstarter Campaign on your own social media channels, by email or good old fashioned word of mouth.

  "The Miniatures are: The Rules are: \u00a0The Goblin Civil War set of wargame rules have been developed over a two year period and have been extensively play tested, however to make sure that they are as good as they can be, our plans are to release a beta-test version of the rules as a PDF living document. This will enable you to get playing with your new miniatures as quickly as possible and for you to play an important part in the development of the final rules. We will be releasing exclusive scenarios for backers to play, and feed back there results to make sure we iron out as many problems as we can before going to print with a final version. Elton will be at hand to answer any questions you may have during this period. The test period will last for 6 months at which time we will run another quick kickstarter to launch the full color, final, hard copy version of the rules. Part 1: Turn Sequence & Movement Part 2: Force Creation Part3: Shooting Part 4: Melee \u00a0Part 5: Recovery Tests I personally have been involved with Fantasy alternative history games, since my first sculpts were sold to alternative armies (for the flintloque game) back in 1998, (Ogre hunvarian legion variants). So I was looking for something interesting to sculpt and I've often thought the Spanish civil war, is a criminally under rated game source, a time when infantry was the most important thing and tanks were used as support rather than being the battle critical devices they are today.\u00a0 so after perusing a \"very British civil\" history/canon and the looking the figure range it just all morphed together in my head. The Raw premise is that a immense sprawling wealthy country has grown into a empire over centuries, the trade guilds hold great power and like all empires the wealth gets concentrated in smaller and smaller groups and the outskirts and rural area get poorer, a major drought happens which go's one for several years food is getting scarce, of course the wealthy are hoarding food and it just explodes into civil war in the way that centuries of Rich/Poor, City/Rural divides can do. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I decided to modify the factions slightly, as many people know, in the real SCW there was the Nationalists who were fascist (hence Hitlers/Mussolini's support) but for reasons of game balance I split the right into \"monarchists\" (middle right) and fascists (Far right) and we had the obvious leftist factions of the communists (middle to far left) and the anarchists (\"dont need no stinkin badges!\" - far left)\u00a0 Important note the swastika has no part in this game, \u00a0and never will, the fascia bundle is the representative symbol of fascism, any attempt to use a swastika on your pictures, fan units etc will be quickly disavowed, and if able we will take your pictures down, so please just don't use it!\u00a0 in practical terms you choose to either deploy a platoon of regulars or militia, the game is built around regulars being better trained and equipped, and militias being more keen and numerous, all playtests so far from various \u00a0groups helping around the world it works. In most cases the regulars will be monarchists or fascists and the communists/anarchists will be militia, there are exceptions in the early war there were regular units which sided with the communists, and if people want to paint/convert figures as \"international brigades\" (there are planned full rules and figure releases for international brigades in the future but they are not out yet).

Platoon Contents Choice of Support Options - All support packs contain 12 miniatures including command figures A quick note, many of the support packs share models, the biggest example if the gardia municpale, the garde felde and the milicia theologi, all three units use the same trooper models (picture marked as gardia municpale) but you paint them differently, in addition gardia municipale and the garde felde use the same command pack (picture marked as garde felde) but the milicia theologi use the different command pack shown as milicia theologi, and both units of monks with rifles or shotguns use the below command pack\u00a0 Ok there are two types of stretch goals. The first are extra support unit options, the second are what I call \"Trooper II\" packs, ie a second pack so that you have 12 unique figures per 12 model support section.\u00a0 Above \u00a34000 we will see there's are lots of extra units sculpted (but not master moulded)\u00a0 The Goblytanian ordinance board (or just G,O) are very good at shipping things across the world, unfortunately, we are stuck with human postal systems. \u00a0",
  "Hello everyone. My name is Jake Dixon and I'm the lead singer and guitarist from The Hiding Magpies. I'm here to explain why the group are using Kickstarter to fund their second album along with a tour.\u00a0 Back in 2016 I started recording the bands' debut album with my good friend Ben Gonzalez, who is a producer, engineer and musician. I had songs stock-pilling up and I had a bit of money saved in the bank to actually get these songs down onto tape at the time. However, I soon ran out of money and production of the first album stopped until the following year in July. Funding an album is never easy on your own, no matter what you do as a job in this day and age. I had to save, save and save to finish the album off, which as a working musician was extremely hard, as I had bills and outgoings to add the stress of it all.\u00a0 After we recorded the album, it seemed daft not to put a band together and tour the record. The band is fully formed and rocking and more songs are stock-pilling up. However, with this in mind, we are looking to get back into the studio and record our second album 'Searching For Gold' which will be followed by a tour.\u00a0 As a band we are really passionate and dedicated to the music. Music comes first for us guys! The newer songs are sounding stronger than ever and we can't wait for you guys to hear this on a recorded format. As I mentioned, when I recorded the debut album with Ben Gonzalez, it was just the two of us and a few friends guesting on the album.\u00a0 As a band we have travelled up and down the country supporting the likes of Hawkwind, Fishermans Friends, we have played on the main stage at The Great British Folk Festival. We are a fully fledged touring band. A long way from what it was in 2016! At the moment on our live shows we are already playing the new material, and it's been a question by many fans and friends, when is the second album on its way?\u00a0 Well, he is the answer. It takes you guys to help, and donate little or large to our future project.\u00a0 When recording an album or hosting any project it costs money as we all know. I have listed how I went about it before and what it will cost us this time, and I hope that this helps in the understanding of why we need your help!\u00a0 We are offering lots of things in return for your help (including a living room gig!!). Fingers crossed you can get something back you like as well as supporting local music and grassroots music! First Stage (Pre-Production)\u00a0 Pre-Production is basically getting every band member into the studio, with the producer and sound engineer, and all of the equipment to start figuring out what will work for the record. This means testing guitars, amps, keyboards and drums to see what may work for the sessions that are to come. This time also includes working out subtle arrangements on the songs, because we all know, what happens live can be sometimes different on a record. Pre-production can roughly take up to two days.\u00a0 Now baring in mind we shall be using our good friend Ben Gonzalez to record the second record, as his knowledge, understanding and musicianship is far beyond anyone we've ever worked with before, in the sense of a studio producer and engineer. As I mentioned earlier he recorded our first album, which we are all very proud of and love the sound of. Recording with Ben will cost \u00a3140 a day (which is a very good rate) plus expenses for strings, maintenance on equipment and fuel to get to the studio etc.\u00a0 Second Stage (Recording)\u00a0 After pre-production its then on with recording the album. Now in the studio you want it to be a relaxed environment and a good work space. However, with that in mind this is why records take time to make. Not all the time can you get the best take of a drum pattern or guitar lick in five minutes of recording. All the same, this doesn't mean we are going to take six months to make a record. We are hoping to have the album recorded within two weeks, with small breaks in between to give us (the band and producer) the time to reflect on what we can do better. After that it's then onto mixing and mastering.\u00a0 Third Stage (Mixing)\u00a0 Mixing a record can take a while. However, our good friend Ben who will be recording our album is quick and proficient. This shouldn't take long. In his words, \"if you record it well, it shouldn't take much time to mix!\" Fourth Stage (Mastering)\u00a0 Mastering an album can take a little time but with the guy who we have In mind works like Ben, quick and proficient. Mastering will cost roughly between \u00a3250-\u00a3400. Any record that you hear on the radio, or on your Hifi will have been mastered. It's the cherry on the top for a record, and we want it to sound amazing!\u00a0 Distribution Now after we've finished all the recording stages, it's then getting the album distributed on all formats which include: Cds,Youtube, Spotify, Itunes, Google Play etc.\u00a0 In the past we've always worked with an American distribution company called CD Baby, and to have all this sorted costs up to \u00a3600, through past experience. The reason why we work with CD Baby is because the quality of product we get from them is out of this world, which for those who have bought the first album will know. For us and for you, we want our second album to be accessible to anyone who wants to listen to it.\u00a0 Tour it!!!\u00a0 The next stage is for The Hiding Magpies to tour the album. With our October Uk tour soon approaching we're dead excited and we can't wait to show case these songs for you, for the fans (new and old) that haven't heard them already! When touring it costs money. What we've already learnt from past experience that fuel, van hire, sound engineers (on the shows) and hotels cost the band! Anyway, all of this is a lot to read and take in, but we wanted to give you, our family, friends and fans a chance to make all this happen. We are all working musicians who play in other bands but our hearts truly lie with The Hiding Magpies and we've all said if we can do this all the time, we would. You guys have been amazing throughout the past few years supporting the group and coming to the shows and buying the CDs. You really don't know how much it means to us! We know that the making of the second album and touring it means everything to us, and we know we can't do it without the help of you guys!\u00a0 Thanks for taking the time to read this, and we hope we reach our \u00a32900 target in the near future. Spread the gospel folks! We love you.\u00a0 THM\u00a0",
  "If you know me, you know how hard I work. \u00a0How much passion I put into my craft of creating the kind of music that speaks to my soul - music rooted in the traditions of American music while at the same time pushing genre boundaries, testing the limits and breaking the rules. \u00a0 The last 2 years have been the most fruitful of my creative life. \u00a0I moved to Nashville from Maine because I love country music but wasn't crazy about what I was hearing on the radio. I came to Music City because I felt that as a lifetime entertainer, honky tonk fanatic and absolute disciple of all things rock 'n' roll, I could make a difference. \u00a0 I came here to play a role in bringing some forceful, unapologetic twang and true-to-life honesty back into the music being made in Nashville. \u00a0 With the help of a big break at AJ's Good Time Bar - the Broadway bar owned by Alan Jackson, I was able to make my debut record Honky Tonk Dream - my ode to the stone-cold honky tonk style that took me from Nashville nobody to a 5-night-a-week, 4-hours-a-night front man and band leader in the most competitive music town in the world. \u00a0\u00a0 The combination of the success of Honky Tonk Dream and me and my band's tireless work on stage playing nearly 700 gigs in Nashville in 3 years awarded an opportunity of a lifetime - to open up for Alan Jackson himself on 4 arena concerts in his 2019 Tour. \u00a0 But I don't rest. \u00a0I don't sleep. \u00a0I don't sit back and bask in the glory - however big or small. Every day I wake up and ask myself \"WHAT'S NEXT\". \u00a0 And I write. \u00a0And write. \u00a0And write. \u00a0 Exhausted? \u00a0Write about it! \u00a0Got your heart broken? \u00a0Better write 20 songs about her! Frustrated about how the hell an artist makes an honest living in the 21st century? \u00a0Better make the music that speaks a truth so vividly that one can feel the anguish and yearning bleeding from the speakers. \u00a0 Lately some people in the music industry have started to take notice of the work we've been doing and have been asking \"What's Next for Jay Bragg?\" \u00a0Labels, hit writers, publishers, managers... we've gotten a few people's attention that could make all the difference in the world. \u00a0 The iron is hotter than ever and it's high time for a Brand New Season - a collection of songs that I've been writing and cowriting over the last 3 years that define who I am as a writer, a singer, a musician and a man. \u00a0No longer feeling like I need to be bound to traditional country or honky tonk styles has allowed me the freedom to dig deeper into some of the other styles of American music I heard growing up - \u00a0music that came out of cities like Memphis, New Orleans, Bakersfield, Los Angeles, Chicago and Austin. \u00a0 A Brand New Season will contain a collection of some of my most personal and most rhythmic music to date. \u00a0I want this record to be the honky tonk equivalent of an Andy Warhol painting - classic, iconic American framework with colors and textures that give convention a swift punch in the gut, all set to a soundtrack made for the dance floor.\u00a0 However, realizing this vision and dream is not possible without help. \u00a0I am so grateful for the fans who have come along on this ride I've been on for over a decade - going back to the bars in Portland, Maine. \u00a0And every week, more people excited about what we have to offer are coming into the fold. \u00a0It's a damn exiting time to be alive!\u00a0 I'm launching this crowdfunding campaign not because I want to make it easier to make this record, but because without your help, it doesn't get made. \u00a0I don't come from wealth. \u00a0What I have, I have earned with my two hands, gig by gig, night after night. \u00a0But great works of art done right require a seed that is allowed to germinate into something big and badass. \u00a0 I'm asking for you to help me with the seed part.\u00a0 With all the sincerity in my soul, I am humbly asking for your financial support to fiercely launch this new chapter in my creative life. \u00a0My last record help me achieve some major milestones in my career. \u00a0I have learned much from the experience and I feel I'm at a creative peak at a time when people are craving a fiercely rockin' honky tonk sound more than ever. \u00a0 Volume 1 of my work here in Nashville is nearly complete. \u00a0Now it's time for a Brand New Season. \u00a0 I hope that you'll come along and help support this ride.\u00a0 Thank you from the bottom of my heart. \u00a0I am eternally grateful.\u00a0 -Jay\u00a0 PS If we raise $9,900, we make Brand New Season 100% of additional funds will be invested into the production making everything bigger and better - more studio time, bigger budget for musicians, more elaborate packaging, music videos and an investment into the marketing and PR budget for the record to help spread the word as far and wide as humanly possible.\u00a0\u00a0",

  "Arcane High is a dive into an 80's drenched in spectacular magic!\u00a0 As part of Zine Month 2022, we're finally launching this massive project. Inside you'll find rules to play out your oddly specific fantasy of having magical abilities in the 80's. Included are 100 unique quirks to mix and match along side 20 different schools of magic! Each school comes with 3 unique and abstract spells that can be wickedly twisted to suit your every need. You'll find your classics like Illusions, Alteration, and Divination but you also find plenty of modern style schools like Electro, Gravity, and Mechanicy! We're also planning on a genre system that lets you set up different stories from romance, sports, to slasher.\u00a0A trip through this stand alone game system will take you through 4-5 sessions, each 2-4 hours long. These tubular rules have been shaped over literal years. In fact, most of the book is already written! All of the core mechanics have been fully prepped to have a most excellent roleplay experience. All the quirks, spells, and genres are primed for a socially focused game. All that's left is to write out spectacular adventure and give it some majestic design.\u00a0 Notsold? Take a dip into a sample of our rules: savagehess.itch.io/arcane-high $1 Freshmen - A Most Excellent Thanks $10 Sophomore - Digital Copy $20 Junior - Physical Copy $25 Senior - Early Access $3000 - We're Funded! Once we get here, we'll immediately continue production on this tubular table top game. $3200 - We'll add in another excellent sample adventure from a selection curated prompts that you, the backers, can decide on! $3500 - Even more of that masterful art to bulk out these pages. $??? - Who knows what out this world rewards await beyond? Definitly something magical. While most of the writing may be done, there's still lots of work left. The majority of the funds will go to helping pay our layout designer, editing, and getting extra art. The funds will also help pay for printing and shipping of the physical copies. Lastly, there'll be fees to pay to the various companies like Kickstarter. We want to make sure that Arcane High can get into as many hands as possible. On that line, we are more than happy to ship internationally. That being said, It's important that our international folk now that shipping is a bit crazy right now. We can't guarantee a reasonable shipping price or timely delivery due to the small size our team. \u00a0If enough our international backers come from the same region, like Brazil or the UK, than we will look into getting more local printing.\u00a0",
  "Before we get to business please allow me to ask you a few questions 1. Do you have a good sense of humor? 2. Do you sometimes hate small talk? 3. Do you like to be heard and want to be listened to? 4. Are you interested in improving people's mental health? If you answered yes to any of the above yes are in the right place!!! Have you ever played Cards Against Humanity? Well this game are cards FOR HUMANITY. Now, imagine the laughter & connection that is possible with THIS experience, a game that's designed for deliberate dialogue around things that matter most to you. A.S.K Me | The Game is more than a game, it's an experience designed for people who are: open-minded, open-hearted, and ready to break-bread, break-down, and break-through for a more humane tomorrow.\u00a0 Hi, my name is Davis J Williams and I am an award winning gangs worker and author from London, England. For the past 20 years, I have been working as a front line worker supporting vulnerable young people by steering them away from knife crime, violence and dysfunction.\u00a0 The last two years of my life have been a revelation. Putting the pain and trauma of COVID19 aside for a moment, COVID19 taught me a few things, it has taught me the importance of human connection. During the worldwide lockdown, I created A.S.K Me | The Game to empower humanity & to explore their highest potential. My single intention is to help the world to heal. People around the world are practising\u00a0social distancing\u00a0and\u00a0self-isolation\u00a0to curb the further spread of coronavirus, millions of people are feeling the psychological effects of a lack of human connection, feelings of loneliness and isolation. This journey started in October 2021 when I asked a group of young people to participate in one of my workshops. The ages of the students ranged from 14-16 years old, and they all of them had 1 thing in common, their lives were in great danger. The students were victims of gang culture, they were misguided and vulnerable. The Youth Offending Service invited me to engage with them, to help steer them towards great success.\u00a0 Being an experienced worker I quickly built a strong and honest rapport with the students. We joked, discussed their needs and explored their future. Five weeks of engagement had passed and the relationship was solid, progress was being made and there was a sense of synergy amongst the group. Today I was feeling daring so I decided to introduce the students to a game called Undiluted Expressions (now called A.S.K Me | The Game). The rules were simple, the teens were given pens and paper. I played some familiar music in the background to generate an ambience. After I presented the reasons behind this task I then gave them their mission; \"Write down some questions that you would like to ask your parents, questions that you are afraid to ask but the answer you are dying to know!\u00a0 At first, the students were resistant as they said they were not use to asking questions like that but the game-like environment infused them with the courage needed to participate. The room became very tense, as the student's heads were down in their notebooks writing down their questions. Once the students had written down the questions we got them to place them into a box. Every student was then asked to stand up and take 2 questions each from the box so they can share what was written with the class.\u00a0 The time came for the students to feedback, and they were very open and real. The range of emotional responses displayed by the youth as they shared their questions and thoughts was unbelievable. There were tears, laughter, disclosures, deep insights and moments of clarity, there was a great sense of release by asking the questions with one boy saying; \"It felt like a great weight was lifted from my shoulders\"\u00a0 What motivated me to create A.S.K Me | The Game was the level of connection between the students. They realised that they had more in common with each other. They understood how relationships can decline when questions don't get answered or if they are not heard. The students explained that whilst growing up, they were never allowed to ask questions, no one listened to their worldview so they looked outside of the family home for that deeper connection. They spoke of how other peers welcomed their questions without judgment or persecution. The students also spoke of the negative impact of unanswered questions and the impact on their mental health and well being. During the session debrief, students explained that the game-like approach took away the fear and replaced it with a challenge, a quest, it became fun and daring. It was at this moment that I decided to create this game. There are a few variations of how this game can be played, this is the traditional way; (This game can be played in pairs or small groups) 1. Pick a question card (start with \"Safe Mode\"). 2. If you're not comfortable with the question, ask yourself why, before you decide to exchange it. If you do not want to answer show your Pass card (every player gets 2 swap cards) Remember, if you swap your card you might get a more challenging question. Then again you might not - LOL)\u00a0 3. Be honest and answer the question. Share your experiences; tell stories; be brave and help the listener to understand your truth 4. When someone else is sharing, be present. Listen and see where the conversation takes you. Listen to understand that persons worldview. The aim is to build bridges of understanding, not to tear them down trying to prove a point. 5. Once you are ready to go deeper, pick a \"Lion-heart\" card Cards will be carefully created to bring households together, challenging unwanted feelings and creating space for healing and transformation.\u00a0 A.S.K Me | The Game contains 143 questions that create space for deeper connections, uncovers hilarious truths and facilitate meaningful relationships during the digital age. A.S.K stands for A = Ask me anything, lets create tighter bonds. S = Seek for that thing....together.\u00a0 K = Knowledge is power A.S.K Me | The Game aims to; If successful we will launch our first edition; THE FAMILY EDITION on Father's Day 2022. These cards are perfect for: We will use the profits from this venture to kickstart the next editions. ; We have more editions in the pipeline such as; Hi guys, how are you doing?\u00a0 My name is Davis J Williams, I am an award-winning author of\u00a0And Along Came a Lion\u00a0|\u00a0No Enemy Within\u00a0|\u00a0From Boyhood to Manhood, The World's First Activity Journey For Young Boys. I am a Celebrity Vegan Chef creating meals for Sir Lewis Hamilton, Erykah Badu and Les Brown to name a few, a father, friend and CEO of a charity called\u00a0Manhood Academy Global I am the youngest of 3 children, my siblings are 9 and 10 years my senior so growing up sometimes felt boring as I had no one my age to bond with. \u00a0I felt the love but I also felt invisible. I did not have that sense of belonging, so as I got older I sought that connection from outside of my home.\u00a0 As a result, I quickly bonded with others who showed me interest, sometimes to the detriment of my wellbeing. I would do dangerous things for attention or act the fool to get a few likes from the cool kids. As time went on, I joined 'negative' social groups that shared my search for that deeper connection as they too had lost that connection with people from their safe spaces. My past made me emotionally unavailable, detached and I was someone who lacked deep and meaningful connections with others. When my became a father I decided that for me to break the cycle I had to change. I enrolled on numerous self-development courses, started to redefine myself and found mentors who helped me find meaning in my life.\u00a0 I am now a father of two amazing children, I am lucky to have such a truly magical connection with them. We ask each other all sorts of questions and the conversations are so deep it brings a tear to my eye. I just wish others had that type of connection too.\u00a0 Having that deep and meaningful connection is the cornerstone of ALL healthy relationships, but my heart bleeds when I look at my local community and see lost children looking for that connection in all the wrong places.\u00a0 We turned to Kickstarter because we wanted to include our community in this process. This game aims to impact the community so it was only right to reach out to the community to validate this venture. \u00a0Some of you know me for Love Is Just a Verb, and since then I have been passionate about people connecting with each other. I strongly believe that with the backing we will be able to work with other communiy groups and local government to really put the topic of connection on the agenda.\u00a0 The funds raised during this campaign will help me place initial orders, help with the design of the game and printing. Every pound counts towards giving you the ability to become part of our community. Our goal is to continue to create games that challenge who we really are as people.\u00a0 We can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A.S.K Me | The Game a reality. We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a pound, if you\u2019re a supporter of this venture, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!",
  " The Day Out of Time / Free Green Day is an art, music, meditation and information-sharing festival celebrated every July 25 throughout the world to mark the 13 Moon Natural Time Calendar end-of-year holiday. Flying Serpent Productions (www.facebook.com/flyingserpentproductions), in association with the Foundation for the Law of Time (www.lawoftime.org), is inviting our brothers and sisters in the Bay Area to Golden Gate Park on July, 25, 2012 to celebrate the 20th annual Day Out of Time observation and honor the heritage of San Francisco's infamous Human-Be-In, also designed as an art project, in 1967. We are calling the 2012 festival of the day between solar years the \"Human-Be-Love-In,\" and we are inviting the whole Bay Area to join us...for FREE!   The unique and radical element of this gathering is that no money is exchanged: admission is free, materials are given away free, the performers are giving their talent free and no fund-raising occurs. Thanks to Kickstarter, we are inviting supporters in spirit throughout the world to join us and contribute to the celebration of peace through culture that embodies the Day Out of Time.   Our expenses include renting the facility, obtaining the required permit, insurance and security from the Parks Department, generating publicity, renting sound equipment and purchasing materials from the Foundation for the Law of Time for a generous supply of calendars, books and background information to be distributed for FREE on the Day out of Time at Golden gate Park, for the coming year Blue Resonant Storm that begins on July 26, 2012. \u00a0With your support, we can make this day a day to be remembered as a gift to the Earth and the Universe.\u00a0With your support we will be able to expand our vision and share our message with a larger audience, supported by the local music, dance, and speaker presentations planned.   The history of the Day Out of Time is interwoven with the creative output of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Arg\u00fcelles, the messenger of the Harmonic Convergence in 1987 and the first person to bring into popular awareness the Mayan prophecy of the December 21, 2012, end-of-cycle date based on the Long Count Calendar. Arg\u00fcelles authored many books, all in print, and launched the 13 Moon Calendar Change World Peace Movement that spread the basic message of the true nature of time that got lost in the \"cycle of history\" as time was usurped and corrupted into a \"time-is-money\" mindset.\u00a0 The 13 Moon message is that \"Time Is Art!\" The Day Out of Time is a special holiday when we celebrate our humanity, our planet, our creativity, our wisdom teaching and our evolution toward galactic consciousness that lies before us when we pass through the 2012 gateway.\u00a0 Integral to the celebration will be blessings by Native American leaders and Mayan elders and a group participation in the powerful Rainbow Bridge Meditation, visualizing the planet surrounded by a rainbow aurora stabilizing the cosmic energies emanating from the sun and the Milky Way Galaxy. We hope you will join us in whatever way you can: in person, in spirit or through a donation. All who come with a good heart are welcome! All Praise to the One, the Creator of all that is!  May all beings be well and happy!  Mitakuye Oyasin  With Respect and Love, Thank YOU!",
  "Hi, this is B. Gypsee and I'm back! \u00a0I want to say thank you for coming here to consider Project: Stories Without Borders.The idea of Project:SWB was conceived, with my seed, some 42 years ago, however, now, 2012 is time to pu$h it, turn the soil real good! More than 25 years of unprecedented access to many ideal (not always real) images that have thrived; through which I have survived! \u00a0Project:SWB is an intergenerational, cross-cultural, educational, performance art project undertaken to express the extraordinary commonality of our being.\u00a0 Ma'dere Ma'kere Christine became what I describe as, 'gone and grown'* on 2/10/2010 at 12:10am; *that's expired, other sided, transitioned, no more or how do you describe it? None the less, I was fortunate to enjoy 39 extraordinary years parallel to Ma'Dere Ma'kere's 'herstory'. \u00a0I am grateful for the authentic Griot that she was! \u00a0\u00a0 Knowing how Ma'kere\u00a0glued and tied the family together, means you know you ain't heard nothing, 'til you hear how life's origami unfolded 'After Ma'kere died.' \u00a0\u00a0Envy can cause worse fallout than a chemtrail! \u00a0So, one Project:SWB\u00a0piece, you won't want to miss is the telling well of what happened worldwide 'After Ma'kere died!'\u00a0We got ancestors watching over we? \u00a0 Anyone who has been exposed to the end of the life of a loved one, can relate to the time and energy it can take to care for their affairs. \u00a0One, sleepless night in Chicago, I decided to organize my Ma'kere's boxes of documents. Loads of everything, from 20th Century Social Security Correspondence, 1940's Church-School Records, 1970's Purchase Documents for Homes, Cars and Other Must Haves...No laptops, mobile phones or designer puppies early 20th century! Within a final box of documents I find what? \u00a0A white bundle of what? \u00a0I take caution in unravelling my mothers 'secure' packaging and discover that the white bundle is a Blessings gown for a baby. \u00a0Handmade with custom embroidery, ab-so-lute-ly beautiful! \u00a0For what baby, if not mine? \u00a0Within, I find a note on a ribbon, which is tightly tied around thousands of 35mm negatives. \u00a0The note read, \"Daughter, may all your negatives become positive.\"...and my griot within was awaken! \u00a0Project SWB's:Sophia's Story of\u00a0seeing yourself outside of yourself will give you goosebumps about the concepts of 'elephant\u00a0angels and concrete shoes'. \u00a0 Cer-tain-ly, I was capable of being B. Gypsee, going global digitally, to tell Stories Without Borders, however the thousands of negatives preserved shape thousands of words! \u00a0Once upon a time in the wilderness, an unknowing voice cried out, \"everybody's got a story\". \u00a0This is when I changed courses for Project:SWB. \u00a0I own me & I owe you, to tell stories of bahramdipity and serendipity, that will change his story. Through\u00a0Project:SWB I will share, excerpts of authentic 'truths and proofs', highlighting the lessons that have enjoined my journey. \u00a0Having participated in the evacuation and aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Project:SWB expounds of the necessity of reinforcing lessons learned regarding being prepared when you find yourself in the path of aftermath. \u00a0Has B. Gypsee ever crossed your path?\u00a0 The images span more than 3 decades, growing up in the US, below the Mason Dixie and scratch lines, 1970's, studying, researching and rescuing in New Orleans, Louisiana, long before and after Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005, researching and investigative journalism that has taken me from Memphis' 'Most Memorable Martin Moment 1999.' to California \u00a0'On The Road With OJ' to Georgia 'Olympic State of Mind' to Mississippi 'Gulf Coast Tent Cities' to New York 'Great Times In The Square' to Texas and the 'Audacity of Veracity' to Las Vegas' Mike Tyson-Holyfield 'Bite Fight' to Kansas 'Hunting for Divine Heather's' to Puerto Rico's 'People of Color Advocating Across The Globe' conference to Chicago from 'Beavers, Nuts & NATO to the Prosecutors & POTUS plus all the governors bla-bla-bla in between, and those images conclude, last but not least in Washington, DC where there sits bills, big and small, being politicked with the knowledge of some and the finances of all taxpayers. \u00a0Project SWB:'From Poe 2 Politics' journals seeing little change you can believe in! \u00a0 \"That's my gypsee child; don't let no green grow under her feet.\" Ma'kere \u00a0 \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\" Ms. Cantrell \u00a0\"Yes, child, go to school and know that when you finish there will still be enough that you don't know to make other worlds.\" \u00a0Great Griot Hannah \u00a0\"Anger is the door for the devil to come in.\" Grandpa Allen SH \u00a0\"You have the courage to care with love, so you will never meet a stranger; you will never not have what you have need of.\" \u00a0Aunt Lottie \u00a0\"Where money can't, character can take you.\" Damon \u00a0\"I'd rather be abhored for who I am, than adored for who I am not.\" B. Gypsee And so, Stories Without Borders needs you to become a part of this sharing of the sunshine & rain of human experiences and endeavors, of letting loose the reins, of trusting the path of the journey (into aftermath, into overflow), of keeping your eyes open and your mouth closed, in the midst. \u00a0B. Gypsee speaks candidly because no longer are we separated 6 degrees. The truest generosity of humanity is often underexposed while images untrue to character are too often overexposed. \u00a0And who puts down the reality TV remote to ask themselves, 'how far from this image is the reality?' \u00a0 Take a sagacious ride on a serendipitous path and witness some stories and exchanges that inspire, surprise & make you you go hmmm?!<@>! \u00a0Life is... like a box of chocolates! or cracker jacks! or lemons, from which can come lemonade! Kickstarter works this way: without your support to reach the $9000 goal, \u00a0none of the dollars donated will contribute to bring\u00a0Stories Without Borders to your life. \u00a0There is a line in some song that goes, 'no thing from no thing leaves no thing.'; Project:SWB needs something: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ACCESS TO A MOBILE SPACE FOR CAPTURING, EDITING AND DIGITALLY DISTRIBUTING COMMUNITIES OF STORIES. \u00a0I HAVE DONE THE YOEMANS TASK OF SCANNING THOUSANDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS AND DOCUMENTS WITH THOUSANDS MORE TO GO! \u00a0 STORYTELLING IS AN AGE OLD PATH FOR SHARING TRUTHS THAT LAST, CULTURE CHANGES AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I've bought many lessons. \u00a0Some have taught other lessons. \u00a0Speaking is cathartic. Listening is therapeutic. When you hear Project:SWB 'Bonus to Bone Us' you will discover why a woman, working in America, can't invest in an American Dream. \u00a0If not in America, where? \u00a0 \u00a0Man-Del-A! \u00a0Project SWB\u00a0is one Griots interactive plethora of 'toasts' to birth, body image, modification, love, gradual-granual politics, indifference, dreams and the experiences of growing through and sharing lessons for leaps.\u00a0 A thousand thanks in advance for your consideration and partnership in assisting me to create\u00a0Project SWB,\u00a0comprised of a mobile photographic exhibition as backdrop to independent journeying, journaling and journalism, expressing so much of what many learn before Kindergarten and others lack longer; that life is about the choices we make and where those choice behaviors take us. \u00a0 You can visit www.hayyimis.com\u00a0for a photographic preview of some of the places and faces that have inspired me to recognize the benefits of coaching others as they 'grow through' circumstances. My mission (responsibility) is to work with communities of adults and children, assisting them 'unpack' to develop and implement wholistic strategies that inspire them to a lifestyle solution they can live with well. \u00a0This amount to more well-beings. \u00a0It is natural to be well, it is authentic to be you! I am well and life is, Change\u00a0",
  "We've done it horror hounds, we've smashed the 100% funded milestone! First off, thank you so much to everyone who has backed, supported and help bring this film to life. So what's next? Well as most of you will know, indie film campaigns are launched in the hope of raising the minimum production costs. And we now have the opportunity to move forward and create the best damn gothic horror film imaginable. So with that in mind, we've launched our stretch goals: \u00a37,500 - If we reach our first stretch goal, we will be able to go above and beyond in bringing our new horror icon Darkness to the life. Right now our budget allows for a full head cast, but we want to do more. Help us unlock this goal and we'll be able to create full body SFX work to really make Darkness something special.\u00a0 \u00a38,500 - Our second stretch goal is all about post production. Editing and VFX work is covered but we want to bring in Hollywood level Sound Designers, Mixers and Colourists. If you help us unlock this goal, you are ensuring Black Mass looks and sounds the best it possibly can. A presentation worthy of the worlds biggest screens. \u00a310,000 - And our final stretch goal, the big one! Once we have created our unique gothic horror, we now need to get it in front of the biggest festivals in the world. As you know, Black Mass isn't just another horror film, its a story that dives deep into the world of depression and the depths it can take you to. And we want to take that message across the world. Our ambition for this film is huge, and we are looking at the very top festivals in the world. Sundance, SXSW, FIFF, Sitges, Raindance. To achieve this we will look to hire a PR and Marketing team that put us firmly on the radar of all these festivals.\u00a0 From day 1 Black Mass has been a roaring success and we could not have dreamed of such an amazing start and reaction for our little film. So as a Special Thank You for all that incredible support, our \u00a350 and above perks will now include a Limited Edition OST CD of our amazing and unique score from composer Mitch Bain. From the bottom of our black hearts, THANK YOU!\u00a0 Black Mass is the latest project from Producer Chris Nials and Writer/Director/Producer Scott Lyus - the team behind award winning short films Silently Within Your Shadow and Echoes of the Passed. A gothic horror that promises to be their most ambitious and personal tale to date.\u00a0 With an award winning cast and crew, including actors Johnny Viviash, Charlie Bond and Sophia Eleni, with Director of Photography Neal Parsons, (who worked on the Oscar Winning Short The Silent Child) and Composer Mitch Bain. Black Mass promises to be a terrifying horror that will chill you to your core.\u00a0 The dark and atmospheric story centres around a bereaved father and his two adopted daughters as they try to come to terms with the loss of their mother, all while haunted by a demonic presence. \u00a0 Black Mass is a story that is born out of my own personal battle with depression and the depths it has taken me to. For me, it has been the darkest and scariest period of my life, and while it\u2019s a battle I still suffer with, it\u2019s something I\u2019m ready to open up about and help shine a light on. The story is a passionate take on a very tough subject and I don\u2019t want to shy away from or sugarcoat what people with depression go through. I feel horror is the perfect genre to explore that story and I promise Black Mass will be the scariest and darkest film I have ever made. - Scott Lyus\u00a0 The film will introduce a new and terrifying horror legend known as Darkness.\u00a0 A demonic presence known by many names but most commonly referred to as Darkness, the entity latches on to those at their weakest, appearing as an old friend or loved one, an ever present voice, slowly taking over their life until nothing remains but a deep, dark void. Our new horror icon will be created with a mix of Hollywood level FX and VFX work. And we are beyond excited to announce, and we can't believe we get to say this, Bafta Nominated (The Theory of Everything) FX artist Kristyan Mallett and his KM Effects team have joined Black Mass to bring our new horror icon Darkness to life. Kristyan has a ridiculous CV that includes the Harry Potter franchise, the latest Mission Impossible films, Ghost Stories, Guardians of the Galaxy, Autopsy of Jane Doe and Star Wars: The Last Jedi to name just a few.\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2259734/\u00a0 \u00a0http://kmeffects.com/gallery/\u00a0 And putting the finishing touches to Darkness, will be VFX guru Ryan J. Thompson, who has worked on a bunch of cult horror hits, including horror mega hit The Birch which was picked up by Eli Roth\u2019s CryptTV and has hit a record breaking 15 million views on YouTube alone, has joined the Black Mass team to bring our terrifying icon to life.\u00a0 Johnny Vivash as Charlie (The Father) Johnny, a fan favourite among the indie horror community, he has featured in multiple award-winning productions such as Book Of Monsters, Charismata and The Creature Below. Charlie Bond as Jessica Charlie has been a stalwart of British indie films, having appeared in The Rise & Fall of a White Collar Hooligan, Hellriser and King Lear. As well as upcoming indie horror Dead Air. Sophia Eleni as Meagan Sophia is an incredible young actress well known for her roles in American television series Tyrant and romantic comedy feature Finding Fatimah, as well as upcoming TV mini series Whatever After. We've listened to what you guys want and we've come up with a wide range of different perks. e it a helping hand or a full on Executive Producer credit, we've got you covered. But before you donate, we're sure your biggest question is going to be \"where is my money going?\" Don't worry, it's not being used for an over the top Hollywood party; we'll be investing every penny into creating a truly unique & chilling short film like you've never seen before.\u00a0 We've already invested our own money into bringing the film to this point and will be investing even more as the project rolls on. However, due to the sheer scale of Black Mass, we need a little help bringing this one to life. Here's the lowdown: \u2022 Equipment: 30% of our final budget \u2022 Cast and Crew: 20% of our final budget \u2022 Location & Accommodation: 20% of our final budget \u2022 Production & Post Production: 20% of our final budget \u2022 Perk Service: 10% of final budget By contributing you're directly becoming part of the awesome world that is indie horror. And as we've previously mentioned, we want to do more than simply make an incredible horror film. We want to help raise awareness for depression and mental illness, so be safe in the knowledge that by supporting our campaign you're helping make a difference within an industry you love, and hopefully the wider world beyond! Get Involved! We know even a fiver can be hard to succumb to when you're making last week's out-of-date takeaway last until payday, so we appreciate any and all help you can throw our way.

The Hermit, played by Hugh Ross. and composer \nDaniel O\u2019Sullivan of Grumbling Fur, Ulver and Sunn O))) will compose an original piece for the soundtrack.\u00a0 THE GATEKEEPER follows a grieving nobleman and his servant as they journey to find an alleged necromancer.\u00a0 Since completing our first short,\u00a0SHELL\u00a0(2017), which is currently making the rounds on the film festival circuit, we've been working on a number of music videos for UK based & European artists. We had great fun with these projects \u2013 some are even available to stream on iTunes worldwide and screened on MTV.\u00a0 Now comes our next narrative film project: THE GATEKEEPER, an ode to classic British horrors. We've been developing this project over the last 12 months and are excited to take it into the next phase. We intend to build on the success of\u00a0SHELL\u00a0(2017)\u00a0with a period horror film set in the late 16th century,\u00a0based in the Derbyshire homeland of both Josh and Harry. We have a finished script and are looking to shoot the 20 minute short film in February 2019.\n At the tail end of the 16th century, a grieving nobleman and his unwitting servant attempt to locate an alleged necromancer living deep within the Derbyshire countryside. Navigating the often harsh and foreboding landscapes, the nobleman and his servant eventually come upon the mysterious bridge refuge of the man they seek, only to find themselves at his mercy. \u00a0More info in the rewards section! Jamie, Harry and Josh are three friends making short films, music videos and film content. We work under the production company anteroom - a collective we've established to develop and make projects with friends and colleagues both inside and outside the film industry.\u00a0\n THE GATEKEEPER will be soaked in an unsettling atmosphere, making the journey through the Peak District as terrifying as the outcome.\u00a0 A contrast between the beauty of the setting and the ominous narrative. Dreamlike visuals where we don\u2019t realise, at first glance, we are in a nightmare.\u00a0 Set in the middle of winter, the film will have a subtly unnerving and unnatural look.\u00a0 Check out the concept art below! Concept art by Tobias Jones Storyboards coming soon! To make the project happen, we've raised some personal funds and applied for various short film funding but we really need a final push to meet our \u00a37K budget for the whole production. Your pledge is vitally important to keep the schedule on track and make the project a reality. Your money will cover all aspects of production for the film including cast & crew costs, lighting and camera costs, post production such as editing and sound mixing, plus film festival entries throughout 2019. Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing fundraising platform, which means if we do not raise our goal within the time frame, Kickstarter returns all the pledged money to our backers and we will receive nothing.  The Peak District is seldom used in film. We plan on filming in several places throughout the Peaks including Washgate Bridge, Winnats Pass and Don Whillians Hut. We will be filming roughly an hour away from where Harry and Josh grew up in Derbyshire and about the same distance to Manchester where Jamie lived and studied for several years. Our affinity for this place matches our love for folk horror and gothic cinema.

  "Hi, I'm Andreas, and I love to develop games in my free time.\u00a0 Last year I came up with a challenge for myself: create a card game that is both fun and challenging, using as few cards as possible, with no text on them, and rules that fit a single extra card.\u00a0 This is what I came up with: Features The story of Gluty Bear Gameplay In Gluty Bear and the Wurst Truck players constantly swap cards in secret to accumulate knowledge, until one is confident enough to come out of the bushes and eat. First shuffle and deal every player a card face down. The remaining two cards go face down to the middle of the table. Then take turns in clockwise direction. On your turn you may either swap your card with one in on the table and then take a look at it. \u00a0Or you may pass. If you have either bear or fork on your hand, you may eat (but don't have to). To do so, first reveal your card so everybody else can see it. If you have the bear, choose one card from the middle and turn it face up: if it shows the wurst, you win, if it shows something else, you lose. If you have a fork, turn both cards in the middle face up: if they show the wurst and a bun, you win, or lose else. The game ends when a player has eaten. You can play multiple games in a row and write down points. The beginning of something Gluty bear is just the first of many minimalistic games I'm currently working on. I'd love to make a series out of them - and thanks to your help that might become reality. Stretch goals Originally I wanted to keep the campaign as easy and simple as the game itself, with no additional stretch goals and extras. But some of you guys approached me with good ideas and feedback, so I included them. The unlocked below apply to all pledges. About me Even though being a happy family man with a satisfying job I still can't help gambling away my time thinking about those games. I published two of my games successfully here on Kickstarter: Lunatic and the One Minute Game (later republished in Europe, \u00a0the U.S. and Russia).",

I have an incredible ensemble of artists, using improvisation and common language to ask questions in the studio, developing choreography and story directly from the knowing body....lineage, flocks of birds, tricksters and \nthe nature of patterns. We are looking and feeling through the heart and\n blood. We are excavating the hidden call of the body to flock or \nseparate from the flock.  We have been building a language for several weeks, now moving into the stage of improvisation and learning choreography, we will create\n a full length piece embodying the stories of the ancestors through \nphysical dialogue character and images. 5 performing artist/creators, 3 Musicians and several Visual Artists The artists: Katie Anhalt, Shana Cordon, Maria Flegas, Mya Strasser \nand Musical Artist Sam Gathman, as well as visual artist Areia Li and \nothers who will come into the picture soon.\u00a0 After working with these ideas and researching in solo for almost two\n years now, I have an ensemble. Everyday, I am honored by their \ncontribution and perspective, by offering their time and energy, and by \nfiercely engaging in difficult questions through movement.\u00a0 I cannot\n fill the complete expression of this work without the flock, and they \nhave arrived, fully engaged.\u00a0  The primary reason for this \nKickstarter campaign is to pay these artist-performers a handsome sum, \nas all who give their heart and blood should be! We will also recoup \nexpenses for costumes and materials, and\u00a0 to hire a technician and a \nvideographer crew to document. \u00a0  With a few old photographs sent from my mother, I was set on\nfire to research my lineage, leading to contemplation on the greater human\nstory through mythological and archetypal images. I suddenly wanted to know what opportunities arise in me, what unreasonable behaviors, dreams, attractions and fears urge me, and\nthat which the origin is ultimately hidden from plain sight? What are the\nletters hidden in boxes, the immortalized stories told by campfires, the hushed\nup questions of our universal experience? In February 2011, I went into the studio to embody a few of\nthese stories. My process began by allowing the body to speak first about this\npersonal ancestry before assuming and projecting the stories.  What I found in the studio during this time was surprising\nand beautiful, my own personal myths: Flocks of birds; A Shaman and a Priest; A\nmurdered woman in a polka-dot dress; Chants in harmony from the depths of the\nsoul that reveal the truth.The landscape of Featherweight\nis of things known and unknown, light and shadow, that penetrate our everyday\nperception of where we come from and who we are at our core. In July 2011, I\nheld the first work-in-progress open rehearsal with a few invited colleagues,\nto share these findings about the personal part of this journey.\u00a0  In August, as an artist-in residence at Denver Performance\nResearch space, I performed a two hour structured improvisation with\nenvironmental installation to further experiment with an archetypal image that\nhad been emerging in the rehearsals. DPR is an open studio during the First\nFriday Artwalk in Denver. During the evening, the space was open along with\nother galleries and patrons could come by at any point during the event and\nstay for as little or as long as they wanted. I created an installation of\nroots and chose feathers as the only one material/object of play. With this I went into a deeper\u00a0 investigation into the\nsacred universal symbol of flight within the spirit world and serving as\nmessenger. I find it interesting to create a structure for improvisation in public\nview, where the presence of others and condition of being seen, allows for a\ndifferent type of energy and focus of the work in question.\u00a0  This project is a crucial step in the development of the final expression of this piece in May of 2013, which will be the complete interweaving of all these three past research performances. We will have the audience enter into\nan environmental sculpture of woods, threads, objects and sound-scapes,\nnavigating through this \"Life Path\u201d to share in the dynamic physical\nperformance of these stories and myths that have evolved from knowing the blood.

  "An increasing number of cycling enthusiasts have been wondering what a professional need and the answer to that is simple: A power meter that allows them to track their performance whilst cycling.\u00a0 What would the cycling enthusiasts do when the market only offers fine devices under exorbitant price, or cheaper but unreliable and alternatives?\u00a0 Now the high-quality and very affordable MAGENE P325 CS Dual-Sided Crank Arm Power Meter helps you get out of the awkward dilemma!\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been working so hard to be able to launch truly prime power meter with full functions that has a great level of accuracy, performance, reliability and quality whilst being affordable as well. Based on the solid R&D foundation in power meters and trainers for 4+ years, we guarantee that you could save 2/3 of your money to get a power meter with fuller functions and of higher quality! When using your MAGENE P325 CS power meter outdoors, its accuracy rate of +/-1.5% essentially means that any vibrations caused by a bumpy ride, local environmental conditions such as higher or lower level of humidity or temperature barely affect the data collected by MAGENE P325 CS.\u00a0 P325 CS has single side and dual side versions to choose from. The dual side version uses left and right independent module detection to calculate, providing the power data as accurately as possible.\u00a0 Meanwhile, P325 CS provides torque efficiency pedal smoothness, pedal balance alongside with multiple high-order power and cadence data which enable riders to have a better grasp of their cycling data and improve cycling performance at the same time! Previous power-meter customization generally involves sending your crank to factories for processing, a process that would often take one whole week or more.\u00a0 Now here comes the exciting news: in addition to the power meter, the P325 CS contains both cranks and a chainring!\u00a0 In terms of the crank, we adopt a 3-hollow crank structure, making the crank more rigid and visually symmetrical. Compared to the solid crank, it has stronger integrity and higher stability that is conducive to the accurate collection of power data.\u00a0 As for the chainring, we use a nail integral design to ensure a better rigidity and make it stronger and lighter.\u00a0 We independently developed high-quality cranks and chainrings after 160,000 and 190,000 tests to present you better users\u2019 experience. we adopted a high-energy density certified battery and utilized magnetic charging to make P325 CS more durable. We\u2019ve achieved a quick 3.5h charging time and a battery life up to 200h which would be more than enough to ensure a complete training block without recharging. This is an obvious concern that every cyclist faces when cycling outdoors: What is the level of the power meter\u2019s waterproof property? Well, the MAGENE P325 CS comes with increased waterproofing, featuring an IPX7 anti-splash level. The rechargeable design effectively avoids the natural wear of the waterproof rubber caused by battery replacement and improper reinstallation, which in turn causes damage as a result of the water that seeps into the power meter. Fortunately, the shell of the P325 CS power meter is completely sealed and welded and leaves no gaps at all, which can ensure riders to enjoy their journey safely under any circumstances! While developing MAGENE P35 CS, we initially used a hand-drawing approach and then a 3D drawing approach to reach the perfect crankset design. We\u2019ve improved the product\u2019s appearance, strength, and reduced weight. In this aspect in particular, we\u2019ve brought the weight of the crank from 210g to 206g, and then to 200g, having ultimately left it at 198g. Now it\u2019s ready to be yours! We used 7075 aluminum alloy to build the crankset and tested its rigidity to ascertain that the calibration is in line with SHIMANO\u2019s crank rigidity test data benchmarks. This is a device that complies with the ISO 4210-8-2014 standard. We also tested the data and produced video documenting the performance at varying speeds to ensure that, no matter how fast you go, your key power meter\u2019s features won\u2019t fail you. MAGENE P325 CS power meter uses the latest version of ANT + and Bluetooth dual protocols, which are widely adapted to code tables and training software that could support any protocol and related data functions, including strava, zwift. It provides reliable and rich stomp data and helps riders to improve their pedaling efficiency. It is compatible with Shimano and Sram 11-speed or 10-speed front derailleur.\u00a0 The power meter applies to BB86 and it is also compatible with most of the frames you can find in the market.\u00a0 The crank and power meter are created on our own. We had put lots of efforts into the research and development, as we hold the core value that unique self-owned technology stands the test of time. After mulitiple fatigue tests and improvement, MAGENE P325 CS has successfully met several international standards there is.\u00a0 Instead of keeping a higher margin on ourselves, we bring down the production and development costs and pass the savings generated by our cost-effective approach on to you. To provide bikers more enjoyable experience and save money at the same time is our ultimate goal.\u00a0 By bringing down the production and development costs this much, instead of keeping a higher margin for ourselves, we prefer to pass the savings generated by our cost-effective approach on to you. After all, we want you to have a superb power meter that doesn\u2019t break the bank! It is under the strictest crank test parameters that we ensured the MAGENE P325CS would be the perfect power meter for you. Here\u2019s a detailed overview of how it performs when tested. The durability test of the crank arm and chainring that we developed and produced uses the prevailing industry standard ISO 4210-8-2014 to perform a durable test on different hole sizes, applying 1800N force to the crank, and performing 100,000 tests at a level of 45 and 30 degrees, respectively. After many modifications and repeated tests, the 8mm hole size was finally determined. After 160,000 and 190,000 tests, MAGENE's self-developed crank arm and chainring passed the fatigue test. At Qingdao Magene Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd., as one of the earliest brands in the Trainer industry in China, we focus on developing high-quality bike training accessories that blend the latest technology developments with great materials while putting an affordable price tag on the products we develop for you. \u00a0This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\u00a0",
  "Demo | Wishlist | Discord | Press Kit | Twitter | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok | Website Beyond the Long Night is a whimsical twin-stick shooter with roguelike mechanics. Explore The Dark Mountain - a subterranean world full of monsters, secrets and lovable characters. Puzzle, upgrade and battle your way through three major biomes to outrun a deadly storm and escape to the Overworld beyond. Uncover a trail of mysteries in this ancient kingdom of demigods and explorers, captured within an endless time loop. What treasures await in The Overworld? Is there a way to stop the storm from spreading? Can you escape the endless time loop? All may be revealed beyond the long night. Beyond the Long Night was inspired by completing side quests in FTL many years ago. I was struck by how much these secondary objectives hooked me, and wanted to experiment with that concept. I also love games that subvert your expectations, and set out to create a game within a game, where it\u2019s secrets are drip fed to the player as they explore. I've had the game favourably described to me as Enter the Gungeon combined with Cave Story. It's also been described as a \"chill\" roguelike with an atmosphere similar to Fez. There's lots of charming characters, puzzle elements, and a moody retro-inspired soundtrack interspersed between all the bonkers enemy bashing! I'd be honoured if you tried out the free demo! And if you have any thoughts, feelings, hopes or dreams you'd like to share, come hangout over at the discord server. I can't stress enough how important player feedback is in game development, so I'd love to get your thoughts! Thanks \u2764 The combat in Beyond the Long Night takes it's inspirations from classic modern action roguelikes, such as The Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon. A 2D twin stick shooter at heart with an Upgrade combat system that allows you to stack and combine multiple Upgrades at once, leading to chaotic combinations. You can shoot, dodge, throw items and use a secondary ability, known in game as a Superpower. Throwable items include torches that explode on impact and cause burning damage! Beyond the Long Night also has many environmental hazards for you to contend with. They interact with enemies too, meaning you can also use the environment to your advantage. You can also encounter a friendly NPC known as the Buddy. This NPC will help fight with you during combat, and can be upgraded as you progress. You can improve your build throughout a run by collecting Upgrades and Superpowers. Upgrades are stackable, meaning you can pick up multiple versions of the same type. There are multiple different Upgrade \"themes\" that allow you to improve your Bullets, Passives, Buddy, and Superpowers. Many of the Upgrades synergise with each other, leading to overpowered and chaotic builds. Superpowers are secondary abilities you can discover during your playthroughs, and range from defensive to offensive. You can only hold one of these at a time, so choose wisely! Superpowers have limited ammo, but can be recharged by landing shots on enemies and treasure chests. I'm aiming for a total of at least 64 Upgrades and 16 Superpowers at launch. Beyond the Long Night uses permadeath, and your build is reset every run. However, that doesn't mean all your progress is lost... You play as the ballooned explorer, awakening within a strange underground kingdom known as The Dark Mountain. With no prior knowledge of how you got there, a friendly guitarist tells you of a mysterious land called The Overworld - a land free from the mountain that is located at the highest point of the map. The journey upwards begins, as you fight your way through the mountain to whatever lies beyond. The world of Beyond the Long Night is trapped within a time loop. A dark ferocious power that emanates from the depths of the mountain - known as the storm - spreads from chamber to chamber, destroying everything it touches. Yet life in the mountain is reborn, and the loop begins again. The mountain folk who reside within the world are aware of the storm, and are accustomed to the cycle of life and death. They'll remember you beyond this life, and may even grow to be quite fond of you! The Dark Mountain contains 3 major areas that you need to fight through. Hollow Grove: The calmest of the 3 areas - where many of the inhabitants of the Dark Mountain live in peace. Forbidden Temple: The old remains of a Temple built long ago. This place gives me the creeps! Hope's Peak: Overrun by a cult of Guardians. They'll do anything to stop explorers escaping to the Overworld. The characters and dialogue are daft, but also heart felt! You'll meet plenty of colourful folk on your journey, such as the security guard who isn't very good with confrontation, or the farmer who just wants to throw a party for their animals. Puzzle rooms, treasure rooms, challenge rooms and secrets scatter the map. Discoveries are delivered in a drip-fed manner - The longer you play, the more you'll uncover. Composing is really close to my heart, so the music of Beyond the Long Night truly is a labour of love. I've taken huge inspirations from Disasterpeace's Fez soundtrack, and Lena Raine's Celeste soundtrack. The music is inspired by retro gaming, but infused with modern elements. My first priority for the stretch goals is to make the game as accessible as possible, through the use of ports and localisation. As a small team our resources are fairly limited, so we are initially focussing on developing Beyond the Long Night for Windows PC. However, I would love to bring Beyond the Long Night to as many people as possible post release. As a team, we have all had professional experience in porting games to different platforms, and we have also been accepted by Nintendo to develop Beyond the Long Night for Nintendo Switch. Any ports will be scheduled post the initial release on PC. We are hopeful that we could localise the game into a few languages by the initial launch, but we'd need a little extra financial help to get there. We all met in the audio department of Frontier Developments, and we have over 20 years of professional game development experience between us. Steve Hollis - Lead Developer Before I began working on Beyond the Long Night, I used to work as a Technical Sound Designer at Frontier Developments. I mainly did audio programming, but my specialty was music and music systems. I had the pleasure of building the music systems for Planet Coaster, Planet Zoo and Jurassic World: Evolution, and got to work with awesome composers such as Jim Guthrie, JJ Ipsen and Jeremiah Pena. I've worked on Beyond the Long Night full time since early 2020. It's mostly been a solo endeavour, but I have had some help along the way from a couple of good friends.

Some money will go towards taxes, and Kickstarter takes a 10% cut of any funding raised.",
  "I'm almost finished with my new album and I can't wait to share it with you!! This album is a collection of songs and chants that are very special to me. Writing them and singing them has helped me to process and celebrate so much of my journey. Many are about moving through challenges and finding solace in one's spiritual practice. In a sense, they are love songs to the divine, my sangha and teacher. Sanskrit mantras and kirtan weave throughout the album much like they do through my life, supporting, soothing and sometimes stirring.\u00a0 I want to make this album as beautiful as possible. Most of the vocals and guitar parts have been recorded. And now it's time to add gorgeous instrumentation, tablas and polish.\u00a0 I've been recording up in the mountains of Boulder. I'm working with Tom Wasinger who is not just a genuinely nice person but also a 3 time Grammy winning producer. Tom is a blessing to work with and he really knows how to make everything I write sound even better than I had imagined.\u00a0 Since I began this album, I moved 1000 miles from Colorado back to where I grew up in Indiana. I've been recording bit by bit whenever I can get out to Colorado. I have an upcoming trip scheduled this summer and I want to finish this album. It's time.\u00a0 This is where YOU come in, my wonderful supportive community. Many of you made my debut album possible with a successful Kickstarter campaign. And I am so grateful. Thank you, again! And many of you, I have met more recently since my move. And it's been such a joy to meet so many lovely people to share music and yoga with in Indiana.\u00a0 You have already made this album possible. You have shown up and supported me. You have sung with me and sent me words of encouragement when I really needed them. And as I prepare for the final stages of recording, I'm asking for your continued support. You will be greatly rewarded with music and yoga and sterling mantra jewelry. And this time, I want to come sing and share with you in person, wherever you are.\u00a0 Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\u00a0 So much love and gratitude,\u00a0 Kalika All of the jewelry here is sterling silver and consciously handcrafted by me with lots of mantra and attention to detail. The only exception is the sterling cuff which was originally created by me and then cast by a Denver-based local business.\u00a0 I consider all of the jewelry to be gender-neutral. The most popular item by far is the Om Namah Shivaya ring in Devanagari script. Many of my friends and sangha members wear one (including my husband as his wedding band) as a reminder to practice mantra and be present.\u00a0 All rings will be made to size. You can determine your size by visiting a local jeweler (me, if possible) and getting sized. Alternately, you can mail me a ring that fits and I can make one to match the size. *Please note: Wide band rings fit more tightly than thin bands. For example, if you wear a size 8 in a thin band, you will probably be most comfortable in an 8.5.\u00a0 Kirtan Circle:\u00a0 Gather some friends to share music and enjoy the sweet connection to the divine and to each other. I will lead you in several chants and talk about the meanings of the mantras. (For \u00a0up to 10 people total. Please connect with me to explore larger class options).\u00a0 Bhakti Bath:\u00a0 Enjoy 90 minutes of chanting, live music restorative yoga and deep relaxation. This nourishing workshop is designed to ease tension, allowing body and mind to rest and rejuvenate. (You provide the space and the props for up to 10 people. The more props the better!)\u00a0 *To schedule more workshops, lively full-band kirtans, etc. please reach out to me and we will create a special reward package just for you!\u00a0",
  "(Thanks to the many folks over the years who shot the photos!) SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE SUPPORT!!!\u00a0 We've achieved STRETCH GOAL #1! Let's try for STRETCH GOAL #2: another song!!! I've been dreaming about this project for months. Writing material. Drawing up plans. Researching and meeting with producers. Putting together the band. \u00a0And now, here we are! Amazing.\u00a0 A THOUSAND TINY TORCHES is an EP collection of some of the songs I've written in the past year. My last album was released over 10 years ago. A THOUSAND TINY TORCHES is the album I didn't realize I've been making ever since.\u00a0 I dare say these are the best songs of my life. They come from growing up and growing older. They come from listening to others and examining myself. They come from loss, grief, joy, love. They come from a deep appreciation of the folk, Americana, country, and singer-songwriter artists who have buoyed my spirit throughout my life. Will you join me in the making of this album by backing this campaign? Whereas years ago making a record was a magical effort behind secret doors -- nearly impenetrable to independent artists like me, and completely closed off to you -- times have changed. Now, \u00a0YOU AND I ARE THE RECORD LABEL.\u00a0 As the creator and visionary for this project, I am deeply appreciative that you've come this far. Truly, my community of family, friends, and fans is everything. With you in mind, I've created super-fabulous incentive rewards just for this campaign. In appreciation for your support, as a backer at every level, you'll get exclusive Kickstarter content and your name inscribed on the wall in my little \"she-shed\" cabin where I do almost all of my songwriting.\u00a0 Will you back this campaign and add your light to A THOUSAND TINY TORCHES? Did you ever have a dream so bright that, though the path was not blazed, or the road twisted like an M. Night Shyamalan plot, you could follow it like headlights in the dark?\u00a0 Did you dedicate everything to your dream, as they say you must, with tenacious commitment? And, did it happen, after years and years, that one day your light blinked out?\u00a0 Over the past year, after a looooooong hiatus from my singer/songwriter career (during which I recorded 3 albums and toured throughout the Northeast and across the U.S.) I've been working on a new collection of songs.\u00a0 It started last spring with one song about a woman and a question: The song came begging to be written. (Sometimes songs are like that. Insistent.) I dusted off my guitar, dusted off my voice. Both were weak from neglect, because though songwriting was once my light and compass, it'd been over 10 years since my last album and tour. A melody emerged; verses moved around; I tested different lines in the chorus. I was hoping to heal a relationship in my life. Perhaps, I thought, the craft and emotion of writing this song would reveal a key to peace in the fraught rapport.\u00a0 In the song, I pondered what I knew of this woman's younger days. I remembered that she'd once wanted to be an archaeologist.\u00a0 I thought about how she might have felt in middle age, having given up some dreams. Now in my 40s, I am arguably \u00a0\"middle aged.\"\u00a0I, too, have lost dreams along the way. Every song is a conversation. As I wrote the pre-chorus, I found myself hearing the song not just as the composer, but as the intended audience:\u00a0 In my early 30s, my own brightly lit dream -- of recording and performing my own songs -- blinked out. Maybe the electricity faltered. Maybe life got stormy. Maybe I was in a marriage that wasn't working. Maybe I felt too young to be stuck there for life.\u00a0 Though my heart still ached to write songs and sing, I found that I couldn't do it anymore. For the first time in my life, I stepped away from music. So I left the East Coast for someone else's dream in California. I practiced yoga. Wrote down stories from the touring days. Composed music for film/TV. Played in several kirtan/world music bands. Made a lot of pies. I got divorced. Fell in love. Grieved over not having children. Married. Became a stepmother. Published essays and poems. Did very little songwriting (though, truth told, not none). Made more pies. Ten years went by.\u00a0 The years were tender, hard at times, often quite beautiful. I embarked on a sort of archaeological self-excavation.\u00a0 Then, last year, I built a tiny \"she-shed\" cabin. I needed a quiet place to write. A room of my own. And -- suddenly -- my dream re-sparked. The light went on. Was the song about the woman?\u00a0 Or was it about me?\u00a0 ...I'd be writing songs. I'd be singing.\u00a0 And so I did. I wrote six months' worth of songs, a new one every week. And out of that emerged a new record. This Kickstarter campaign is for A THOUSAND TINY TORCHES.\u00a0 Turns out, sometimes a dream is not at all like headlights in the dark.\u00a0 Sometimes it's a long string of sparks, flickering here and there, revealing pieces of the world one blink at a time, like a time-lapse release.\u00a0 Sometimes it's like A THOUSAND TINY TORCHES illuminating the night. Records are like homes. We all live in one, but few of us know everything it takes to build one from scratch. So what does it take to make a record?\u00a0 I already have an AMAZING team -- producer, studio, live and mix engineer, and musicians -- that I can't wait to tell you about in a later campaign update, when it won't get lost in the shuffle of this giant campaign word block. As a friend says, \"Don't make me drink from a firehose.\" Some interesting numbers, for the numbers folks:\u00a0 I've set my goal for this campaign for $9600, which will cover SOME of the costs of recording, mixing, mastering, and manufacturing this album of 6 songs. If we exceed our goals for this campaign, the first stretch goal is to create a music video for promotion on YouTube. If we're widely successful -- a girl can dream! -- we may be able to add another a song or two. The cost of recording a single song is about $3267.\u00a0 Here's (approx.) how the funds will divvy up: For the pie lovers: **************************************************************************** \"Lovely songwriting and arrangements.\" - The Boston Globe \"Silver's tough-yet-tender vocals move through the space where Lou Reed meets Chrissie Hynde, ensuring that Something Pretty Something True lives up to its name and then some.\" - Performing Songwriter Magazine \"Silver first seduces with a rich, highly emotional voice. Though her arty lyrical flair reflects Ani DiFranco, Joni Mitchell, and even Jane's Addiction, it's a very personal modern rock approach.\" - Boston Herald \"Beautifully throaty, melodic voice belting meticulous poems...a truly talented songwriter.\" - The Spectator (Raleigh, NC)\u00a0 \"Listening to [On The Dashboard Of A Shaky Car] is like stumbling upon the perfect small town on a cross-country, broken-hearted road trip. You love the place so much and it's so familiar to you, yet you also find a whole new way of understanding your life and loves there. All of the emotional baggage you took with you is unpacked by chanteuse Arielle Silver's voice - low-riding, naked, and sure - coupled with wise, nimble lyrics and beautiful instrumentation.\" - Cynthia Gralla, author of The Floating World (Ballantine) *************************************************************************** Thank you for supporting A THOUSAND TINY TORCHES by backing this campaign or sharing it with others in your communities. Your support means the world to me. From my deepest heart, thank you. xoxo,\u00a0 Arielle P.S. If you have a idea for a custom reward configuration that you would like to propose, send me a message. Let's work together!",
  "In mid January I went to Missoula Montana and recorded a full length album. The album will have at least 12 original songs. The age of these songs range anywhere from 5 years old to 6 months old. What I want to do is finally promote my own work. I believe if I'm going to get anywhere in the music business it will be because of my own work, not because of covers. Covering many emotions, the themes of my songs include love, death, happiness, and homesickness. I believe a broad audience can relate to these real life themes. Music is my passion and I take pride in my work. I'd love to share my work with the world.\u00a0 This album has a very simple sound. I didn't want anything over produced or cluttered. A majority of the tracks are just myself and a guitar, and an occasional harmonica or bass drum. I think my songs are best served stripped down. The reason I am doing a Kickstarter is to raise money to have hard copy CDs made, release on all major digital platforms (iTunes, Amazon Music, Spotify, etc.), put more money into merchandise, and I'd like to put some money into promotions and advertisements to further my career opportunities and reach a larger audience.\u00a0",

  "Four days ago, Lera Lightfollower - Acolyte to Delvyr, sent a letter that she was making the journey from Hastrull to Stennard. She would be taking the North Road - through the Mangled Hills. The announcement of her impending arrival brought relief to the suffering people of Stennard, whose Temple of Light has fallen into neglect. For the faithful, this was nourishment for their souls in their famished lives. Three full days have passed since the letter arrived. Their light has not followed. It is a one-day journey, two if a landslide had blocked the road. The town needs a search party to find her and bring her to the Light Temple. Cleft in the Mangled Hills is a DCC RPG-compatible adventure module designed primarily for 12-16 0-level characters. A party of 4-6 1st level characters could be substituted, but you may wish to increase the hit points of the monsters, or slightly increase their numbers to keep the adventure challenging. This adventure requires the use of a timekeeping device. Warning! This adventure is filled with insectoid-fueled body horror and includes graphic depictions of physical transformation. The North Road leads from Stennard to Hastrull, traversing the Mangled Hills. A westerly spur splits off from the main road into rich, densely wooded foothills. This heavily worn track terminates at Hillwood Camp, a rugged haven for those that fervently embrace self-sufficiency and self-determination. They are known for a strong familial vibe within the camp, and they passionately distrust outsiders. Hillwood Camp is a DCC RPG compatible micro-setting for any number of characters levels 0-4. It details 3 NPCs, the Code of the Woodsfolk, Superstitions of the Woodsfolk, 8 camp locations, 7 training encounters for a single outlier PC or other ranger type character, and several new creatures. The writing was done by myself, Nick Baran. \u00a0I will also be handling the cartography. Jamie Jordan (The Stennard Courier Vol. 1 Zine, Wide-eyed Terror Zine, Tome of Debasement Zine) will be handling all of the art. Find Jamie Jordan @noirfade on Instagram. Cleft in the Mangled Hills and Hillwood Camp are each slated to be 40+ pages, saddle stitched.\u00a0The interior will be black and white on 60# text and the cover will be black on 70# cover stock. This zine will be printed at DigiCopy, here in Milwaukee, WI. The goal of this Kickstarter is to raise the funds to print 100 copies of each of these 40+ page zines. Additional money will fund additional copies, stickers, and art for future projects. With each Kickstarter we've expanded and refined our shipping options. Sending zines in an envelope with no backing is the cheapest available option, and is very affordable. Adding any sort of cardboard backing to prevent corners from being bent or the spine being creased immediately escalates the price from \"letter rates\" to \"package rates\", and there is a huge difference in price. We invested in a back stock of envelopes and hard mailers to give you, the Backer, the option of what works best for you in terms of budget and condition, so please choose the option that works best for you. Rabid Dogs Zine (2nd printing) - $8 The Precipice of Corruption adventure module - $15 (hard mailer shipping ONLY!) Wide-eyed Terror Zine (2nd printing) - $8 The Tome of Debasement Zine - $8 The Stennard Courier Vol. 1 Zine - $10 Note: Each item will show $1 additional shipping for being added on. This is specifically for the Hard Mailer option. If you select Envelope and add additional zines onto your pledge, you will be charged additional postage after the campaign as each zine will be sent in its own envelope.

  "This game is being made for Zine Month or #ZiMo for short! We hope you enjoy it! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ You are Dr. Mallory Addison, a new hire at Discount Medical, fresh out of med-school with a bright smile on your face and hopes of becoming a productive member of society. Unfortunately, you have to put that last bit on hold because you've got bigger problems: paying back your student loans. So you do what a few of your friends have done and gotten yourself a second job to help speed things along. Of course, what you don't tell people is that your second job is working for the Mob. That would be an unfortunate thing to happen as people tend to look down upon such actions. That might get you fired! And worse, you'd still have loans to pay back! Gameplay:\u00a0 All you need to play this game is this book, a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and an active imagination! Gameplay is broken into cycles. Each day you start with the full deck of 52 cards. Then you go through your day job, an event, and then your night job. During your day job you will choose a number of cards to pull from the deck, hoping to get hearts and avoiding spades. This represents you... ensuring unneeded supplies and organs make their way into your hands while keeping your patients alive. During your night job you will again choose to pull cards from the deck, hoping to get diamonds and avoiding clubs. This represents being able to sell your hard-earned black market goods while avoiding people who would steal what you have rightfully stolen! And of course, every day there is an event. This will put one of your skills to the test: Charm, Deception, Fighting, or Medicine (each represented by a different suit). When an event happens, you will have to come up with a plan, draw a chosen amount of cards and hope you draw the appropriate suit! This would get tiring after a while, but as you get better at juggling your jobs, you will level up and get perks to make your chances of success even better! Choose wisely. Depending on what skills you decide to focus on, you may find yourself leaning towards too closely to one job or the other! Focus on being your day job and you may not be able to pay your loans! Focus on your night job and you may neglect to keep your patients well! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Goals: $330: We are fully funded! This covers our costs for production at a break-even point. $660: We can afford to buy a few more pieces of art! Namely art for Dr. Mallory's bosses at both her day job and her night job! Also, a bonus piece of Dr. Mallory going out for her night job! $1,300: Okay, you may not be as interested in this, but this is where us as writers get paid a fair rate for the work that we did in making the game. Thought we might as well be upfront about that part. Just like Dr. Mallory, Miguel also has school to pay for! $1,420: Art will be done for a rival of Dr. Mallory who also works at Discount Medical. Dr. Engelica Vianne jumps into the fray with her own set of events as she tries to ruin Dr. Mallory's life! $2,020: We will release rules for a multiplayer mode of this game! Do note that this will increase time it takes to complete the project by a little bit as more writing will have to be done! \u00a0Video Music: The music in the video at the top of the Kickstarter page is: Sixth Floor by Pawe\u0142 Feszczuk Find the original track here: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/pawel-feszczuk/walking-next-to-the-playing-piano/sixth-floor Creative Commons License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",

  "'Brave or Beautiful?' will be an e-book, of approximately 40 pages in length. It will be available as a free download. What is the project about? The\n series \u2018Brave or beautiful?\u2019 aims to create an opportunity for the \nviewer to explore their own prejudices about body shape and to reflect \nupon the impact of these prejudices.  This is done in a few steps. Firstly, by presenting \nnaked bodies (and a few clothed ones), and asking the viewer the \nquestion- are the models  brave for baring all, or are they in their \nnakedness, an object of beauty?  This creates\u00a0 a space for the viewer to be explicit in their thoughts on what is an \u2018acceptable \nbody shape\u2019. The viewer is then asked to reflect upon a deeper question, which is, who is to say what is brave, what is \nbeautiful, or what is ugly?  The project then asks the viewer to reflect upon how they outwardly\u00a0 communicate their body prejudices. Is it a look, a comment or by other means. What impact does this communication have on the person it is directed at or intended for? All of this reflection is done internally by the viewer and at their own pace.  The project then presents research which discusses the \nrelationship between our sense of self (how we perceive ourselves) and \nour mental well-being. The question is then raised about the impact our body prejudices, and the way we communicate them, may have on the other person. In simpler and more direct terms, we ask the viewer to reflect upon the impact that their body prejudice has on others. It is expected that in the process of exploration, other questions may internally arise such as:  From where did I get my ideals of what a body \u2018should look like\u2019? How have I or my loved ones been effected or impacted by body prejudice? Lastly and most importantly, by respectfully creating a space in which the viewer can explore their prejudices and the impact of theses prejudices on others, an opportunity for reflection and change is created. Once this process is successfully undertaken, the viewer has the potential to transfer the process and experience of critical reflection, to other aspects of their lives and thinking Some questions answered: What will the funding be used for? The $2,200 asked, will cover the direct costs of professionally producing the e-book, as well as cover the admin and processing fees collected by the Kickstarter site.  It is your project, what are you financially contributing towards it? A considerable amount of my own money has been spent of this project to date, for items such as flowers, props, specialized photographic equipment and more. There will be other upcoming costs associated with this project, which I will pay for myself (items such as; website hosting, more flowers & materials/props  for the shoots, more specialized camera gear etc). If more than $2,200 is raised, these funds will directly support the project and go towards the above mentioned costs.  Why will the e-book be available as a free download? By providing a free download, I am minimizing cost (or lack of affordability), \nas being a factor which excludes people from being able to view and \nengage with this project. Also, many people have volunteered time and expertise to the project, \nthrough posing/ modeling, guidance, mentoring and assisting with collecting research on the impact of body \nprejudice etc. It only seems fitting to collectively offer this project up to others for free.\u00a0  When will the e-book be ready? I am aiming for the e-book to be ready in late March or early April. If not sooner. Interest in the project is steadily growing and more people are\u00a0 wanting to be part of the project. Because of this,\u00a0 I am allowing some extra time so that more people can pose and be included in the e-book. If this project is about bodies, why do you have flowers, that I find distracting and why are some of the people clothed or hiding their faces.\u00a0 The presented images intentionally have colourful flowers or fabrics/props for several important reasons. - For the men involved, the stereotype of what is masculinity is counterbalanced by the fragileness flowers, as well as the stereotype of flowers being feminine. This can intentionally create a mental jarring or reaction in viewers who adhere to those stereotypes. This reaction presents the viewer with something immediate to explore.  - The colours of the fabrics, props or flowers, intentionally create an alternate and less confronting point of interest for the viewers eyes to focus or rest on. This is important if the viewer finds the presented body image too confronting, in which case the viewers eyes can alternate between the presented body and the alternate focal point, slowly easing themselves into the whole image at a pace which feels safe and less confronting for them. Some of the models are clothed because they they strongly believed in the project and wanted to be part of it, but did not feel they could show their body nude. There were many different reasons for not being able to appear nude, such as; cultural/religious beliefs, fear they may be judged or just not being comfortable. In the clothed shots, clothing was specifically chosen which would show the body shape. A few people who strongly supported the project, wanted to appear nude, but because of their positions in society/business, feared repercussions so we 'masked' their faces.\u00a0 It is important to point out that respectful conversations were held with everyone who appeared or was interested in appearing in the project. No one was pressured or coerced\u00a0 to appear naked or to pose in anyway which was disrespectful to them. It was very much a collaborative approach. I hope you find this project worthy of your support! many thanks, matthew schiavello.",

  "OUR STORY: We are GROWING! Over the past 6 years, we have regularly toured across the country in our van to share our music. After we had our baby girl this past year, we took a break from the road and toured locally. We plan to hit the road again starting this spring to support our new album. In order to continue touring this way, we will need more space.\u00a0 WHAT WE NEED: We are looking for a travel camper trailer. We need something that is reliable & safe to house the family band as well as our road nanny as we continue taking our music across the country for this & many more tours in the future.\u00a0 WHY KICKSTARTER: Being independent artists, we do everything ourselves from booking shows, updating websites, publicity, merchandise and sometimes we even get to write songs! ;) Because of this we rely solely on our fans, friends & family for a living. We simply cannot do this without your help.\u00a0 This trailer will be our family's \"home on the road\" for many years to come. We have new music to share and our spring tour already booked. The only thing missing is that extra set of wheels following our van, Blue Bell.\u00a0In order to continue touring as our family grows in this new way, we are asking to all of our fans, friends, family and supporters to help us get to the next phase of our musical journey.\u00a0",

Por otro lado est\u00e1 Dulce, una joven mujer cuyo pasado la atormenta que se ve\u00a0 amenzada cuando, en su casa, su hija y Elena (su amiga) son abducidas por la entidad sobrenatural, que demanda un sacrificio a cambio de ellas. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- English: The short will tell two different stories: the first one is the experience of Elena, a curious girl who, while playing Hide and Seek, is forced to hide herself in a basement where a supernatural force lies.

  "*Promo video shot & edited by Dylan Santurri / Makeup FX by Taylor Haggard / Artwork by Logan Gordon \u00a0 Cutter is a 12 page script that not only thrills with scares, but also paints an intricate portrait of a young\ngirl\u2019s complicated relationship with her mother, her friend and herself.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 Teenage cutter in recovery, Raelyn, returns home from treatment to the apartment she shares with\nKathy, her overbearing mother. Raelyn finds that her room has been stripped of sharp objects, her diary\ntaken, and a new set of rules ban her from contact with her best friend. Raelyn knows despite\nthe doubts of her mother, she\u2019s overcome her habit, at least until fresh cuts begin to mysteriously appear on her\nbody.\u00a0The\n growing tension Raelyn feels with her mother runs parallel to her fear that someone else may be\n inside the apartment. When Raelyn reaches out to Kathy for help, the secrets Kathy has been keeping from her come to light, cut deep, and end in bloodshed.\n Hello. We're Dan Repp and Lindsay Young, the writer/director duo of CUTTER.\u00a0 With CUTTER, we set out to make a horror short in which the monster is new and memorable and the\nrelationships are real and complicated. We appreciate the kind of horror movie that asks more questions\nthan \u201cWhat\u2019s going to make people jump?\u201d\u00a0 While we expect to reach a horror\u2010loving audience with the\nfun of suspense and shock of gore, we also find it important to leave them thinking about the tough subject\nmatter.\u00a0 Our story deals with a multitude of serious issues such as cutting, drug addiction, parental abuse, and suicide. Particularly, we hope our film brings to light the dangers of simplifying a teenager\u2019s problems and invading\ntheir safe spaces. THE PRACTICAL FX The ghost of CUTTER will be a gruesome, never-before-seen monster resembling a combination of Freddy Krueger, Samara from THE RING, and Jack from AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. We've seen a lot of horror films and know quality FX are essential to their success. That's why we're thrilled to be working with Emmy-nominated Meredith Johns of Hawgfly Productions, Inc. as our makeup FX artist.\u00a0 Meredith grew up in a family of artists ranging from ceramics and oil painting to woodworking and lampwork bead making. She met business partner Carolyn O\u2019Hara on set and abandoned her budding graphic design career to start Hawgfly Productions, Inc. Meredith was nominated for a 2010 Primetime Emmy Award for her makeup work on TEMPLE GRANDIN. Some of Meredith\u2019s other credits include STOKER (SFX Makeup Artist), MACHETE KILLS (Key SFX Prosthetics Makeup), MACHETE (SFX Makeup Department Head), TRUE GRIT (Makeup), FRIDAY THE 13TH \u2013 PART XII\u201d (Prop Fabricator), EXIT SPEED (Key SFX Makeup), and TEETH (Makeup). THE LOOK AND FEEL We plan to make CUTTER an immersive (and uncomfortable!) experience through utilizing the intimate\nlocation of an apartment, creating distance between characters with wide shots and negative space, and\u00a0using warm colors to highlight the red of the blood -- setting ourselves apart from the so often used blue tones of horror films. We're so excited to work\u00a0with our talented cinematographer, Ellie Ann Fenton. Ellie Ann is an emerging cinematographer hailing from El Paso, TX with work spanning television, commercial and feature films. She is an alumna of the University of Texas at Austin and received an MFA from the American Film Institute in Cinematography.\u00a0 Known for the award-winning films ZERO CHARISMA (SXSW 2012) and SLASH (SXSW 2016), she is also a member of IATSE Local 600 as a Camera Operator.\u00a0 She recently finished filming Josh Stewart's BACK FORK.\u00a0 THE ACTRESS While still scouting for the other two actresses in the film, we're proud to announce that our lead role will be played by Nadia Alexander.\u00a0 Nadia began acting at the age of six, working in over 30 productions in Pittsburgh regional theater.\u00a0She moved to NYC at 13 and was accepted into Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts\u2019 drama program and graduated as a Presidential Scholar in the Arts. While in high school and college (where she double majored in Physics and Psychology), Nadia appeared in a number of TV series, including BOARDWALK EMPIRE, ELEMENTARY, and THE FOLLOWING and films such as TEN THOUSAND SAINTS, ADMISSION and FAN GIRL. Upcoming films include lead roles in Boaz Yakin's psychological thriller BOARDING SCHOOL and Justin P. Lange's zombie drama debut, THE DARK. In 2017, she joined the cast of Netflix's SEVEN SECONDS and co-starred in the film BLAME alongside Chris Messina and Quinn Shephard, for which she won Best Actress in a US Narrative Film at the Tribeca Film Festival. Currently, she can be seen in the USA series THE SINNER starring Jessica Biel.\u00a0 \u00a0 A quality horror film comes at a price, and with CUTTER we're dedicated to doing it right. As well as compensating our talented cast and crew, we also need to pay for insurance,  equipment rentals, props, makeup FX, craft services and costumes.\u00a0 What happens if we don't raise our goal?\u00a0Kickstarter is ALL OR NOTHING fund-raising. Even if we\u2019re only $1 short of our target, we don\u2019t get to keep any of the money we raise. If we do reach our goal, your payment method will be charged at the campaign's end. Can we raise more than our goal?\u00a0Yes! Any extra funds raised will go towards post-production and distribution costs. No matter what, your support will be worthwhile.\u00a0 Can you increase your donation once you've pledged? Absolutely!

  "Massive thanks to everyone who has helped me to reach my goal, now I've set a stretch goal of \u00a31500 which we are already very close to. This second short film will be a 'mystery' horror short film that will also be included in the 'For We Are Many' Horror anthology. Everyone will get a second reward matching their pledge for 'Breath' for this short film too, be it a digital download or any of the production credits and thank yous!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Breath draws it\u2019s influences from classic surreal horror cinema, from psycho-sexual masterpieces Blue Velvet and Dead Ringers to dream-scape horror like Jacob\u2019s Ladder and It Follows. \nThe film is also inspired by the disturbing documentary The Nightmare and the real life accounts of people who experience night terrors and sleep paralysis.\u00a0 Our goal is to create a bold, provocative and truly terrifying demonic horror short for inclusion in the up-and-coming feature length horror anthology For We Are Many, produced by Hex Media and scheduled for release in Spring 2018. We want to raise funds so we can put everything up there on the screen for you; the Horror Fans. From creative practical effects to stunning cinematography, from hiring a talented cast and crew to using state of the art post production techniques; the money raised will go to making this happen.\u00a0 Breath tells the story of Simon, a regular guy who takes on a mysterious new flatmate, Clive.\u00a0 No sooner has his lodger settled in that Simon is plagued by a strange recurring dream, involving a beautiful and alluring woman who appears to be draining him of his life force.\u00a0 As Simon plummets into despair and paranoia, his housemate takes on a new and boundless energy and all the while the temptress of his dreams starts to reveal her true demonic identity. The Crew TOM STAUNTON - Director/Writer \u00a0 \u00a0 I have worked as a crew member and post production assistant on indie horror The Unkindness of Ravens and the up-and-coming Hex Media production, The Black Gloves.

He has starred in theatre productions such as Arthur Miller's The Crucible and Brecht's\u00a0The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui and has a wealth of film and performance art experience under his belt.

Gordon is a terrific physical actor and he will give the character Clive an air of mystery and subtle menace.\u00a0 ROSIE WILLIS plays The Hag Rosie Willis is a prolific feature and short film actor. \u00a0She is truly unafraid to take on the bold and daring roles and that makes her perfect to play our demon The Hag.

At the center of our film is a woman (Elizabeth Roberts) running from her past. Her physical fight is with the creature,\u00a0her battle inside is ambivalence towards what her life has become versus pure love of her children. Elizabeth Roberts was cast for her natural style and believable edge.\u00a0 Elizabeth plays \"Kara\" a single mom, who moves from New York City to the quiet rural countryside, with her two young children \"Jesse\" (Arman Darbo) and \"Cambria\" (Chloe Perrin). It\u2019s a job opportunity she can\u2019t afford to turn down. Kara works as a private nurse to \"Walter\" (Bruce Davison), a man stricken with multiple sclerosis,\u00a0an appraiser of rare antiquities with a secretive past.\u00a0The family moves into his humble guesthouse. \u00a0 Her teenage son, \"Jesse\" (Arman Darbo) is most unhappy being a 14 year old boy in this new place. Losing his friends and moving to the\nmiddle of nowhere hasn\u2019t made his job of looking after his little sister, \"Cambria\"\u009d (Chloe Perrin) who's 7 years old any easier. Doom precedes them, \"Ahkeeba\" (Treva Etienne) a shady international associate of Walter, has brought with him a mysterious relic of ancient origin. The relic contains more than just legends. Inside is a terrifying creature, a terrifying cave Spider unlike the modern world has ever seen.\nWalter\u2019s associate encounters a run in with a local sheriff played by genre veteran actor Denise Crosby. \u00a0 Itsy Bitsy is an old-school creature film with a terrifying giant spider at the center, but the movie is about more than just about arachnid horror. Kara will have to deal with her internal and familial struggles while saving everyone from becoming spider food. It\u2019s as much a story about people and family as it is about an eight-legged monster. Mixing an emotionally charged character drama with chilling scares, Itsy Bitsy is a movie you\u2019ll be haunted by for years to come. \u00a0 Maybe you\u2019re not scared of spiders now, but when you see our nightmare that we\u2019ve affectionately dubbed Itsy coming after you, well, you might quickly find yourself stricken with arachnophobia.\u00a0\n\n Itsy Bitsy\u2019s giant spider was brought to life with the help of special effects master Dan Rebert, whose models, prosthetics, and FX design have been featured in True Blood, Stargate SG-1, and James Gunn\u2019s Slither. Instead of just using computer graphics Itsy Bitsy went the classic route, paying tribute to old monster movies from the 80s and earlier by employing practical effects. Our spider is an original creation and is actually in the room with the actors as opposed to made on a green screen after filming. Not only do we think this is a nice nod to some of our favorite classic films but there\u2019s a special sort of chill you\u2019ll feel watching this spider creep and terrorize that you just can\u2019t get with computer graphics.\u00a0 \u00a0 HUGE THANK YOU FOR ANDY DICK, WHOS HELPING US TO PROMOTE OUR PROJECT.

  "I'm a singer/songwriter living in Ypsilanti, MI. I'm a guitarist, vocalist, and producer. I'm most at home behind an acoustic guitar. But I also love my telecaster, making sounds through pedals, sequencing on drum machines and synthesizers, and manipulating audio with samplers. I love timeless, water tight, bare bones songs. I also love indulgent, dense, digitally imagined electronic music. On a personal non-music note, I'm a sucker for a two hour conversation over black coffee. I love a good binge-able novel, especially if it's written in the voice of an untrustworthy narrator. I've toured the continental US, shared stages with some of my favorite artists, and enjoyed seeing my music reach a broader audience with every year of work I put into this path. I'm now ready to bring my latest and best body of work into full realization. And I am humbly, gratefully, and excitedly asking you, my listeners, supporters, family, friends, and everything in between, to support me. To walk alongside me. To invest a little cash, with the promise of very cool album-related rewards in return. I've seen, created, and contributed to a bunch of campaigns like that, so I went to great efforts to make the rewards as cool and desirable as possible. Every reward is a glimpse into my world and personal tastes. Thus, in addition to advance copies of the album, you can get cool shirts, a custom coffee bean blend, and guitar-player accessories. How dope is that. Kickstarter takes a leap of faith! This is an all-or-nothing campaign. If we don't hit our goal by February 1st, no money changes hands. The project gets shelved. Dramatic artist grief ensues. But honestly, that risk is the beautiful part! There is something big at stake. There is no success for this album without a community, a tribe, willing it into reality with their support, belief, and love. I believe we can, and should, take this leap together. Over the past couple years of traveling and performing, I've come to see that none of these songs truly belong to me. Can music exist without an audience? Well, technically yes. But I deeply believe that music can only live and breathe at full potential in a space that exists for the artist and listener, with both having equal importance. If this vibes with you, then read on, and let's make something beautiful together! My songs are borne of a fascination with memory, lineage, origin, spiritual fantasy, and the invisible connections we build with friends and strangers as we navigate our uncertain timelines. That\u2019s a lot of ideas to shove into an indie/folk album, let alone an album title. I\u2019ve decided to commit these ideas to a physical place. Enter Floodplains. The idea came about in one of those rare light-bulb moments during a solitary walk. My favorite walking trail is on the Huron River floodplain. I rarely come across this word because I don\u2019t often associate Michigan woodlands with \u201cfloods\u201d or \u201cplains.\u201d On further research, I learned that floodplains are known for having a shallow layer of nutrient-rich soil, which allows plant life to spring up quickly, and also die quickly. Trees tend to cast their roots horizontally instead of downwards, and many die entirely uprooted during storms. Looking at the many felled trees with their gnarled root systems groping for the sky in vain, I quickly remembered the countless times I\u2019ve heard the words \u201cI feel like an uprooted tree,\u201d whether from a friend, or from my own mouth.\u00a0 In familiar lore and parables, people are often described as the fertile or infertile soil upon which the seed of a good word can fall. While walking through the floodplain, I began to imagine the fable flipped, with me as the seed, falling onto a bed of soil that was certainly rich on its surface, but dry and hostile a few inches below. How often is a person cultivated in what seems to be a fecund, abundant, safe environment, only to find herself grasping for nourishment that doesn't reside deep enough to sustain her where she was planted? I named my record in honor of this image, and the many people who comb through memory and lineage trying to make sense of where they were first rooted. These songs walk the listener through a haze of memories, half-forgotten childhood corners, and restless fever dreams, inviting us to uproot bravely and plant again.\u00a0 The songs are guitar-centric, written mostly in the dead of night on a fingerpicked acoustic. They are lyric-heavy, with a greater interest in word sounds, evocation, and association. There are deep drum rhythms. There are tight vocal harmonies. There are peculiar and off-putting sampler noises and avant-pop synth parts. I am eagerly leaning into every musical and sonic avenue I am passionate about, and I don't know what the hell is going to happen! Every song for this album was demo'd early after its conception, often with unfinished or unrefined lyrics. My guitar lines would be broken, disjointed, and loaded with errors as I learned them and composed them at the same time. Each song was committed to the memory of an old creaky tape deck with no professional gear whatsoever, and then augmented in a digital ecosystem with drum machines, samplers, and synth patches.\u00a0 Frankly, the demos sound crazy, but making them helped me truly fall in love with making music again. I shared them with bandmates and confidantes, and was immediately met with excitement and eagerness.\u00a0 Flooplains is being produced and mixed by Nick Gunty, who is one half of the Chicago power-duo Frances Luke Accord. If you've seen me live since the release of my last album, you've likely heard the jaw-dropping musical force of FLA sharing a stage with me. Their fabulous debut Fluke was engineered and mixed by Nick, and I absolutely love the sonic footprint of what he does. He's a great engineer, an anointed musical arranger, and a truly lovely person to create art with. You'll love what he does to my sound. This record will feature musical contributions from Ann Arbor staples Billy Harrington, Luke Jackson, Katie VanDusen, Christina Furtado, and more. Rumor has it that Olivia Millerschin will be contributing a guest vocal. There will be many more guests announced as we get rolling in the studio! REAL TALK: we picked rad rewards and I want to give them to you. I feel like that crazy person who loves the holidays and went overboard getting stuff for their buddies.\u00a0 Obviously a central reward will be early access to the album! But we designed a handful of other really cool rewards as my way of sharing my quirky interests and passions with you. For instance, the coffee reward. My favorite coffee roastery, Hyperion, has agreed to collaborate with me to create a Floodplains coffee blend. They're even going to carry it in their shop, with download cards inside the bags of beans. How dope is that? Backers who choose the coffee set receive a bag of whole bean Hyperion coffee, and we will all be united over long distances by drinking it in the mornings! Also comes with a rad mug and some coasters. We also have a guitarists reward! Levys Leather custom stamped pick pouch keychains (I've carried one of these at all times for literally 20 years), customized Chris DuPont guitar picks (same gauge I use), and a chord/riff/lyric booklet so you can learn the ins and outs of playing songs of Floodplains. The T-Shirt. Don't you hate it when you wear a t-shirt with pithy words on it, but no one can read them because you have your jacket on? We have a solution for that. New CDP t-shirt has the line \"I Keep My Jacket On\" printed extra narrow so you can, in fact, keep your jacket on, and still show off your CDP swag. We are trying to raise $16K. Holy cow. That type of money doesn't grow on trees. Where's it all going to go? - Compensating producer Nick Gunty. Nick will be arranging, consulting, engineering, playing instruments, and mixing the album. This stuff takes forever, and Nick deserves every penny. As a general policy, I do not mix my own studio records, even though I am an audio engineer. Nick will bring a sonic magic that is outside my artistic tendency and skillset, and this will be a big part of the record's unique personality. \u00a0 - Compensating players. Every musician who plays on a CDP record gets paid, and they get paid well.\u00a0 - Mastering. Gotta have it big and loud. We ship the tracks out to Jim Demain, one of the most excellent, pedigreed, and prolific mastering engineers in the business. - Pressing CDs. - Creating the rewards: shirts, merch items, coffee blend, etc. We are going big with rewards, and creating them with great care, so our campaign goal reflects the costs of these items.\u00a0 - Publicity. We work with Detroit-based publicists Green Light Go. We worked with them for Outlier, with fabulous results. We were featured in Relevant, Huffpost, American Songwriter, and many more publications we respect highly. Since then, thanks to you, my audience has grown, and I feel strongly that I need to capitalize on that. Rather than tossing my best work yet into the ether and hoping it gets noticed amid the constant barrage of entertainment and distractions, I want to invest in getting this music heard and spread onto bigger platforms. Green Light Go has treated me incredibly well, and is already highly invested in this upcoming record, so we fully intend to work with them again. Pub campaigns are the most expensive part of the process, and with good reason! Publicists have to put upwards of three months of work into an album release to help it obtain critical mass. $20K - We will press heavyweight vinyl LP's. These will be made available at a discount to all backers if we hit this goal. $22K - Bonus companion EP. THAT'S RIGHT. More music, delivered digitally to all backers well before it hits streaming platforms for public consumption.\u00a0 $25K - We will produce and release a high quality, concept/story based music video. A video video video, like what they had on VH1 in the 90's, you know. $28K - We will step up our publicity investment and do a premium-tier campaign. \u00a0",
  "This limited edition book will celebrate the changes and traditions in African Caribbean lives and deaths in London, a subject that Charlie has been sensitively documenting since 1962. Who is Charlie Phillips? Charlie Phillips is a 70-year-old London-based photographer whose photographs have been exhibited at Tate Britain, Museum of London, MOCA in Detroit, and whose work is part of The Wedge and V&A collections. Having moved to London from Jamaica in 1953, Charlie was given his first camera by a Black American GI who was stationed near Notting Hill during the Cold War in the 1960s. With his recently acquired Kodak Retina, Charlie set about documenting the lives of fellow members of the African diaspora. Unable to afford access to professional photo processing labs, Charlie waited until all of the tenants that used the communal bathroom had gone to bed before hand-processing and printing his own photographs in the bathtub.To this day, Charlie remains committed to analogue photography, and has never owned a digital camera. As the years passed Charlie travelled widely across Europe, briefly working as a paparazzo in Italy during the 1970s and documenting student uprisings in Paris.  He always found himself returning home to the African Caribbean community in London, where he remains an active contributor and staunch advocate for the invaluable contribution that the Windrush and subsequent generations have brought to the UK, and London in particular. What is How Great Thou Art? How Great Thou Art is a sensitive photographic documentary of the social and emotional traditions that surround death in London\u2019s African Caribbean community.   The title for this book and exhibition is borrowed from the popular hymn sung at funerals. The song How Great Thou Art praises the life of an individual, and this project is a declaration of love and celebration for the traditions and cultures of the African diaspora in London.  In his time attending and photographing funerals in his community Charlie has witnessed huge changes and emerging traditions in burial and mourning practices. From the disappearance of bodies lying on dining room tables, to the establishment of black funeral directors and the booming business of burying and celebrating the dead.   How Great Thou Art represents a lifetimes work by Charlie, and the book presents you with a rare opportunity to engage with, learn from, and celebrate these rapidly changing mourning traditions and practices London\u2019s African Caribbean community.   The How Great Thou Art exhibition will be held at Photofusion\u2019s gallery in Brixton, South London late in 2014.  Why we need your help This is not a commercially viable project; funerals are only big business for undertakers. We hope that by reading this information, watching our videos, and thinking about your own experiences of funerals, you might see the value in exploring and contextualizing the values and traditions that British cultures place upon death, burial and a celebration of life. Your support for this project through pre-orders or larger pledges will cover the costs of producing a first edition of the book. The book will stand as a permanent legacy for not just Charlie\u2019s work, but importantly for the community he has lovingly documented.  The book can survive in libraries, bookshelves and classrooms for years into the future, revealing the currently untold story of how the African Caribbean community established new traditions for life and death in the London.  What will we do if we exceed our fundraising target? Charlie is keen to have his work accessible to everyone If we are lucky enough to exceed our target, we will be\u00a0donating\u00a0copies of the How Great Thou\u00a0Art book to libraries.\u00a0 Who else is involved? The book has drawn together an exciting mix of long-time advocates and new admirers of Charlie\u2019s work. The book will include essays exploring the themes of Charlie\u2019s work by Paul Goodwin and Michael McMillan. Paul Goodwin\u2019s curatorial and research interests span the fields of art and migration, urbanism and critical curation. He has curated and co-curated a number of internationally significant exhibitions including Migrations: Journeys Into British Art, Tate Britain 2012. Paul is Associate Lecturer, MA Curating, Chelsea College of Art and Design; a Research Fellow in urbanism at the Centre for Urban and Community Research, Goldsmiths, University of London Dr Michael McMillan works and practices as a dramatist, mixed-media artist, curator and academic. Michael\u2019s recent show My Hair: Black Culture, Style & Politics (Origins of the Afro Comb) was at the Museum of Archaeology & Anthropology, Cambridge. Prior to that, he engaged audiences young and old with his installation The West Indian Front Room, Memories and Impressions of Black British Homes at the Geffrye Museum in London. The book design will be overseen by designer Will Bankhead, who has previously worked with Charlie\u2019s work when designing record sleeves for Honest Jons records. The exhibition is being hand-printed by Nick Jones, using all traditional photo chemical printing processes and fibre-based archival paper. Nick has previously printed for Linda McCartney, The Kobal Collection, Herb Ritts and Norman Parkinson. Charlie\u2019s work is being archived and preserved by Eddie Otchere and Lizzy King. Eddie Otchere is a fellow photographer and curator of photography. Eddie has known Charlie for seven years, working with him as a friend and neighbour. Lizzy King will produce the project, following the recent successful production of the British Black Panther Movement book and exhibition. The book will be printed in the UK, by a small company that provides high quality products at competitive prices. Charlie Phillips is represented by Nicky Akehurst. The exhibition will be held at Photofusion in Brixton. Photofusion is a not-for-profit photography gallery and resource centre, they have and continue to offer unquantifiable support for this project and the upcoming show. All of the exhibition costs are being covered by a grant from Arts Council England.",
  "My name is Randy Butterfield, and I\u2019ve been designing Playing Cards, an hour or two each night, for about 10 years now. Some of my past designs include ROME, Draconian and Wild West. I only work with themes I\u2019m personally interested in, and the Red Rising books by Pierce Brown are some of my all-time favorite reads!! It was inevitable. Conceptual Drawing is not my strong point, so I contacted the exceptionally talented Briana Crotinger / PB (pb.doodles). Briana is also a huge fan of Red Rising, and she has created some amazing drawings of Red Rising characters throughout the years! Briana was all for the idea, and we got to work on a presentation. Briana and I pitched the design concept to Shit Escalates - Pierce Brown and Joel Phillips (visual artist and creator of the Red Rising iconography and maps). They loved the idea, and gave us the go ahead! Unlike a lot of other officially-licensed products, Joel and Pierce have been very involved throughout the entire process. It\u2019s been a joy to work with them and an honor to delve into the Red Rising world with this project. If you\u2019re not familiar with the Red Rising books, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing. \u00a0 Utilizing Briana\u2019s beautiful character drawings as the centerpiece, the design for the Red Rising Decks is meant to let them shine and to complement PB\u2019s drawing style. Picking the 12 Court characters for the first trilogy of Red Rising was a difficult task. There\u2019s so many to choose from! We decided to go with Darrow / The Reaper, Virginia / Mustang and Sevro / Goblin for the HEARTS: Ragnar Volarus, Aja / Protean Knight and Cassius / Morning Knight for the SPADES: Nero au Augustus, Octavia / The Sovereign and Roque au Fabii for the DIAMONDS: Fitchner au Barca, Victa au Julii and Adrius / The Jackal for the CLUBS: Darrow O\u2019 Lykos and Eo of Lykos for the JOKERS. Each Court lists the character\u2019s name in a location that doesn\u2019t detract from the rest of the design. The corners for each Face Card contains either Red or Gold imagery. Both sets of corner coloring subtly fades to Black at the edges, which means gameplay will not be compromised (each card would essentially be \u201cMarked\u201d on the edges, if the Red and Gold colors bled to the edges). The PIPS (Heart, Spade, Diamond and Spade shapes) each feature some of the Red Rising iconography. House Mars for the Hearts, Gold Sigil for the Spades, Red Sigil for the Diamonds and The Society for the Clubs. HOLOGRAPHIC COLLECTOR CARDS - In addition to the complete set of 54 cards in every standard deck, each deck ordered will include an additional holographic card, picked randomly from the 54 unique possibilities in the deck.\u00a0 RED RISING DECK - The Tuck Box for the Red Rising Deck is an inverse of the original Red Rising book cover. Black wings are featured over the red textured background. The top, right and bottom panels are designed to look like the edges of a book. The left panel is the book\u2019s spine. When assemble together, the Red Rising Tuck Box will look like a mini version of a book. The Back Card for the Red Rising Deck features the black wings from the Tuck Box, and also utilizes a combination of the Gold, Red and House Mars sigils. The Tuck Box will be printed on a premium paper stock. The Exterior will be printed with 4-Color Process + Silver FOIL. The Interior pattern design will be printed in 4-Color Process. HOUSE MARS DECK - The Tuck Box and Back Card for the House Mars Deck prominently features the House Mars sigil. It has rough texture imagery within the wolf head and is set off nicely with the contrast of the black rock texture background. Scattered throughout the Tuck Box and Back Card are elements of gold leaf designs. They symbolize an Iron Rain. The Tuck Box will be printed on a premium paper stock. The Exterior will be printed with 4-Color Process + Silver FOIL + Clear UV Spot Ink on the House Mars and Red sigils. The Interior will be flood-coated in PANTONE Black and the pattern will be stamped in Red FOIL. It will be extremely luxurious. HOLOGRAPHIC COLLECTOR CARDS - In addition to the complete set of 54 cards in every standard deck, each deck ordered will include an additional holographic card, picked randomly from the 54 unique possibilities in the deck. The holographic cards will be printed 4-Color Process on a Rainbow Foil material, with the House Mars back card design. The Red Rising Brick Box is a COMPLIMENTARY item that will be included with ANY order of 12 Decks (2 Brick Boxes with any 24 Decks, 3 Brick Boxes with any 36 Decks\u2026.). The Brick Box design features Briana\u2019s character drawings in all their glory! The front and back each contains a lineup of 6 characters, and the House Mars sigil is featured prominently on the top. The sides feature Eo and Darrow \u2018o Lykos, along with The Society pyramid and the quotes \u201cLive for more\u201d and \u201cBreak the chains\u201d. To ensure that everyone has an equal chance at grabbing one, the Silver Edition will be made available on Feb 16th promptly at Noon (Eastern) as two new pledge tiers. The Red Rising GILDED Set / Silver Edition Is LIMITED to a quantity of 250 (240 available). The Silver Edition will feature almost all the same details as the Gold Edition: a rigid 2-Deck Box with Magnetic Closure, 1 Red GILDED Red Rising Deck and 1 Black GILDED House Mars Deck. To differentiate between the unique editions, each Gilded Deck in the Silver Edition will include a Silver Foil Sticker on the left side of the Tuck. Each Sticker will be hand-numbered and will be hand-signed by Red Rising author Pierce Brown!\u00a0 The Red Rising GILDED Set is LIMITED to a quantity of 200 (190 available).

To add any extra items to your base Pledge Reward, see down below in the Risks and Chellenges section for detailed instructions. Please send me a PM if you have any questions or concerns (or e-mail me at midnightcard@yahoo.com). The Red Rising Decks will be printed by Legends Playing Card Co., with their China printer (and with their Classic Finish). The Classic Finish is a softer and slicker paper. It\u2019s more comparable to a vintage Bicycle Deck. This will be my sixth time printing with Legends Playing Cards. They do an amazing job!! Thank you from the Butterfields, PB Doodles and the team at Shit Escalates!",
  "On June 14th, 2014, four friends and I will travel on motorcycles through Latin America on the Pan-American Highway. The 6,000 mile journey will begin in Austin, Texas, and end in Mendoza, Argentina. During the trip, I plan on photographing and interviewing as many people as possible in order to share some of their stories.  When possible, I will ask individuals to write and share a story that relates to the image on the postcard. The postcards will be printed on a Canon Selphy CP 910, utilizing postcard grade paper, (Canon E-P50), and will be mailed from Latin America.\u00a0 Additionally, I plan on sharing 8\" x 12\", photographic prints with \nsponsors to share a memento of my journey through Latin America.  With the creation of an electronic zine, I will provide sponsors with an opportunity to gain a more in-depth understanding of the trip, places visited, and the individuals encountered.  Latin America is a complex and diverse part of the world, and \nany attempt to convey that can only provide a glimpse into the lives of \nindividuals who reside there.  Regardless, it is important for me to share the stories of individuals who I will encounter on the road.  Eventually, I plan on creating a multimedia, journalistic project that documents the journey, and individuals I encounter.  These are a few of my images from previous trips: ",
  "New Reach Goals Thank you everyone for backing and supporting us, we hit our target! \nWe are thrilled to know we can put on The Singh Project as a fantastic exhibition. To celebrate, we would like to add a couple of reach goals that will help to further expand the presence and potential of The Singh Project.\n If we hit \u00a310,000, all reward backers will receive an additional 6\u201d x 4\u201d print. If we hit \u00a315,000, all reward backers will receive an additional 12\u201d x 8\u201d print. \nPlease help us spread the word!\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is the SINGH project?\u00a0 SINGH is about the identity of British Sikh men. It\u2019s a celebration of the beard and the turban, a showcase of the styles and variety of how they are worn in modern Britain.\u00a0 We have photographed thirty-five Sikh men for the project and our aim is to hold an exhibition in the UK.\u00a0 Why did we do it?\u00a0 It sounds a bit strange, but part of the inspiration came from the sudden popularity in 2013 of the beard as a fashion statement. Billboards advertisements, magazine editorials, TV commercials all featured male models with sizeable beards.\u00a0 Being of the Sikh faith, we found this intriguing. In our culture the beard is a constant, a key tradition and an integral and important identifying feature of a Sikh male.\u00a0 Inspired, we developed a project focused on the identity, the look of the beard, and equally important, the turban of British Sikh men. We wanted to pay tribute to our heritage, but in an artistic style that expresses our skill and style as contemporary British photographers.\u00a0 How did we do it?\u00a0 We set about the task of finding and photographing Sikh men of different ages and from diverse occupational backgrounds, each with a unique look. From doctors to boxers, temple volunteers to magicians and I.T professionals to fashion stylists.\u00a0 The photographic execution was purposeful and deliberate. We photographed all of the subjects in our studio. By keeping the lighting, framing and our creative style and technique constant in each image, we wanted the subjects to be the centre of attention.\u00a0 The final result is a set of images full of character. They each engage with the viewer in a distinct way. A celebration of the Sikh religion, weaving through each unique portrait, uniting them, are the symbols of the faith - the beard and turban.\u00a0 The Exhibition\u00a0 The photographic element of the project has been completed and has been featured on many blogs and websites including the highly respected Its Nice That http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/amit-and-naroop\u00a0and Creative Review. It also has a great following on Facebook \u2013 www.facebook.com/singhproject\u00a0 Through Kickstarter, in the UK, 2014, our aim is to put on a fantastic exhibition that is contemporary and modern in its appearance, yet rooted in tradition and culture in its substance.\u00a0 The money raised will be used to:\u00a0 - Print the thirty five images from the project - Hire out a exhibition space to display the project\u00a0 - Print high quality booklets\u00a0 - Hold a private view event to showcase the exhibition\u00a0 We have always aimed to raise awareness on topics and issues that we feel passionate about through our work. SINGH is a project close to our heart. A marriage of our faith and skill, it represents our identity as British born photographers and our Punjabi, Sikh roots.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t reach our goal of \u00a37000 then we won\u2019t receive any money and the exhibition won\u2019t be possible.\u00a0 About Us Born into Sikh families and raised in Southall, West London, we came together nine years ago while working on a photo shoot for an unsigned music artist. The shoot went really well and the chemistry was instant. Amit and Naroop was formed.\u00a0 We continued working in music photography, developing our style and honing our craft, quickly building a name for ourselves while shooting some of the industries biggest stars including Tinie Tempah, 50 Cent and Jay Sean.\u00a0 Some of our clients include: BBC, Huawei, Universal Records, Sony Records, Warner Music, Parlophone Records, Universal Republic and Island Records. \u00a0 Celebrities we have worked with include: Ricky Gervais, Alex Zane, Nick Grimshaw, Lee Nelson and Example.\u00a0 As time has passed, we have broadened our horizons and our work has expanded to embrace advertising and portraiture, all interpreted with our characteristic passion and intense visual style.",
  "The delivery was expected to start in March of next year, but we are able to meet our deadlines earlier thanks to our backers\u2019 interest and support. The $99 reward will be delivered in December, and the $119 and $218 rewards will be delivered in January. Many of us maintain our health by going on diets and exercising. But have you ever experienced these problems below? You went on an extreme diet and worked out excessively based on your weight and BMI, But you ended up experiencing a yoyo-effect or other health problems. Then how can we properly go on a diet and manage our health? You should first check your body composition to take care of your health. Many people go to the fitness center to use the body composition analyzer machine because it is expensive and big to purchase to use at home. The problem nowadays is that many people are unwilling to go to the fitness center. However, there is a mini body composition analyzer device that resolves all these problems and provides the best motivation for diet and exercise. Fitrus Plus 2.0 raises awareness of your well-being beyond recommending workouts. It measures body compositions such as skeletal muscle mass anywhere at any time. It is a device that takes care of your health by measuring the heart rate and body temperature. Connecting the device to the app allows you to check your body condition every day. It basically acts as your personal trainer!\u00a0 Now, start your healthy life with Fitrus Plus 2.0. \u00a0 Do you doubt it\u2019s going to work properly because it\u2019s much smaller than standard body composition analyzer that you can find at the gym or the hospital? Fitrus Plus 2.0 not only measures body compositions, but also measures heart rate, stress level, body temperature, and even the temperature of other substances. It\u2019s beyond the standard body composition analyzer. Your weight on the scale doesn\u2019t hold much significance because it cannot tell you how healthy you are. Scale readings represent your total body mass including internal organs, muscles, bone, blood, fat, etc. One who seems to be thin can actually be overweight according to body compositions. Likewise, you can\u2019t figure out your exact internal body condition without knowing your body fat and muscle mass. Fitrus Plus 2.0 allows you to directly check your body composition and condition. You can simply check your body fat, skeletal muscle mass, BMI, basal metabolic rate, body water and step count all at once on the app. Additionally, it not only takes care of your body, but also looks after your psychological health by measuring your heart rate and stress level. The app allows you to check and control your body on your own. Fitrus Plus 2.0 is the best device that is beyond the standard body composition analyzer that can only analyze body compositions.\u00a0 It\u2019s unlikely for people to have large and expensive standard body composition analyzer device at home to use. Moreover, unless you\u2019re always at the fitness center or the hospital, it\u2019s inconvenient to visit those places every time you want to use it. Fitrus Plus 2.0 only weighs 45g and provides you more information than the standard body composition analyzer machine that generally weighs more than 15kg. It\u2019s a pocket sized device with excellent portability. With this device, you can just measure and analyze your body composition at home or even when you\u2019re traveling without having to visit the healthcare center. The app saves your body composition and bio-data in the cloud-based platform for it to be analyzed. Fitrus Plus 2.0 uses this data to provide a personalized service through the app.It analyzes your body composition, body shape, and even suggests appropriate meal plans and workout routines, which differentiates it from the existing body composition analyzing apps. The app distinguishes the somatotype based on OSD\u2019s self-researched body composition. It divides users into 3 body types, 25 specific subtypes, and provides a total of 139 comments regarding the health condition.\u00a0 Then it provides suitable health comments based on your results as well as the most appropriate exercise for your body. You can effectively manage your health since the recommended exercise also changes based on your changed body composition. Also, it prevents you from following impractical meal plans that ruin your health by providing dietary reference intakes. Many people who diet and workout normally keep track of their routine by writing it down. However, with Fitrus Plus 2.0, you don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore. You can simply check your data and the change in your body through the app since Fitrus Plus 2.0 uses the auto-tracking charts system that automatically records your data upon measurement. Line charts on the app allow you to intuitively see the change in your body. Fitrus Plus 2.0 is the best gym mate as well as a personal trainer. Even though it is easy for people to give up on exercise and diet, Fitrus Plus 2.0 motivates you to exercise and diet by showing visible changes in your body. Fitrus Plus 2.0 supports you psychologically and suggests the best exercising routine and meal plan for your body. Most wireless devices need to be connected to Bluetooth every time you use it. However, Fitrus Plus 2.0 doesn\u2019t require the standard pairing process because it has adopted the Bluetooth 4.0 BLE technology. With this technology, the device connects to the phone and the application automatically when you turn on the device. The device can also measure the body composition in 5 seconds, which allows you to check the data on your app right away. The device can also be kept safe and clean even when multiple people use it because it uses an IR sensor which measures the body temperature without contact. Besides measuring the body temperature, it can also measure the temperature of other substances like bath water. Thus, it is convenient to use in various areas in your daily life. You can use Fitrus Plus 2.0 in your everyday life anywhere in any situation since it is designed to be water-resistant. Also, it will be okay even if you drop the device by accident. It\u2019s extremely durable as it is made from a material that can withstand external impacts. Sometimes, you may find yourself in a situation where you just turn on the device and measure your body composition without bringing your phone with you. But that\u2019s alright because you can still check the basic body composition (e.g. step count, heart rate, remaining battery, temperature, and body fat) you measured lately through the OLED display in the middle of the device even without the app. Also, you don\u2019t have to bother about charging the device so often because you can use it for a maximum of 120 hours after charging it for just 3 hours. You can feel less concerned about the battery even when you travel far away or when you\u2019re very busy. Various aspects have been considered in the thorough development of Fitrus Plus 2.0. 1. Algorithm that utilizes Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis: BIA Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis focuses on the fact that \u2018water doesn\u2019t exist in fat, but it exists in muscles.\u2019 Thus, the \u2018impedance\u2019, the degree in which the electric current passes through according to the amount of water in the body, differs from person to person. The key is that electric currents flow through water, but not through fat. The amount of current that passes through your body based on the amount of body water is called impedance. If you lightly hold on to the electrodes of the device, it sends out harmless amount of minute electric currents to your torso. At this moment, the device checks the impedance and measures the amount of body fat. Also, the device measures the skeletal muscle mass, BMR, body water, etc. that contribute to the body development through the algorithm self-developed by OSD. The Bioelectrical Impedance analysis (BIA) is a safe and effective measuring method which analyzes the impedance value of the body. In order to provide more accurate measurement results, we\u2019ve adopted the self-developed algorithm that utilizes BIA and applied it to Fitrus Plus. Moreover, we are continuously carrying out the algorithm research by utilizing the continuously accumulating data. The results are being reflected on the application directly. The electrode contact method that separates the current and the electrode can be measured in the same way repeatedly because it always measures through the same points on the wrists. You can accurately measure your body composition since contact resistance that occurs on the skin does not affect the measurement. 2. Heart rate (BPM) and stress level measuring principle - PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) The PPG technique is a method that measures the amount of blood which passes through the blood vessels by illuminating the LED light on to the veins. Based on this method, the device calculates the heart rate (BPM) and stress level through OSD\u2019s self-developed algorithm. 3. Activity Measuring Principle The device calculates the number of steps by using the 3-axis accelerating sensor to acquire and process the data. Also, the device converts the measured number of steps into the amount of activity (travel distance, consumed calories) through the self-developed algorithm. This converted information is provided on the app in real time, which allows the user to monitor the quantified amount of activity in real time. Search \u2018Fitrus\u2019 on Google Play Store or Apple App Store and download the app. Turn on the Bluetooth on your smartphone and open the app. Create your account by filling in the user information. Turn on the device and press \u201cmeasure\u201d and \u201cstart\u201d in the consecutive order. The display will show \u2192\u2192\u2190\u2190 when the device and smartphone are connected properly. Check out the results through the Fitrus app. After turning on the power, press the touch sensor for 3 seconds to activate the one-touch function. You can also check the temperature through the OLED display even without the smartphone. However, the app will not save this value. The delivery was expected to start in March of next year, but we are able to meet our deadlines earlier thanks to our backers\u2019 interest and support. \u00a0The $99 reward will be delivered in December, and the $119 and $218 rewards will be delivered in January. \u00a0We developed the body composition measurement technology to help people build good habits for managing their health based on our accumulated data. We focused on our development to standardize the practice of analyzing body compositions. In July 2013, we\u2019ve also released a dissertation on how our device demonstrates 98% accuracy compared to professional medical devices. After putting in 4 years of our effort, we finally launched the portable body composition analyzer \u2018OneSmartDiet\u2019 in September 2015. After releasing \u2018OneSmartDiet\u2019, we were able to reach out to customers internationally through exhibitions in various countries, global crowdfunding, and online and offline sales, in which we received a lot of interest. After gathering diverse opinions on our device, we began the development of the next device in 2017. We found out that \u2018OneSmartDiet\u2019 device can be uncomfortable for foreigners to use due to its small size. Other feedbacks conveyed it doesn\u2019t have a display screen which shows the measurements and the remaining battery and that it doesn\u2019t have other additional functions besides the function that measures body compositions. Accordingly, we took these needs into consideration to develop our new device. For the software, we secured the connectivity and expandability of multiple devices by establishing the platform that can collect, save, and analyze various biometric data. Consequently, we can provide a high quality data analysis service. Moreover, we\u2019ve provided the body shape analysis service along with the body composition data, but received the feedback that we need to add more contents. Thus, we extended our service to include the meal plan management function and food/diet content and also upgraded the body shape analysis and guideline contents. We launched our very first \u2018Fitrus Plus\u2019 in July 2019 after working on development for almost two years. We received favorable and various reviews since we launched this product in the market. Then we immediately started to upgrade our product to fulfill customer satisfaction. Since then, we proceeded with the product advancement by carrying out our research and development for a year. We are developing our algorithm through continuous technological advancement to achieve systematic recalibration and high accuracy. We are also planning to provide services such as AI based meal plan analysis and counseling service, workout routine analysis and recommendation, and strengthened VR based exercise service. We applied more than 20 patents domestically and abroad so far (overseas application \u2013 4 cases, PCT \u2013 4 cases) and we were acknowledged for our innovativeness as we won the pitching contest and various awards internationally. We hope you pay attention to \u2018Onesoftdigm\u2019 that will be active in the global healthcare market in the near future. Hardware: improved the production method from ultrasonic wave fuse method to hook method / modified the backside design of the device / added the temperature measuring one-touch function. Software: improved the measuring accuracy through the algorithm enhancement of newly collected data / added the customized digital content of body shape analysis which applies the somato body type based on self-researched body composition / improved the usability by upgrading the app UI \u2018Fitrus' is a startup based in Silicon Valley that sells pocket-size health and fitness tracking device that Unmasks the New You. According to Douglass Lee, the founder of Onesoftdigm, he was overweight and diagnosed with pre-diabetes when he was 15 years old, which was a huge wake-up call in his life. Not only did he try numerous weight loss programs, but also purchased various fitness devices to use for losing weight. However, it was impossible for him to find weight loss programs and fitness gears that were effective for his specific body type. This motivated him to come up with Fitrus, the body composition analyzer. Our team is happy to introduce Fitrus, a pocket-sized health and fitness tracking device that measures, analyzes, and timely reports accurate biometric data along with various digital health contents to Unmask the New You. This campaign is powered by FUNDINGINSIDER. Prepare your campaign's consulting, video production, and general marketing with us. This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them. Our goal is to allow people to easily measure their body composition and use the collected data to create good health managing habits. Accordingly, we\u2019ve persistently carried out campaigns on global crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Makuake, etc. We received a lot of attention from the world\u2019s early adapters by successfully raising more than $230,000 in funding. Thanks to our backers\u2019 support, we were able to successfully complete all our campaigns and shipping. We took into consideration the opinions of 2,194 backers who\u2019ve participated in funding in order to create Fitrus Plus. Based on our backers\u2019 feedback in the past campaigns, we were able to complete the production of the upgraded Fitrus 2.0. The current Fitrus Plus 2.0 is not a prototype. We are ready for the final production and we\u2019ve already tested our product by making hundreds of prototypes. If we complete our campaign successfully, we will start the production right after the day the funding ends. Then we will ship the products 3 months later. We look forward to openly receiving feedbacks on Kickstarter, which we believe to be the optimal stage for us the launch Fitrus Plus 2.0.

  "The fishing industry amounts to 35.8% of the world\u2019s equipment market, which makes up the largest market size of $788,000,000. Moreover, the number of people who participate in recreational fishing is increasing annually.\u00a0 Unlike the past, closed season has been created to protect the nature. The catch and release culture is continuously spreading among people who take part in sports fishing. However, many modern people who engage in recreational fishing find it difficult to enjoy their time and also protect the nature. The problem is that fish can get burns from the relatively high temperature of people\u2019s hands when they hold it for measuring its weight and length. Also, people can get scars from the sharp teeth and scales of the fish. We recommend the Halasz Fishing Grip to people who want to contribute to conserving the environment while adhering to the 'closed season' that is spreading all over the world. This product is differentiated from other existing products that can only measure either the weight or the length. With the Halasz Fishing Grip, you can safely enjoy fishing and also protect the environment. While getting ready to go out fishing, have you ever felt inconvenience from having to gather the tapeline, scale, fishing grip, etc. each individually and carry the heavy weight in order to measure the length and weight of the fish and pull it up without hurting it? \u00a0 The Halasz Fishing Grip can simply resolve these problems all at once. Now, you don\u2019t have to worry about carrying all the heavy equipment. The Halasz Fishing Grip can resolve this problem for you since it only weighs 0.66lb (300g) for a 3 in 1 measuring tool that combines the scale, tapeline, and grip! Start your convenient and smart recreational fishing lifestyle with the \u2018Halasz Fishing Grip\u2019. Click here to read the Mr. Gadget's article. The Halasz Fishing Grip is the world\u2019s first fishing grip that connects with an application through Bluetooth. The Halasz app uses the big data technology to provide online fishing tournaments for people at different locations to participate in. In the near future, the app will also utilize the predictive API of deep learning AI and big data to support fish species distinction technology, predictive fishing information (date, weather, location, etc.) service, and also chat bot service. If you take pictures within the Halasz app, it not only shows fish measurements, but also provides pictures that include fishing information such as date, weather, location, etc. The app eliminates the hassle of having to individually measure the weight and length and search for the date, weather, location, etc. as it automatically measures and reports the information. You can participate in online fishing tournament with the automatically recorded information the app provides. online fishing tournament, participators don\u2019t have to limit themselves to certain areas and times for fishing unlike other existing online fishing tournaments that limit the time and restrict them to certain areas. It is convenient because they can fish in any location, they desire during the tournament period and register the measurements and fishing information to participate in the tournament. \u00a0Moreover, Halasz app will save the fish measurements and other fishing information for you to see them later as soon as you upload the provided picture, The app is in the process of developing into a fishing exclusive SNS platform for communication, information sharing, and fishing contests among users. We are currently researching and developing a method to adopt the deep learning AI technology to detect the fish in the picture taken through the app and distinguish its species based on its learned information. Since there is a learning function in the technology, its ability to distinguish fish species will become more accurate as the usage increases. In the future, we will update the app with the fish distinction function. The Halasz Fishing Grip is smart in that it shows information such as weight and length on the LCD screen of the device and on the Halasz app simultaneously. Basically, you can check the measurements even if you don\u2019t have your mobile phone with you.\u00a0 Many people who participate in recreational fishing like to fish while traveling around the world. However, what if people who meet at a certain fishing area while traveling find it difficult to share and understand the information about the fish they\u2019ve caught due to having different measuring units? And what if you want to give the fishing product as a gift to relatives or family members who live in another country? The Halasz Fishing Grip can be used in any location in our world since the measuring units can be easily converted through the setting to suit different countries. It has been designed so that anyone can use the unit he/she is most familiar with. We have currently completed the development for automatically converting units in the fishing grip device once you convert the units of length and weight in the Halasz app. Now, without having to convert units respectively, you can just convert the units in the application and the units in the fishing grip device will be automatically converted as well. When people go out fishing, they become exposed to the external environment such as water, moisture, and sand, along with the equipment. Moreover, when you use the equipment, it can also slip out of your hand and drop. Nevertheless, the Halasz Fishing Grip relieves your worries since it has been created for long-term usage without malfunctioning. It is proven to be strong and durable as it has been through drop, waterproof, and dust proof tests. \u00a0 After using it, it\u2019s important to clean the tapeline before you withdraw it and the external part of the grip with a dry towel or tissue. The viscous fluid of fish that comes in contact with the fishing grip can cause the water to stay on the device if you do not dry it off. Just as you would take care of your fishing rod by cleaning off the sea salt water, cleanly maintaining your fishing grip will allow you to use it safely and pleasantly for a longer period of time. In addition, anyone can use it regardless of which hand (left or right) he/she uses due to its ergonomically designed structure. The structure of the grip is made to appropriately grab the fish mouth, which allows you to hold on to the fish strongly. Enjoy fishing in a smarter and more convenient way with Halasz Fishing Grip! The measurement accuracy in the existing RPM counter measurement method is often reduced due to the projection speed and foreign substances. Also, the existing optical sensor measurement method may provide less accuracy than the RPM counter measurement method since there\u2019s a high chance for the equipment to become damaged from external impact. However, there are no errors that arise from external factors in the Halasz Fishing Grip because it is equipped with the weight measuring sensor that has been developed in-house from its company. Halasz has adopted the barcode scanner sensor and newly developed RPM counter sensor in its device. The device uses the strain gauge sensor and adjustable resistance, which allows you to comfortably take measurements through its rotation rate measurement and code reader. It minimizes the error rate of the measured value to guarantee accuracy within the range of \u00b11.0mm. Make the most of your sports fishing life with the Halasz Fishing Grip. It is differentiated from other existing uncomfortable and cumbersome fishing grips. It is the one and only product that allows you to enjoy fishing without distractions. The power turns on if you press on the power button for around 3 seconds, which also automatically resets the weight and length information. Turn on the Bluetooth on your mobile device and connect to \u2018Halasz Fishing Grip\u2019 in the Halasz app setting. Once you establish this connection, the device will automatically connect to the app the next time you use it. When you connect the device to the app, you can measure the fish and take its picture to receive another picture that includes the fishing information (date, weather, location, etc.). Use the provided picture to experience various contents on the Halasz app. You can comfortably measure the weight by using the strain gauge sensor on the fishing grip that is made for safely pulling up the fish. Also, the rotation rate can be measured easily since the device adopts the RPM counter sensor, and the length can be measured comfortably through the bar code reader. The product provides excellent accuracy by minimizing the error rate of measured values. The measured information can be checked in real time on the Halasz FishingGrip\u2019s LCD screen and on the Halasz app when the product is connected to the app through the BLE communication. The app is very user-friendly and convenient because when a picture is taken, it provides the measurements as well as other fishing information. You can even upload pictures on your SNS account and enjoy various contents within the app.\u00a0 Our team has researched and developed the Halasz Fishing Grip for around 4 years. We\u2019ve continuously developed its design and technology, and we were finally able to complete its final form in the current state by going through 3 prototypes. We\u2019ve persistently carried out our research for not only the product, but also for creating the new application which hasn\u2019t previously existed. As a result, we were able to online fishing tournament that allows people to fish in their desired areas without having to go to specific areas for the tournament. Furthermore, we were able to develop the big data and deep learning AI technology. We\u2019ve also developed the fish species distinction function, automatic weather function measurement function. In efforts to provide higher quality app services, we are continuously researching on convenient services such as the chat-bot service. ATOZSOFT CORPORATION, which is leading the marine leisure IT industry, is a professional developing company established in 2012. It provides services such as on-board fishing reservation platform, fish measuring brand and recreational fishing exclusive AI social media platform. As a professional marine tourism IT company, it provided convenience and practicality for recreational anglers when they measure the fish by launching and servicing its first product \u2018Halasz Tag\u2019 (AR based fish length measuring tag). Its second product \u2018Halasz Fishing Grip\u2019 (IoT fishing grip that simultaneously measures the weight and length of fish) has been developed based on the needs of recreational anglers who use the \u2018Halasz Tag\u2019. It aims to offer more convenience and practicality than the existing product. This campaign is powered by FUNDINGINSIDER.

  "I started embroidering recently and then I thought about how I can use the stuff I made. Then I saw this beret in a shop and I thought of putting patches on it. \u00a0Afterwards I pitched it to a friend and she was like \"Let's start a Kickstarter\" :D",
  "This Kickstarter is for a softcover book provided through print on demand (POD) and a pdf file which details a point-based system for building balanced heritages for use in Level Up: Advanced Fifth Edition. \u00a0This book is being produced by a third party developer (me!). I was delighted to be part of the Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition (A5e) design team and work with so many talented writers and designers. \u00a0As well as creating interesting and varied gameplay with interesting choices at every level, I found their ingenuity and problem solving approaches to be really inspiring. One of the concept in A5e I was particularly inspired by was the heritage system and the use of cultures. \u00a0With that simple step, I realised, it became possible to integrate character design and world building, to give worlds depth and flavour in a way which they struggled to achieve without 1000's of words of lore in other editions. With this product you will be able to give players what they want, the realisation of their fantasies and the ability to play new and interesting shaped creatures without having to worry about whether they're balanced. \u00a0All you have to do is follow the instructions, use the templates, count up the values assigned and you can have merfolk, big tree people and unicorns in your game. \u00a0I'm even giving some of these ideas away FREE on DTRPG so you can try before you buy. If you'd like to see a video or hear a podcast, or read an interview about what's been going on with the project, then there's a media tab at the end. Have you ever just really wanted a point system to give ease of use to homebrewing player heritages? Have you ever sighed because some of your players have Darkvision and some don't and thought \"I wish I could sort this\"? Have you ever felt frustrated because one of your players just wants to fly, but it's really hard to balance around? Have you ever had someone say \"I want to play a Unicorn\"? and it just wasn't possible? Have you ever wanted to give cultures a real go in your game? \u00a0Give them mechanical teeth and support so that players want to play to the cultures as written? Have you ever just wanted to experiment with how your heritages are used in the game but you've just not felt confident to balance it? If you answered yes to any of those questions, than this is very definitely for you. If you're already doing all of the above, but want a resource with some fun ideas, then this is also for you! If you just want to add another gorgeously laid out RPG book to your collection... well... wouldn't this make a fine addition? :) Promises are alright, but you're here on Kickstarter where talk is cheap. \u00a0Why not get a free taste of some of the things you get. \u00a0Maybe this solves all your problems and you don't need the book anymore? \u00a0That's ok! \u00a0I'm just glad I could help! The Arboreals, when you're too big to be a dryad, but you still gotta be a tree. \u00a0Click through for the DTRPG link to a free download! I like these so much I want them out in the wild! Share them with your friends! Merfolk, under the ocean, you'll cause a commotion! \u00a0I've never even been offered the chance to play a mermaid. \u00a0Can you believe that? I know, shocking, so here's your opportunity to make it right. \u00a0Gift someone the chance to go down where it's wetter so life can be better! As you can see, my words are good, but my layout? Abysmal! \u00a0That's why I'm doing this Kickstarter. \u00a0With your money I can pay a very talented layout artist to turn my functional, but aesthetically displeasing words, into the gorgeous eye candy that you deserve.\u00a0 \u00a0The writing on the book is finished so the fulfilment will be very quick indeed. I have compiled a list and assigned values of all the things you might want from a culture. \u00a0Not only do you get the values assigned to many of the Adventurer's Guide cultures, but you also get my own creations and ideas which you can use straight out of the box or as a framework to gauge your own creations by! \u00a0You can use this with a template that I provide to produce your own heritages to give to your players. Making heritages and cultures has never been easier! As a special bonus, everyone who backs the Kickstarter will get 3 backgrounds never seen or published by Advanced Fifth edition that will fill in the gaps left in the Adventurer's Guide. \u00a03 more backgrounds to round it up to the 18 you know you deserve. YES! In addition to the worked examples given, I'll be throwing in some extra special language rules to help YOU make your world special and unique. \u00a0At these kinds of prices, you're rarely going to see better value.\u00a0 If you want to be able to create your own heritages If you want to be able to create your own cultures If you want to be able to create your own backgrounds If you want an easy to use system for all of the above Then please, pledge for the Kickstarter, before it's too late. This project has been kindly covered with Morrus from EN Publishing on Morrus' Unofficial Tabletop RPG Talk (we talk about it after covering the RPG news at about 49:22) (a podcast about RPG news, which in fairness, I do co-host).\u00a0 I also did an interview with the lovely people at The Rising of Chicanery, a group dedicated to enhancing creativity! Although I see I am BAD at getting to the point when talking (go for the 26.00 min mark if you're more interested in the book than me), the book is honestly a lot more concise! The talented Egg Embry who keeps tabs on the Crowdfunding news wrote a piece that made it into ENworld!\u00a0 $8,000/\u00a35,900: Hardship fund! \u00a0Free, editable templates for everybody! As those of you who have had experience of my programming know, I am very committed to the belief that role-playing games are for everyone. \u00a0At this level of funding I'm pleased to announce that, due to the generosity of you, the backers, a hardship fund will be created which will allow the distribution of 100 free copies to gamers who cannot afford the full price. I will also ensure that the templates for creation of the heritages, cultures, and backgrounds are up on DrivethruRPG and our best efforts will be made to ensure that they're editable. $9,000/\u00a36,600: Surprise Art Money! As designers of RPG books now, being able to specify great art costs, and rightly so! \u00a0As this project was initially aimed at what I felt to be an ambitious $300 mark, I had a big fat zero in the art budget. \u00a0\u00a0Fortunately, there exists amazing sites where you can use the art there free, to help creative endeavours like this one. The majority of the art in this book was created for free under a creative commons licence which did not require acknowledgment of the artists or their website, obviously, because I'm not a monster, I've always had the artists' names in the credits. At this level of funding, a contribution (which will doubtless be unexpected) will be sent to all the artists who contributed art, along with our fulsome thanks. \u00a0\u00a0I'm sure they would appreciate the exposure, but they'll appreciate some money more! $10,000/\u00a37,400: A new PDF arises! Randomised culture generation! I will create as a separate PDF. \u00a0a randomised culture generation table and also produce, as a free download, a listing of all the tables for your convenience, which will contain page references to the Adventurer's Guide and also to the book itself. $11,000/\u00a38,100: Doubling up the hardship funds! An \"Inside Design\" Case Study of Failure The number of copies available in the hardship fund will double to 200. A further PDF \"Case Study in Failure\" will be produced. \u00a0This will be a small case study about what it is that is required to do good A5e rules and how you would go about cracking it. \u00a0I don't know if this will be useful, but you don't find a lot of examples of things going wrong, so there we are. $12,000/\u00a38,800: A Youtube Series about how to design heritages, cultures and backgrounds I will attempt to do a Youtube video series about how to use this supplement and talk about some of the ideas that inspired it, and be taking suggestions on how to create it. $13,000/\u00a39,500: Hardship fund expansion! At this level of funding we will be immensely proud to add an extra 300 copies to the hardship fund. $14,000/\u00a310,300: It is your Destiny! I will also create a pdf document exploring how to go about creating Destinies. \u00a0For those backers who don't know, a Destiny is how you gain inspiration in advanced fifth edition, whether it's by learning through failure, squaring up against intimidating foes or just acquiring lucre and loot, Destiny gives you inspiration, an inspiration feature and for Narrators and DMs? \u00a0Instant plot hooks! \u00a0Nice.",

Inspired by the dragons of mythology and classic fantasy fiction, Deadly Dragons Dire and Daunting features a host of tables to make each dragon unique: their physical features, appearance, powers, breath, treasure hoard, lair and psychological traits, fears and desires, as well as their enemies and allies, and quests involving the beast. These tables are perfect to create dragon-centered quests, or even a whole dragon-hunting campaign! The first three zines have already been released as electronic/print-at-home zines, and they've been very well received by the Old-School Essentials community. You can check them for yourself, and even get them for free! So why should you back this project? Back this project to have them all collected in a single nice hardcover book, and to also get the fourth and fifth zine, Pious Prayers and Powerful Prodigies and Deadly Dragons Dire and Daunting, which are and will remain exclusive to the Axian Library book! But there's more: this project gives us the opportunity to expand the contents of the\u00a0zines with RUNIC SCROLL OF STRETCH GOALS! These are the stretch goals we are confident to add to the Axian Library book without delaying the delivery, if you help this project go beyond the funding goal! Thanks to your incredible support, we've had to put the Axian Librarian on triple shift with that read magic spell, and also hire a bunch of magic-user retainers to help! Update 15/02/2022: The scroll holds no secrets anymore! All stretch goals have been unlocked! ALL GOALS UNLOCKED! Axian Library is going to be a PDF for all backers, and a 5.5\" x 8.5\" hardcover book for backers of the print pledge. Both versions feature a color cover by Igor Piccirillo, black and white interiors, and also the same art found in the original e-zines by talented Carlos Castilho, Denis McCarthy, J. M. Woiak, Heather Shinn, Jack Badashski, and Daniel F. Walthall. Both versions will be fulfilled via DriveThruRPG. Backers\u00a0of all pledge levels will receive the PDF as soon as it is finalized! Backers of the print version will receive a voucher to order the book at print cost (around $7/\u20ac6, but may increase slightly depending on final page count, which will be affected by unlocked stretch goals, and may be affected by price changes outside our control).\u00a0 Print books will take a little more time than the PDFs for two reasons: we need to create a separate file specific for the print version, and we also must order, receive and approve a proof print copy before we make it available. Assuming nothing is wrong with the first proof print, the whole process should be done in two to four months months. We are offering a Signed Print Pledge. Backers of the Signed Print Pledge will be required to pick it up at the Goblin Caf\u00e9 in Pisa, ITALY. No shipping, sorry! Shane had the patience to listen to my funny Italian accent and made me a lot of questions at his awesome podcast, come have a listen! \u00a0 Lands of Legends was our offering for ZineQuest 3. We've decided to offer it up again at a special price as part of this crowdfunding for those who might have missed it. Lands of Legends is a series of five zines, each with a theme: Each of them features 100 special areas and 100 unique encounters, sorted by ten different terrain types. \u00a0The whole series gets you 500 areas and 500 encounters! Lands of Legends is the perfect resource if you want to create a sandbox/hexcrawl campaign with plenty of interesting places to explore and events to roll! Immediate delivery: TheLands of Legends series is already available, which means you'll receive the PDF (and print vouchers for print backers!) as soon as the campaign ends and Kickstarter gives us the confirmed backers list, which will probably take no more than two weeks!",
  "\u00a0Well, hi there! Come on in... would you like a cup of tea? We're The Teacups, an unaccompanied foursome focusing on traditional material, who met in 2010 on the Newcastle University Folk & Traditional Music degree. We've been working on new material for some time, for our third album, and we need your help to bring it to life! The idea is simple - you buy it early, and we get to finish making it!\n\nWe love the versatility and vibrancy of the human voice, and exploring what it can do. Singing together is life-changing, empowering, therapeutic and an enormous joy, and we love being able to perform for, and with, our audiences, finding both a great strength and vulnerability in the unaccompanied voice.\n The band consists of - always from left to right - Will Finn, tenor and arranger extraordinaire, Rosie Calvert, songwriter and soprano, Alex Cumming, accordion supremo and bass, and Kate Locksley, broadside nut and alto. Over the last 8 years, we've travelled the length of the UK and beyond, meeting many amazing people and performing our unadorned, gutsy singing, with inventive and sensitive arrangements, encouraging all of our audiences to get involved and sing along with us, learning the words and the tune together with us as you go, if you didn't know them before.\u00a0 Our debut release, 'One For The Pot' (2013), revelled in the vibrancy of youth, and all that heartache, confusion, and euphoria that goes with it. We took a step forward with our second release,'Of Labour and Love' (2015), an offering which showcased our growth both in the development of material and sound. In the past couple of years people have said time and time again, 'Oh. I've got both of those... when are you going to do a new one?' and we're pleased to say that the answer is NOW!\n\u00a0 \u00a0We feel that this album will be a step forward for us, as we've set ourselves many new challenges in the past couple of years. There's a new set of mouth music that we've chosen and arranged, a self-penned protest song, new re-workings of traditional snippets, a celebration of new life, and of course some of the classic folk song material, like shanties, hunting songs, and the difficulties of life, love and loss. There might even be a song about tea (finally).\u00a0 When we made our first two albums, we were still at University, which meant that we had access to studio space and equipment for free, and were able to produce work on a shoestring budget! This time around however, we'll be recording in an excellent and stylish new professional studio (thestudioatsunbeams.co.uk), and we want to make our next album as polished and beautiful as possible. We will be recording with the outstanding Pete Ord who we have worked with before when we recorded our second album 'Of Labour And Love'. Pete did such a stunning job and is such fun to work with, we can't wait to get back in the studio under his masterful hand - and that's where you come in. We're really excited to be crowd-funding this project, because it means that the cash doesn't need to come from some outside source (like a record company) who we would then be beholden to - it can come from people who love our music and want to help us create more of it! The power of crowds is an impressive and wonderful thing.\u00a0 Making an album is really difficult at the best of times, but is especially difficult when you are based so far apart, as we are (Alex now lives full-time in the USA). We've already begun recording the new album and we're making good progress, but we need to fund the rest of it.\u00a0 To be able to fund the remaining production and release, we need your help raising \u00a36,500.\u00a0 This can be broken down into costing for:\u00a0 - Recording - Mastering\u00a0 - Artwork\u00a0 - Manufacture\u00a0 - PR & launch costs\u00a0 Plus a little bit extra to cover Kickstarter's fees and misc expenses!\u00a0 It may sound like a large sum (and it is), but we are fully committed to making this our best release yet, and are working with the best sound engineers, studios, designers and photographers, who all do amazing work and deserve to be paid accordingly. Also, our love of what we do means that we want to make a stand-out recording, celebrating unaccompanied folk singing, and taking it to a wider audience than ever before.\u00a0 We're really hoping that you will feel able to support us, and every penny counts! From a single download, to a simple album pre-order, to a music bundle, to a house concert, or even a lesson with one of the band, a house concert or workshop, there should be something you'd like. And if there's something you'd like that isn't featured, then just drop us a line and we'll see what we can do.\n\nIf you don't feel able to contribute financially, we'd really appreciate your help in getting the word out as far and wide as possible, so all likes, shares, comments, and retweets are very much appreciated!\u00a0 Thanks for taking the time to read up on our Kickstarter campaign. Catch you down the road somewhere.\u00a0 Will, Rosie, Alex, & Kate - The Teacups",
  "In the summer of 2017, I started working on my fourth recording with producer Tino Zolfo, who I met years ago at our local cafe, The Common. We made a few demos back in 2009, which turned out to be magical little tunes. Little did we know that our work together would lead to a full length recording almost a decade later. Over the last year, we\u2019ve crafted a beautiful 10 song recording, which is due out in early 2019. The album even includes two of the original demos and one of them, This Is My Room, has become the title track for the album. The funds you contribute to this project will help cover manufacturing costs, design, some DIY videos, promotion and paying a band so we can celebrate this project with some live shows. These are all post-production costs because the recording is finished and just waiting to leap into your hands. Your contribution will get you a pre-purchase of the album, a few extras and best of all, lots of good feelings for supporting local, independent music. The release of my last album, Get Yourself Home, coincided with some hard times, especially my father\u2019s sudden death in 2012. Then, four years later my son\u2019s father, Paul passed away from cancer. During that time, I got to know something about grief and how it can take your voice away; the sensation of not wanting to open my mouth to make a sound and the strangeness of not being moved by music was new for me. Over time, grief loosened its grip and a lightness returned. I discovered something new about music in that quiet time: that singing is about finding a thread attached to hope, something like singing for the spirit of music itself, filling that well, wherever it exists. The album title, This Is My Room, comes from this journey. My musical story is also about being a single mother, trying to keep my music going against the demands of everyday life, with a nod to Virginia Woolfe\u2019s, \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own.\u201d Tino got the project going by letting the drummer follow me and my \u2018broken wheel\u2019 guitar playing, which became the basis for the groove. He filled in the bass and even encouraged me to play bass on a few tracks (my first time). Many of the vocals were recorded in one take, as if the songs had a mind of their own. We wanted the album to sound stripped down, with lots of groove and the lyrics front and centre, something I think we acheived. Every song we recorded for you is a small, sweet gem. These superb Toronto musicians contributed to the album: Lyle Molzan (drums); Rebecca Hennessy (trumpet and flugelhorn); Tania Gill (accordion); Tom Richards (trombone); Tino Zolfo (bass and all the extras). And I sang my heart out and strummed my guitar, just the way I always do. Ari Rhodes did an amazing job mixing and mastering the album. You heard a little bit of the song, Country Girl, on the Kickstarter Video. I shot the video from the car on a road trip from Ottawa back to Toronto, taking a turn off Highway 7. The field video was shot by my friend Lynn Bishop at The Everdale Farm, which was originally called The Everdale Place \u2014 a free school modeled after Summerhill School in England, established by A. S. Neill in 1921. I went to\u00a0 school there from age four to seven where my father taught and was one of its founders. Lynn and I happened to meet for the first time at a friends wedding, only to discover we had this amazing shared Everdale experience \u2014 at the time she was living and working there. When I thought about walking in the field again, I knew Lynn was the perfect person to shoot the video. We're also working on a full length video for the song.",
  "\"I Love My Life\" is an interactive mixed media performance art project to raise a sense of gratitude & awareness of one's surroundings worldwide.\u00a0 The Loving Life Coalition was formed by the\n band Lo Fly Kickaz, spiritual record label Skillful Methods Records, and filmmaker Melissa Balin, to encourage interactive participation from around the globe.\u00a0  A FREE Downloadable & Embeddable Kickstarter Backer \nAppreciation Video will include Kickstarter backers names, as well as your submissions of photos, video and \nmixed media expressing Loving Life, alongside celebrities and Friends of The Loving Life Coalition edited to the infamous \"Kickstart\" B-side PaliGap homage remix being produced by Grammy-winning Bobby Ozuna. The monies raised through Kickstarter are to cover the production expenses of LIVE \"I Love My Life\" Performance Art pieces around the globe from Summer Solstice 2011 to Summer Solstice 2012.\u00a0 Because Kickstarter is an All-Or-Nothing Crowd-Funding model, we are setting our Phase One goal as low as the minimum required to legally place signage reminding people to Love Life in prominent public places...Phase One is estimated at approximately:\u00a0 $1,000.00 When we meet our goal of $1k, we will continue to raise funds through Kickstarter to achieve Phase Two and beyond, until our campaign ends on the full moon September 12 at 11:59pm PST.\u00a0 Phase Two will include a Production RV type of vehicle for filming and as a mobile GreenRoom of sorts during Burning Man 2011 and beyond.\u00a0 Craft Services and drinking lots of water are keys to Loving Life ;)\u00a0 ...Phase Two is estimated at approximately:\u00a0 $3,700.00  Given that we have high hopes, and plans to continue the global Performance Art\n Project throughout the year until the following Summer Solstice; we \nwill continue to raise funds through Kickstarter to achieve Phase Three and beyond, to ensure that the Project will continue and incorporate \"I Love My Life\" Live Performance Art quarterly in various cities.\u00a0 Phase Three is estimated at approximately:\u00a0 $7,000.00 Until our campaign ends on September 12 at 11:59pm PST, we will continue to spread the word to raise the ideal amount of capital in order to cover production and logistical costs of Phase Four- including but not limited to; dvd duplication, printing, and mastering, as well as International LIVE Performance Art dates.\u00a0 Phase Four: is estimated at approximately $25,000 Whether or not you contribute to the Loving Life Coalition financially- we ask that you TAKE THE PLEDGE TO LOVE LIFE and FORWARD TO A FRIEND!\u00a0 After all, \"Positivity has a direct relativity to our frequency collectively delectably!\"",
  "The Glass City Phantom Orchestra is a Troupe of Musicians and Performers seeking to hold unexpected performances of haunting beauty around the Toledo, OH area.\u00a0 Silent ghostly figures appear amongst the crowd, take their places, and begin playing beautiful musical arrangements on classical instruments while another specter dances about to draw the crowd's attention and mind into the experience. After the final note plays, without a single word ever spoken, the apparitions silently depart, vanishing back to wherever they had come.  We seek to bring haunting beauty into the lives of the unsuspecting audience, cultivating an experience of the fantastic and ethereal, while also showcasing the skills of young artists and developing their performance experience.\u00a0 The talent gathered for this troupe includes costumers, videographers and photographers, as well as musicians, of course! All talent is from the Toledo area and most are college students or recent graduates.\u00a0 The musical arrangements we plan to perform will range from moving classical pieces to instrumental arrangements and interpretations of modern music, similar to those performed by the Vitamin String Quartet. Toledo, OH and the surrounding areas have a great number of public events, festivals and fairs through out the year that gather people together, providing an excellent opportunity to perform unexpectedly, creating delight and wonder in the gathered audience. By 'piggy-backing' on other events, the troupe can perform before people who may otherwise have never sought out this type of performance, and the troupe need not worry about marketing or overhead costs that would be required for a more traditional performance. We seek funding to give at least five high quality performances within the six months following funding. These\u00a0performances\u00a0will be announced to backers at the $100 and higher level as soon as the troupe commits to them in our 'Premonitions' newsletter.\u00a0 The funds raised by this Kickstarter will pay for a number of items necessary to make this production successful. The funds will help us pay for costumes, equipment such as chairs and music stands, DVD and photo production, rehearsal space and refreshments, permitting costs and vehicle (van) rental if needed, and minor instrument maintenance.

  "\u00a0I am a child psychologist, certified mindfulness expert and an artist who has a passion for introducing my clients to the significance of their inner world. As a child psychologist, I created a children\u2019s book series called Brilliant Brown Babies which focuses on self-development and self-love with an emphasis on diversity. Recently, I have been exploring how to expand my message to older children and adults in a way that is fun, positive and unique. That is how Glo was born! Glo is my concept for a mobile aura photography company where patrons would be given the magical opportunity to see their aura through the use of a rare specialized technology. Learning about your aura can give insight into who you are at a soul level and develop a consciousness of who we are beyond the physical body. This self-awareness could be the spark to perpetuating positive change. Being a mobile company would allow me to spread my message all over the country without the confines of a brick and mortar. This concept also aligns with my mission of emphasizing diversity in spaces of healing. While healing practices originated in indigenous societies all over the world, the assimilation of new age practices (ie. Yoga, aura reading, reiki, crystal healing etc.) in North America has traditionally been lead by Caucasian practitioners. While many of these practitioners are extremely skilled and well respected, people of color have widely been left out of the narrative. Despite, the interest and demand in aura photography worldwide, there is currently only one commercial African American aura photographer in the world. As an African American woman, I can attract diverse audiences that may have otherwise felt unwelcome in new age healing spaces. I believe this could open new doors to self-discovery and development as a society! Your aura is the energy field radiating from your physical body. It represents your feelings and experiences at a certain point in time. Auras are fluid and can change over time. Your aura can also change depending on who you are with and where you are. While the aura is invisible to the naked eye, there are brilliant colors glowing from within! Each color and placement is associated with different traits that tell the story of your soul. In 1939, Semyon and Valentina Kirlian discovered \u201cKirlian photography\u201d. This form of photography captured electrical emanations on film, which they believed were depictions of the \u201caura\u201d. In the 1970s, Guy Coggins used the ideology of Kirlian photography to create his own camera called the AuraCam 6000. The camera is hooked up to two charged metal plates containing biofeedback centers. A subject places their hands on the sensors as the camera opens for a long double exposure, creating both a headshot and a colorful auric capture layered on top. It\u2019s literaly snapshot of your energy in the current moment! The camera and film used to photograph auras is very rare and very expensive! Below is an estimated price breakdown of the equipment that would be needed to start this business. AuraCam 6000 - $15,698 + shipping and handling 290 Xtra Manfrotto Tripod - $200 Elgato Ring Light - $200 Heavy Duty Rolling Suitcases for Carrying - $200 10 packs of FujiFilm Instax - $200 Custom Neon Tabletop Sign - $200 Backdrop - $60 Custom Interpretation Cards - $150 Personalized Business Cards - $150 Small Keepsake Boxes for Photos - $200 Small Foldable Table for hand plates - $60 Bench - $100 Website & marketing - $100 Thank you so so much for taking the time to read my proposal! I hope to meet you and your glo one day soon! Love and light",
  "In December 2018 I met some friends for trivia and a few beers, a typical Wednesday night in Northeast Ohio. \u00a0I was excited about an upcoming trip to Egypt and I explained to my little group about my soon-to-be visit to the Pyramids; a cruise down the Nile and a stop at the Valley of the Kings. They all looked at me, slack-jawed, as if I was signing my own death warrant. \u00a0One of them even exclaimed that I was going to get my head chopped off by some \"crazy guy.\" I was shocked. \u00a0Both at how little my friends thought of other parts of the world and secondly by how much American media had informed their view of the world and its people. I then spent twenty glorious days on the Mother Continent, following up the Egyptian sojourn with a safari in Kenya. \u00a0I took lots of photos, \u00a0was exposed to the Maasai people of Kenya and the hearty laughs of dozens of Egyptians, Nubians, and other African cultures. The only thing I was met with in Egypt were hugs, a new understanding of a culture much different than my own and plenty of love from my new Egyptian friends. In 2020 I had plans to return to Africa and several other places around the world to put together a photo project just to show my friends (and prove just how wrong they were about \"foreign\" places) when Covid struck. \u00a0 I've been lucky over the last few years and have been able to visit a few new places since March of 2020 (such as Ecuador and two of its Amazon Basin indigenous villages, as well as an extended stay in Morocco and all of its wonders). \u00a0 But, the bulk of the project was put on hold due to the logistics of visiting unique and interesting places during a global pandemic. The goal of this project is to show the world just how alike we all are, as opposed to how different we may seem. \u00a0Especially in today's politically-charged climate where the fear of the \"other\" is helping to shape both domestic and international policy on a national level, and fear and misunderstanding of cultures that don't seem to be much like America's unique melange of chicken wings, beer, and Starbucks. I am going to employ the Kickstarter project funds to photograph cultures in Asia and southern Africa to accompany many of the photos I've already shot elsewhere in the world. This funding will go towards the logistics side of the project: flights, guides, and lodging while gathering the photos. \u00a0The places I have in mind to finish this project are Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \u00a0If time and funds permit, I'd like to stop off in Nepal for a week of immersion onto their unique culture. Secondly, the printing, binding, and distribution of the \"coffee table\"-style book rewards will come from the Kickstarter funding.\u00a0 When I travel, I go alone. \u00a0I feel that, when traveling solo, there are no distractions and I'm able to focus on the task at hand. There are no poolside afternoons, no drunken evenings at a hotel bar, or time spent at a casino blackjack table. \u00a0This time is meant to deep dive into a culture, meet the locals, and get an understanding of what makes their patch of real estate unique. However, that doesn't mean I'm a stick-in-the-mud! \u00a0I've met dozens of people from all over the world with whom I routinely stay in touch. \u00a0I tell my son that when I leave Cleveland, I leave alone. \u00a0But when I return, I come home with a coterie of new friends. I don't plan on making this book available for sale; it's a passion project and the books that I print will be meant as rewards to the people who fund me; I'd like to offer some of them to libraries and photography students in Northeast Ohio after the project wraps later this year. The goal is to present a volume of photographs that illustrate cultures from around the globe which, on the surface, seem much different and even alien to the American or Western experience, but at the end of the day showcase that we all have ten fingers and ten toes. \u00a0In my experiences, the only significant difference in our cultures is the way in which we dress and the language that we use to greet each other. The best way to break down barriers and impose new understanding is through photography, the medium in which a single photo is worth more than a whole compendium of words. Note: The image quality of the above photos is not representative of the actual photos. \u00a0The image quality has been compressed for internet size and upload convenience; the actual images are of a much higher print quality at 300dpi. \u00a0The images above are represented at 72 dpi and 500kb, so they'll load and present better on most internet browsers.\u00a0 The above images are \u00a9Brian M.

Like its inspirational source, Aberrant Reflections provides a polished \"Puzzle Box Dungeon\" for your players to solve from the inside. Aberrant Reflections includes: Jacob Fleming, of In the Shadow of Tower Silveraxe, is illustrating the adventure.\u00a0 His work has quickly become iconic in the OSR (Old School Renaissance) community and I am very excited to have him be a part of this project. It's always a very cool feeling when players can see, in ink, the environment that they are exploring and experimenting with. Handouts have always had a special place in my games and I want them to have a special place in this adventure. The fact that Jacob is on board for all the illustrations in the book really makes me want to fill it out with as much useful detail as possible. The community copies are for students and those experiencing financial hardship. If you need the discount, feel free to support via this backer level. Backers who purchase the \"Bundle of Joy\" add-on increase the number of community copies available. These generous individuals will also receive a custom dad joke about a topic of their choosing.

So far, Jean has worked up one spread for the zine and I can't wait to see what they come up with for the rest. Jean is really bringing that pop that makes zines like Knock! so good. Old School Jelly Old School Jelly makes exquisite maps. It was one of their maps that actually inspired the main mechanics of Aberrant Reflections. So I am beyond words when I think about the fact that the zine will get an OSJ original thanks to you! JV West West is an illustrator with a specific flair and style that bleeds old school. Their work in the Black Pudding zines is top-notch. I'm very ready for some of that in a custom character sheet for Aberrant Reflections.

I often describe Lucid: Sea of Dreams as being inspired by dreams, nightmares, Jewish folklore etc. The game sprung from experiences as an educator, a gamer, a dreamer, and a Jew. I wanted to create a game that could explore emotional and psychological themes for possible educational or therapeutic applications, I also wanted to create a game world that could pull from Jewish folklore but still be accessible to a wider audience. These two ideas merged into the current iteration of Lucid: Sea of Dreams. Lucid is very good at pivoting from whimsy to nightmare, and allowing players ultimate flexibility in their creativity. I have loved to watch players rescue missing children, plot against formidable dreamer syndicates, parley with beings that understand the world alien to that of our own. With the encouragement of friends/playtesters I decided to get things together for this February Kickstarter as part of ZiMo! This is my debut project for Kickstarter and first foray into publishing, very very excited and very thankful for all the amazing guidance from those more experienced than I!

Adam is going to release a full-length album of brand new songs, followed by a full-length collaboration. We\u2019re asking for your help so that we can make these records sound as good as they can, and send them out to as many people as possible.\u00a0 All of the money you help us raise goes toward the cost of recording, production, artwork, press, and radio. Our plan is to release them in the spring of 2019. By helping us meet our goal, please know, that we\u2019ll consider you a part of our team, and we can\u2019t thank you enough.

  "Hi, I'm Chad Richard. I write songs. And I travel around from time to time with a guitar and sing 'em to folks whenever I can. I've always dreamed about what it would be like to make my living solely by playing my songs for people. But sometimes life leads us down different roads, and with that being said, my main \"career\" has always been in a chemical plant. I did however, manage to dip my toe in that creative water a few years ago when I made my first full length record titled \"Veteran's Grocery\". I'm very grateful to have had Walt Wilkins and Todd Purifoy produce that record. We made a really cool first record with my one and only regret being that I did absolutely nothing in the way of promoting it. I guess at the time it was just more of a bucket list item to check off, and merch to sale at my shows. I've done quite a bit of living and writing since the \"Veteran's Grocery\" record. I've experience a lot since then. Good and bad. Happy and sad. I've drawn from all\u00a0these experiences and written what I believe to be 12 meaningful songs that I feel\u00a0strongly about. With my chemical plant days numbered I'm ready to go back in the studio and create something really special and start working toward new goals\u00a0in this\u00a0blessed life. I want to put these 12 songs on an album titled \"Worthy Cause\".\u00a0I believe it is! I'm incredibly honored and thrilled to have Walt Wilkins producing again and Ron Flynt engineering. All of this fun work will take place at Jumping Dog Studio in Austin ,Tx. We're doing things a little different this time in a cool way and I'm very excited about this project and the sound we're going for. And when it's all said and done I want to promote this record and put it out into this big ole scary, crazy, beautiful world for all, or at least some, to dig! Fun stuff! This Kickstarter campaign is a new deal for me. It's an interesting way for \u00a0independent artists like myself to fund projects these days. It's a really cool concept in that we're not asking for a hand out but instead pre-saleing the record and other rewards to you the fans, friends, and supporters in order to fund recording, mastering, and promoting expenses. You the supporter/fan/friend gets the record first, before it's released to the public in exchange for your belief and support of this project. There are different levels of support and rewards offered. It's an all or nothing campaign meaning that if the goal isn't (ain't) reached you won't be (ain't) charged. I'm launching this Kickstarter campaign in hopes that if you've ever remotely enjoyed even a smidgin of my music and believe in what I doing that you will be kind enough to help me out by pre-ordering this new record \"Worthy Cause\" or choose one of the other levels of support and rewards offered. Thank you so so very much! Let's make a record! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chad",

  "Joanie and Matt here (JAM)! This project is a HUGE step for the both of us. We\u2019ve often reminisced about our early work together though we didn\u2019t necessarily think it would ever be rebooted \u2013 that is, until now. \u00a0 It all started 10 years ago... ...when Joanie and Matt met during their lunch breaks at Central Synagogue to write songs together. All of that bread-breaking led to the release of the world\u2019s first kids' Jewgrass album, Challah, Challah. \u00a0Look at us... we are babies :)\u00a0 Though we enjoyed writing together, our collaboration was short-lived and came to a close in 2010 as we both pursued projects that pulled us in different directions.\u00a0 Joanie started a kids\u2019 rock band called Joanie Leeds and the Nightlights for which she was a winner of a Gold Parents\u2019 Choice Award and a NAPPA Gold Award. She was also a finalist in The USA Songwriting Competition and The John Lennon Songwriting Competition as well. Further accolades from that period include multiple features in People Magazine, Parents\u2019 Magazine and The New York Times.\u00a0 Matt\u2019s banjo-playing meanwhile was captured on an Emmy-nominated song. He also launched The Bluegrass Kabbalat Shabbat Experience which he brought to different parts of the US and the UK.\u00a0 Life kept happening as it does. Joanie was married in 2012 and had a beautiful daughter in 2015. Matt finished a memoir in 2017 about his life as a Jewish banjo player while continuing to produce both albums and music videos for other musicians.\u00a0 During this era the songs from Challah, Challah took on a mini-life of their own. They enjoyed national success both on Jewish radio stations as well as in the homes of families through PJ Library.\u00a0 The year of 2018 unexpectedly brought us back together as a songwriting team. After teaching, traveling and writing abroad for several months, \u00a0Matt suddenly returned home early from India and Southeast Asia as his relationship came to an end with his girlfriend and traveling partner. \u00a0Joanie, whose marriage was sadly coming to a close, \u00a0moved back to Manhattan. Suddenly, we were neighbors! \u00a0Within walking distance of each other \u2013 we were both in the mood to write some new music. From March to May, we met each week, working diligently and realizing that, just like a decade ago, on our lunch breaks at Central Synagogue, we still had it!\u00a0 We\u2019ve always prided ourselves on the core of the \u201cJoanie-and-Matt\u201d Americana style; catchy melodies, vocal harmonies and acoustic guitars. That\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for both with Sterling (a seven-song album) and The JAM Havdalah Suite (a three-song medley that rethinks the ritual for ending the Sabbath).\u00a0 STERLING When we sat down to sketch out our main project, \u00a0Joanie wanted the music to remain grounded in cultural Judaism \u2013 albeit this time exclusively for an adult audience. Matt wanted to delve into something that has always intrigued him - controversial characters in the Hebrew Bible. Upon reviewing a few stories together however, Joanie took major issue with the overall chauvinistic and patriarchal tone of the canon (Matt concurred). But this didn\u2019t make us change our vision. In fact \u2013 we uncovered an unexpected relevance in the stories. \u00a0Furthermore, it became an intellectual exercise too. The more we wrote, the more we found ourselves talking about relationships, addiction, feminism, the LGBTQ community and #METOO. In writing these songs, we hope to unpack the flaws and challenges of our heritage while honoring them as well (we promise). \u00a0\u00a0 THE JAM HAVDALAH SUITE\u00a0 As if we didn\u2019t have enough to tackle, we also wanted to write new melodies for Havdalah. Many of us have fond memories at summer camp with the classic melodies under the stars. We love and honor this experience and want to add our musical voice to this tradition. We\u2019ve envisioned our own way to enrich Saturday evening for synagogues and community centers. The music industry has changed over the past decade. Making money from CD sales is a thing of the past (we now live in a world where people stream). That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking our family, friends and fans to support us now before we go into the studio.\u00a0 Our goal is $19,500 (just a little more than CHAI!). We hope to surpass this number, so we can also make a music video (that would be awesome). Below is a breakdown of our budget.\u00a0 Your generosity will not go unnoticed. By helping us fund our project on the front end, you will be REWARDED - BIG TIME. Here are some examples:\u00a0 Kickstarter is like an avalanche. It starts with a few falling snowflakes, then a little snowball, but once it picks up, it grows tremendously and starts to power itself all at once. Please help us blast down the mountain \u2013 quickly! Give us an initial push and help us meet our goal. \u00a0 Funding is ALL OR NOTHING. \u00a0 If we don't raise $19,500 by NOVEMBER 2ND, we won't get a single cent, you won\u2019t get your rewards and we can't make the album. OMG. That would be the worst Halloween EVER.\u00a0 Whatever you can contribute, please help us by spreading the word. Join our new FACEBOOK \u00a0and INSTAGRAM pages. Email your friends about us \u2013 that\u2019s the best way to get exposure since the algorithms are all fakakta. We are eternally grateful to those supporting us.\u00a0 You will love these songs and we can\u2019t wait to make them a reality. Sincerely,\u00a0 Joanie and Matt (JAM) \u00a0- joanieandmatt18@gmail.com",
  "Hello my name is Joel Jorgensen and I am a singer songwriter who has been entertaining professionally since 2003. I moved from Colorado to California where I began my career as a frontman in a band I created called Angels Fall. Signed a deal with Sony Records, wrote and went on tour. The single \u201cDrunk Enough\u201d charted and climbed to #2 on rock radio.\u00a0 \u00a0https://open.spotify.com/artist/1HzkIi3SzN7u0NQf8bTvPR?si=3vTvM3vWRiSEinBuecB2Nw\u00a0 While in the process of writing my second album I was stricken down with illness leaving me unable to perform and was released from my record deal.\n During the next several years I battled for my life and continued to write. The loss off my record deal and momentum left me longing for a simpler life and so with the help of God, family , friends, and amazing Doctors I made a full recovery. During that time I recorded a demo call\" Life Me Up\" Single Written by: Aly Tadros & Joel Jorgensen, was a four song Ep that I produced with my friend Damien Fink. I am proud of the work and thankful for him and all my friends that stood by me even when I was at my worst. \u00a0https://joeljorgensen.bandcamp.com/releases\u00a0 After making a full recovery I made it my mission to find a new home so\n I sold all of my belongings except for my trusted Guild guitar, clothing, books of lyrics and my Harley Davidson and hit the road to find a new place to call home.\n I traveled for a month by motorcycle before landing in Nashville TN where I had written my first album. \n I started playing gigs almost every night of the week across TN and have been doing so ever since. I have met some of the most inspiring and down right Badass musicians that I now call family in Nashville. They Inspire me and leave me in aww every time we are together writing or sharing our music on stage.\u00a0 Below are links to the companies I will be using: \u00a0House Of David\u00a0 \u00a0Disk Makers\u00a0 \u00a0CD BABY\u00a0 Here are some videos of live performances :",
  "Dear Friends,\u00a0 This Kickstarter will fund my debut album of resistance music, \"Love Songs To America\" in hopes of inspiring a more just and peaceful America. I have been working on these songs for over a year and am ready and excited to record them. This Kickstarter will allow me to present a new soundtrack of resistance music to a new generation. However, I can't accomplish this dream on my own. I need your assistance to make this vision a reality. If you believe in resisting the awful atrocities in America right now, then let's bring America some hope and healing and truth through this all-new resistance music. Please support this Kickstarter as an act of nonviolent resistance.\u00a0 Poignant, strong and unapologetic are the three words I would use to describe this project. This album is being created in the spirit of one of my favorite quotes: Can music really make a difference? Absolutely! Think of the Civil Rights Movement without \"We Shall Overcome\" or the labor movement without \"Solidarity Forever.\" These songs became the soundtrack of resistance movements. It's time to do that again.\u00a0 However, creating an album is not just about turning on a microphone. It takes a significant amount of money to bring an album to life for studio equipment, time, marketing and promotional materials, a web site, and more. If you look at other album Kickstarters, $1000 goal is about as low as you can go. Let's do this! America is counting on us.\u00a0 Below is the official blurb on the album. I appreciate any support you can give at whatever level. And please tell your friends. We need to resist in every way we can right now.\u00a0 Much love, Dave Love Songs To America \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Known for his signature guitar that says, \u201cThis Machine Destroys Hate,\u201d Dave Soleil is a folk singer/songwriter writing music to change our world.

He has performed at numerous venues from the \"Power To The Polls\" Women's March Anniversary in Atlanta to street corner protests to political house parties.\u00a0 \u201cLove Songs to America\u201d is Dave\u2019s debut album featuring original favorites like the inspirational \u201cStand On The Mountain,\u201d his tear-jerking update of Woody Guthrie\u2019s \"Deportee\" for the migrant children separated from their families at the border, and the hilarious \u201cWhat\u2019s the Warmest City in Canada?\u201d Poignant, strong and unapologetic, Dave Soleil brings resistance music to life for a new generation. \u00a0 Dave is also helping lead the folk resistance as the lead organizer of Sing Out Defiance, a group of singer/songwriters cranking out modern day protest music mentored by folk legend Frank Hamilton. \u00a0",
  "Ever since I saw Vincent Price's Diary of a Madman\u00a0I've wanted to adapt Maupassant's Le Horla. The time has come. After years of developing my own artistic voice I'm finally ready to shoot my adaptation called Out There. The film is a rumination on the affects of mental health on the psyche and takes place entirely in basement. Part Eraserhead, part No Exit, the short is sure to terrify.\u00a0In October of 2016 we shot a test of sorts to explore the possibility of making something bigger. The video above is the product of that experiment. My DOP (Spencer Bergman) and I felt successful in shooting in extremely low light so we decided we were going to pursue finally making Out There. We also decided that we would film the short in black and white.The purpose of this Kickstarter is to fund the prop cost for the film. I own most of my own film equipment except for a light set. We're shooting ultra low budget and will be using the money for makeup, lights (which will be used as props in the film), and building material. We are building a small wall for our basement location so we need money to afford the wood, screws, and plastic sheeting. I believe $500 is sufficient enough to cover our prop/building costs and whatever else we may end up needing to purchase during the production of the film.I've always dreamt of making movies and now I'm pushing to see my dream become a reality. Every penny helps and is very very very appreciated.\u00a0",
  "TIMELINE OF EVENTS Logline:\u00a0When a couple visits a remote cabin and cross paths with a compulsive liar, their vacation takes a dramatic turn for the worse. Brief Synopsis: A young American couple caught in a downward spiral embark on a roadtrip through rural backwater Sweden to rekindle their relationship. This, however, puts them right in the sights of a vicious sociopath, who has a plan in store for them. Their vacation of their dreams turns into a fight for their lives. Since the majority of funding for this film came from Swedish local government scholarships to Johan Bodell, we will need $3,000 for the following things: Between the skilled and professional cast and crew on this project along with the access to money and resources so far, we don't need much to make a huge difference, hence the $3,000 proposal.\u00a0 Every penny over the reached goal will go to more film festival submissions and make this film reach a broader audience.

  "You need such an ingeniously designed portable laptop stand to make your typing and viewing more comfortable and to improve your working efficiency on the go. And better yet, blocking no vents and compatible with all your devices like smartphone, tablet, kindle, switch and much more. MUKI BounceMan-The world\u2019s first invisible and portable flick stand for all your electronic devices. Easily attach to the back of all devices to make it self-stand and give you a healthier working and entertaining posture. Automatically extended by a spring in 0.3 second when the switch is activated. Completely steer clear of any vent, strip or pad on the bottom to give your device better airflow. MUKI BounceMan uses a spring-assisted mechanism that takes just 0.3 second to open and fold in one quick motion. Activate the switch and Whala, the stand automatically extends and stands on its own. Fold it in and it will be locked securely in place. Easy for anyone to use. It transforms any desk, table, or surface into a comfortable, organized work environment within seconds. As slim as a coin, your laptop can slide in/out of its sleeve with MUKI on with absolutely no obstacle. No more frustration of repeated setting up and putting away, it allows you to make the most of your workspace in a smooth one-hand operation. MUKI BounceMan is the size of a finger,folded down to only 3.7mm in thickness and weighs 2.5oz. Simply attach it to the bottom of your laptop and it\u2019s barely noticeable and almost invisible from the side view\uff01 It is a perfect on-the-go stand for frequent travelers, that can be easily carried in your jeans pocket, saving space to the extreme. MUKI BounceMan raises the laptop off the table surface, and due to its tiny footprint, it leaves your laptop vents perfectly unblocked for better airflow and improved heat dissipation. So your laptop always stays cool and runs at its top speed. MUKI BounceMan is compatible with almost all your mobile devices regardless of their sizes or models. It can be applied to anything flat that you would like to make self-standing or elevated. Smartphone, tablet, Kindle, Switch, keyboard, you name it. It's ideal for a hands-free video watching, game playing, facetiming and web surfing on your smartphone. It allows your body to adopt a more ergonomic posture by offering both vertical and horizontal viewing angles to your smartphone. It fits laptops of all sizes and brands: 13\u201d, 15\u201d, 17\u201d, etc. Comfortable desks or chairs are not always available or accessible, and MUKI BounceMan compensates for it by adding extra necessary inches wherever your laptop takes you. It elevates the screen to a more comfortable height so your neck can be positioned at a more natural position to reduce the likelihood of neck pain. The keyboard is angled by MUKI so your wrists can enjoy a more relaxed angle while typing to ease the muscle strain. MUKI BounceMan is aimed to help you stay pain-free in the hours long drudgery in front of laptops, leading to more productivity during work times. Nice silicone padding at the bottom of the stand helps prevent the laptop from slipping. No matter how hard you pound on the keyboard when playing games or drawing on the iPad, MUKI BounceMan remains the rock behind your devices, making them easy to work with. Your laptop needs to be safe and stable when lifted up off the desktop. When opened, MUKI BounceMan forms a strong triangular structure between your device and the surface, which holds up a maximum load to as much as 22kg (48lb), more than enough to sustain the heaviest mobile device plus the fiercest typing force. MUKI BounceMan is made of zinc alloy which is quite sturdy and gives an attractive luster. Zinc is much stronger and more durable than aluminum which is widely used in competitors, and provides better corrosion resistance, stability and strength. MUKI prides itself on the exceedingly long lifespan of 3~5 years, for each unit will be subjected to rigorous testing of 30,000 cycles of opening and closing. There are no complicated install steps at all. Just take it out of the box, remove the sticky seal, and attach the adhesive side to the back of your device. (*If there was any residue, it could be easily wiped off with alcohols) MUKI is a team with a dedication to design and innovation. We can be meticulous when it comes to perfecting the deficit in products to make them more practical and instrumental in facilitating people\u2019s everyday life. Freedom and creation are our tenets.

  "Art can inspire change. This is why we started ARTPORT_making waves five years ago. We are an international curators collective based in New York, Spain, and Switzerland that produces socially engaging projects with a focus on climate change, from art video contests, exhibitions to artist residencies. This year, we present \"La Isla Hundida\u201d (The Drowned Island) by artist Javier Velasco, a live art performance with over 100 children to raise awareness about the dangers of rising sea levels at the next United Nations Climate Conference in Cancun, Mexico (COP16, Nov 29-Dec 10). Children are the future of our planet, and we think that it is important to educate them now about the causes, consequences and solutions of climate change. \"La Isla Hundida\" does this in a creative and fun way. The funds raised on Kickstarter will be used to prepare, produce, and record this performance, and to launch an ongoing, interactive platform for children around the world on the specifically created website, www.laislahundida.org, which will be launched in late September. The artist has already prepared a cutout model of the island. He will travel to Cancun a couple of weeks before the conference, in order to prepare the children for the live performance and to talk to them about climate change. We are already working with the local ministry of education in Mexico in order to identify schools and a public space for the performance. During the performance, the children will create their own little islands from recycled newspapers and decorate them. Then they will drown their islands at once in a large container filled with water. The performance will be videotaped and streamed live on our website and distributed to international media. The cutout model will be distributed worldwide through newspapers and the internet. Schools around the world will be invited to participate and to join the \"mass drowning\" of the islands. We will post photos and videos of the performances and interviews with the children on our website. \u201cLa Isla Hundida\u201d is one project of \u201cCancun: 2 Degrees of Separation,\u201d a comprehensive arts program presented by ARTPORT_making waves and Cinema Planeta, an environmental film festival based in Mexico, as part of the COP16 cultural program. Movies by renowned filmmakers, cell phone video contests from around the world, and panel discussions with scientists, politicians and artists and will take place at the UNDP booth (United Nations Development Program), local movie theaters, and public spaces in Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum. We have already secured some support for this program, but need additional funds for \u201cLa Isla Hundida\u201d. You can help make this performance an unforgettable experience for hundreds of children in Cancun and beyond! A huge, heartfelt Thank You!\nCorinne, Anne-Marie, and Oliver",
  "Are you gay? Trans? Asexual? A member or supporter of the LGBTQA+ community? A lover of cute hermit crabs? Then this is the project for you! We have decided that there are never enough pride pins out in the world, and we want to contribute our own in an adorable way.\u00a0 So if \u00a0you're stuck in your shell, or just like a flashy one, then get yourself a hermit crab today! Because why not have your shell and wear it, too? These amazing crabs are created by Aimeer, @aimzdoodlez on twitter and will be shipped from the USA by Kitty @PeachShips, an experienced shipping mod from fanzines. We will obviously be trying our hardest to get as close to proper colors as possible by sending the manufacturer pantone numbers for every color. That being said we cannot guarantee that shades will be exactly as you see not only because sometimes exact shades are not available and also because colors could look different depending on the screen you are looking on.\u00a0 Proceeds will mostly be going to the artist, with a small portion going to myself and my assistant for helping with this project and shipping, and if we make enough we'll be able to make more pride crabbies for everyone to enjoy! Each Crab Pin will be Gold hard enamel and 1.5in in size. \u00a0They will have 2 posts and rubber clutch backing. The Stickers will be 3in Vinyl die cut stickers and will be available in all 8 available flags.\u00a0 This project has 8 different crabs to choose from (with asexual included along with the ones pictured above). \u00a0 Your choices are between the Rainbow gay pride pin which is the starting crab and \"unlocks\" at $500usd. Why is this labeled as unlocked before we even reach our goal and its the first crab? Because I like getting announcements of \"we have unlocked this goal!\" when supporting others and I feel like you guys will like it too.\u00a0 Next is the bisexual pride pin crab. For those who love all genders and crabs. \u00a0This one unlocks at $550usd. Next up is Ace pride pin!

The Nonbinary pride pin Crab pin unlocks at $650usd and is the perfect creature to slot in as an answer to everyone's annoying questions of \"what's your gender?\" Do you love every gender (or lack there of), but don't feel like the label of Bi feels right for you? or maybe you just don't like the flag colors. Well you're in luck! Because at $700usd we'll be unlocking the Pansexual Pride pin Crab!! This little buddy loves everyone for who they are just like you do! Perhaps you're a connoisseur of the finer things, and those finer things happen to be loving the ladies. Well, lady lovers, do I have the perfect crab for you. Unlocking at $750usd we have the wonderful and amazing Lesbian Pride pin Crab! Proud of who you are even though you have to fight to claim the right gender? I'm proud of you, too! and you know who else is proud of you? The Trans Pride pin Crab! This crab knows who they are, and so do you, don't let anyone tell you differently. (no longer) Last, but certainly not least is my personal favorite. The pride crab I would add to my vast collection of pride crabs. My own personal pride love, the Aromantic Pride pin Crab. This crab is for those of us who just don't feel that twinge of romance in the air. We love you, we just don't feel comfortable with some things, and that's okay. \u00a0Aro crab unlocks at $850usd, and I am rooting for it to find a home with myself, and with you. Are you a man? Do you love other men? Do you want to show people that loving men can be a finer thing in life, too?

Who doesn't love a rainbow of proud crabbies? Not me! (Actual sticker sheet is still under design and probably won't be completed until the campaign has finished so that we are sure every crabby is included) Are you a crab who feels like your heart calls out for more than one person? Then this next stretch goal might be for you! At 1050 we will be unlocking the Polyamorous Crab! Attraction can be hard to find, in fact, sometimes you just don't feel it until you really know a person.

SHIPPING INFO We have decided to charge for shipping after the kickstarter is complete this way if shipping prices change they will be covered and not under or over paid for. This being said I find it would be useful information for everyone to see what the CURRENT shipping prices are for a package of this size and weight of one enamel pin. These prices are rounded UP to the nearest dollar! Eastern USA - $4 Western USA - $5 Mexico & Canada - $15 International EXCLUDING AUSTRALIA - $17 Australia UPDATED PRICE - $19",
  "For this Make 100 project I'm using classic playing card styling to produce a limited edition A3 print showcasing some playing card elements, but also with some unique twists of my own.\u00a0 My two previous playing card concepts on Kickstarter moved away from traditional playing card graphic design, but I've always found the artwork on 'regular' playing cards beautiful and that's why I wanted to make this. The original piece is hand-drawn by me and I'll have it reproduced as a limited edition museum-grade print for the rewards. I chose the suit of hearts, and in the interests of equality I've combined both the queen and the king in the same piece. \u00a0So you can chose which way up you want it to be... When I was a teenager I actually drew something quite similar to this and never imagined I'd end up actually designing real playing cards one day. Not that the internet or Kickstarter were even a thing then! I've always liked B&W ink drawings and am really excited to combine that with my love of playing cards and of Kickstarter. For this drawing I've gone for a simple black and white style using black pigment inks.\u00a0 My drawing contains some classic playing card design elements, but also some references to my previous playing card designs - cocktails and game cards. So you'll see the king and queen with a cocktail in one hand and a chess piece in another. When looking for the more traditional elements, I enjoyed researching the history of the court cards and there are some interesting stories about the evolution of them. Because the artwork is a king one way up and a queen the other way up, when you pledge for a print I'll ask you where you would like me to sign and number the print. Either King up, Queen up, both, or neither!\u00a0 Since this is part of Kickstarter's Make 100, there are 100 rewards on offer: the original drawing itself, and 99 beautifully reproduced prints. Each will be unframed and securely shipped worldwide - the prints will be rolled and packaged in a tube and the original will be packaged in a hard flat box. If you missed my previous two Kickstarter projects, they were playing cards with cocktail recipes on them, and then playing cards with multiple markings for different games like chess and dominoes. \u00a0Hence the details on this king/queen drawing! You can see more about them on my website here: www.cartesiancards.com Those previous card decks are also available as 'Add-ons' to this project if you back for one of the artwork prints (or just the high-five reward). The original piece has been drawn with black pigment liner on 220 gsm acid-free paper - A3 size (297 x 420 mm | 11 \u00be x 16 \u00bd in) The limited edition signed print will be reproduced by the excellent Kite Print in London. They will use museum-quality archival pigments on Somerset 100% cotton from St Cuthbert\u2019s Mill.\u00a0 The unframed prints will be sent via a tracked service worldwide rolled with acid-free tissue paper inside sturdy cardboard tubes with secured end caps. The original artwork reward will be shipped flat. Source of the king's moustache quote: www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/22/card-games-facts",
  "The Laughter Foundation, a 501(c) 3, supports comedians, the comedy community, as well as \"the serious world.\" Our first order of business is to organize and provide health insurance for comedians. There is also The Heckler Fund which will give one-time grants for rent or child-support. Long term: The Comedy Museum and International Laughter Day. The Comedians for Comedians Comedy Gala at the Hollywood Bowl is our big fundraiser and event. Roseanne Barr is committed, but Queen Rosie is just the beginning. Many famous comedy stars are lining up. Unfortunately, I cannot reveal their names just yet. But, from the man who brought Jerry Lewis to the London Palladium, you can expect the unexpected! Watch the clip of High On Laughter, which is the show I created and produced in London. (HOL benefits Turning Point Scotland, a drug and alcohol charity launched by Princess Diana.) I've done this already, Folks, and I'm going to do it again, this time for my own foundation at The Hollywood Bowl. TLF will focus on seven main areas, referred to as \"The Seven Goals,\" which can be read on our Facebook Group page: http://www.facebook.com/group.php... The foundation's immediate needs are minimal. I am a one-man band. I need an assistant 20 hours a week. I need to get a website done, business cards, etc. Devoting an average of 50 hours a week, as President of TLF, I would like a small working wage. Plus, I need money to apply for the foundation's own 501(c)3 non-profit status. (please read REWARDS DISCLAIMER below) Most importantly, I need to raise the deposit for the Hollywood Bowl show. The Bowl deposit is $150,000 for one night. (There are other costs -- security, buses, etc.) Everything is negotiable in life and I'm sure once I get the complete core of great famous comedians, I'll be able to close the money gap with corporate sponsors. Plus, there are many ancillary means of fund raising, such as auctions, which will be tied into the charity. And, finally, there is always \"that chance\" that television will pick this up. The High On Laughter show I produced at the London Palladium was filmed and broadcast on Bravo UK. The Laughter Foundation is being followed by people all around the world. I'm getting offers of help, as well as donations, from people who have heard my story, but never met me. It's truly an amazing time. Folks, like many of us recently, I've been through a very tough time. Last year, my home of nine years, in London, was repossessed. It was heart-breaking. I had remortgaged it too many times, but I was also carrying an enormous debt from the London Palladium show. I bet everything I had on that show. That's why I thought Jerry Lewis was the right move. Rather than detract from the main message here, you can read all about what happened with me and Jerry Lewis if you go to the Facebook group THEY LOVE HIM IN FRANCE. And while you're on Facebook, please go to the group THE LAUGHTER FOUNDATION. What matters now is the future. I want to be involved in something bigger than myself. And my dream is to be on stage a year from now, introducing the greatest comedians in the world, at The Hollywood Bowl, all for what I think is a great cause: Comedians. Please read the Seven Goals below. I've put up the 5-minute highlight video of the Sept 8, 2002 High On Laughter show at the London Palladium. \"HOL III\" was a great show, 15 British & American comedians. And starred comedians such as \"relative unknowns\" Zach Galifiniakis and Jim Gaffigan. Zach (who did two HOL's) is now a big Hollywood comedian film star. Jim is doing pretty nicely too, one of the top comedy acts in the country. Thanks for your time. I love you all! You've been a great crowd! Drive safely!\nAnd, please please please, if you can, contribute to The Laughter Foundation. Never take Life too seriously, you'll never get out of it alive. Comedians. A very funny cause! Please help me help \"My Kids,\" ya' know...like \"Kidding\"? Cheers,\nSteven Alan Green\nPresident, The Laughter Foundation THE SEVEN GOALS: HEALTH AND DENTAL INSURANCE for comedians. This would include coverage for mental health issues, a common occupational hazard or prerequisite for being a comedian in the first place. [LATEST UPDATE: May form \"The Comedians Guild\" for best group rates.] SUPPORTING COMEDIANS ON THE GROUND \u201cHow can we help?\u201d is our motto. Whether you\u2019re a comic off the turnip truck or a burned out vet, sometimes advice and a simple and friendly conversation with someone in the know can help. WORKSHOPS Not a \u201cnetworking thing,\u201d screw that. All workshops at the Foundation will focus on the human element of being a comedian, as well as The Business. Guest lecturers and workshops will feature Kelly Carlin, the daughter of the late great George Carlin. Kelly teaches a wonderful workshop on how to get control of the creativity deep down within and make it work for you. THE HECKLER FUND One-time financial grants will help qualified comedians who may be experiencing rent or alimony problems. An interview process will determine eligibility. ADDICTION SERVICES. One of The Laughter Foundation Advisors is Kitty Bruce. Daughter of the late great Lenny Bruce, Kitty runs The Lenny Bruce Memorial Foundation, helping women with addiction issues. COMEDIANS FOR COMEDIANS COMEDY GALA AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL will be the big fund raising show. Many top comedians have already lent their names and more info as this develops, but I promise you this\u2026.. From the man who brought Jerry Lewis to the London Palladium, I think you can expect the unexpected.\n[LATEST UPDATE: \"The Comedians for Comedians Comedy Charity Gala at The Hollywood Bowl\" is in the works, with a target date some time in 2011. ROSEANNE BARR is the only big name act I can mention at this point, and within the last week alone, I got two very well known comedians who star on HBO and Network Television. C4C is going to be the most talked about comedy show in LA in years. My dream is to get Eddie Izzard, Russell Brand, Rickie Gervais, all of whom I have met and/or worked with in London. REGULAR MEETINGS Leave your networking hat at the door. These gatherings are open to comedians and will serve as sort of group-therapy between comedians. Sharing stories and hearing other\u2019s stories. That\u2019s the way we do it! MY DREAM is to create a community. Being a comedian can be a very lonely enterprise. People love you when you make \u2018em laugh. But comedians are real people with extraordinary talent. And often, that talent comes at a price. That\u2019s where The Laughter Foundation comes in. My long term goals for The Laughter Foundation? A Comedy Museum and International Laughter Day. Let\u2019s help comedians. They are a very important part of the world. And remember, \u201cNever take life too seriously!....You\u2019ll never get out it alive!\u201d For more information and/or to offer your services for the cause, please email me at steven.alangreen@gmail.com.

  "Hartford, CT has one of the most vibrant cultural scenes in the region. Yet, for all the cultural outlets available, an overwhelming majority fall out of financial range for residents of this city. The Center without Walls Concept will take advantage of every nook and cranny in the city to present music, poetry, theater, dance, workshops, and just plain ole conversations to areas where mainstream arts organizations do not go. Admission to all of our events will be affordable with a minimum of \"what you can pay.\" Our first project was an artist residency by Internationally renown printmaker, Favianna Rodriguez. During her stay Favianna held two workshop with local youth, gave a talk on artists and their roles as social change makers as well as talks with local neighborhood groups and students. In collaboration with a local university, her work was hung in a local community gallery. It was estimated that her residency reached upto 1,000 residents. None of her events had an admission cost. 100% of all monies received will go to towards program development: artist fees, marketing, and space rental.",
  "This short film will act as an introduction to a new kind of classical horror monster, The DitchPeople. These mysterious mud human creatures emerge and recede from the ditches at the sides of the road in a rural community. Their motive or origins will not be revealed in the film but their abilities and effect will be. With both physical and digital effects the walking mud humans will overtake all but one of the characters in the film. There will be one full transformation on camera, the others will be implied. To transform a regular human into a DitchPerson, one of the monsters must hook their target with their mud dripping hand at an entry point to the body (eg. mouth/eyes). A surge of mud will then flow from then Ditchperson\u2019s Body into the victim. The flow of mud will not stop until the person being attacked is overcome inside and out with brown wet mire. I plan to use this short film as an advert and promotional tool to try and secure funding to develop the concept further into a feature length project. The Feature would explain the origins of the monsters and feature Nona, the lead in the short film that gets away as the lead in the feature tying the two projects together.",
  "Our mission is to celebrate diverse bodies. Our first phase is to photograph and interview the amazing people in NYC and the surrounding area. We ask them to share their experiences of their body, their relationship with it, and their relationship to society. We want to explore bodies for all they can be, beyond and inclusive of the sexual. Help us by supporting the completion of the photography and interview portion of the project and the creation of tangible items to share.

Gold and Silver smithing and ceramics are my 2 main areas of practice. I have a Diploma of Art in Fine Art (ceramics) Queensland College of Art and a Bachelor of Art in Fine Arts (gold and silver smithing) Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I work as an artist in my studio making sculpture at the moment in clay. I make all the work by hand with basic wooden tools. Here is some of my Contemporary jewellery held in the public collection of the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia.\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/66281\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/61230\u00a0 I \u00a0love to paint and love working with people. I also worked professionally for many years assisting people to get their lives back on track. I see this work as a merging of my life\u2019s experience, skills and gifts. It\u2019s a culmination of my life work where I can simply share with other people. I would like to open out the opportunity for people to make bookings with me and directly commission work from me internationally. I really wish to open out and contribute to the world community in my own unique way, put the money toward my dream. My dream is to buy and create a little studio here in Wales. I relocated from Australia to Wales, I gave away and sold my assets including my studio equipment and tools. I came here with 2 suitcases so I am starting over. I had a wonderful session with Shell today where she open her space and made me feel free to explore new concepts through creating a couple of drawings that came through and a couple which came through Shell and were able to represent some parts of what is going on in my life. \u00a0I found the experience relaxing and I felt free to express whatever came up without any expectations and the results were very gratifying. Thank you Shell for that experience. Loxy My goals 6 months to 1 year for the start up of the ArtExplore project. 6 months to one year to establish the one on one sessions. 1 year to establish Saturday community classes.\u00a0 1 to 2 years to establish inspired painting by private commission.\u00a0 I would like to purchase a pottery wheel for the Saturday classes and a kiln. I would like to purchase a small studio cottage, its my dream.\u00a0 My plan My plan is to continue making my individual ceramics pieces ongoing and while the one on one bookings build to 2 days per week.

  "Managing all the various remotes can be a real pain, especially when the ones you want are missing, broken or mixed up. It could be dangerous too, given the prevalence of the current pandemic and the fact that remote is reportedly to be the germiest thing in your room \u2014 more disease-causing germs than the bathroom door handle. Introducing SmartEgg Pro, the ultimate smart control that rules all the infrared home appliances and makes your life easier, healthier and better. SmartEgg Pro can learn or copy from any IR remote for you to control everything using just its App: TV, cable box, projector, DVD player, Blu-ray, Apple TV, Fire TV, audio system, game player, air conditioners, heaters and lights, more than 200,000 (with more added daily) different kinds of household devices.\u00a0 The SmartEgg Pro App is user-friendly, extremely versatile and powerful. It also protects you and your loved ones from touching the remotes crawling with bacteria, viruses and other nasty organisms capable of transmitting colds, infections and diseases. Create a series of most used commands and activate it all with one touch on your smartphone.\u00a0 For instance, you could set up a \u201cleaving home\u201d event that turns off lights and heatings as you are leaving for the day to save energy or a \u201cfootball night\u201d event that turns on TV, stereo and cable box, set to a certain channel and volume and dims the lights for you. Connect with SmartEgg Pro over WiFi network to control devices at home from your mobile device when you are away on a trip or beyond its Bluetooth range.\u00a0 You could have your home robotic vacuum cleaner crawl around the floors sweeping the dust anytime you want when you are far off on a trip. Trigger automated tasks according to your location ranges from 0.1m~50m (with the Bluetooth turned on and the App running on the background on your phone)to the SmartEgg Pro. Imagine this, as you walk in, your bedroom lights, A/C, TV, cable box, stereo will automatically turn on for you without you touching any remote or smartphone. SmartEgg Pro works with Echo, \u00a0Google Home, so you can speak to these voice assistants to control SmartEgg Pro to send 360\u00b0 full coverage IR commands to smart home products. SmartEgg Pro surpasses other remotes with its advanced Bluetooth 5.1 mesh networking, that is many-to-many SmartEgg Pro communications optimized for creating large-scale networks to cover every corner of your house. This is ideal for secure and reliable automations even without internet connection of a large number of devices in different rooms in your house. Devoid of internet access, you can still perform off-line controls through SmartEgg Pro to all the devices on the Bluetooth mesh. The internet is only necessary when downloading a new remote to SmartEgg Pro or to using it with a third device which requires an internet connection. You can schedule time-related commands using SmartEgg Pro, such as turning on or off the lights and closing or opening motorized blinds at specific times on specific days needless for you to say or touch a thing. The built-in thermometer in the SmartEgg Pro monitors realtime room temperature, records it in the App (12 months max.) and uses the set thresholds to govern the heating/cooling system to keep the room temperature pleasant and the energy usage low. SmartEgg Pro supports IFTTT to create chains of customary conditional actions with all your applications and appliances. For example, if a food delivery app informs SmartEgg Pro that the food is at your door, then SmartEgg Pro will send commands to turn on the outdoor lights and unlock the front door for the food delivery person automatically. SmartEgg Pro will immediately auto mute any device with volume control (speakers, stereos, TV, media players, etc.) when an incoming or outgoing call is detected for a clear and uninterrupted phone call. It will resume the volume when the phone call ends. Unlike other universal remotes that require constant power plugging or frequent battery replacement, SmartEgg Pro has a long battery life of 3~6 months and is cordless that can be freely placed anywhere in the house or wherever you go. Simply sit it on the removable base in contact with the magnetic PINs for a quick recharge. AICO Technologies was founded in 2014. AICO committed to providing the one-stop solution for Home Automation and to making every home smarter, self-sustainable and energy-saving. \u00a0With teams specialized in software development, hardware integration and aesthetically pleasing design, we apply only the highest quality standards to AICO products.

  "\u00a0So why Kickstarter? I chose Kickstarter for this project because in my opinion it is the most efficient platform to use when trying to fund so many designs, and also leaves room for even more stretch goal designs. Another great thing about Kickstarter is that your card will not be charged until after the campaign ends on February 25th and only if we meet our funding goal. \u00a0If you made it this far, thank you so much for taking a look at my campaign!",
  "I'm going to get equipment to record my speaking songs and words of wisdom that I have gathered over the years from old wise women/men. I have at least 6 notebooks full of lyrics jokes theories and roll like songs/poetry. I also have 2 tablets and 2 phones full of memos that are the same as described above! Before I decided to gather funds on this platform I recited my writings to many people not friends and family alone. Random people such as a very nice man I met at 7-eleven. I had a rough day at work that night. I sat in the parking lot letting my mind flow into lyrics about how people should cause a chain reaction for good. I wrote how I experimented with this notion on many occasions, also how it had worked. He was very moved by my words he said to me \"man you really know how things should be done to better our society, I was watching you on the parking lot. You wrote all that while sitting out here in your car?!\" I thanked him for reading my loonnnng poetry then was on my way. I want to move the world the way I was able to move this seemingly lonely mid 40s man that by the look in his eyes had been through a lot in his time. I know for certain that I can produce the same effect for others if I had a platform. Thank you for reading and hopefully one day I will be moving you!",
  "A problem we, as dreamers, often face is that we we feel the calling to do something great but don't have the means initially to fulfill that calling. There is something magical about the theater that allows us to transform our sometimes mundane lives, if only for a couple of hours, into something that transcends all of the problems and challenges we face and leaves us with something valuable and worth savoring: Perspective.\u00a0 \u00a0 Our dream, as a company, is to produce high quality theater productions that will positively impact those who view it and allow them to become better people by adding to their perspective and experience.\u00a0\u00a0We want to challenge our audiences, while giving them an enjoyable experience that they won't forget. We want to help those who feel they have a calling in life to perform but are unable to do so due to lack of opportunities or inability to justify the time when they are already spending so much time away from home just to put food on the table.\u00a0 The great significance of this is that, unlike a community theater, I want to eventually be able to pay my performers and technicians so that they are more able to continue performing and doing what they love. We want to see things from different points of view and encourage people of all different shapes, sizes, colors, orientations, and belief systems to perform with us.\u00a0 We want to promote inclusion and acceptance within our business culture and through our artistry. To do this, we need your help.\u00a0 Running a theater company is hard work and requires a lot of resources to keep it up and going.\u00a0 We have a prospective spot for our theater but will need assistance revitalizing the space as well as raising funds for production costs for the 2018 season including licensing fees, costumes, set, lighting, artists, scripts, etc. There is so much we want to do that will not only benefit our community but have a more global reach.\u00a0 We want to provide opportunities to help others grow through theater.\u00a0 We are working with the management at Cache Valley Mall to secure a space on their property that will serve as a Black Box Theater.\u00a0 We will use this for our productions as well as rent it out to help other theatre companies in the area.\u00a0\u00a0 The closer we get to our goal, and beyond, the cooler this venue will be for the community to enjoy! But we're getting ahead of ourselves.\u00a0 Let's introduce the minds behind the theater itself. Chris Metz (President) \u00a0Hi!\u00a0 My name is Chris and I'm the founder of Panoramic Theatre Company or Pan Theatre.\u00a0 I've been performing since I was about 15 years old and I have not been able to quit since then.\u00a0 I have a passion for creating unforgettable experiences for audiences and living in the magic of these worlds that one can create on stage. I have a degree in Musical Theatre and I have just been dying to use it in order to produce some creative work that I think people will enjoy.\u00a0 I love to write and create.\u00a0 I've written several original works in my time in the theatre including this Parody of Alexander Hamilton from the Musical Hamilton set in the world of J.R.R. Tolkein's: Lord of the Rings trilogy: \u00a0I have a wonderful and supportive family and group of friends that are backing me on this huge adventure, not least of all is my wife Whitney.\u00a0 She helps me come up with so many exciting ideas, including the song you just previewed which was originally her idea. \u00a0\u00a0",
  "The movie will be completed and all your awesome rewards will be produced and sent all over the world.\u00a0 As our campaign is not yet over we have created a stretch goal of \u00a345,000. If we reach this goal then every backer, past and future will also receive our special 'Ravens Arcana' Epic Digital Book shown in the graphic below! The Unkindness of Ravens is an exciting, original, feature-length horror film that blends the psychological with the supernatural in a nightmarish tale of one man's journey into hell. Our film began shooting in 2012 and is finally shot and edited but we still need help to complete our film's post production and to release the film independently.  Andrew travels to a retreat in the remote Scottish Highlands hoping to overcome his fear of ravens, the dark creatures that populate his visions.\u00a0But, in this bleak wilderness, his nightmares manifest into an enemy more powerful than he could ever have imagined. Our script was written by the amazing Sarah Daly in 2012. Inspired by the Valkyries of Norse mythology as well as the Celtic Morrigan, these evil raven-headed beasts stalk the earth, seeking suitable victims. They hunt in a flock or 'unkindness' and their ultimate prize is the juicy white eyeballs of their chosen victim. These incredible creatures were designed by Gavin Robertson and Lawrie Brewster in 2012 with help from the public The Unkindness of Ravens Artist Group (2012) Copyright Hex Media ltd. Lawrie Brewster is passionate about making bold horror films set against backgrounds rich with mythos and lore. He is also\u00a0a jack of all trades, a technical and VFX wizard whose past work has been featured in film festivals such as Sundance and South by Southwest.\u00a0 Sarah Daly is a prolific Irish musician and screenwriter with a love for all things dark and mysterious. Her work has been performed by stars such as Gary Oldman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway. Jamie Scott Gordon is a wild and intense method actor who threw himself into a mental abyss in order to play such a disturbed and challenging role. So far, we've used our own money along with some help from our friends at Dark Dunes Productions to fund the shooting phase of our film. Now we need your help to finish off the film. Every penny we get we'll match with our own blood, sweat and tears as we work to make this the best film it can possibly be. We care passionately about our audience and we love the way that Kickstarter allows us to connect with the very people we do this for. So we hope you'll share this crazy and exciting journey with us!",
  "The ZX Spectrum was a revolution in personal computing whose impact is still felt to this very day, 38 years after its original launch by Sinclair. A generation of developers, artists and designers took their first steps into the art of software development using a Spectrum, a machine that broke out of a computing niche to touch the hearts of millions of people around the world. Few memories are as powerful as finding a Spectrum under your Xmas tree or as a birthday gift, unboxing it to unveil an icon of design whose ease of use got people from all walks of life into programming and gaming. So powerful was the impact of the Spectrum that new games and apps are still produced for it to this very day, making it one of the most enduring machines of all time. The ZX Spectrum Next is the evolution of the original Spectrum, the computer Sinclair would perhaps have made if given the chance at the time. Designed by Rick Dickinson (1957 - 2018) and Phil Candy, the Next embodies the very same principles that made the original computer a success: a beautiful look, ease of use right out of the box, endless hacking possibilities and power that punches way above its weight. With new video modes, co-processors, more colours, sound channels, faster speeds, large storage and networking capabilities, the Spectrum Next leads the way for a generation of new games and apps created with the same philosophy that made the ZX Spectrum an icon, and the most successful home computer in British history. The ZX Spectrum Next Issue 2 is an improved follow up to the original Kickstarter campaign launched in 2017 which successfully delivered thousands of Nexts around the world. It expands a legacy and opens the door for more fans to join an incredibly flourishing community which has been going full steam for the past three years, creating a host of new games and apps -- some of them made by giants of the Spectrum development scene, such as Garry Lancaster, Jim Bagley and Mike Dailly. Get your Spectrum Next and join a growing community that has been rather busy playing a host of new games and apps, whilst building the Spectrum future together. Our targets for the original ZX Spectrum Next Kickstarter campaign were ambitious. A fully realised and fully compatible ZX Spectrum computer which could also create its own identity through its expanded capabilities. The objective then was to deliver a computer which could run up to twice as fast as the original Spectrum models, to increase its memory to a lofty 512KB RAM, and to introduce new video modes which would give the ZX Spectrum Next a palette and graphics capabilities worthy of its ambition and push into the future of the platform. Ever since we have refined the ZX Spectrum Next over the intervening years in order to still further its potential. It is through this continuous development cycle that we are able to present the computer as it is today for Kickstarter - Issue 2: vastly expanded with a multitude of features that could not have been imagined when the original Kickstarter launched in 2017. The ZX Spectrum Next Issue 2 is fully compatible with the original Spectrum 48, 128, +2, +3 and even some clones such as the Russian Pentagon, allowing it to run virtually every piece of software available. Its hardware is implemented in FPGA technology, with no emulation in sight. It\u2019s capable of running the original games with enhanced capabilities, such as faster processing speed boosting 3D titles, or even loading them from tape if you want the original feeling. It supports most expansion boards made for the original ZX Spectrum via its Expansion Port, and connects to several different types of monitors, including RGB (Scart), VGA and HDMI. Check out its specs: In addition to these awesome specifications, we have been listening to backer feedback from the original Kickstarter and are planning to refine a number of areas of the original computer by improving its board to a brand new revision and expanding the firmware. Features like Expansion Port protection, repositioning of the WiFi module for less interference and boosted signal, and digital port power feedback mitigation are just a few of the improvements already made to the original design. The gorgeous box includes a ZX Spectrum Next (obviously!), a 9V international Power Supply Unit and a printed manual to get you started discovering the secrets of its hardware and capabilities. The Next also comes with an SD card featuring NextZXOS, fully packed with games, demos and apps to hit the ground running and drop some jaws along the way. The Next can swiftly run all the original gems we have fond memories of, but what about the new stuff created to take advantage of the full capabilities of the Spectrum Next? We believe an image is worth a thousand words, so here are a few of our new favourites: Right out of the box, the Spectrum Next brings a host of unique experiences ranging from cool games, apps and Internet connectivity, including its own Teletext portal and multiplayer support. It\u2019s also an ideal tool for learning programming by booting straight away into NextBasic, opening a door for newcomers to learn more about the inner workings of computers using a simple and powerful programming language: one can literally start coding a new game in minutes by just browsing the Next\u2019s manual. Its main CPU, the Z80n, can run up to 28MHz, enabling the Next to smoothly execute anything you throw at it. With its co-processors, hardware sprites and DMA, it can literally give any 16 bit computers a run for their money and put up a fine visual show. The Accelerated version features a Raspberry Pi Zero as a co-processor at the service of the Spectrum Next\u2019s own processor, enabling it to utilise a 3D GPU, 512MB of RAM and a powerful ARM processor. The Plus version can be upgraded by adding your own Raspberry Pi Zero (with the correct header) to the accelerator port -- literally the world\u2019s cheapest accelerator upgrade. Built to last, the Spectrum Next will be your trusty companion for years to come and ensure the legacy of the Spectrum is kept alive and well for decades to come. The ZX Spectrum Next aims to be a project made nearly at cost, featuring a minimal margin, with the goal of getting as many computers as possible in the hands of fans in order to boost the community numbers. The Kickstarter Issue 2\u2019s prices are higher than the original for a few (very reasonable) reasons: Taxes. While we didn\u2019t charge taxes on the first campaign following advice that crowdfunding was exempt, the taxman said we owed them. The team footed the bill themselves at huge personal cost. This time around we\u2019ve added tax to the price, which is the lion\u2019s share of the price difference. Components. Some of the parts employed on the Next have gone up in price in the past three years, in particular the FPGA and the RAM chips. This is the second factor composing the price. Assembly and Test. Less than 0.3% of the Nexts from the first campaign had to resort to warranty or repairs of some kind, an industry-beating quality standard. This high watermark was achieved due to the Next being built and tested in the United Kingdom at cutting-edge facilities. The testing procedures we deployed were more thorough than originally planned, and their costs are now reflected. The ZX Spectrum Next was born out of the brains of Victor Trucco and Fabio Belavenuto, retro hardware developers who created the TBBlue bitstream upon which the Next is based (\u2018T\u2019 from Trucco, \u2018B\u2019 from Belavenuto, and Blue because\u2026 well, because the board is blue!) The ZX Spectrum Next is fueled by its community, and there are dozens of collaborators who daily improve what it\u2019s capable of. Here are the people behind the Kickstarter campaign. Allen Albright: Allen is the developer behind the latest iteration of the firmware, making the ZX Spectrum Next even more powerful, capable and flexible with each iteration. He\u2019s an unstoppable force that is yet to meet an immovable obstacle. Garry Lancaster: Garry is the wizard behind the NextZXOS, the most powerful operating system an 8bit computer could wish for. It doesn\u2019t matter what the feature is: if it exists, Garry finds a way to implement it for the Next. Bonus? He\u2019s also the man behind NextBasic. Say no more! Henrique Olifiers: Henrique is the man responsible for the project, coordinating its finances, suppliers and people -- essentially where the buck stops. He would very much like more time for simple things in life, such as sleeping or actually playing with his Next. Michael Cadwallader: Mike is the glue holding the project together. He hustles us all into action, keeps us true to our responsibilities and ensures things are moving smoothly on all fronts, from manufacturing to the community groups. Jim Bagley: A legendary game developer, Jim produces great games and supports the dev ecosystem who are making software for the ZX Spectrum Next. He holds too much technical information in his head, which can be seen as a good or bad thing... Phil Candy: Phil is the partner of Rick Dickinson (1957 - 2018), and co-responsible for the design of the ZX Spectrum Next. He devises clever solutions to very complex manufacturing challenges, and is a bastion of quality control of all the parts that make up the machine\u2019s exterior. Rick and Phil designed products together for over 20 years. Phoebus Dokos: Phoebus is a technical writer and IT support specialist as well as a graphic artist and musician behind new games for the ZX Spectrum Next, and the author of the incredible manual that accompanies the computer. He\u2019s partial to sun and beaches, which absolutely debunks the myth we all live in basements. Robin Verhagen-Guest: Robin is the man connecting the Next to the world via NXTel and the ESP WiFi module firmware, laying the foundations for all the online scope for the computer. He\u2019s also the author of nxtp, a nifty utility to keep your clock synced via the Internet. D. Rimron (Xalior): Xalior is the engineer behind what makes the RPi accelerator board tick: The amazing NextPi distribution (and now thanks to you, NextPi2). He put together the distribution, wrote the scripts and the drivers that currently enable the Next to load .tzx files, speak, play midi files\u2026and...and... and best of all makes sure none of this breaks! Tim Gilberts: Tim is a veteran of the Sinclair scene. From the founding of Gilsoft back in the 1980\u2019s (producing classic adventure creation software such as The Quill and Professional Adventure Writer), he has turned his considerable expertise to the Next and created the mouse and RTC drivers as well as the UART drivers that enable the Next to \u201cspeak\u201d to the outside world, via WiFi, Serial I/O (as well as with the RPi accelerator) David Saphier: David is the mind behind all things media, the creator of the music players that access data from the RPi. Key utilities like the piSend command to copy files between the Next and the RPi as well as the Term(inex) utility to control it are also his doing, together with tons of toolchains and development utilities used by devs to make stuff for the Next. Victor Trucco: Victor is the man behind the hardware of the ZX Spectrum Next, without which there would be no computer for us to work on. His hardware and retro hacking skills are unmatched in our dimension, thus expect him to come up with pleasant surprises all through the project\u2019s lifetime. You: Without you the ZX Spectrum Next would be just a husk, an soulless aggregate of metal, plastic and electrons. It\u2019s you, its community, players, developers, users, who make it a real thing. It\u2019s all about you and the love you have for this machine. We would like to thank the awesome folks at GamesYouLoved, who have been supporting us ever since the ZX Spectrum Next was an idea and a cobbled-together prototype. GamesYouLoved is all about the passion for retro gaming, treasured memories, and spreading the word about cool people and great projects. Make sure to follow them! Sub: www.youtube.com/gamesyouloved\n\u00a0Follow: www.twitter.com/gamesyouloved\n Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/gamesyouloved\n Site: www.gamesyouloved.com The ZX Spectrum Next was created with the simple goal of keeping the flame of the ZX Spectrum alive, burning as bright as ever, all neatly packed inside a powerful, expanded, yet simple computer to use. We hope you join the thousands of fans around the world who upon unboxing their ZX Spectrum Next fell in love with it at first sight. Welcome to the future of the ZX Spectrum! With the funding goal achieved under 5 minutes (you are awesome!), time to get the stretch bonuses in place!",
  "\u00a0Don\u2019t miss out on upcoming live streams from these awesome reviewers! You may have heard the news of rising international shipping costs, and unfortunately, it is true and more expensive than anyone could have imagined just a few months ago. We appreciate you for backing our game through Kickstarter, and thus we are subsidizing shipping costs for each region. After the campaign ends, shipping will be collected via the Pledge Manager system described in the previous section. This will allow you to easily provide your shipping address, upgrade your pledge level, choose add-ons, calculate shipping, and confirm your rewards.\u00a0 We will provide \"Customs Friendly\" shipping to the USA, Canada, the UK, the EU, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Here are the hubs that we currently plan to use for fulfillment: We have worked with these company several times in the past, and we believe they will do a great job of delivering our games to you. The price chart below is the subsidized shipping cost estimates based on our fulfillment partner's projection for 2022. Prices are given in US Dollars (USD). EU VAT is now included in the chart, please read this update for details.\u00a0 Actual shipping costs may increase due to factors out of our control, but we shall do our best to communicate any price changes beforehand. Please click the chart to view the expanded price chart for multiple copies of Jiangnan. We also provide free shipping for all backers in Taiwan, but only the English edition will be provided in this campaign. For the Chinese edition of Jiangnan, please wait for the separate campaign in early 2022. Unfortunately, we are unable to ship to Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, or Syria. \"Customs Friendly\" is not actually VAT Free. What this means is that we will take care of all VAT, import tariffs, customs duty fees in the listed regions, and pay them before delivery to you. The technical term used for this is Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) shipping. The \"Hub Fulfillment\" model commonly used for board game crowdfunding is considered to be a very advanced & complex solution for DDP shipping by most freight companies.\u00a0 After further\u00a0discussions\u00a0with\u00a0shipping\u00a0and\u00a0fulfillment partners, we have\u00a0come up with\u00a0a\u00a0solution to bundle\u00a0European\u00a0Union import\u00a0VAT into our shipping\u00a0charts above. Please read this update for details.\u00a0 We still\u00a0need\u00a0to\u00a0pay\u00a0custom duties\u00a0when the games arrive in\u00a0Europe,\u00a0but\u00a0for backers, this\u00a0is now\u00a0bundled\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0shipping chart\u00a0instead\u00a0of\u00a0being\u00a0calculated\u00a0separately in the Pledge Manager. Due to the current global pandemic, we cannot promise your rewards will be sent from the specific fulfillment hub listed above. We have a list of alternative hubs that we can switch to depending on what is the best solution at the time of fulfillment.\u00a0 We promise that we will commit our fullest effort to ensure the delivery will be as \"Customs Friendly\" as we can reasonably arrange. If you are a retailer in Southeast Asia, please contact VFI Asia for details. If you are based elsewhere, please make a $1 pledge and send an email to us for pricing. This is the only guaranteed way to get this edition of Jiangnan for your store. There are no American or European distributors that normally carry our games as of this writing. We will do our best to prioritize all shipments to FLGS stores and ensure they will be sent out along with other shipments to backers.

  "Remember those old school RPG's that you used to play until it was way past your bed-time and the console's power supply was really hot?\u00a0 Well, that's exactly what we are aiming to recreate in our own way.\u00a0 Affinity Sorrow is a new and original 16-bit classic top-down RPG (Role Playing Game) with turn based combat in development for the SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive Consoles.\u00a0 The game is heavily inspired by 16-bit titles like the early Final Fantasy games, Lufia, Breath of Fire, Dragon Quest and the Mana series. \u00a0We want to evoke all that nostalgia and live up to those great games, stories and memories in these modern days and take you back in time Second Dimension's style. Live the tale of a group of heroes that will be challenged at every step of their journey to save the world. When a lurking evil threatens to escape from its prison into this reality, the fight between light and darkness begins...\u00a0\u00a0again. Our retro development team has already released a few projects for retro consoles such as \u201cThe Curse of Illmoore Bay\u201d and \u201cEyra the Crow Maiden\u201d that were well received and that gave us confidence to raise the bar and tackle a bigger and more ambitious project. We are planning on bringing Affinity Sorrow to the 16-bit SEGA consoles on a high quality cartridge with SRAM so you can save and load your progress easily. Why SEGA Genesis? We have several years of experience with both software and hardware working on and releasing games for the SEGA Genesis and Mega Drive - that allows us to tackle a project like this one. We want to bring back to fans the opportunity to experience playing a true 16-bit RPG game on a cartridge on a console that's over 30 years old, complete with box, manual and lots of cool goodies.\u00a0 We have pre-alpha demo for you to play! Although it's missing features and mechanics, it's a proof of concept that we hope you enjoy and it will give you a nice idea of what's to come and what to expect from the final game. Have in mind that we intend to polish and improve the experience as much as we can until the game is released. You can play the demo on any SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive emulator or on original consoles using a flashcart. Get it here: https://second-dimension.com/downloads/affinity-sorrow-demo/ \u00a0And don't worry, we are going to balance the combat encounter rate. This is a very early build. Welcome to Tyrne, a rich and dense world filled with different areas waiting to be found and explored. Tyrne is a vast land full of different civilizations to meet and discover.\u00a0 As the power of the Quadra Novis is drained, the world becomes more chaotic. Animals become violent, monsters emerge, and the threat of devastation looms in the very near future. Our story begins with the tale of Nex, a young boy from the town of Fey, a small self-sustaining village surrounded by mountains and isolated from the rest of the world. Nex lives a quiet and peaceful life with his mother amongst his peers and friends until one fated night forces him to abandon his small known land. The Empyrean's, who\u2019ve been imprisoned away in another dimension for ages are somehow siphoning energy to break the seal that keeps them locked from Nex\u2019s world. But how? And\u2026 Why now? There\u2019s not much time left and something needs to be done. It will require our hero making a long journey in search of answers and several magic stones. The more Nex travels and grows as a hero, the more he questions his role in the world. Nex will need to face a dangerous yet wonderful world full of adventures on a series of escalating main story quests and side quests that will ultimately take him through an epic journey with life changing consequences for everyone. But he won\u2019t be alone on his quest, he and his always growing band of adventuring companions won\u2019t let anything nor anyone get on their way until everything is right in the world.\u00a0 We intend to tell the story of the game using all of it's features, that way the player's actions, lore and dialogue, gameplay mechanics, combat, graphics and music all will be part of how the narrative unwraps and how you experience it.\u00a0 The town of Fey will be the starting point for \u00a0of our adventure.\u00a0(final design subject to change)\u00a0 As the player you will need to meet and recruit several unique characters with different abilities along the way and use them in creative ways in order to make your way through all the dangers and challenges you will face. Develop each character from common adventurers to legendary heroes, or fall prey to the forces of evil. \u00a0 Nex is a quiet yet brave boy from a small town with great things coming up in his life although he might not be prepared for what lies ahead. Nex was born in a time when the world was in great danger and that might not have happened just by chance... \u00a0 Valeria has been feeling like an outcast in her home land for a long time now and that\u2019s because she possesses magic powers that she keeps in secret and nobody but Nex knows about. Nex and Val have been friends since their childhood. They grew up together exploring the caves nearby and fishing in the river that goes through their town. Val\u2019s powers will be of great value once they leave the safety of Fey.\u00a0 In balance with all nature, Rhelyn the druid will be a powerful ally and a great friend in times of need. A lonely old man wise enough to understand the seriousness of the situation who won\u2019t hesitate to help our young heroes as much as he can.\u00a0 She is the brains of the party. A nerd with a knack for all mechanical things, always crafting needlessly complicated gadgets and contraptions that end up being really useful.\u00a0 Patches is a werewolf and that is not a secret. Despite his big size and his eye catching appearance he is a very skilled rogue. Patches possesses tremendous strength and can be very loud, persuasive and intimidating if required but he can also be a swift and silent deadly assassin.\u00a0 Pyrrk\u00a0is a strange creature that posesses a vast knowledge about science, chemistry and alchemy making him a powerful ally. He can also be really funny and a bit of a hot head sometimes so try not to make fun of his height or his long ears.\u00a0 Lugnut is the result of Ally's wits and mechanical knowledge. Being built as a work robot, Lugnut helps Ali during battles. A strange dark knight named Gideon lurks at the limits of two realities always accompanied by a sinister figure who goes by the name of Shaddex. Who is this dark knight and why is he in the company of this strange ethereal being? Affinity Sorrow takes on a classic a well loved formula and seeks to stay true to it with high quality art, sound, music and game play while expanding it and adding some extra Second Dimension touches to it. The game will feel both familiar and refreshing to fans of the genre and very welcoming to everyone else. We're aiming at crafting an experience that equally balances 5 key features we feel are the right ingredients for it. - Storytelling The first prototype for Affinity Sorrow was made back in 2012. Since then the idea has been worked on and off and it's been slowly taking shape into a great experience. For us it's important to deliver an epic tale full of adventure and emotional moments sprinkled with lots of humor here and there. We want you to feel what our characters feel, from joy and happiness to sadness and despair. We're taking our time to craft a rich and complex plot and fill the different story chapters with, unique quests and dialogs so the world and its people feel real to you. Both main and secondary/optional dialogue and character interactions play a great part in the game. discover more about the Lore and History of Tyrne from it\u2019s inhabitants. - Engaging Look and Feel Graphics and music of a game are not the whole experience but those are indeed very important features. Everything needs to feel right. Besides the retro style and the nostalgic feeling we want to deliver a very high quality product that looks, sounds and feels appropriate to the story we\u2019re telling. We\u2019ll expand on this later. Take a look at a work in progress mock-up made in order to test the tileset we'll be using for some desert towns and areas.\u00a0 Battle backgrounds are also very important to the immersion and the whole feel of the different areas of the game. - Exciting and Fun exploration The world of Tyrne can be a very dangerous and cruel place and you will need to know it very well to make your way through it. We want a large and complex world with lots of different and threatening areas to explore, from green pastures to dark caves and beautiful castles.\u00a0 \u00a0A world map that will make traveling between distant places and finding secret areas a real joy. We don't have the final world map design yet but we can show you this pretty rough sketch to give you an idea of how the world map will look. This of course will change and evolve as we keep developing the game and the story. And here's a test of the world map tileset which allows us a lot of detail and variation. Hop on a ship and take to the high seas to look for new lands and uncharted islands across the world. We know that some of the most curious and brave adventurers will spend some extra time sailing away looking for hidden treasures while fending off a variety of aquatic foes that will surely try to turn them into their lunch. For this project we developed our own in-house map making software that makes it easy to deal with all the tiles and meta tiles making the creation of different areas easier and allows us to add some extra care to every map. - Solid and intense Combat We\u2019re developing a very engaging and intuitive easy to used active turn-based combat system with some very useful options and a large variety of attacks and abilities that will allow you to defeat even the most dangerous foes. You can also run to fight another day if you feel like it... No shame on that.\u00a0 Different \u00a0action icons depending on the selected character will help you take quick decisions and keeping the game play fast and immersive. Smooth, highly optimized animations play an important role on our combat system. A well balanced random encounter system with a great variety of unforgiving enemies and foes will be waiting for you in each area. Learn about enemy weaknesses and pay attention to your surroundings because battle areas are Interactive and there are several different items around you that can be used in combat and might give you the upper hand in each encounter. Special and unique different color enemies will pop up here and there... Prepare yourself to face epic ruthless boss fights each with different attacks and weaknesses that\u2019ll require you to learn and think fast and that\u2019ll grant you a ton of experience and some juicy loot.\u00a0 - Customizable experience (leveling up, party, items, spells,) Characters gain experience, Level up, get stronger and smarter as you progress through the story raising their stats like their hit points, mana pool, damage and learn new spells and abilities. Find items and equipment and give your characters what fits best to your play style. Difficulty of the game is designed around what the player does or decides not to do, you can choose your challenge level depending on how brave you decide to be.\u00a0 Go on! Explore the world recklessly or take your time to study and improve your arts before taking on the different challenges that the game will present you. We plan on having some side activities to keep you entertained between quests.\u00a0 For example...\u00a0 You can fish. You can pet dogs and cats. And don't forget to check everywhere for hidden stuff. NPCs In Tyrne you can find a large variety of humans and creatures. world making it feel more deep and real. You\u2019ll never feel truly alone\u2026 Unless you dare to go explore those dangerous places we told you about. We are working with templates that allow us to quickly create and modify a lot of different NPCs to fill the world with all sorts of people. As every previous project we start at a point and then it just evolves and gets better with time. Art development and improvement is still an ongoing process on Affinity Sorrow. We are hand pushing each and every pixel to get just the right feeling and making the most of the game's visuals within the console and memory limitations. Same as the map making software we have our own art program that makes the creation of palettes and pixel art assets faster and easier. It can also export straight to the right file formats we need to get the graphics into the engine in no time. Original and heavily optimized, well planned tile sets allow us to make a great variety of stages and scenarios while saving lots of memory. We can use these tile sets in full or partially and even use different color palettes to make them look even more diverse. Our main character's color palette has been optimized and worked on a lot so we can use it for whatever we might need to, from attacks and special visual effects to interfaces items and more. Even the font is hand made and uses the same color palette as the characters. Formerly a stretch goal, now built into the main funding we are pleased to announce that the main theme song of Affinity Sorrow will be composed by Hiroki Kikuta, legendary composer and sound designer of Secret of Mana, Trials of Mana and Romancing SaGa amongst . We know very well that music is the emotional backbone of a video game, music is what tells you, even if you don\u2019t realize how to feel at every step.\u00a0 That\u2019s why our musician is composing a nice and varied soundtrack with themes for each situation and a ton of sound effects to make you feel right in the middle of the action. This is what he wanted to tell you... I'm Lawrence (or Larry) McCormick although people online may recognize me as Inglebard. I've been an avid gamer since I was tall enough to reach the joystick on some of the earliest classics like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. I spent time working as first a writer, then an editor on a bunch of semi-pro websites in the late 90s and early 2000s. I wrote my first original game soundtrack for a game called Homeland for PC from Dragon Lore Software right around 2000.\u00a0 After a long hiatus, I'm back to some gaming work. I've been running my retrogaming YouTube channel, Inglebard Gaming (https://www.YouTube.com/c/InglebardGaming) for a while now and started my chiptune music channel Inglebard Music (https://www.YouTube.com/c/InglebardMusic) in 2021 where I've mainly been doing Genesis covers of music from other systems. These days you can hear my Genesis music in several projects within the Genesis homebrew and development communities and even some Sega Master System demos in that community. I've done music for the upcoming Sega Genesis demake of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the upcoming Genesis port of Street Fighter Alpha, some songs for the Genesis demo of Splatterhouse and more. \u00a0\u00a0 Musically, my inspirations come from all over the place. I love instrumental movie scores, game music from the 16-bit era on all systems, classical music, and a good helping of rock, alternative and metal from the 70s, 80s and 90s. I love surprising people with what you can do on the Genesis sound hardware! We use high quality materials for our cartridges, shells, boxes and other rewards. We manage most of the process in-house by hand soldering and writing every cartridge memories ourselves to ensure the quality of the game's copies before sending them out into the world.

  "Witch of Evansburg is a screenplay written by Andrew Fritz and with your help, his story can be more than just words and a vision, but become a reality for you and others to see. This is the dream is it not? The artist has an idea; a mental image picture for directing a film, lyrics to a song or words for a book. And over time this dream is weaved into reality via a camera, an instrument or computer. That is magic. And what is art if it not seen? Perhaps a healing just for the artist, but what about the world? We naturally seek out various forms of art for not only entertainment, but inspiration and healing. This project is to inspire those with dreams. It does not take millions of dollars to create a film. Story is important, the vision is important. That merely comes from within. The goal here is to raise just enough money to make the film happen which will force those involved to dive deep into their creativity to make the best of everything. The entire filmmaking process will be documented to not only show how the film was made, but to inspire filmmakers and people who have dreams they want to experience.\u00a0This will be Andrew's directorial debut, a dream come true. He is confident in his vision, which is really what the Witch of Evansburg is about and Andrew is confident that this film could very well provide an opportunity to create a second full length film. Why support this film? It's a great question. Not only are you supporting a dream for the director and actors, but depending on your pledge amount, there are some great rewards including aura readings, astral body healing and even meditation classes all done by the director himself! What is an aura reading? An aura reading is a spiritual hello in present time. You gain clarity on various aspects of your life and the direction you are heading. How about an astral body healing? Perhaps you have difficulties sleeping or you are just wanting to take your dreams (sleeping or waking) to the next level, then an astral body healing is for you! Why learn meditation? There are many benefits to learning how to ground and to center yourself such as; releasing negative energies in your life, becoming focused and replenishing with your own unique life force. How are these pledges even related to the film?\u00a0Well, before the witch transforms to evil, she performs energy work and provides \"visions\" which are the very elements that stir up the community that she lives near. Not from Pennsylvania or Chicago, IL - not a problem, all the rewards can be received or done long distance via phone, Skype or FaceTime. When can I expect to\u00a0receive my rewards? For film credit, access to the completed film, digital photos and behind the scenes film footage - you will have to wait until January 2017, however, if apart of your rewards is an aura reading, astral body healing, meditation sessions or clairvoyant sessions - those can be scheduled anytime with the director. What happens after the film is made? The goal is to submit to as many film festivals as possible and then to submit to Amazon. When will the film be made? Spring of 2016 and Autumn of 2016. What will happen between now and\u00a0the actual filming? Even though the screenplay is complete, there is much work to be done. Hardware and software for audio and video will need to be tested, casting needs to be completed, the remaining locations need to be selected and of course, the shot list will involve a lot of work. How is the money that is donated to be used exactly? Editing: $330 Video: $1040 Sound: $755 Costumes / Props: $1150 Travel: $200 Kickstarter / Festival fees: $225 Connect \u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRjCjF6KyGdBuWnqrNwgFXw https://www.facebook.com/Witch-of-Evansburg-902168613152903/?ref=hl",
  "Welcome and thank you so much for showing interest in my new project! Five years ago i started taking pictures in my free time. I did not really think this would be a permanent thing, it kind of just happened and i wasn\u00b4t even thinking about where it will lead me. I started a facebook page, showing some content to a small audience and get very positive feedback. First I was surprised but in the same time i was so happy and thought: \"THAT\u00b4S IT!\" \nI started working like crazy on all different photography stuff,I wanted to know everything! But most importantly i was actually shooting and working with other people, creating scenes, a special atmosphere and a room for emotions, that\u00b4s what i love to do!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As my focus in my photography is on men the calendar is called #HE_MAN.

I hope you like it!

  "Bren Plus Ten is creating a shorter version of the musical Oliver giving at-risk teens in the Memphis area a chance to express themselves using performing arts. The musical will be performed by 40 to 50\u00a0 6 - 8 grade students in the Memphis area, auditioning students from low performing schools. The musical is free to the public and is the first of many plays to come.  Bren Plus Ten At Festival is presented by Brenette Netters, Janice Holt-Lucas and Tonya Bradford. The Bren Plus Ten Art Festival is an extension of the Bren Plus Ten Youth Mentoring Program which is funded out-of-pocket by Brenette Netters and Tonya Bradford. All funding for the Bren Plus Ten Arts Festival will go toward renting a building for the musical, costumes, stage hands and props.\u00a0 Our goal is to help at-risk teens become productive at home, school and the community. Through creative art these kids will be able to flourish through the art of expression.  Because most teens love to sing and perform, this groundbreaking musical, Oliver, will give at-risk teens a freedom of expression while entertaining the audience. Where Is The Musical Being Performed The musical will be performed in Memphis, Tennessee in May at the end of the school year.  This play is the first of many musicals that will be performed by at-risk youths in the Memphis area. It takes a village to raise a child and we want to be apart of that village.  Using creative arts to give teens the freedom of expression, we all win.",
  "I, along with my fellow Performing Arts students at Fishers High School, saw this video and wanted to recreate it. But we felt that the school's auditorium could not do the performance justice, so we are looking for $3500 to rent the Palladium for a day to perform the number. Please help us achieve our dream.

  "It has always been my dream to make other people's dreams come true through photography. I love dressing people up and taking their photos. I mostly do families but since my grandmother passed away, she lost her battle with breast cancer, I have been doing a lot of beautiful photos of women who have lost one or both breasts to breast cancer. I think that they are beautiful and spectacular. I do not have permission to share their photos at this time but I'm hoping this will show that regardless of what happens you are still beautiful inside and out! Please help me make my dream come true! I work a full time job supporting a family of four which isn't easy but this will help so much because I wouldn't have to work as much as I do now!",
  "We\u2019d like to introduce you to NOTA \u2013 a surprisingly effective app-powered mole tracker. NOTA works by measuring the electrical impedance of moles on your skin. It is actually a little known fact that moles and tumors have a very different electrical impedance \u2013 this is what allows NOTA to work, and track changes in your body over time. \u00a0 Besides the electrical impedance, moles and melanoma have several notable differences. Moles (or the medical term: Nevi) are pigmented skin formations that vary in color and can be brown, black, red, or purple (though rarely more than one color). Those moles that show up after sunbathing, start itching, or have grown and/or changed color should be taken seriously and checked. Melanoma causes a large majority of skin cancer deaths, and can develop out of ordinary moles in response to UV light, injuries, or even rubbing. The American Cancer Society\u2019s estimates about 100,350 new melanomas will be diagnosed in the United States during 2020. Of those, 6,850 are expected to be fatal. The rates of melanoma have been rising rapidly over the past few decades. A true melanoma can only be confirmed by healthcare specialists, and it\u2019s important to do as early as possible, as late-stage diagnosis may lead to severe consequences. That\u2019s why monitoring your moles is vital. Before, you were only able to do it by paying close attention to any changes in your moles. NOTA is the most accurate and convenient way to track your moles. \u00a0Real smartphone video that clearly shows Nota's functionality\u00a0 Normal tissue and tumors have different amounts of water in them, which leads to differences in bioimpedance: a measure of how well the body impedes the flow of an electric current. By using super-sensitive electrodes, NOTA can measure tiny differences in bioimpedance in the skin and specifically, within your moles. As long as the cell contents are normal, NOTA will show a green light. When the light turns yellow or red, this indicates abnormalities and changes in your mole. The mobile app allows you to track your moles and any changes over time. It also offers regularly updated health information on skin, moles, and how to properly care for them.\u00a0 NOTA is designed to fit into your everyday routine. Just like an at-home thermometer, you can use NOTA to check any changes in your moles whenever you are concerned, or at regular intervals. NOTA is a collaboration between engineers, entrepreneurs, scientists and designers who are dedicated to creating portable devices that improve people\u2019s lives from the palm of their hand. We bring together a vast collective of professional experience from many industries, giving us the creativity to create truly inspiring, world-changing smart gadgets. We believe every marker of health should have its own \u201cthermometer\u201d equivalent, an at-home detection device that is simple and easy to use. By bringing these devices into existence, we are helping to create a healthier world. NOTA was developed over a rigorous 2-year period, with several prototypes and scientific validity testing. We initially determined the types of sensitive electrodes we would need to measure impedance in the skin, then focused on simplifying them into a single device. From there, we streamlined the design into something anyone can use at home. Now, the NOTA is a remarkably accurate hand-held medical device capable of providing possible early warnings for those with a risk of melanoma.

  "What is our community project?\u00a0 Needless Alley is currently working with Look Ahead and Idea Store to hold a one\u00a0day performance workshop and to help implement an arts festival for a local London community.\u00a0During the workshop, we will work with the communities young people (age 16 to 25) through interactive\u00a0artistic practices in order to encourage them understand their local community and to become active members\u00a0within it.\u00a0 The workshop will focus on how the participants view and understand their local community\u00a0and the ways in which they want to develop and improve their surroundings. Through sharing\u00a0our performance making techniques- this will give the participants a medium beyond talking (or,\u00a0rather, not talking) to express themselves. During the workshop we will introduce: improvisation techniques in dance, music, and spoken\u00a0work; the use of communication skills to create collaborative performances; and the exploration\u00a0of local stories and politics into their creative work.\u00a0 At the end of the workshop, Needless Alley will present a special performance of In Embryo\u00a0based off of the collaboration done with the participants during the day and their community-\u00a0all of the participants will be invited as special guests to the performance. This performance\u00a0will allow the participants to witness the skills they were introduced to during the workshop be\u00a0implemented into a performance. After the workshop and experiencing an example, participants will be given a seed commission in order\u00a0for them to organise a one day arts and community festival, which members of Needless Alley\u00a0will give support and advice- but this will be the young people's project. How will we achieve this?\u00a0 First, in order to ensure participants are interested and attend the workshop we will offer two\u00a0participants a work experience package in event organisation in co-ordinance with their Look\u00a0Ahead programme. They will work with Needless Alley to promote and organise the workshop\u00a0in a way that the local young people will respond to and, in exchange, they will be provided\u00a0mentorship from the company and have their expenses paid for. Then, during the workshop we will provide the participants a safe place to express themselves\u00a0and take artistic chances. Having an experience of being empowered to try without judgment\u00a0will give them the confidence to take more chances- such as putting on an arts and community\u00a0festival. Finally, following the workshop, Needless Alley will still be in contact with the participants\u00a0to provide mentorship to the participants while they organise and run a one day arts and\u00a0community festival. They will be given monetary support with \u00a31000 towards the event, which\u00a0will be monitored by Needless Alley in collaboration with Look Ahead and Idea Store. Why is this important? This project is important because it helps disengaged young people to look at their local\u00a0surroundings, to talk about them and to understand how they would like them to be developed.\u00a0This could be that they would like more local shops to open (as opposed to the standard\u00a0corporate chains), a new park to be built, or a new gaming centre. All opinions are valid and will\u00a0be welcomed.\u00a0 Having a long term goal, of a one-day arts and community festival, will give the participants a\u00a0much needed platform to share their wants, find out what the community as a whole desire, and\u00a0lead, by example, that people within the community can make developments. The one-day arts\u00a0and community festival will also give them a chance to set the foundation for relationships with\u00a0local businesses, residents and other artists, which they can build up in order to achieve other\u00a0goals for their community. Creating these lines of communication and involvement with their\u00a0local community will provide a sense of belonging and achievement- something that is normally\u00a0lacking for the participants.\u00a0 It is our hope that the participants make this a yearly event, pursue the other goals they have to\u00a0develop their local community, and continue to have a sense of belonging and achievement. What will the money be used for?\u00a0 \u00a31000 for the seed commission that the participants will use towards the arts and community\u00a0festival day; \u00a3900 (divided among 3 advisors) for the mentorship package of advisory meetings and project\u00a0supervision for three months; \u00a3500 (divided among 5 workshop leaders) for 2 months of preparation and running the one day\u00a0workshop; \u00a3300 for documenting the process in order to help the participants make a publicity reel for a\u00a0future arts and community festival*; \u00a3200 (divided among 2 participants) for stipends for work experience package; \u00a3100 to hire a technical manager for the performance after the workshop. Total: \u00a33,000** *Please note: The documentation will also be featured on the Needless Alley Collective website\u00a0and will not be exclusively for the participants' use. **Also, note that the projects grand total is \u00a36340, but with local support and funding from the\u00a0Arts Council we have been able to reduce its cost to the figure of \u00a33000, listed above.",
  "EXPECTING is a horror/sci-fi short about a woman coming to terms with the child inside her, and who grossly underestimates what to expect at delivery.  The miracle of birth has always been a fascinating, and yet at the same time, terrifying concept to writer/director Jackie Perez.\u00a0 You hear that having a baby is one of most painful things that anyone can go through.\u00a0 Your body and life are never the same afterward.\u00a0 Without knowing who this person is, or who they are going to become, you are expected to love this being unconditionally and hope that through your love, they grow into a better person than you ever were.\u00a0\u00a0 EXPECTING is the story of Marilyn - a happy-go-lucky young woman who has her whole life ahead of her and shares it with her loving boyfriend, Aaron.\u00a0 During a camping trip with friends, Marilyn wakes up from a horrible nightmare and can only recall the foggiest of details.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, she learns she is pregnant.\u00a0 Something doesn't seem right with her body, though, and she quickly becomes depressed. Her family and friends convince her that everything will be alright and that the baby will bring joy to her life.\u00a0 No class or book could prepare her for what was to come... The film will be between 10-15 minutes long depending on the final version of the script.\u00a0 We will be shooting in 4 different locations over the span of 3 days in late July. WRITER/DIRECTOR/EDITOR - JACKIE PEREZ.\u00a0 Jackie loves all things horror and can't wait to bloody things up on set.\u00a0 She lives in Los Angeles, works in development and creates short films when she can.\u00a0 This is her 5th short film...this ain't her first rodeo - she started making movies while studying engineering at MIT.\u00a0 She strives to hire and work with military veterans, is on the advisory board of Veterans in Film and Television, and is a vocal advocate for gender equality in Hollywood. Jackie's reel can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/121133633.\u00a0 Her last short DRYER LINT was an official selection at Queer Horror, and Fears for Queers V. PRODUCER - ANDR\u00c9 ANDREWS.  This is the second film that Andr\u00e9 and Jackie have worked on together, so they have a rapport and know how to work together to get the job done in the most professional way possible. Andr\u00e9 produced a music video for the Australian band Flight Facilities, as well as the feature film \"Lonely Boy\".\u00a0 He also worked on the crew of studio films Godzilla and Ninja Turtles and is also a member of Veterans in Film and Television.\n\n DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY - MATTHEW RENOIR.\u00a0 Matthew is a Los Angeles-based cinematographer whose work includes the Horror Shorts - The Chicken Run, Dryer Lint, Seer, and A Zombie Next Door, as well as Feature Films Beast Wishes, Kong: Long Live The King, Harbinger Down, and The Ascent.\u00a0 Matthew's reel can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/126285684.\u00a0 He will be filming EXPECTING on a Blackmagic 4K camera. Sarah, who is a originally from Germany, has now settled into LA with her best 4 legged friend Tater.  She's been a part of many exciting projects, most recently a stage production of Calendar Girls at the California Theater, Indie film \"Cloudy with a Chance of Sunshine\" and a music video with British songwriter Tom Odell.  A cool fact about Sarah, she actually got her degree in Biology and Biomedical Sciences and loves anatomy!  She's so excited to be a part of this exciting new project! Aspiring to become Cary Grant.

He obtained his B.A. in Theater from San Francisco State University and is a student at Playhouse West. When he's not acting, he can be found perusing the wine aisles, taking Instagram photos of his cats, and preparing three-course meals just for fun. Fun fact: if he wasn\u2019t an actor, he would be a Forensic Anthropologist. (Maybe.) Fluent in Spanish, Silverstein calls herself bi-ignorant. Silverstein edits to AP Style, can recite the presidents in order, and chicken-clucks \"The Blue Danube.\" She also does a wicked impression of a chimp getting irked. Armen Babasoloukian is a classically trained actor, model, comedian and host. His deep complexion and rugged good looks have served both him and his career well, as has his sense of humor.\u00a0 We have calculated the budget a few dollars shy of $5000, not including incidentals.\u00a0 Most of our crew are providing their own equipment, which decreases rental costs and allows more of the budget to go towards production design and effects.\u00a0 We believe in compensating cast and crew for their time and talent which is why that is the largest portion of our budget. We'd love to have your support on this project even if it's just spreading the word. \u00a0This is going to be a really exciting film to work on and we hope you will be a part of it with us- we love what we do and want to share it with you.\u00a0 There are plenty of ways to support and get involved.\u00a0 If you have any other questions you can message us here or at expectingfilm@gmail.com KICKSTARTER VIDEO MUSIC: Rumble, Popdance - Bensound.com",
  "We, Robert and Cailin of Campbell + Green, are recording a new full length album. Release date is set for May, just in time for our 3rd European Tour.\u00a0 We're approaching this album a little differently than we have in the past with our previous albums. The songs themselves are a little different in that several of them are more focused on our \"being human\". We're also paring it down from the full band to a more acoustic duo sound, along with some guest musicians, to reflect more of who we are and how we sound as a duo.\n\u00a0 We have a lot of time, money and work invested in this project already and we know its going to be great. Now we need your support to get it to completion. The funds will help pay for: producing, studio and equipment rental, mixing, mastering, CD printing both in Canada and in Europe, and distribution services to get our songs out to radio. We've got some really great rewards for your donations, too, so have a look. Thank you so much for being a part of our dreams!",
  "A cast and crew didn't breathe life into it yet, there was no film, no set, no wardrobe - nothing.   I had created the comic in 2006 as a six-part mini-series that was later compiled in 2008 as a graphic novel. Kevin Christensen's art and Erin Kohut's editing helped to create one of the flagship titles at Alterna Comics and seven years later, here we are.  When we held a Kickstarter campaign last year to raise money for pre-production development on the film - all of that changed.  Our first campaign didn't reach its $300K goal, but we made it almost half-way there and managed to pick up investor interest, distributor interest, and build awareness for our film.  When we relaunched with a smaller goal of $40K, we had some ups and downs but in the end, 499 backers came together to make filming possible! We went through some casting and production crew changes since then but on February 9th, 2015 - cameras began rolling. We wrapped principal photography about two weeks later and are now at a point in post-production where it's time to start taking the last steps to tie up any loose ends on the film. To do this, we need funds to edit, correct and enhance the color and sound, hire a composer to create a chilling soundtrack - basically everything that needs to be done to turn a hundred hours of raw footage into a great movie. If we raise more than what we're asking for, these funds will go towards submitting to film festivals and comic and horror conventions. Witnessing the brutal killings of his fellow inmates\u00a0(played by Ezra Buzzington, Jacob Banser, and John Siciliano) at the hands of the prison's sadistic and psychotic Warden (Bill Oberst Jr.) and his crew of guards\u00a0(played by Roddy Piper, Noah Hathaway, Zach Galligan, Derrick Damions, and Kyle Hester), Sullivan decides that the only way to survive is to fight back. But as he's forced to match the brutality occurring in the prison, Sullivan is pushed to the brink of madness. Even if you can't afford to contribute, tweets/shares/spreading the word about our campaign and our film can go a long way as well. With your help and support, we can make this happen! Thank you!",
  "The Woman Without a Face\u00a0follows our main character, Allison, as she struggles with the idea that another woman is trying to take over her life. Inspired by films like Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby,\u00a0and The Innocents, The Woman Without a Face deals with questions about what it is to be a woman as Allison slowly loses her grip on what is happening to her. The film blends modern elements of the horror genre with an observational style seen from directors like Lucrecia Martel and Roman Polanski, all culminating in a unique and unsettling experience.\u00a0 The Woman Without a Face\u00a0is primarily funded by a grant from Studio 22, but that money only covers a portion of production costs.

  "When I was young, the basement in my childhood home scared me beyond belief. I refused to go down there unless someone else was with me. What was even worse was the connecting crawl space. I never went in there. Every now and then, I would watch my father go inside it to check on the water pipes or the furnace and instantly my imagination took over. At night, I would dream of monsters creeping out of the crawl space and feeding on me in the basement. My cries were muffled by their claws, and no one ever heard my screams.  I'd be stuck in the basement forever... THE BASEMENT is a feature-length horror film about two distant brothers trying to reconnect after the death of their parents. When Ryan, the younger of the two, returns to their childhood home, he\u2019s met by a mysterious woman telling him, \u201cDon\u2019t go in the basement.\u201d Brushed off as ridiculous, Ryan unpacks, only slightly worried by the woman\u2019s words. But when a string of bizarre occurrences transpire inside the basement, Ryan and his older brother Chris realize that the woman might not be crazy after all. Chris has gone inside the basement and now he\u2019s starting to hear voices inside his head, telling him to do the most awful things. He\u2019s having visions of suicide and murder. The brothers must come together to solve the mystery before Chris becomes lost forever. The film was shot on location in Southeastern Massachusetts inside the very basement and crawl space I grew up fearing.\u00a0 We used cast and crew from all throughout New England and shot through the bleak winter months in 2013 during hurricane Nemo. Here's an article about us shooting in my hometown: http://www.wickedlocal.com/x898136229/Holbrook-horror-at-Stanney-s?zc_p=0#axzz2LZcitguN Now in sunny Los Angeles, we are currently in full swing of post-production. We are looking to premiere THE BASEMENT this fall at many horror film festivals throughout the United States, Canada and Europe.  THE BASEMENT has completed filming, but now we need help crossing the finish line. There's a lot left to do in post-production, and also, getting our movie out there for the world to see. The funds we hope to raise here on Kickstarter are for the following: POST PRODUCTION: FILM FESTIVALS: Thank you for taking the time out of your day to look at our project. We can't thank you enough for perusing our Kickstarter. Please help us in getting to our goal of $12,000. Anything you can give, we will be greatly appreciative.

  "Hello, I'm Cassidy! I am an independent artist and I love to create cute, colorful, and sometimes creepy artworks! I enjoy taking these designs and turning them into wearable flair, such as enamel pins and stickers. My last Kickstarter campaign was successfully funded, and all rewards were fulfilled ahead of schedule, so I am confident that this campaign will be managed just as efficiently. The Koi-Koi Hanafuda Enamel Pin campaign will help bring to life my interpretation of the traditional designs of Japanese Hanafuda cards in the form of enamel pins as well as washi tape! I am passionate about this project, and your support means the world to me. To see updates, future designs and more of what I've created, please check out my Etsy shop and my Instagram page. All items are offered at their LOWEST PRICE during the campaign! Prices for the pins, washi, and stickers will be higher after the Kickstarter.\u00a0 While not all designs are unlocked initially, please pledge as though all designs were unlocked and you could get every single pin you wanted. This will help us to unlock all pins faster! You can always change your pledge at any time during the campaign, so there is zero-risk pledging! \u00a0Hanafuda is a style of Japanese playing cards made out of paper and cardboard. On the face of each card is a depiction of flowers, scrolls, subjects (animals and other objects), or culturally-significant scenes. Hanafuda are used to play a variety of games like Koi-Koi (which is my personal favorite!) There are 48 cards total in a Hanafuda deck, divided into twelve suits, each representing a month of the year. Each suit is designated by a specific flower or plant. There are 5 cards in each Hanafuda deck that are super special! These are known as Lights or Brights. These cards are represented in this collection by Hanafuda-card-shaped pins. Each pin in this Hanafuda Collection does have a special meaning according to Japanese Folklore, which we will share at the very bottom of this page. All rewards will be shipped via USPS with tracking info. Although this does cost more than untracked shipping, it ensures your rewards will arrive to you safely! I have manually calculated shipping costs for many different countries for many different rewards to ensure the most accurate cost. NOTE: Due to the ongoing pandemic, shipping times are not guaranteed. Please ensure your country is currently accepting international packages. I can hold packages to be shipped at a later time for anyone who lives in a country not currently accepting foreign packages. \u2740 Washi tapes are in-hand, and pledges consisting of only washi tapes will be fulfilled immediately upon campaign end. Additional rolls will be ordered if needed. \u2740 Please note that these are very rough, estimated timeframes where I've given some generous buffers to account for unexpected delays. Delays (or early arrivals) are still possible, and delays will be communicated if they occur.\u00a0 *if additional are needed 'Karagoromo\u00a0 kitsutsu narenishi\u00a0 tsuma shi areba\u00a0 barubaru kinuru\u00a0 tabi wo shi zo omou' \u00a0 Translation: 'I have a beloved wife Familiar as the skirt Of a well-worn robe And so this distant jouneying Fills my heart with grief' \u00a0 At first glance, the poem seems to have nothing to do with irises. However, it is an acrostic. The first Japanese letters of each row of the poem spell out \u201ckakitsubata\u201d which is the name of the species of beautiful purple iris that filled the marshes.",
  "Hi! I'm Litchling, the artist behind this project! I always loved designing clothes and accessories but I was never brave enough to make them true. Now, with the encouragement of my family and friends, I decided to try to bring these wallets I designed to life, \u00a0but this will of course not be possible without your help! I first showed four of my designs on my Twitter account and they received a lot of positive feedback, since I can't afford the production costs by myself I decided to start this campaign!\u00a0 Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that allows creators to bring their projects to life, if you like mine you can help me fund it by pledging! I recommend pledging for the designs you want even if these are still locked, because that will help them get unlocked. Don't worry you can edit or cancel your pledge anytime before the campaign ends! Once the campaign ends I will send out a survey for you to choose the designs of the wallets and/or card holders that you want! You won't be charged for your pledge until the campaign ends, that's means pledge now, pay later.

  "\u00a0\u00a0Settling Scores\u00a0 Vol. II \u00a0There are eight songs on this record.\u00a0 And one is almost thirteen minutes long.\u00a0 \u00a0Below are some reference and attribution notes about each of the songs. 1)\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPitchforks and Torches\u201d is a line I ripped from the muddled diatribe of a boot-licking slave from the state of Wisconsin.\u00a0 That is Jaimee Harris singing with me.\u00a0 Even if you don't get this record...don't forget that name.\u00a0 \u00a02)\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGoodbye\u201d is a Steve Earle song I'm pretty sure I would have written\u2026if he hadn\u2019t.\u00a0 \u00a0 And that's Jaimee Harris again singing the duet with me. 3)\u00a0 \u00a0 Robbinson Jeffers, my most influential poet,\u00a0 wrote an epic poem called \u201cDear Judas.\u201d   It could have been called \u201cLove, Betrayal and Forgiveness.\u201d   As could my song of the same title.\n\u00a0 4)\u00a0 Page 243 of the novel  My Best Friend\u2019s Exorcist provided the dots  (though from an altogether different painting) that I tried to connect in \u201cIt Could Be a Long Night.\u2019   Thanks to Danny Goddard for some help on this song.\n\u00a0 5)\u00a0 \u00a0I first recorded \u201cLiliana\u201d on my debut album, It's Later Than You Think (2008), which is now out of print.  I wrote it in the 1980\u2019s.  With the recording of  \u201cThe New Brownsville Girl,\u201d the song started bubbling up again.  It is the oldest of my songs that I still play.\u00a0 \u00a0And that's all I really got to say about it here.\u00a0 6)\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe Black Dress\u201d was informed by an imminent event I watched a trio of sisters preparing for.   \n\u00a0 7)\u00a0 \u00a0 Gurf  Morlix is singing the \u201cHigh Fructose\u201d pre-song here.   He and I made a full recording of \u201cHigh Fructose Corn Syrup\u201d on my 2011 record, Okra and Ecclesiastes. \u201cMore for Us, Less for Them\u201d evolved from an idea for a spoken-word piece.   And wound up being the only song I ever wrote using a drum machine.\n\u00a0 8)\u00a0 In 1986 I ran to the record store---like I always did---to buy Bob Dylan\u2019s newest release, Knocked Out Loaded.   The album seemed to me then, as it does now, to have been his absolute poorest effort.   But there was one very notable exception.  Which was a seventeen verse, twelve-minute-long song called \u201cBrownsville Girl.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0https://vimeo.com/183524348 \u00a0It was a magnificent, impenetrable epic that I played over and over in an effort to decode it. \nAdding to the mystery of the song was something I discovered in the liner notes:  Dylan had co-written it with playwright Sam Shepard.  Which made such obvious sense---his western cinematic fingerprints were all over the spectrum of the narrative.\n\u00a0 Years later I would learn that \u201cBrownsville Girl\u201d was a revision and re-recording of the Dylan/Shepard song, \u201cNew Danville Girl,\u201d which was supposed to go on Dylan\u2019s previous (and much better) album, Empire Burlesque.    The structure, the chord progression, the story-line, and over ninety-six percent of the words in \u201cBrownsville Girl\u201d were unchanged, though the previous track lacked the passion, the power, and the building tension of its gleaming successor.   It\u2019s true, the recording on Knocked Out Loaded is over-produced, dated, and rife with sonic clich\u00e9s.  But in a good way.   Not to mention it was one of the most stunning vocal performances Dylan ever recorded.\n\u00a0 As with many Dylan songs, this one was a bit \u2018informed\u2019 by earlier material, namely by Woody Guthrie, who had recorded (and copyrighted) the song \u201cDanville Girl.\u201d  And Woody\u2019s song seems to be very much \u2018informed\u2019 by an even older bluegrass standard of the same name.  There\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about any of this.  Considering who we are talking about.\n\u00a0 But furthermore  (some folks just can\u2019t help themselves when it comes to worming to the bottom of things like this),  the Dylan-Shepard song was a less-than-veiled reply to a Lou Reed song, \u201cDoin\u2019 the Things that We Want To Do.\u201d   Ironically, that song, Lou Reed\u2019s song, is largely built upon Reed having gone to see the Sam Shepard play, Fool for Love.  Indeed, the first line of that Reed song is:  \u2018The other night we went to see Sam\u2019s play.\u2019    With all this in account, it could not be called coincidence that the first line in Dylan and Shepard\u2019s \u201cBrownsville Girl\u201d is:  \u2018Well, there\u2019s this movie I seen one time\u2026.\u2019\nKinda crazy, huh?\u00a0 \u00a0All this vague homage does seem circuitously incestuous.  \nBut be that as it may, and irrespective of Dylan scholarship, I have gone to some length here examining the song\u2019s layered past.  This is partly a search for an explanation.   But primarily a hope of exoneration, an exoneration of my having taken the song \u201cBrownsville Girl,\u201d and boiled-out of it  (and injected into it) my own story:  \u201cThe New Brownsville Girl,\"\u00a0 using less than five percent of the lyrics from the Dylan/Shepard song. I will leave it to the rare, genuine listener, with his surviving  interest and focus, to comparatively sort-out what seems to have gone down in the thirty years between a pair of twelve-minute songs.   As Dylan said in yet another masterpiece:  \u201cThere\u2019s been a lotta water under the bridge.  And a lotta other stuff, too.\u201d\nMeanwhile, I would just like to thank Bob and Sam and Woody and Lou, for their founding (and derivative)  parts in all this.   Guys, I could not have done it without you.   But this\u2026this is my song now. \n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ How this record happened.\u00a0 More or Less. He had thought it unlikely there would be another record.   He\u2019d already made more than he could really account for, and it seemed that recording another would be like scooting just one more ragged flag up that same\u2019ol leaning flag pole.  \n\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t \u2018burn-out.\u2019  Which is just a term abused by those who have never themselves really \u2018burned.\u2019  It was more-like a sense of defeat by the , cookie-cutter amalgamation of the American landscape, its inauthentic intellectualism, spiritualism and the one in which he had been working as an artist.  He imagined himself\u2026irrelevant, which is a dramatically more pathological condition than burn-out.\n\u00a0 Not that he had ever had cause to believe that anything he was building would ever really float.  But from the very start---that first time he breathed into a stage microphone---he had been secretly holding-out for a collective response of revelation from beyond.  And it had never coalesced.   \nHe wasn\u2019t disillusioned, but rather disavowed, untethered from the fleet of precepts that had once been his channel markers.  Sure, he had a \u2018body of work\u2019 which he could hold up or point to, but when he looked at it he felt oddly sociopathic toward it, non-emotive.   This, he knew, was the most dangerous place that one (living under the auspices of artistic freedom) could find himself.  Moreover, this wasn\u2019t really something that had happened to him.  This was his own damned doing.  And he knew it.   \n\u00a0 For another record to get made, he would have to recover some of what he had lost---what he had blithely scattered across the Fifty States---or find some other currency for the stock and trade of the music business.   The songs just weren\u2019t doing it for him.  He had seen too many of them roll off into the gutter  (both his own songs, and those of others) to think this was about that.\nThough it was no longer the 1970\u2019s, the essence of the music business was still all about who had the best drugs.  As an artist, you could light up the artifices of social media, and fill in the canyons between the lines in your songs with crisp curations of your digitized, crafted image.  If you were any good at that kinda thing, you could keep a buzz going.  24/7\n\u00a0 The fact was it was just a waste of time to kick out any footlights these days.  Not unless you had a smoking graphic to go with it.  In a sort of sissified death grip, the music culture had its toneless arms around sound and image, and its bitter tongue in the ear of fame.  It had thrown out the baby and was drinking the bath water. There was no palpable interest in what a song or a record meant any more.   And therein lay the substance of his feelings of irrelevance.  In short, he wondered:\u00a0 what was the use?\n\u00a0 But then love---of all things---walked by his door.  And his mood began to change.  And his imagination cleared.\u00a0 He could see he still had irons in the fires he had started long ago.\u00a0 It was like unfinished business.\u00a0 \u00a0Volume II.\u00a0 Settling Scores.\u00a0 \u00a0",
  "When the zombie plague strikes, not even Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes are safe. Marvel Zombies is a cooperative board game for 1 to 6 players, based on the core mechanics of the smash hit Zombicide series, bringing non-stop zombie action to the Marvel universe. The original art by comics legend Marco Checchetto is brought to life in amazing game pieces depicting the iconic Marvel characters in glorious (and often gory) detail.\u00a0 Fight the insatiable hunger, for heroes never die, they just change. Learn more about the Optional Buys: Galactus, the Devourer, Fantastic 4: Under Siege, Hydra Resurrection, Clash of the Sinister Six, Guardians of the Galaxy Set, Sentinel Strike, Artist's Special Edition Set, Tile Set, Plastic Tokens, and Extra Dice Set. The folks at Quackalope joined in for a couple gameplay sessions using a virtual prototype. First we have a Zombie Mode gameplay using the Marvel Zombies core box:\u00a0 And then we have a Hero Mode gameplay using the X-Men Resistance core box: We will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel Zombies - A Zombicide Game core box (Zombie Mode), however many copies you get, and it is estimated to deliver around October 2022, about the same time as it goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the Marvel Zombies: X-Men Resistance core box (Hero Mode) and Galactus the Devourer (if acquired), the box of Rewards and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around June 2023. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated June 2023 delivery date. Please take note that once the Pledge Manager launches the shipping options will also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline.\u00a0 Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), or USA (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping the base pledges. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on any optional buys you choose. >>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT. >>> Traditional Chinese, Korean, and Thailand language editions will be available for pre-order at a later time in their own currency. Please see the FAQ for more details.\u00a0 Please note that Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates.\u00a0If USPS is not available, these rates may change. These are the territories we are able to ship to. If your country is not listed here, we will be forced to refund and cancel your pledge: Be aware that we\u2019ll only be able to fulfill pledges confirmed in the pledge manager system and within\u00a0the deadline\u00a0provided upon the system launch. Once the pledge manager closes we won\u2019t be able to deliver unconfirmed pledges. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us. The table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

  "In the face of the growing threat presented by the Order of Reason, mystick mages from across the globe came together for a Grand Convocation in the hopes of finding mutual defense and turning the tide of the nascent Ascension War. Now, with over five hundred years of history behind them, the membership of the Council of Nine Mystick Traditions must reconcile its past and forge a new path into the 21st century.\u00a0 Lore of the Traditions explores the history, practices, and politics of each current member of the Council of Nine. This book lays bare the secrets and shame of the Traditions, recounting past tragedy and triumph, and details how each of these magickal societies approaches the quest for Ascension heading in to the mid-21st century. It all seemed so simple once: Magic good, technology bad. As both fictional mages and players of Mage realize, however, nothing is quite that simple. Magic, as Mage continually asserts, is technology. Whether that technology involves concoctions, crossbows, or computer networks is a matter of semantics. The line between a wizard in his tower and a hacker in her basement gets pretty damned fuzzy, after all, once you realize they\u2019re doing the same thing with different tools and rhetoric. As our not-so-new-millennium speeds toward its fourth decade, those simple old delusions point toward a troubling new question: Now what? In an age of transformation, what does \u201ctradition\u201d even mean? That question, for mages of the Council of Nine Mystick Traditions, isn\u2019t merely academic. The 21st century (with or without an Avatar Storm) poses dilemmas that medieval wizards could never have imagined: issues of power, ethics, technology, even reality itself. Where \u201ctradition\u201d once sounded comforting and stable, that term begs vital questions now: Which features of \u201cthe Old Ways\u201d must change when confronted by the new, and which elements were worth preserving to begin with? Lore of the Traditions doesn\u2019t simply rehash material from older books. Instead, it explores where Mage\u2019s nine Traditions began and where they\u2019re headed now. Ultimately, the magick is yours. Let\u2019s see where it leads us. Lore of the Traditions contains: This M20: LORE OF THE TRADITIONS Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable us to create a deluxe hardcover edition of this book, designed to specifically serve as a setting supplement and sourcebook for the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. We want to create a deluxe edition with a cover featuring spot gloss, an embossed/debossed title treatment, a silk ribbon bookmark, weighing in at 180+ full color interior pages. Exceptional funding will allow us to further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play. The Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Lore of the Traditions. The primary purpose behind this Kickstarter campaign is to enable Onyx Path to create the best version of Lore of the Traditions that's possible. Your support will allow Onyx Path to use the best production, the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for this book. An amazing digital PDF product will be created with this material. With your help we will be able to take it a step further and produce a deluxe hardcover version of M20: Lore of the Traditions for\u00a0fans and collectors. The main goal and primary focus of this Kickstarter campaign is the creation of this limited-edition book. Exceptional funding may allow Lore of the Traditions team to explore more of the world of the mages, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and supplements. Beyond those campaign-specific goals, the hope is to do what these games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this epic journey and become part of our own tradition. All participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($30,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target. In thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses. Cast Your Spell: do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version or go all in with the deluxe hardcover version? Are you just interested in the new book created by this campaign, or looking to add extras with the Add-On options available as well? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses. While mages may bend and shape complex realities, we've kept supporting this project as simple and straightforward as possible. To pledge support to this project and receive the book in one of the formats offered, pick one of these reward tiers: In addition to these primary reward pledge tiers, we also offer the following options: ACCESS TO DRAFT MANUSCRIPT UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for M20: Lore of the Traditions. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates. LORE OF THE TRADITIONS PDF VERSION - The digital version of M20: Lore of the Traditions, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive a redemption links for an early version of this book before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will automatically be added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience. LORE OF THE TRADITIONS DELUXE HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a deluxe hardcover edition of this book. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the deluxe version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location. OPTIONAL DISCOUNTED PoD VERSION \u2013 For this M20: Lore of the Traditions campaign, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy of the PDF directly from their PoD partners at discounted cost (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which may be some time after the books have gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the books from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards. In addition to the rewards listed in each Pledge Tier, backers can add extra options via the Add On menu associated with your reward format. Digital Rewards can be added to any pledge, while physical rewards can only be added to rewards lists that include a version of Lore of the Traditions deluxe hardcover book, and have therefore established shipping parameters. As we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list for backers of the relevant Stretch Goal path. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.

When you pledge to a reward tier that includes a physical item (the M20: Lore of the Traditions deluxe hardcover book), Kickstarter will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location. Unfortunately, international shipping has become increasing expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. If you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy: After the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however. Onyx Path Publishing has managed more than 50 Kickstarter projects, and that experience allows us to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals.

  "The Adventurer's RPG Tiles are beautiful modular terrain tiles that each feature an open space design and another with \"trinkets\" or extras such as footprints, a piece of armour, a magic mushroom, etc. Small visuals to enhance the players experience and spark interest and exploration at every corner.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- These tiles may be used to expand on your board games, D&D games and other RPG tabletop games as well as miniature war games.\u00a0 \u00a0Since we are using a small US based manufacturer, shipping costs to the rest of the world are quite high. Instead of relaunching this campaign as a DIGITAL product ONLY, I decided to offer all options. Therefore those that want a physical set can still get them as well as those that just want the downloads, ALL at a very discounted price. Digital downloads are a great option as it may be much cheaper to print these tiles in your country rather then have them shipped from the US. Please consider the DIGITAL pledges above as SHIPPING outside of the US is quite expensive due to our small manufacturer.\u00a0 PRINTED PRODUCT DETAILS: \u00a0High definition color printed on 60 point .06 inch (1.524 mm) thick chipboard. The initial print has a gloss finish to it, although if the LINEN TEXTURE Stretch Goal is unlocked, the tiles and the box itself will have this new very nice texture. - Drift is a slight shift that may occur during printing. Hence you may notice some drifting among the print and where the cut lines are. - Burn: Since the tiles are laser cut, it is recommended to do a light wipe down of the tiles before use. \"Laser cut items will have a slight amount of soot around the edges, which can easily be wiped off; and will have a campfire smell for about a week after you open them.\" \u00a0USPS has temporarily suspended shipping to Australia and New Zealand.

Sure there's a lot of great 3D terrain coming out every year but what about the more affordable.. more manageable 2D modular layouts that are MUCH cheaper and easier to blend in with other terrain Hence, The Adventurer\u2019s RPG Tiles. Terrain that allows for more features for DMs and adventurers to explore.\u00a0 If there is treasure in an area or a sword then let\u2019s see it!\u00a0 Plus things can be changed around so quickly just by adding tiles/tokens via stacking.\u00a0 Instead of laying out a bunch of plastic with the hassle of putting it together, not to mention transporting the stuff to your friend\u2019s house, how about just laying out a few tiles and either stacking them or spreading them out in case your heroes are on different levels.\u00a0",

We had good equipment but with your donation we can get even better equipment through a rental agency to help make Idyll look the best it can be.\u00a0 We plan to pull this off by working hard, day in and day out to make sure we use our resources wisely and efficiently to meet your reward deadlines. We also must ensure that the film is the best it can be, before sending it your way.\u00a0",
  "\"LUMOS\" is a fantasy-horror about a young girl who is brutally murdered, but is given a chance at revenge by a succubus. As a disadvantaged girl, she has the opportunity to regain agency over her body, and bring a violent end on the men who hurt her.\u00a0 The representation of violence on women is very important to me, and I feel as though there are a lot of misconceptions presented in media. I'm working to paint these men as truly unforgivable characters, and put the power back into the women's hands. So many films today victimize women with no recourse, and I hope to make a difference in that in my own little way.\u00a0 Alyssa Harrison\u00a0Writer, Director, Editor Alyssa Harrison is a senior at San Francisco State University working towards being a writer/director. She has experience writing and directing several shorts including \"Approach\" (2014) and \"Honey, I'm Home\" (2013).\u00a0She is also an established makeup artist, having done special effects makeup for several films including \"Better the Devil\"(2014), \"Enceinte\"(2014), and \"The Forests of Cumbria\" (2014), among others. Recently she has also began work production designing \"Dead on Arrival\" (2015) and art directing \"Shared With\" (2015). Maira Memmi\u00a0Producer Maira Memmi is a Freelance producer & Filmmaker who has a marketing certificate and a BA in Cinema from San Francisco State.

Madeleine currently works as the SFSU marketing representative for NBC Universal. She has a passion for film, art, books, and all things creative. Sarah Mahan\u00a0Production Designer Sarah Mahan is a senior at SFSU and is very excited for this project. This is her second film as production designer, the first being the science fiction short, \"Atlas\" (2014). She has also art directed multiple shorts such as \"Beacon\" (2014), \"Living with Liz\" (2014), \"Better the Devil\" (2014), and \"Enceinte\" (2014). To make this film a reality, I'm going to need your help. My goal is to make this film artistically beautiful, and to do that I will have to build one of my sets, as well as rent lenses and equipment to make everything run as smoothly as possible. Also, because this is a student set, many people are simply donating their time, and I want to be able to take care of them as best I can. My base goal is $5,000, but the more we raise beyond that, the better this film can be! Thank you for your time!",

  "Infinite Realms is a tabletop projection software to project your battle maps on the table. You can use a projector that you hang under the ceiling or a TV that you place on the table. It is no VTT yet, it is for in-person games. It was important to us from the beginning that you can play both images and video maps through the software easily and without problems, so that you can continue to use all your existing maps. However, the motivation for Infinite Realms was the idea to create 3D maps and to be able to adjust wind, weather, time of day, color effects and much more. For us, a good gaming experience includes a flexible grid system and a Fog of War. Infinite Realms is for the lazy DM who doesn't feel like designing his own map, who wants the right maps for his campaigns with little effort. Early Access Features:\u00a0 Infinite Realms can do all that already!\u00a0 Daytime\u00a0 Fog of war\u00a0 Weather\u00a0 Grid\u00a0 At the moment we offer you five different 3D maps (more in progress).\u00a0 Forest Creek: A small river winding through the woods. Features a bridge over the river, an abandoned field, a small settlement, a cave and a druid stone circle. K\u00f3ngul\u00f3dalur: A large canyon with a river flowing through the mountains. Featuring smaller streams and waterfalls, a giant spider lair, a mine, a cabin in the woods, hanging bridges and a cult site (human sacrifices not included). Forgotten Graves: The ruins throne over a forest and a distant town.\u00a0The town has houses, a tavern and a festival ground. You may also find a waterfall, a lake and creeks combining both. Bombed Wasteland: An open field with craters, fire and smoke. Features a lot of space for fighting, some impacts are still glowing hot, fires are burning everywhere.\u00a0 Old Battlefield: An open field with craters from former battles. Features a lot of space for fighting, some craters filled up with water and a sparse treeline at the edge.\u00a0 Due to the size of the maps we have the possibility to integrate different points of interest in each 3D map.\u00a0 The maps Bombed Wasteland and Old Battlefield are created with wargaming in mind but can be used for rpg as well. SciFi maps are in progress, Cyberpunk will be supported later.\u00a0 Now you're probably wondering why we are here on Kickstarter then - more on that in the next section.\u00a0 We still have many visions for what should be possible with Infinite Realms, but we can only take care of the development besides our 9 to 5 jobs. We realized that we are reaching our limits at the moment and that's why we need you! With your help we can add the following features in the near future: Once Infinite Realms is market-ready there will be three subscription levels to choose from. The Adventurer Tier will always be free with basic features. The Champion Tier will unlock more features for your existing 2D and video maps. The Hero Tier will unlock all features for our handcrafted 3D maps as well as all features of the Champion Tier.\u00a0 You can support our project by investing in one of the rewards below.\u00a0We see every backer as part of our production team.

Each dice bag is unique and took about 5 hours of work to make. Only available here and only in limited quantities.\u00a0 If you are so convinced of Infinite Realms that we can achieve and multiply our set goal, the following stretch goals await you:\u00a0 We are planning to replace the current grid system with an even more flexible solution that allow the game master to mark segments of the grid in various colors! Doors and chests that can be opened and closed. Lights and fires that can be lit and turned off, traps that can be sprung. We plan to have numerous interactive items on every 3D map! We already have an interactive soundscape system that we plan to further develop. But we also aim for one shot sound effects that can be fired by the game master! Fireballs, lightning strikes, orbital bombardment, clouds of poison gas, Magic circles... Placable and scalable effects for every scenario! Infinite Realms is a tool for in-person games. But in some instances it can be nice to have a token system - The game master could use a token to mark the group's position on a regional overview map! The players could even move the session from the table to the couch and play on a wall-mounted TV! We plan to integrate a growing collection of placable 3D objects. Place some tents and a campfire in the woods or a treasure chest in a dungeon room! The next step is to integrate remote players and upgrade Infinite Realms with virtual tabletop features. This would require using the optional token system and feature optional virtual dice as well as optional video and voice chat! Due to the different rewards, there are different delivery times. Early Access and wallpapers will be sent via email directly after the campaign.\u00a0This email will also include the invite link to our discord server.\u00a0 For the Champion and Hero Subscriptions you will receive a key shortly before the market release. Presumably in the fall of 2022.\u00a0 The dice bags are currently not all sewn up yet. Therefore, the shipment here will probably also take place in the fall of 2022.\u00a0 The design video chats will be scheduled between march and october 2022 depending on the backers' and our availability. \u00a0 We, that's Jan, Danny, Jessi and Nina, have been friends for several years. Jan was Danny's apprentice and the professional collaboration quickly turned into a friendship. At that time both Jan and Danny were already passionate roleplayers, in different systems, but always open-minded towards other worlds. So it was inevitable that the two became friends beyond their professional relationship and also played tabletop rpgs together with their partners. We all became friends. Soon we had several roleplaying groups together and were always looking for ways to optimize and improve. Then about 1.5 years ago Jan and Danny had an idea that grew into Infinite Realms. Since then we put every free minute and a lot of heart and soul into the development of the software and the design of the maps. This has worked out great so far, because we are all convinced of the idea. We can enhance your tabletop experience with Infinite Realms. Danny has been in the IT industry for over 20 years. He worked in all areas: Hardware, Software and Service - for Infinite Realms he takes care of programming and product design as a developer.\u00a0 Jan is IT specialist since 2012 and has experience in 3D design for several years. He had a successful YouTube channel dedicated to blender 3D, thats why he is responsible for level design.\u00a0 Jessi is the third IT specialist and completes the IT Team with web design and server administration.\u00a0 Nina studied economics and completes the Team in the office as the management mastermind.\u00a0 To learn more about us visit our website www.infinite-realms.de or just ask - we don't bite!\u00a0",

  "Press and Media Relations, contact us at hello@cutiepi.io Pick your press kit here. We are now introducing our Stretch Goals, where we\u2019ll add specific features to the CutiePi tablet based on the level of funding we achieve. The goals are:\u00a0 With this special \"Sidekick\" mode, your entire CutiePi tablet screen will transform into a virtual keyboard and trackpad, when you connect it to an external monitor via the micro HDMI port. Don\u2019t want it? There\u2019s a toggle for that. At 250% funding, we are unlocking the \u201cCodingHero\u201d, a live coding environment that you can use to do rapid prototyping with Qt and JavaScript. Together with \u201cSidekick\u201d, you have the ultimate prototyping tool in a convenient package.\u00a0 CutiePi is an ultra portable Raspberry Pi creation kit, in a convenient and affordable tablet package. And best of all, the CutiePi tablet is 100% open source and hackable. Too good to be true? Read on and discover for yourself. \u00a0\u00a0 At just 12mm thin, CutiePi is probably the thinnest Pi tablet in the world!\u00a0 All Raspberry Pi developers know setting up a Pi development environment is never fun. It\u2019s cumbersome and messy, requiring a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Before you know it, your desk is covered in peripherals and the development board. The CutiePi tablet solves this problem.\u00a0 Being tied to the power outlet or a desk is now a thing of the past. With an 8-inch touchscreen and a 5000 mAh battery built right into CutiePi, and a handle that doubles as a stand, you are now free to work on the go. Your next portable project could be an FPV remote control car, or an edge A.I. object detection app. Untether your creativity, unbound your imagination, and start creating whenever and wherever the inspiration strikes!\u00a0 We know that Pi 3B+ (and CM3+ which CutiePi is based on) comes with certain limitations due to the nature of its hardware, and the original Pi environment wasn't designed with portability in mind.\u00a0 That is why we built the CutiePi shell, a mobile UX that has been optimized all the way to the bare-metal performance, to let makers take full advantage of the hardware.\u00a0 It\u2019s built using open source Qt framework, to provide you with an effective mobile UX on top of the Raspberry Pi OS. One look at our demos below and you\u2019ll see how buttery smooth our UI is:\u00a0 We firmly believe people should have control over the technology they use. For that reason, everything about CutiePi, and we absolutely mean EVERYTHING, from the hardware design, firmware, enclosure, all the way to the user interface, is open source. CutiePi board, our custom designed carrier board for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3+, is OSHWA certified. You can find the schematics, BOM, gerber files, and layout designs in our GitHub repository.\u00a0 What does this mean? For starters, you can create your own flavor of the CutiePi tablet using the designs. Or build on it to make your next portable project.\u00a0 All of our designs have been released, and are already free to use, modify, and redistribute. And this is what sets CutiePi project apart from all the other crowdfunding campaigns.\u00a0CutiePi is a strong supporter of the right to repair movement.\u00a0 Since last year (2019), we have shared with you our exciting progress and our various functional prototypes.\u00a0 Now, we need your support to reach the next stage of the project -- mass production. Join us and back CutiePi today! Untether your creativity, and together we can bring mobility to the Raspberry Pi world.\u00a0 Shipping fees will be calculated and charged after the campaign. You can confirm the actual costs, including shipping, using Kickstarter\u2019s \u201dManage your pledge\u201d function, before finalizing your orders.

  "\u00a0Trading Post started out as an inside joke among my friends. We had played this game called Citadels. It was the first-ever board game I had purchased with my own money. One of the cards in the game was called Trading Post. It was just a building that really didn't have any value. But we loved that card and would fight to see who could build their trading post first! Slowly that grew into a challenge for me. My friends challenged me to make and design a board game based around a Trading Post. I did just that, starting in the summer of 2017. \u00a0My wife and I together, 4 1/2 years later, \u00a0finally finished our first board game.

  "ABOUT... \u00a0My name is Corey Nolen.   I\u2019m a songwriter living in Birmingham, Alabama.  I\u2019m a husband, dad of three and a photographer by day.  I consider myself very fortunate to have found a way to continue to write, record and perform original music in a sustainable way in this season of life. The support I\u2019ve received as a singer/songwriter has allowed me to continue to consistently create and play my own songs.  Because of that, I\u2019ve been able to produce 5 projects over the past 5 years and am once again in a position to capture new songs.   As I have been working hard playing live shows, creating a network of musicians and recording, I\u2019ve also been paying attention to which of my songs connect the most with others and which ones I connect with the most. I\u2019ve come away with 11 songs that I think need to be produced and captured in order to give them an even broader audience.  These are songs I believe are worth all the effort of this campaign.  THE PROCESS... \u00a0I\u2019ve played a role in recording over 20 projects in my life.  Through those experiences I\u2019ve recorded in just about every possible way.  With that experience I\u2019ve learned what works best for my music.  For this project\u00a0we will record all parts together in a studio built for this type of recording. \u00a0This will allow us to create quality music that has character and conveys honesty.  This means all the players will be in the same place at the same time responding to each other but with isolated parts, ensuring the highest quality recording.  It will be a group effort.  It\u2019s how albums used to be made. The project will be recorded at Boutwell Studios in Homewood, Alabama in August 2017.  It will be produced by Brad Lyons.  I\u2019ll be joined by the finest musicians in Birmingham and Nashville including Jesse Suttle, Nathan Guhmeinhart, Clint Wells, Collin Newberry, Chandler Parker, Wilder Adkins and Bethany Borg-Martin.  As in our live shows, Ashley Spurling will share the lead vocal role with me.   ALL OR NOTHING... \u00a0If you support this project then you are buying this album in advance as well as receiving something from me in return (depending on the Tier).  This is not charity but rather the purchase of a product.  I intentionally chose Kickstarter because it puts the pressure on me to be serious about the project and to provide you with something credible and worth what I\u2019m asking.  IF I DON\u2019T RAISE THE SUPPORT, THE PROJECT DOES NOT HAPPEN. WHERE THE MONEY GOES... \u00a0The money I am raising will go entirely toward production costs.  The funds will go towards studio time, engineering, producing, and the musicians who are working on the album.  There will be additional expense beyond what I\u2019m asking for in this campaign which I am prepared to fund myself. TIER PRODUCT SAMPLES...

  "\u00a0It\u2019s kill or be killed in when you\u2019re being hunted in space! The Evolmorph (pronounced \"Evil-morph\") will evolve over the course of the game and features a \u201cvanishing\u201d mechanic where it will disappear into the ventilation shafts only to return when you least expect it\u2026 or perhaps if you plan it right, into a well-laid ambush!\n\n\u00a0The USCSS PATNA spaceship introduces \u2018keycards\u2019 that can be used to access different parts of the ship. Will you kill your foe the old-fashioned way? Self-destruct the ship and escape? Or perhaps you\u2019ll try to airlock the killer into the void! You won\u2019t know who you can trust when playing against The Organism. How can you fight what you can\u2019t see? You\u2019ll have to test the victims in the lab or with test kits you find to determine if they\u2019ve been assimilated. Of course, your real job is to kill mutated victims to stop the spread once identified! Featuring three different types of organisms, you\u2019ll never know what you are going to face.\n\n\u00a0The arctic Station 2891 features new unique challenges. Anyone who stays outside too long risks succumbing to frostbite, but the only escape is via the helicopter traveling to and from the station from the Arctic airport. Will you try to save your comrades against all odds, or look out for numero uno and use them to buy yourself time? What horror game would be complete without a home invasion? The Intruders are here. Face not one, not two, but THREE killers. You thought one was hard, but you\u2019re really going to have to stay on your toes against these murderous menaces. Wingard Cottage offers a new challenge with unique events and a new crafting mechanism that lets you take ordinary items and turn them into epic weapons. Stick with that knife or scrounge up some wood and nails to craft The Obliterator? It will be up to you, just make the call before it is too late! Not every story ends happily ever after. This isn\u2019t the Big, Bad, Wolf you imagined as a child. It\u2019s bigger and badder than you could imagine. Can you slow the wolf down before it becomes fast enough to move anywhere on the board in a single turn? Featuring \u201chunt\u201d and \u201cslay\u201d modes, the killer will take different actions depending on what mode it is in, making for yet another unique challenge for you to tackle!\n\nStorybook Woods features a unique layout with a river running through the land. You\u2019ll have to cross rickety bridges only you and one victim can safely traverse. Fairy tale events and items may be a magical miracle or a crippling curse. Will you get lost, or make it out of the woods alive? The Ratchet Lady is in a mood. She\u2019s performing her own brand of therapy on the victims, turning them into bloodthirsty maniacs. You\u2019ll have to decide if you want to try to calm them down or kill them before they can kill you. But the only way to really stop them will be to put down the Ratchet Lady herself.\n\nWolfe Asylum seems harmless and like a typical mental institution to outsiders. Inside lies something very different. There\u2019s medicine and other drugs inside that can, shall we say, amplify your abilities. But at what cost? When the choice is death or a potential side effect, it really isn\u2019t a choice at all.

  "Last Minute Incentives:\u00a0 It's 4:15pm on July 19th. From now until the clock runs out, all new backers and backers who increase their pledge will receive an additional 10 entries in my Taylor Guitar giveaway! Come on! Let's finish strong! Wanna hear more good news? We're WELL on our way to reaching our first stretch goal of $15,000 which will go towards sound equipment, merchandise, and proper display racks for said merchandise. All stretch goal #1 items are vital to a successful tour life and surviving on the road. Keep sharing and keep those fingers crossed.\u00a0 I mean...this would be freaking INCREDIBLE if we were able to reach this stretch goal. For an additional $5,000 we could move into a diesel engine sprinter utility vehicle that would last 3 times as long. There's a reason diesel engines are King of the road. I know ultimately a diesel sprinter would save us money in the long haul. And long hauling is exactly what we'll be doing! In addition, a part of this extra $5,000 would help us complete our sound system and lighting needs.\u00a0 ______________________ Last summer on June 6, 2016 my tour bus burned down at a truck stop in Corning, CA. On June 6, 2017\u00a0I'm launching a campaign that will get me and the band back on the road. The bus fire was an overwhelming loss both emotionally and financially ($30K, of which insurance did not cover). Thanks to the support of all my amazing fans, I was able to find the strength to keep going and finish the tour. From ashes came new beginnings. After returning to Nashville from our road adventures in December, I got signed to Nashville label, American Roots Records. I also signed with a new manager, Jeff Catton, of In Tune Entertainment. So far so good! I'm loving the creative direction and the people I work with. We're having a blast making music together. My first project with the new label, \"Beauty In The Ashes (Unplugged Vol 1),\" was released May 12, 2017. I'm already back in the studio working on a second full band project. So far, In Tune Entertainment has released 4 music videos. Content has been our focus this year. So, I've been doing a ton of writing in addition to recording and video production. As a team, we are strategizing and ramping up to bring my brand to full strength so that we introduce a fresh new show when we start touring again.\u00a0 I feel like my label and management really go above and beyond for me. I'm super grateful and lucky! They are doing such a great job making sure things happen and most importantly they let me be myself artistically and creatively.\u00a0 You might be wondering since I've gotten signed why my label isn't paying for a van. That's a good question! It's actually a common misconception that once an artist gets signed, that all their expenses are covered. Let me clarify. The label is responsible for producing the music and making connections. I'm responsible for all things related to touring (which includes merchandise, paying band members, travel expenses, and providing a suitable tour vehicle).\u00a0 That's where this campaign comes in!\u00a0Most of the touring expenses will take care of themselves once I get back on the road. But, in order to get back on the road, I need some wheels.\u00a0 Good news! I already have a van in mind. My label mate recently bought a bus and is selling his 15 passenger van. It's really a win-win for the whole team. Considering what happened with my bus, it's a comfort and relief to know that I'll be able to get a quality vehicle at a good price. In addition to the van, I'll need to purchase a small trailer to haul band equipment.\u00a0 And, thanks to the generosity of my friends at Taylor Guitars, each backer will be entered in a drawing to receive my autographed Taylor Guitar after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll also be donating a portion of the pledge money to Sweet Relief Musicians Fund. They provide financial assistance to professional working musicians who are struggling due to illness or age related issues. In light of all the amazing people who have taken care of me through the years, making this donation is really important to me. I know I couldn't have made it without help during difficult times.\u00a0 We've already confirmed so many dates for the remainder of the year with the band. Now we just need the van to get there! I have been blown away to witness all the ways you have supported me these last few years, and I cannot wait to give back and share more of my music with you on the road. This campaign is really personal to me. When I think of all the ways I've toured in the past, I think of all the stories and friends I've collected along the way. I once toured in a PT cruiser, which was a total disaster because it was my messy 20's. The 19 year old Volvo was definitely an adventure. It broke down in almost every state. The Nissan Cube was safer, lol. And the bus...well, you know how that one ends, haha! 12 years of touring have gone by so fast. It's hard to believe sometimes. I'm excited for all the amazing opportunities my label and manager are working on to take this to new levels. I hope it soars in ways I never dreamed possible, and I'm so thankful that you are on the ride with me! Thank you for helping me make this happen. I couldn't do it without you.\u00a0 P.S. In the event that we exceed our goal (which would be AWESOME), I've set up a few stretch goals that would really help out with more touring costs outside of the van and trailer purchase. Check out the FAQ section to learn more. Sincerely,\u00a0 Sarah Peacock, American Roots Records & In Tune Entertainment - Jeff, Jenna, Kim, Casey",
  "Hello. My name is Charlie Deacon. I am the Director of this project, Metaphysical. Metaphysical is a project that me and my production team, Golden Stallion Productions, are creating for our college finals. Our final project requires us to create a pilot episode for a TV show that we must create. The project only requires us to produce one episode of the show, but we really want to go all out with this and show what we can really do with our talents and skills. Metaphysical is about a team of highly trained military operators working for a secret government service called the P.A.C. combine. The Combine's purpose is to capture and contain paranormal anomalies and prevent public exposure to these entities. The team that we follow is Epsilon-9, Code Named \u201cThe Jager Bombers\u201d, which consists of five operators and two scientists. They are tasked with investigating an anomalous building located in South East UK, Surrey, which has been reported by multiple witnesses to host many accounts of paranormal activity. Upon investigating the building, Epsilon-9 find themselves trapped inside of the building with no escape and having to fight off the haunted entities that are attempting to kill the team. This project was heavily inspired by the director Stephen Hancock and his films SCP: Overlord, and SCP: Dollhouse. The reason for this Kickstarter is that we want to raise \u00a3400 for this project to create and produce a quality production that we here at Golden Stallion Productions can all be proud of. The money would go towards equipment, props, costumes, catering, and such to make this a high quality production. All supporters who donate towards metaphysical will feature if they so wish to in the shows credits as \u201cSupportive Producers\u201d. Any amount and all donations would be highly appreciated by myself and my production team. \u00a0I want to thank you all for listening and I can't wait to share Metaphysical with you all. - Charlie from GSP",
  "Pourquoi il est n\u00e9cessaire que nous r\u00e9coltions ces fonds? Nous sommes avant tout une \u00e9quipe de passionn\u00e9s, nous avons r\u00e9alis\u00e9 plusieurs courts-m\u00e9trages dont un au Kino de Lille o\u00f9 les organisateurs et producteurs, nous ont encourag\u00e9s \u00e0 continuer. Moi, Billen Damien 41 ans, j'ai donc continu\u00e9 \u00e0 me former, \u00e0 travailler avec d'autres r\u00e9alisateurs, dont Yanis Roka. J'ai ador\u00e9 ses projets et ses id\u00e9es, et sa fa\u00e7on d'amener les choses. Lors de ces \u00e9changes, j'ai \u00e9galement rencontr\u00e9 Jawad Elbe, com\u00e9dien. Par leurs exp\u00e9riences dans le professionnel et apr\u00e8s avoir vu ce qu\u2019ils sont capables de faire comme acteurs, je ne voyais qu\u2019eux pour les r\u00f4les que je leurs ai propos\u00e9s. Mais ce n'est pas tout, ils se sont propos\u00e9s de m'aider \u00e9galement \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation et au coaching acteurs. Ce que j'ai accept\u00e9 \u00e9videmment, pour moi c'est une \u00e9vidence que nous devons travailler ensemble. Ensuite, il y a Gwendoline Jourquin qui a commenc\u00e9 comme photographe amatrice. Aujourd'hui, elle fait une formation professionnelle en photographie et a pu acqu\u00e9rir de l'exp\u00e9rience sur les tournages. Pour ma part, j'ai \u00e9galement fait une formation en infographie et en motion design, pour m'am\u00e9liorer au cadrage, lumi\u00e8re, au montage mais aussi en FX et 3D. Si j'ai autant de personnes qui me suivent dans mon projet, c'est parce que j'ai une ambition d\u00e9bordante et je suis convaincu qu'ensemble, nous r\u00e9ussirons le projet. La seule chose qui freine le projet depuis 2 ans, c'est le manque de moyen financier. Nous sommes avant tout, des particuliers qui cr\u00e9ons petit \u00e0 petit notre route dans le professionnel. Donc pas d'entreprise de production, pas de bourse, pas de subside... Le seul moyen de faire aboutir notre projet? Votre participation \u00e0 la cagnotte. D'autres informations suivront pour les lieux, le casting... Afin de re\u0301aliser notre premier long me\u0301trage \u00ab Memorium \u00bb Nous avons re\u0301uni une e\u0301quipe technique : Cadreurs, re\u0301alisateur, core\u0301alisateur, metteur en sce\u0300ne, sce\u0301nariste, mais aussi compositeur, musiciens, technicien son, photographe plateau...

Avec la participation du groupe Octale pour la bande originale, Memorium un film d\u2019horreur/Fiction Lorsqu\u2019une e\u0301trange come\u0300te touche la terre, 60% de la population semble contamine\u0301 par un virus qui les transforme en zombies. Parmi les non-contamine\u0301s, il y a Charles et son fils Matt qui semblent faire leur route tranquillement jusqu\u2019au jour ou\u0300 tout se complique pour eux. Entre une chasse a\u0300 l\u2019homme, un homme pre\u0302t a\u0300 tuer tout le monde et les zombies... Qui est le plus dangereux ? Le virus, les zombies ou l\u2019homme ? A vous de le de\u0301couvrir.. Memorium est un film avec une atmosphe\u0300re post-apocalyptique, mais ou\u0300 le sujet principal sera la psychologie humaine. POURQUOI NOUS SOUTENIR ? Parce que vous souhaitez aider de jeunes re\u0301alisateurs Parce que vous adorez le cine\u0301ma Parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas assez de nouveaux films d\u2019horreurs Parce que vous e\u0302tes adorable A QUOI VA SERVIR L\u2019ARGENT ? Payer les acteurs et l\u2019e\u0301quipe technique De\u0301frayer les figurants Louer le mate\u0301riel ne\u0301cessaire au tournage Payer la location des lieux du tournage Acheter le mate\u0301riel de maquillage et effets spe\u0301ciaux Louer ou acheter les objets ne\u0301cessaires au tournage (tenues, armes, outillage, confections...) Le but est de proposer le film en festival, puis \u00e0 la distribution num\u00e9rique ou sur plateforme. Votre aide est tr\u00e8s importante \u00e0 nos yeux, car sans budget comment r\u00e9aliser ce film? Cela fait 2 ans que nous attendons ce moment. C'est aujourd'hui plus que jamais que nous avons besoin de vous. Pas seulement parce que nous voulons r\u00e9aliser un film, mais parce que chacun d'entre nous, r\u00e9alisateurs, acteurs, figurants, \u00e9quipe technique... voulons d\u00e9marrer notre carri\u00e8re et c'est certainement le meilleur moyen pour mettre chaque participant en lumi\u00e8re. Qui aime rester dans l'ombre sans jamais voir la lumi\u00e8re? En vous remerciant, Billen Damien",

This video walks you through it: And here's an example of play: Want to try the game first? It's available on Tabletopia for free. Join the Sirlin Games discord (aka Sirlin Games \u2022 Fantasy Strike Official) and connect with other players to set up games, ask questions, etc. The reason stretch goals are popular on Kickstarter is that they help projects grow when all of you tell your friends about the project in order to help unlock them. To that end, I'd like to try something different this time. Rather than put us through all that, I will personally take all the risk. The stretch goals below would require around $200k for the project to just break even. But I'll underwrite that risk and include the stretch goals right from the start. This game is great and deserves to have these awesome components, at least for the Kickstarter version of the game, so let's just do it. Since this is strictly better for all of you than if the stretch goals had unlocked at various funding levels, I'll ask that you tell your friends and social media about this project to reward that kind of transparency and no-nonsense approach. Kickstarter backers will get two additional characters (Troq Bashar the well-meaning beast and River Montoya the dancing fencer). I think things that are 100% exclusive to Kickstarter are generally dangerous and sad to do, so we WILL offer these extra characters somehow in the future. Possibly at conventions if we happen to be at any. Possibly through a boardgamegeek.com giveaway, if we end up doing one. Possibly through the online store at sirlingames.com. But Kickstarter backers won't have to worry about chasing those possibilities down, paying extra, or the promo stock running out. Every person who pledges will get the extra characters. Kickstarter backers are able to get the expansion months before it will be available in retail stores. The first batch is just for you all! Also, the expansion is $10 cheaper here on Kickstarter than the MSRP. (MSRP subject to change, but this is our current expectation.) Gem-Themed Card Sleeve: $15 per pack of 100. We've partnered with UltraPro (because we're big fans of their super premium Eclipse line of sleeves) to offer a similar kind of high quality sleeves, but with gem-themed artwork. They don't show the game's logo so that you can use them with any card game, not just Puzzle Strike 2. They come in packs of 100, and you'll want 2 packs for the base game, or 5 packs to sleeve everything in the base game + expansion. Feel free to order lots more to sleeve your other games too. In the last year, the cost of custom-made sleeves has risen a lot. Partly due to materials and partly because of Covid affecting the manufacturing and shipping industries across the board. We don't know if we can maintain this $15 price point at retail later, and will probably have to increase it to $20. That said, we're giving you the lowest price we can on Kickstarter now. Here's the sleeve design: These sleeves have a matte finish on the clear side to help with that good-shuffle-feel. Also, we designed the box internals to fit all the cards when they're sleeved. Not only that, but if you get the expansion, you can put all the expansion cards\u2014sleeved\u2014into the base set's box, and that fits too. Your rewards will be shipped at our cost to our international hubs (then you'll pay the shipping from the closest hub to you). Please note that shipping and VAT are not included in the pledge prices. The cost of shipping will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign and before we begin manufacturing. Within the pledge manager, you\u2019ll be able to finalize your order, provide your address, and pay for shipping (and VAT, if applicable for your region). We\u2019ll also follow up with you before final shipping so you can adjust your address if needed. We offer Customs Friendly Shipping from our hubs in: the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and Australia. We are in the process of setting up an EU and/or UK hub, but due to recent law changes in the EU, this is very difficult. We think it will go ok, and the shipping chart below assumes that. \"Customs Friend Shipping\" means EU/UK backers will pay VAT in the campaign manager when they pay for shipping, rather than pay VAT separately when they receive their packages. It does not mean that EU/UK backers can avoid paying VAT. It's not possible to legally avoid that. We understand the frustration of shipping prices, but there's no magic way to avoid them. We'll be paying these prices or more plus the additional cost of getting your pledge to our shipping hubs. BUT we'd like to offer an option to reduce shipping cost per item. For each pledge level, you can add money to the pledge for a second or third copy and we will only charge the shipping for the first copy. For example, suppose you pledge for the base set + expansion, and the shipping for that is $20. You could add money to your pledge to get TWO base sets + TWO expansions, or THREE base sets + THREE expansions, and the total shipping price for your pledge would still only be $20 in this example. The limit here for any given pledge level is \"the rewards + 2 additional copies, for a total of three\". So find some friends to team up with and you can save on shipping.

Previous campaigns have fielded complaints about issues with reading the dice in low light. Deadly Arrow Dice aims to merge Premium Metal Dice with High Level Readability.\u00a0 Timeframe The project is scheduled for a May fulfillment. That is a conservative estimate.

All files are optimized for different scales. You can reduce or increase any of our 3D model by 900% without any damage to the quality. We recommend printers with a bed size nearly 200 x 200 mm (as Prusa, Ultimaker or Clones have. Also Makerbot & Clones 225 x 150mm will work). We are very pleased that you choose our collection, because we tried very hard to create it. When will I receive the 3D models and how will they be delivered? 3D FORTRESS Studio delivers files 2 weeks after funding. This usually takes about 18 days.(sometimes a little faster). We do not send files immediately because not all of our customers' payments are successful. Some people need to top up their card so that the kickstarter will write off the funds and transfer them to us because the deposit to any kickstarter project can be made from a card on which the balance is zero. Therefore, as long as our customers are given time to solve a possible problem with their balance, we cannot know 100% of all customers who have paid honestly. As a result, after 2 weeks, 3D models will be received only by those customers who actually paid, and did not simulate the payment. The files will be delivered using Google links. The files are stored on Google drive, which the studio rents from Google.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You will receive a secret link in a private message or in a private update of our project specifically for you. You don't have to worry about the files not being delivered, because we have already successfully delivered files many times. If you have any difficulties downloading files from Google Cloud yourself, you can contact Google support or contact us. However, most of our clients never have such problems, because downloading files is very simple.\u00a0",
  "Thank you for supporting me through the years as a musician and songwriter. The boys and I are excited to release our next record titled, \"young or old,\" late summer of 2017. As always, our music will eventually be on most digital platforms including iTunes and Spotify. But this particular campaign will help jump start our desire to release this project on vinyl. As you all know, the music industry is brutal. With CD sales nearly extinct and the streaming world soaking up much of our work, we as artist have very minimal time to make any kind of impression. That being said, I do believe that we have the ability to be creative as ever in this wild west DIY world of music to make lasting impressions.\u00a0 For me, having our record on vinyl puts the music physically in the hands of our listeners. The idea of purposeful listening is a hopeful thought. That we can put Netflix on hold, our Spotify playlist on pause and our smart phones on silent (and in our pockets), \u00a0and sit in a room alone or with friends and enjoy music again. While the digital stuff will be available later in the fall, we wanted to give our backers a chance to own and enjoy this analog moment before it gets swept away and lost forever in the digital world.\u00a0 Help us in anyway possible. Every little bit counts. Don't have a record player? Get one. lol, or buy the record for someone who does. At the very least, it will be a cool piece of wall art.\u00a0The vinyl record will come with a digital download card.  Included are some fun backer tiers, from the vinyl itself to additional merch like shirts, a private show at your house with friends and hand made hand stamped brass cuffs by my wife TATIANA CABRAL SMITH. Thank you for stopping by our campaign. Keep the music alive and always support your favorite artist!\u00a0 Be Kind, Be Real, Be You www.isaacsmithmusic.com www.tatianacabralsmith.com \u00a0",

  "The idea of the book started from a school project that gave me the opportunity to discover a new world. These interviews became a real point of interest for me and every interviewed woman left a big sign on my heart. I understood many things that I had never thought about before. I saw their life conditions. I saw women who had never studied and never had a real smile on their faces. Some \u00a0presumed I would have made fun of them looking at their pictures. They told me: \u201cyou will call me an african dog\u201d. They fear us.

  "I am headed to Malawi to help document the work (Through photography) my brother is doing to combat malnutrition and stunting growth among children 6 months to 5 years old in the country of Malawi. The results of their findings have value throughout Africa and the world as a means to combat malnutrition among children. The grant we are closely working with is the\u00a0USAID's Feed the Future initiative. The story I will be creating, through the photography, will help with grants and funding for the future of this critical study.\u00a0 Here is a quote from Kevin explaining the research in his own words: \"We are studying a disease called Environmental Enteric (pronounced en - tair - ic) Dysfunction (EED). It is an inflammatory disease of the small intestine. This disease is important because it causes stunting (estimated 40-50% of it), both physically and cognitively, and makes children more vulnerable to diarrhea, malnutrition, and death. In rural Malawi, over 75% of children under 5 years of age have this disease. That percentage is similar in many impoverished developing countries. It is called \"Environmental\" because we do not know the cause - it was discovered in Peace Corps Volunteers returning from their stations in developing countries. They had some persistent vague abdominal discomfort and so underwent endoscopy/biopsy of their intestine, which showed something like Celiac Disease. But they didn't have Celiac disease. And it all went away on its own after 6 months back in the US. So we know the cure, actually - if you could transport all of the kids to the US, or make Malawi like the US, the disease would go away. But of course currently we can't. Theories of causes include poor hygiene (ingested fecal material), inadequate weaning foods, and toxins. Multiple treatments have been tried and none have worked very well.  We are trying to address one of these causes in our study - inadequate weaning foods - by using roasted, milled legume (pronounced leg - yoom - it's a normal English word) flours. These flours are a good source of protein and soluble fiber, which is important for gut health. There is also evidence that legumes are anti-inflammatory, which could be helpful. Our study is designed so that the children should receive between 20-40% of their daily non-breastfeeding calories composed of these legume flours for either 6 months or 1 year. What occurs normally is that the children are weaned off of breast milk to a maize porridge that is nutritionally horrible except calories. The control of the study (meaning what we are comparing the legumes to to see if they worked) is a maize-based supplement normally used in Malawi, called corn-soy blend.  In total, we are studying 600 children 6 months - 2 years of age over roughly 15 months. We diagnose EED by a urine test, which we will perform every 12 weeks during the study. We are also studying the microbiome (pronounced micro - bye - ome) in EED and its response to the legumes, and so are collecting stool roughly every 6 weeks. A total of 25,000 samples will be collected - 10,000 are completed now. We are also measuring the childrens' height, weight, and mid upper-arm circumference every 6 weeks to assess for changes in growth. If we found that legumes helped EED and/or growth, it would be an important result. \"",

  "Listen: Islands by Hands of the Heron Hands of the Heron is a Bristol-based folk music collective led by singer Bethany Roberts. A year ago, following a long creative drought, she decided to borrow a friend's mandolin. At the same time, the tight threads holding her life together began to unravel, releasing an unsolicited torrent of songwriting as she learned to play the mandolin.\u00a0 To her surprise, she emerged a few months later to discover that she had written an album, and so gathered a group of exceptional musicians from her neighbourhood to play and sing with her. The album, \u2018As We Lingered\u2019, celebrates the deep source of resilience and regeneration that, in times of intense pain and doubt, can be found within.\u00a0 As we continued exploring our strong collective communication, we decided that the best route to capture these songs was straight onto tape. After our discovery of the newly-opened Bare Bones studio down the road in Montpelier, the opportunity to use this method became much more feasible as the costs are not as high as other analogue studios. However, we still need to raise sufficient funds to cover studio costs and physical pressing. We want to use independent local resources as much as we can, reflecting that the seed of the project was nurtured within a community. Though the songs are rooted in a particular time and place, eventually we would like to see the album blossom beyond the city. That's why we decided to crowdfund the costs, and we'd love to thank each individual that helps us to make this album come to life where it was born. After the album is released, we hope to hold a series of pay-as-you-feel launch gigs in weird and wonderful spaces around Bristol, and everyone who buys the album in advance will be personally invited to attend.

The buzz in his ear came again but louder, \"D CLASS APPROACH THE ENTITY OR YOU WILL BE TERMINATED\"\n\n He put his hand up to his ear, clicking a button on a head set he had been wearing and yelled back at the voice in his head, \"How's about you get off your lazy asses and go up to it yourselves!!!\"\n\n The buzz in his ear responded back, \"D CLASS (numbers on his jumpsuit) If you don't cooperator with us we will be forced to terminate you!!\"\n\n The man turns around looking off into the distance looking for something out there, he felt something, or someone looking at him from the disctance.\n\n Then he sees it, A glint in the distance, a sniper aiming directly at his head,\n \"D Class Approach the entity or we will shoot!\"\n\n He stood there for what felt like years, \"Strike force prepare to fire\"\n\n He snapped out of his trance \"Ok OK I will approach the giant\"\n\n He turned around, the camera has panned out to show the entities feet to show how the size of the entity.\n\n The man gulps and walks towards the entity, the sound of sand and rocks under his feet making crunching sounds.\n\n The entity grips on to something near its chest, The light seemed to burn his eyes.

Through my rewards, I will have opportunity to get to know you all...from recording sessions and Rock School Camps, to Speakeasy and House Concerts. I'm based out the Pacific Northwest, but have also \nloved playing music and raising my family at times in L.A. and \nNashville.  I grew up in a small town in Albany, \nOregon in the Willamette Valley, located between Portland and Eugene.

I was backed and supported by the Fred Rose family of Acuff/Rose Studios.

  "An Album of Music and a Book of Collaborative Illustrations for Each Song THANK YOU! We have reached our goal, however, the budget for the project is well above $10,000. We can still very much use your support! Please consider pre-buying your copy of The Skeleton Keys through this campaign. Tricia Spencer & Howard Rains came up with an idea about a year ago: they would record a new CD with their band, The Skeleton Keys, and make a book of collaborative illustrations for each song. Both Tricia and Howard are old time fiddlers, singers, and multi-instrumentalists steeped in the traditional music of Texas and the mid-west. They are also both artists each with a unique style. In much the same way they have collaborated with their fiddles, they are collaborating with their artwork on this project. On the recording, Spencer & Rains will be joined by their band, The Skeleton Keys. The Skeleton Keys come from across the United States. Charlie and Nancy Hartness, on ukulele and guitar respectively, hail from Athens, Georgia. Brendan Doyle is featured on banjo and has mid western roots in Minnesota but now lives in Oakland, California. Emily Mann is on the bass and also comes from the Bay Area in Berkeley, California. The recording will feature 17 songs and tunes. Each tune will be collaboratively illustrated by Howard and Tricia. Howard paints the subject matter of the song in watercolor and Tricia creates the border in pen and ink. The book will be offset color printed and housed in beautifully printed letter press cover.  The entire project will be created with the help of the Old Time Tiki Parlour in Los Angeles. The Tiki Parlour is run by David Bragger and has a mission for preserving and presenting living traditional music and folk art. This will be a completely unique project and we hope you will join us by supporting it.

  "UPDATE: We reached the embroidery goal! PHOTOS ARE NOW UPDATED WITH NEW EMBROIDERY SAMPLE! :) UPDATE2: WE HIT 10k so now all bags will come with a FREE mini round brass charm with my logo stamped to it. Attach it to the zipper or with the add on attachments, it\u2019s up to you! Thank you so much.. ;-; UPDATE 3: Stretch goal updated with sample photos! Hello! I'm Sherms and I am an illustrator and designer based in Singapore. I am currently working on my own brand of merchandise at Sherms\u306e\u7d19\u829d\u5c45\u5c4b.\u00a0 I've always wanted to venture into making more casual bags other than the usual totes and I hope to be able to fund them through this project. These crossbody bags feature embroidered designs illustrated by me! The bag measures approximately 18cm in height and 15cm in length. Made with polyester material, they are a decent size and casual enough to take with you for a quick errand run.\u00a0 There are 2 different designs for these crossbody bags. \u00a0 \u00a0A yellow bag featuring tsukumogami yokai strolling by. \u00a0A Black bag featuring kitsune masks. \u00a0 Both have a cute stylized fuuyin seal on the tab with a magnetic button.\u00a0 It also comes with a small rubber opening for anything that requires a wire!\u00a0 Adjustable straps too! For now all I have are the 2 samples that I've paid on my own. The base goal allows me to fund for production of 50 pcs of each design. Along with any extra charges like mailing supplies, Kickstarter fees and shipping to me and to you!\u00a0 (EDIT! The support has been overwhelming and i will be able to fund for more bags for everyone! :] There is no limit to the number of bags so feel free to pledge!) I decided to do a Kickstarter since bags are a huge investment to produce and take up a lot of space. Doing this allows me to gauge interests and ultimately not put myself in the red, which is a terrifying situation with how things are at this time and it's a huge risk that i can't take right now. By backing this project, you're able to get the bags at a cheaper rate in SGD (Singapore dollars) as compared to afterwards when I list them up on my online store in USD. You will also be able to receive additional exclusive Kickstarter only freebies I throw in! (i.e., Stickers, thank you cards etc.) I hope the designs appeal to you and I truly appreciate any and all support. :] Once we reach the initial goal, I will add some attachments/charms as stretch goals to match the bags. Once unlocked, they will be add on items on any physical item pledge and you're free to edit your pledge to purchase them if you like! [change pledge>select the same pledge you were on>confirm>add on page] SAMPLE PHOTO\u00a0 All bags will be embroidered by default! There is no need to add on for this goal. Due to the nature of embroidery, there might be some differences in the final design but I will try my best to get it to be as accurate as possible to the printed version! Europe will start applying VAT on everything from July 1st. All duties (VAT + Other charges) have to be borne by the recipient of the package. The same shall apply to recipients in the UK. Please keep in mind that as such unexpected charges may occur upon receipt when backing this Kickstarter. Thank you!",
  "The Animal Within... This kickstarter project will become a collection of beautiful acrylic and watercolour artworks of animals, with some great add on features such as origami cards and special gift wrapping. It is completely self funded so far and it is with your help that I can make this project, and my growth as a new full time artist, a huge success.\u00a0 A bit about myself... I am a qualified architect as well as an artist. Starting up my art business, rubyrayDESIGN, is my release from the structured nature of the architectural industry, and I would love your help to make it my full focus, and transition into becoming a full time artist. It brings me great happiness to produce artworks that my clients love.\u00a0 I am hoping this project will not only build up an incredible portfolio of colourful animal pieces and hone and develop my skills as an artist, but also give me the opportunity to share my artwork with a wider audience.\u00a0 The current collection was originally inspired by the idea of bringing stimulating colours into children's rooms and spaces, but it was quickly apparent that the style appealed to both adult and child. Let's get creating together, I cant make this project a reality without your support. I will be there the whole process to discuss colour combinations you love, animals that inspire you, moods you wish the animals would encompass... scroll down for a peek into the pledges, add ons and my current animal collections. The Pledges... Through this project I hope to produce 25 new Original 25 x 25cm Acrylic artwork commissions. Where each backer will be able to request the animal of their choice, or even provide photos of a family pet they wish to be captured. We can discuss your favourite colours and moods or even just let me go wild! (No pun intended!).\u00a0 There is also an unlimited amount of Original Watercolour Artwork commissions, and prints from the two current collections available.\u00a0 (I wanted to provide an \"Add on\" option for a second animal of the same species within your commission but this got complicated when trying to make it reward level specific. So if this is something you would like to discuss further then drop me a message privately and we can discuss options! ) I have included two pledge levels with a reward of an original artwork from the current acrylic collection. These consists of two 30x30cm paintings and three 40x50cm paintings. I have included these to help fund the overall project and enable me to keep the other pledge levels lower in cost.\u00a0 Update to pledge tier Original Acrylic Painting (30x30cm ) below: If possible, I will try and update the 30x30 and 40x50 pledge levels to give an indication of which from the selection have been pledged for. \u00a0 The jigsaw pledge level has the greatest risk for me as it is reliant on another company to be able to run production again after issues during the pandemic. I will communicate fully if any issues do arise with this pledge level and make sure it is still a great reward to be part of. Use the 'Add on' feature with your pledge to get prints from the current acrylic or watercolour collections at an even lower rate. When the project is successful I will send out the complete collections from the acrylic and watercolour animal series for you to make your selections.\u00a0 I hope to have all your amazing pieces and prints out to you by Christmas 2021. I believe this is a great time allowance, but there is always a chance for human error and misjudgement, so please bare with me if we hit any snags along the road. I promise to do my best to make this project a great experience for you all. I am always available for new commissions, all of which help me fund projects like this and grow as an artist.\u00a0 Check out a little more about my story and what I do on my website: rubyrayDESIGN\u00a0 Follow Ruby Ray Penny on: Instagram / Facebook Thank you for supporting in any way you can, and I hope you enjoy this journey together.",

  "Welcome to the Scary Stories That Glow in the Dark campaign! We at Nick Noir wanted to share one of our many loves of all things spooky with you. Nick has been painting Scary Stories for a few years and discovered glow in the dark acrylic. \u00a0After pairing the two, we fell in love. In addition to these lovely oil paintings, we are also offering our Scary apparel and beach towels. \u00a0Just to make things extra interesting, Nick will be filmed painting a limited amount of these glow in the dark illustrations. \u00a0So whatever your name is, he'll talk to you and walk you through what he's doing as he does it! (Pre-recorded. Not a live event. But he does ramble.) At what extra cost? \u00a0None! \u00a0See our EARLY BIRD SPECIAL for more info! You will find bundles for the whole family and individual items for those that just want something small. \u00a0Whoever you are, we've got something for you! \u00a0Quantities are limited! Here are some of the oil paintings we've done that are available as oil paintings, prints and tees (note: horizontal illustrations look better on tees but we won't stop you if you prefer something vertical!) *All paintings are 16x20 unframed canvases* 1) The Appointment, 2) The Bad News, 3) The Big Toe, 4) The Black Dog, 5) The Bride, 6) The Bus Stop, 7) The Chimney, 8) The Coffin, 9) The Dream, 10) The Drum, 11) The Figure, 12) The Girl Who Stood on a Grave, 13) The Hearse, 14) The Netherworld, 15) The Phone Call, 16) \u00a0The Screaming Man, 17) The Thing, 18) Wendigo, 19) The Witch, 20) They Eat You, 21) The Dancing Corpse, 22) White Wolf, 23) Wonderful Sausage, 24) You May Be Next, 25) Am I Pretty?, 26) Ba-Room!, 27) Bloody Fingers, 28) Cemetery Soup, 29) Clinkity-Clink, 30) Cold as Clay, 31) Creepy Old House, 32) Severed Hand, 33) Dead Man's Head, 34) Ghost Ship, 35) Ghosts, 36) Gypsy Woman, 37) Harold, 38) Head Soup, 39) Headlights, 40) Me Tie Dough-ty Walker, 41) Oh, Susannah!, 42) Poke!, 43) Rings on Her Fingers, 44) Room 505, 45) Severed Head, 46) Skull Pipe, 47) Spiders, 48) Rotten Headstones 49) The Man in the Middle, 50) The Babysitter, 51) Faster & Faster, 52) The Cat in the Shopping Bag, 53) The Strangers, 54) Wolf Girl 1, 55) The Hook, 56) Strange and Scary Things, 57) White Satin Evening Gown, 58) Thupp!, 59) The Brown Suit, 60) Such Things Happen, 61) Bess, 62) No Thank You, 63) The Dead Hand, 64) Wolf Girl 2, 65) The Grin, 66) The Basket, 67) Footsteps, 68) Ghost in the Chair, 69) The Castle, 70) Thumpity-Thump, 71) Other Dangers, 72) The Wreck, 73) The Viper, 74) Room For One More, 75) Maybe You Will Remember, 76) The Curse, 77) The Ghost in the Mirror, 78) Dedication, 79) Footsteps From the Cellar, 80) The Walk For the best use of your painting, have it in a sun-lit area or 'charge up' the acrylic with black light for 15-20 minutes in a dark room. \u00a0Depending on the strength of the light, the glow should last up to 8 hours. \u00a0The examples above were charged in spots with a UV flashlight, giving it that uneven, ghostly appearance. \u00a0The glow will have a 'life' of about 20-30 years. \u00a0Each painting is given multiple coats to create a vibrant, lasting glow! Please be aware that the paint we use is white acrylic with UV pigment, so illustrations with considerable shading (Ghost Ship, the Bride) will not glow as brightly as, say, Skull Pipe or Harold. \u00a0We can substitute our white paint with the UV paint and avoid excessive shading but we wanted you to know in advance so you can make the best decision for your purchase(s)! This option can apply to ANY order you place. \u00a0The decision to use Red Glow is entirely up to you, but white UV makes the black acrylic 'pop' more. \u00a0Upon successful completion of this campaign, we will reach out to ask what your glow preferences are for your order(s). See extensive list under 'AVAILABLE 'GLOW' OIL PAINTINGS.' The best illustrations for tees are horizontal but vertical illustrations can be printed, as well! Illustrations are DTG (direct-to-garment) printed. \u00a0Kids garments will have a smaller size print compared to adults, which feature a maximum image size of 11x15. US orders will be provided a tracking number that will include the ship date. \u00a0For addresses that cannot be verified through location software, or use a P.O. Box or military address (APO/FPO), tracking numbers may not be provided. All Canadian orders are subject to HST (Harmonized Sales Tax) for orders being shipped within Canada. Some of our shirts require pre-treatment. \u00a0Darker color shirts with specific designs do require an underbase to ensure the design will last longer and not wash off. \u00a0The pre-treatment area is the size of our printing area and easily washes off after the first wash. \u00a0You may receive a notice inside the package if the pre-treatment is highly visible. \u00a0This area could look like a large transparent, or translucent, square or rectangle. \u00a0The pre-treated area is a non-toxic water based coating that helps your design last as long as possible. All orders can take up to 2 business days to process. \u00a0 50% polyester, 50% cotton, white, one-sided print. \u00a0(We tried our dozens of other illustrations but they just didn't work on a towel.) We not only take pride in what we do but we stand by it 100%. \u00a0While we can't offer refunds or exchanges for any of our products or services, we will work with you in every way we can to ensure you get the most out of your purchase(s). \u00a0In addition to email support we will provide phone support - it'll be our team based in the US, with Nick taking MANY calls, as well - upon successful completion of this campaign! Tees and towels will all be processed and shipped first with an estimate arrival date of June/ July. Oil paintings will be processed last with an estimated arrival date of August/ September.

  "The ESP Module is a microcontroller based IoT Module which offers the same great features as our Pi-oT Module, but based off on an ESP32 platform. This allows users who are familiar with Arduino programming or prefer a more lightweight architecture to enjoy all of the benefits of our IoT Modules. The ESP Module is powered by an ESP32 DEVKITC-32D microcontroller which is included in each reward. The ESP Modules circuitry allows for the control of 4 Panasonic SPDT relays via GPIO pins. This proven design is similar to our Pi-oT Module which replaces the need for unreliable Chinese breakout boards. In addition, 10 more GPIO pins are routed to the enclosures terminals to harness the power of the ESP32 for a wide range of applications. Due to the flexibility of the ESP32s circuitry, 6 of these pins can easily be configured as analog inputs and 2 can configured as analog outputs.\u00a0 We've even included the 5V circuitry protection from the Pi-oT that allows the ESP32 to be powered from the screw terminals. Two more screw terminals act as grounds for power and the GPIO pins. Our popular enclosure offers a clean and robust way to incorporate the ESP32 into your projects- no more breadboards and messy wiring. This proven enclosure design has mounting holes as well as DIN rail mounting capabilities. Two auxiliary ports allow for endless hacking and modifications.",
  "This is my first solo album in six years, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s especially significant to me. \u00a0This year has been a profound one. \u00a0As some of you may know, I lost my sweet papa 18 months ago. \u00a0And then I had a baby four months ago. \u00a0So it\u2019s been a year book-ended by the most intense of human experiences. \u00a0 I wrote most of the songs on this record soon after my dad died, and right when I found out I was pregnant. \u00a0At this intersection of joy and grief, I locked myself in a cabin in the mountains of New Mexico and wrote these tunes. The coming together of these emotions brought about a visual landscape in the songs that I would not have otherwise been able to write about. \u00a0It was one of the most beautiful and telling times of my life. \u00a0 The Penny Collector is the first album I'm releasing independently, without the support of a record label,\u00a0\u00a0in quite some time. I hope you'll join me on this journey, as I believe this is a recording we can all relate to. I almost feel like I had nothing to do with writing these songs. \u00a0It's as if the songs wrote me as opposed to me writing them. \u00a0 Here\u2019s more about the project . . . The PRODUCTION of the album: It's difficult for me to pigeonhole The Penny Collector, stylistically. I\u2019ve always loved and admired how Patty Griffin and Brandi Carlile are able to deliver incredibly beautiful and vulnerable poetry with fierce powerful voices, and it\u2019s my hope that The Penny Collector straddles the same Americana/Roots, Folk, and Indie Rock worlds that those women manage to occupy. My most amazing producer, Neilson Hubbard (Garrison Star, Glen Phillips, Ben Glover, Ryan Culwell), focused the production on trying to capture the delicacy and nuance of my voice, draping the vocal performances in swathes of expressionistic electric guitars, velvety strings, and primal percussive heart beats . . . but always trying to leave the stories and the delivery front and center. \u00a0And I must say, I\u2019ve never been more thrilled with what we were able to capture in the studio. \u00a0Neilson somehow shared my vision, and managed to actualize it and magnify it. The STORY behind the writing of the album: The Penny Collector is about ushering in new life and honoring old life. It\u2019s about standing in that sacred space where the celebration of life meets at both ends. In June of 2015, I learned of my papa's terminal condition with pancreatic cancer, cancelled my tour schedule, and went to Atlanta to be with him through the last month of his life. Caring for someone that close to me and holding his hand through the exposure of that final phase of life, was an incredibly powerful experience, heart wrenching, but also precious and beautiful in its connection. And it was magnified all the more by the fact that I was simultaneously going through the fertility process, and preparing the emotional fields for planting new seeds.\u00a0 The title, The Penny Collector, was chosen in honor of my papa, Richard Elkin (1942-2015). My dad was a lifelong penny collector. Not just the \u2018collectible\u2019 pennies, but rather every penny he could get his hands on. In the process of cleaning out his basement we discovered that, in his lifetime, he had collected approximately 600,000 special little pennies, neatly rolled and lovingly kept. My dad had a way of finding value and delight in the tiny things that other people might walk right past.\u00a0 My BIG PLANS for the album: I haven\u2019t released an album independently in a long time, and I\u2019m committed to doing this in a big way, and the right way. \u00a0I want to balance the responsibility I feel towards my art (and this album which I feel so strongly about) \u00a0with the responsibility I feel towards motherhood and the nurturing of this amazing new life that\u2019s joined our family. \u00a0So towards that end, I will be touring extensively, nationally and internationally, with Maizy and Danny in tow. \u00a0We\u2019re touring the album as a family for most of 2017! I\u2019ve put an immense amount of planning into building a proper campaign for the album, and I\u2019ve hired a top notch team to support the campaign in its various facets and regions, including a print and media publicist in the US, a print and media publicist in the UK and Europe, and a great production team for photos and videos. \u00a0And Danny and I will be managing the US radio campaign ourselves, as well as the social network campaign. \u00a0Balancing all this work with family life is both exhausting and enthralling. \u00a0But it\u2019s important to me that you understand I\u2019m committed to taking as big a swing with this record as I\u2019m able. \u00a0As we\u2019re able. Here\u2019s a breakdown of my expenses and BUDGET:$12,000 for Production. \u00a0This includes the studio, producer, musicians, and mastering.$9,000 for Press & Media Publicity. \u00a0This includes agencies in the US, UK and Europe.$1,500 for Radio Campaign. \u00a0This is for shipping mostly.\u00a0$4,500 for Manufacturing. \u00a0This is to press CDs, vinyl records, and posters.$3,000 for Tour Support. \u00a0It is much more expensive to tour with a baby and a baby daddy. Thanks so much for all your support. \u00a0I hope to make you all very proud. Simply.Carrie \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
  "Website: https://foundwork.art/artists/chunbumpark Instagram: chun.park.7 Facebook: Chunbum Park Art Hello, my name is Chunbum Park, also known as Chun. I am an MFA Fine Arts Studio student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Through this Kickstarter project, I would like to raise money to support \u00a0my studies at graduate school. I make a unique style of painting that I call the LEGO style. It utilizes vibrant blocks of color that are harmoniously arranged to create a readable form and an emotional experience for the viewer. People love this style for its physicality and solid characteristics, as well as the intense , vibrant colors and poetic quality. I believe the LEGO style painting has a real collection value for people who would like to invest in me as an emerging artist. I first pioneered the LEGO style in 2016 after being inspired by the artistic style of a South Korean painter.\u00a0 I've been studying and making art for the past 10~15 years, and you can be sure that I will continue making art into the foreseeable future. I believe there is a real value in my art for you to possibly invest in - especially since I am still an emerging artist.\u00a0 Thank you so much for your time! Sincerely Chun ----------------- For this Kickstarter project, I will be making 4 new paintings - small portrait painting #1, medium flower painting #1, medium portrait painting #2, and medium flower painting #2. I am not sure how they will turn out especially because I am not used to painting small. However, I will try my best and make the best result possible.\u00a0 These are examples of my previous works:",
  "My name is Dave and I am a film-maker. I decided to jump in and start on this project because i have always had the fear of actually doing anything about my passion for films and film making..\u00a0 Although people do tell me I have a talent for writing as well as the Technical skills required I have never believed in myself.. Well I am 40 years old now and if I don't do it now I never will and I cannot live with that.. So here we are.. The way The Forest came about was I had had the idea brewing for a low budget indie movie and decided to create a short Trailer for my vision and posted it to Facebook and it got a very good response.. So I decided to flesh the idea out and came up with the story and characters It is a Psychological Horror in which 3 friends decide to go camping in the Scottish Highlands for a weekend.. It suddenly turns sour as they become lost and discover that something or someone is actually stalking/hunting them.. At first it seems like it is simply playing pranks on them but things take a dark turn.. The friends find a shack and decide to see if they can survive the night.. and things get worse.. I have never tried to do a Kick-starter before so this is all new to me so I do apologise if this seems amateurish..\u00a0 I will be running this project from start to finish as Director/Writer and Producer and have secured the talents of some local actors who are keen on the project If I do secure the budget I am after this will cover equipment costs as at the moment I am shooting on 1 x Panasonic DVX100 which is a great camera however to cut down shooting time I would really need at least 2 cameras.. It would also go toward 2 Boom Microphones for the cameras as well as 2 x Wireless XLR Microphones for the actors to wear when shooting from a distance.\u00a0 Lighting is also an important part of film and I do have 1 LED white light but ideally I would need 3 as the majority of filming is external and at night That would be the majority of the budget, the rest would be travel costs for the actors and catering and also Insurance (or i do it geurilla style) and to get locations to shoot at I will provide regular updates as to where we are in Production and will also be shooting a behind-the-scenes Documentary/making of..\u00a0 I really hope you can be a part of what is my passion and a dream that I am now making a reality..\u00a0 If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask",
  "An overly ambitious film student excitedly begins working on her favorite filmmaker\u2019s new movie, when the director starts killing the cast members to get \u2018genuine performances\u2019; she soon learns that in order to make it in the business, she might have to get her hands a little dirty. Let's be honest, the only way to produce this movie is with your money.

  "We're in the studio recording our second CD, \"Boomtown Ghosts\", and we are psyched! \u00a0Our first CD, \"Blue Sky Earth\" was a home studio recording, and it was very well received, with nearly 800,000 streams so far through online radio stations. \u00a0Our new project is shaping up to be a huge leap forward in every way; from songwriting, singing, musicianship, to excellent production. \u00a0It deserves the best we can give, and we think you'll enjoy it! The songs on Boomtown Ghosts are personal, but touch on universal themes that will resonate with many; songs of love and of place, of struggles with a changing world, and with changes within. \u00a0Songs that need to be heard! We've been touring and saving for the studio time with the amazing Howlin' Dog Records, but that's just the beginning, and the expenses are adding up faster than we anticipated. \u00a0We want to make this as good as possible, and reach as many people as possible! \u00a0If we meet our goals, we will be able to mix, master, press and package 300 to 500 physical CD's to get out to the world. \u00a0We'll also be able to get the album out to Apple Radio, Spotify, iTunes Radio, Pandora, etc. Our stretch goals could help get these songs even further, with promotional content necessary to reach radio stations, music reviewers, magazines and blogs, as well as venue booking folks. \u00a0With your help, we intend to take our music as far as possible! Some of the expenses that would be covered with our basic fundraising goal; these are required to get a CD out to the world after it has already been recorded in the studio: If we can exceed our Basic Goal of $4,000, a lot of opportunities open up! \u00a0This would allow us to get the CD into the hands of reviewers, radio station directors, promoters, movie and synch license directors, and other industry people. We'll also use anything extra to reach a larger audience through social media advertising, print ads in select magazines, etc. \u00a0If we stretch it enough, we would hire a radio promoter with established connections to nationwide radio stations specializing in Americana and Roots music! \u00a0"
