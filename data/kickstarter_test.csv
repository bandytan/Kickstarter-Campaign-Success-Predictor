Anything related to sustainability gets me excited! 









 There has been a huge shift in awareness of what we do and the impact it has on the planet. Everywhere you look you see people, concepts and projects that are aligned towards sustainability.
Vertica Green helps to accelerate this movement by connecting interested communities, raising funds for each project and working with schools and buildings to make their vertical landscape, green.
I just want to do my part to make sure our planet will be healthy and thriving for the next generation to follow.
WHY?
Crucial things that trees do for cities:

   Make the air cleaner - Trees can absorb up to 150kg of CO2 per year helping to reduce pollution
   Keep us cool - Cities aligned with trees can experience temperatures lowered by 6 degrees
   Makes us happier - Being surrounded by trees makes us less stressed and generally happier

HOW?
Through Green Estate, Vertica Green allows you to support this initiative by contributing a piece of green in the city.

   Leverage - Leveraging the vertical landscape of buildings within cities and transforming them into vertical gardens.
   Partner - Partnering with schools and commercial buildings to ”use” or “rent” their vertical landscape to set up indoor and/or outdoor vertical gardens
   Scale - Through crowdsourcing platforms and corporate sponsorship, we support this initiative by raising funds for each project.

Schools and buildings have the option between a plant based vertical garden, or a vertical farmscape. With a vertical farmscape, we can further reduce CO2 from being released into the air by reducing the need for transportation of fruits and vegetables.









PROJECT DETAILS
Here are previous projects completed by our Landscaping Partner,  in business for over 50 years: 









BUDGET
Each 100 square meter wall costs $195,000 SGD to set up and maintain for a period of 5 years. This caters for the following:

  Equipment & set up
  Plants
  Irrigation systems
  Maintenance

Also includes operational costs, marketing (videos and building awareness through social media), legal fees for contracts and agreements and the fee for raising funds.
This works out to be under $33 per month per square meter of green!
For any amount raised above $195,000 SGD, we will use it towards additional projects. Depending on the amount, this may range from a 10, 25, or another 100 square meter project.
SCHEDULE & DETAILS
We are in discussion with a number of schools in Singapore that are interested to proceed with this project. The names will be published in the “Updates” section of this campaign.
The first project will be a 100 sqm wall for one school.  Subsequent projects will vary in size. 
A VGP system will be used as it is the most cost effective and flexible.  It allows for easy design change and on-going maintenance. 
The timeline to deliver a project will be as follows:

  Commercial sign off – 2-4 weeks (depending on school and their decision making process)
  Scope of Works – 2-3 weeks
  Project sign off – 2-3 weeks
  Equipment preparation and deliver – 2 weeks
  Set up – 1-2 weeks



GOAL
Our goal is to have 1M sqm of vertical gardens covered by 2020 (that's  roughly 187 football fields)
Feel free to check out our website for more info: www.verticagreen.com","The majority of the cost for the project is upfront for the equipment itself and the deployment.   As the only requirement after deployment is monthly maintenance, It becomes more commercially sustainable when we structure his over a minimum of a 5 year commitment for each school/building.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout US$ 4\n\n\n\nDigital Certificate + Video\n\n\nEvery dollar goes directly into building a vertical garden for schools that you are directly contributing to.

""All warfare is based on deception."" ~Sun Tzu~
In this simple game of army building, one relies on misdirection & subterfuge to win battles. Deploy your Trojan Horse to keep your foes on their toes, no knowing which direction your back-stabbing sword will come from. But of course, you will be subjected to the same twisted fate. 
Oh, did I also mention it includes INCREDIBLY PUNNY NAMES & ADORABLY VICIOUS CREATURES? Animals blend with ancient armies to form the likes of SPUGTANS (Pugs + Spartans) and PURRSIANS (Cats + Persians).

The Creators 
Yoke Ideas was birthed around the same time as the current globe trotting, economy-smashing, life-shattering virus i.e. late 2019, with an infectious zeal to nurture critical thinking skills & foster collaborative efforts.
The pandemic has put paid to many our initial, on-ground plans. We hit the ground running but soon found ourselves out of breath...hmmm...
Remaining all-around positive (except for our Covid test results), we went into full-on brainstorming mode. Quarantine has provided opportunity & free time for random thoughts to marinate & mature into actionable ideas. As recent viewings of Nat Geo's ancient warfare & animals from Blue Planet coalesce in our minds, the idea to crossbreed creatures, combats & card game slowly materialize...
And as they say, the rest is HISTORICALLY UP TO YOU! We hope you'll subscribe to our vision and help make this project a successful one!
Special thanks to TheMooseMind (@theneveryak) for the adorable illustrations & Iconian Fonts (www.iconian.com) for the font.","Logistic is one of the main challenges in making this project a success. Due to the pandemic, the shipping costs have risen several fold. The project timeline was pushed back several times due to efforts to source for more economical means of fulfilling orders. The Trojan family is praying to all its respective gods for more stable times ahead to ensure you receive your rewards in a timely manner (& or course, for everyone, especially you, to be protected from any harm caused by the pandemic).","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nCampaign Tribute\n\n\nPay tribute to your favourite army! \n\nArmy with the highest tribute will have its General emblazoned forever in history (and less significantly, on the throw pillows for the \""Pillow de Résistance\"" reward).\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 12 or more\n\nAbout $9\n\n\n\nSingle Tickle (revised)\n\n\nWarning!

Alex stays with his grandmother, Wai Fun in a simple rented apartment. The problem of the story reveals itself when the audiences finds out that while Alex is struggling with the money he needs to secure a scholarship for his further studies, Wai Fun, also needs money to pay for the rent which she had been owing their landlord for three months. Alex did not tell Wai Fun as he did not see Wai Fun as a parent figure or family. However, Wai Fun did not tell Alex about the rent as she did not want to worry him. In the story, Alex was not able to see the love of his grandmother, like a lot of young people, Alex sees the love and concern of Wai Fun as constant nagging.
 Wai Fun eventually manages to win the lottery that gave her enough to pay for the rent, she then proceeds to seek help from Alex to collect the prize. Alex could not care less about what Wai Fun has to say, thus he threw the ticket aside. The due date to Alex’s scholarship and Wai Fun’s rent was fast approaching, Alex becomes more frustrated that he does not have enough money to secure the scholarship and Wai Fun grows more worried about the rent. 
Alex founds out that the ticket had indeed won the money that he needed, thus he tries to hide it from Wai Fun. 
The climax of the story is about how Alex struggles between selfish and selfless. Alex eventually gave up on the scholarship and used the money to pay off the rent when Wai Fun is about to be chased out of the apartment.
The film ends with Wai Fun and Alex enjoying a simple meal together, the ending shows that Alex finally learns that nothing is as important as Wai Fun, he finally sees the love of Wai Fun for him. It is in plain sight, thus the title. This is a student project, unfortunately, we as students are unable to sustain such a production with the little resources, so we need you! we need you to help us fulfil our dreams to become successful film makers one day!The schedule, budget planning is all ready! Although we are students, our production do have a director, an assistant director, a producer, cinematographer, editor and a production designer and that is is not a project we came up with for fun, we will finish the project on schedule.  we hope to assure you that your support will not go to waste!","Although we have the skills for each roles, director, editor etc . What we lack of the most as students, is definitely money. We came up with the most economically conservative budget plan, and we are indeed going to use our own money. The budget plan for everything came up to be $2000, however, being afraid that we are unable to raise that amount of money, we lowered it to $1000 due to the all or nothing policy.

What is a No-Brainer?
No-Brainer is a solo comix anthology featuring different stories in different styles by the same cartoonist. Each issue contains a main serialized story in the first half along with a bunch of shorter stories in the second half.
The short stories range from kids growing up and dealing with changing friendships, to salmon trying to survive the treacherous upriver journey to their spawning grounds.

 Thoomgard: Final Mission Chapter 4 (18 pages)
""Earths greatest protector gets retrenched after five decades of service, due to declining performance and a new wave of upcoming talent. As he struggles to come to terms with reality, he embarks on what seems to be his final mission - be a panel speaker at the academy's recruitment expo.""
As depressing as that sounds, Thoomgard is essentially a buddy sci-fi action-adventure where a gorilla man and his cat-like sidekick fights ferocious aliens while dealing with the reality of growing old.

Ace24, a young lady on holiday, faces literal elimination as a sudden Kaiju Battle takes place during the off-season.""

 ADD ONs 
For those who have missed our early deals, or wish to add more of selected plushies,  keychains and enamel pins for personal reasons. You will be able to choose your quantity under this option.


Disclaimer

  Colors may vary between the colors displayed on your screens and the physical product.
  After receiving the plushie, if it’s misshapen, please reshape the plushie by squashing and gently stretching it. He had a bad hair day.
  Plushies are handcrafted by multiple individuals hence each plushie comes with its own unique shape, some may appear misaligned and others may come with loose or 1 ~ 2 missing threads in their embroidery. This are common flaws in mass production, hence please refrain from expecting a perfect plushie to be made. Here are some examples you may commonly find in your plushie.





A, B, E : Loose threads, can be solved by cutting the extra thread. C : Sometimes fabric just come in wrinkled that can't be fixed. D : every embroidery parts of this doll carries tiny plastic pieces that need to be manually removed, simply use tweezers to solve this issue.  F : Sample of a missing thread, usually you won't notice it from afar!






  [Last Update : 4 Feb 22] - The dolls are currently under safety checks. We hope to get it approved by the end of the campaign and will update you immediately on this platform as we receive updates ourselves. 





ABOUT MYSELF 
Hi, I’m the artist Yencatx, alias Yen, who created Toast the Raccoon. I'm not fluent in English, so I apologize if I made any mistakes in my words may came across as rude.  


You can follow me on Twitter / Instagram for daily posts featuring Toast the Raccoon! or directly support me on Ko-fi  I've also created discord emotes of Toast the Raccoon for anyone to use and as well as Line stickers if you are interested in spreading the Raccoon gang. 


A little story behind this project; we ran into multiple difficulties and faced many rejections before we found the right company and with our finally hunt successful, Toast could be brought into its snuggleable, cuddleable form, but during that process we’ve used almost all of our expenses. This is where you, the supporters, shine!
We look forward to Part 2 of Toast the Raccoon if this project is successfully funded! Our next feature is coloration doll & body pillow size versions of this baby!
Thank you for your consideration and thank you very much for supporting me and taking the time to meet Toast the Racoon! 


Time-lapse
February to March. Two month of time to fully focused on developing keychain pouch while the project is still on. With high hopes to present a physical sample within this period frame in addition to receive safety checks approval.
April to June. The campaign ends on April, production period waiting time, this may extend depending on the amount of orders placed. 
July to August / ???. Shipping period, this may also extend depending on the amount of orders. It may take longer than average to get all of the order shipped as a solo artist handling all of this orders.


Fulfillment / Shipping
We are honored to be work with WhiteSquirrel. The wonderful heroic team will be handling all International / Global shipping.  Exception to only Singapore & Malaysia which I will personally packed them so I don't feel overwhelmed with orders, and get resulting an upset stomach due to anxiety to get all orders out quickly on my own. They're a wonderful team, so please treat with respect for their hard work if you ran into difficulties with your shipment and required assistance when contacting them.


New to Kickstarter 
Kickstarter is a ""pledge now and pay later system"" similar with pre-order system if you have experience in making purchases online. You'll need an account in order to pledge on our project. 
During the campaign period, you may cancel or change your pledge at any time using the pledge manager. Once our project base goal is successfully funded, you will then be charged at the end of the project. Consequently, if the base goal failed, your pledge will not be charged at all.","Challenges we faced are often lies on overall cost.

Knowing where your money is going, especially when it is a high expense, is immensely important so please read further to understand why the costs shown above are as they are.

The plushie itself is expensive due to the complexity of it’s patterns and production. However, these aren’t the only fee’s that are faced in its creation which can be a common misconception. Freight costs to get the product from the factory to my fulfillment center and then on to me is also another high cost, before even touching customer shipping, fulfillment cost, safety certification fees and Kickstarter fees.

Hey there! Im Dhany, a creative based in Singapore and I am the face behind fictive.co. Welcome to my 5th kickstarter.
To celebrate the upcoming new season of Umbrella Academy on Netflix, I'll be trying to get these enamel pin designs put into production. In providing your support and pledge, all funds raised during this campaign will go towards - pin production, shipping fees, packaging, and kickstarter fees.









Want to support this project but are currently short on funds?
No worries, kickstarter has your back! Pledge now to secure your spot, and worry about payments later. All payments will only go through when the project ends successfully.
Editing Pledges: During the 30 days before the project ends, you can edit your pledge however you'd like to. (increase, decrease, cancel)
Unlocking Designs: If there is a pin you want that's still locked when place your pledge, don't worry! By pledging now, you're helping to raise the funds to unlock new designs that you can then choose when the project ends.
Leftover pins from this project will be listed on my shop, though with a hiked price. All prices seen on this campaign are specially for backers of this kickstarter campaign only. If you find yourself interested in any of the designs, do secure your spot during the run of this kickstarter campaign to enjoy discounts while you can!
TLDR : ALL FUNDS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED TILL THE END OF THIS CAMPAIGN 









These pins are inspired by and designed based off of the characters in the live action Umbrella Academy series by Netflix.
All pins will be hard enamel and will measure approx 1.5"" lengthwise.

  Double post with rubber clutch (on main part of the pin)
  Gold plated metal
  Screen printed details

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
✦ The Base Goal ✦ is set to SGD$1400 to provide funding for the first 2 pins - Luther and Diego, along with bonus rewards. After the initial goal is reached, the remaining designs will subsequently be unlocked as we hit their respective funding goals. (refer below)









✦ The Ultimate Goal ✦ is to raise SGD$4900 to fund all 7 pin designs + bonus rewards. However to keep things in scope, each design is broken down into smaller stretch goals (as displayed below). This means that, the more we can raise, the more pins I will be able to end up producing! 

















































PLEASE NOTE : FINAL VERSIONS MAY VARY SLIGHTLY IN COLOUR OR THICKNESS OF OUTLINES DUE TO THE POSSIBLE TWEAKING NEEDED DURING PRODUCTION









Stickers come with your pledge! (for additional stickers, see below*)
Each sticker design will be given alongside its corresponding pin design. For example, the Ben sticker will be given when you pledge for the Ben pin.
Stickers will stay true to the original concept, but with exclusion of the dangling numbered umbrella as per their pin counterparts. The sizes for each sticker may vary depending on design, but will be approximately 2"" each.









 *FOR ADDITIONAL STICKERS TO YOUR PLEDGE :

  Please add on $2 per design to your total
   To add a full set of 7 stickers, please add $10 to your total.

Click the green ""Back this Project"" or ""Manage Your Pledge"" button, select a reward level, then increase the pledge amount by $2. You'll receive your stickers at the same time you receive your pins.
After the Kickstarter, these stickers will be available in my shop, but with a hiked price.










   July 25th: Kickstarter is LIVE
   Approx mid August : Surveys sent 
   Approx end August : Kickstarter funds received / Pin productions start
   Mid to end September : Pins are completed/shipped to me
   Approx October : Pins are shipped out!

*Domestic (Singapore) backers: Package will arrive in 3-5 days from date of dispatch
*International backers: Package will take anywhere between 2-8 weeks for delivery
Please be aware that International backers are responsible for any customs fees their country may ask for, so plan accordingly!









A big ol' heartfelt thanks to you for checking out & backing this project! You're bringing a passionate dream to life and supporting a growing artist, while collecting and gaining new babies to add to your Harry Potter pin collection!
Here's to you adoring them as much as I do! ♥
Thank you to all my friends, family & followers who've extended their endless love & support through this process! I definitely couldn't have done this without you.









Do feel free to give me a follow on Instagram for any updates! I'd also appreciate it so much if you could take the time to share this project. The more exposure we get through your shares, the higher a chance we get to reaching all goals set for this campaign!
If you are interested in checking out the other pins I have created, here's a quick link to my shop.","There is always a possibility that the campaigns fail to reach their funding goal. If this campaign happens to fall short of its goal, the campaign will be automatically cancelled by kickstarted and all funds pledged towards it will be fully refunded.

As is normal with pin manufacturing, small hiccups such as delay in production due to product not meeting the quality checks may occur.
Eventhough I have reached out to the manufacturer to ensure that the pin design is possible to be made into a physical product, there may be final adjustments before actual production.

I will definitely keep you guys updated throughout the campaign, just so I can keep my supporters in the loop with things.

What are Hard Enamel Pins?
Hard enamel pins (lapel pins/brooches) are decorative art that can be worn or otherwise displayed.




Past Campaign Sample Pins (Pokey)














   Pledge now and pay later.
  You can always change your pledge anytime during the campaign.
  You will not be charged until the end of a successful Kickstarter campaign.
  By pledging for all your desired designs even if they have not been unlocked, you will help the campaign work towards unlocking them.










Here is the estimated timeline if everything goes smoothly:

  Start of April to Mid April: Campaign funding phase
  End of April: Surveys sent through Kickstarter for you to choose your preferred pins and add-ons
  Start of June to Mid June: Products are received and shipped out to backers
  July to August: Products received by backers. Please allow additional time for international shipping.

After the campaign is fully funded, a survey will be sent through Kickstarter for you to specify your shipping address, preferred pins and add-ons. Please ensure that your shipping address is correct.
In order to prevent any delayed shipment, please fill up the survey as soon as possible.
Tracking numbers will be sent to you once the order is mailed.
I will do my utmost to make sure that all packages are properly packed. Thank you.









Heartfelt thanks to all of you for viewing the campaign. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I do! Feel free to share the campaign with your friends!

With love ❤ Aethereyr","Pin designs shown above are for illustrative purposes only and are subjected to minor changes during final production.

(1) Possible manufacturing defects

I have made many of my pins with my current manufacturers and they are of high standards. Hence, I have good faith that my current manufacturers will do the same for this collection of pins. However, if there should be any defect, I will reproduce the pins which may cause shipping to be delayed.

(2) Colour variations

Actual colours of the pins may differ from the images you see on your screen. I will try my best to ensure that the actual colours resemble the original pin designs.

(3) Line variations

Slight changes in the line art may be made if manufacturers need to do so, as the lines are made of metal and may fused into each other.

(4) Shipping duration

There may be unforeseen delay due to different countries' customs clearance procedures, which are beyond my control.

I will do my best to ensure that packages are packed properly and handed to my local courier service provider promptly. However, please note that anything that happens during the shipping process is beyond my control.

Any additional tax, fees or customs’ charges are the responsibility of the backer.

Backers will be responsible for any returned parcels due to negligence such as providing the wrong shipping address or failing to collect the parcels from their local post office during the collection period. Additional shipping cost to ship the parcels again will be charged accordingly.

If there should be any queries or issues with your orders, please contact me via Kickstarter and I will try my best to assist you.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 16 or more\n\nAbout US$ 12\n\n\n\nONE (1) Pin\n\n\n▼ Save S$4 (Retail Price = S$20) for each pin. ▼\n\n☁ You may choose from any unlocked designs. ☁\n\n❤ Add-ons to your current pledge ❤\n\n\u2028If you want to get more pins, please select from other tiers with the number of pins you would like.

Introducing Quire by AUSTERToday's generation, everyone always has something to do. Everyone has a very active and on-the-go lifestyle. We want to provide consumers with a backpack perfect for any circumstance with all the features to satisfy the needs and wants of anybody in this day and age. Introducing, the Quire drawstring.







Why use a drawstring bag anyway?Drawstring bags can be a perfect addition to your everyday items. They are quick, easy and compact. Perfect for a stroll in the park, an afternoon outing, or maybe you just need to pack light.So why use the Quire?Our drawstring bag is not limited to only these features. The Quire drawstring goes far and beyond, making it the perfect drawstring for any type of circumstance. Our bag has implemented features that make it one of the most versatile bags available on the market. We are also great for people on a budget as our prices are very low.FeaturesWater-ResistanceThe Quire is designed with your daily lives in mind. And this is one of the reasons we have implemented high-quality water resistant polyester to make sure the rain never stops you.Rain HoodWe have also implemented a Rain Hood to make sure no water ever enters the backpack. So you can run your life with out worrying about your personal belongings inside the backpack. The Rain Hood also acts as another security feature to prevent pickpockets to ever reach your belongings.







 








 External PocketsA downside of a regular Drawstring bag is the inability to organise your items within the bag. The Quire has been designed with 2 external pockets for your organisational needs. These pockets also double up for Bottle holders to make sure no liquid needs to be put inside the backpack. These pockets use an extra durable velcro making sure nothing falls out of the bag.CompressibilityWe all travel a lot, and may have limited space in our luggage to carry more items. The Quire is an extremely durable backpack which allows it to be folded and clipped to take as little room as possible, allowing you to always keep The Quire by your side.







 








Quick Access ZipA downside of using an original drawstring bag is that you have to open the backpack every time, you want to remove or put something in the backpack. With the Quire the whole problem is removed as we have added a quick access zip to let you access your items easily without having to reopen the backpack continuously.







 Detachable StringsDrawstring bags are extremely hard to customise to your daily situations. As the strings are rigidly in place and cannot be changed. Our backpack eliminates this problem as we use high quality velcro to allow you to split and attach it to anywhere you like. As we use one of the best velcro in the market the velcro will never split even when there is a lot of pressure on it.These detachable strings also help balance the strings out as there is a central connection point, which keeps it balanced.







 








 







 The Quire Bag is perfect for travelling, adventures and everyday use. Our mission with this product was to provide users with a bag that can be used anywhere anytime and can serve all the functions needed to carry out different activities.PriceOur prices are extremely low so that we can provide high-quality items to everyone around. Instead of making large amounts of profits, we chose to increase the accessibility of our products to the larger market for everyone to enjoy.







Stretch Goals:SG$6000 - We will release a new color!  Onyx Black to add to the slick design of the backpack.  







SG$7000 - Superior packaging to give your bag a premium feeling at first sight.SG$10000 - We will give away freebies with every Quire that is sold! (More info closer to reaching the goal)More stretch goals will be added if we move past our goal.Rewards

It's a story of good and bad, kindness and betrayal, hope and despair, victory and defeat and many other things that make it real. It is my story and I would like to tell it as a book. 
The art of written word seems lost upon the current generation, with information availability almost as fast as speed of human thought.
So, I have decided to write this story as a book. 
Importantly to me, it is a true story of my past, which I have witnessed and I am the best to tell it. With social media, we forgot how to openly speak our mind without considering what is that we'd like to tell the world. Everything is questioned and everything is doubted, it's hard to even know, what truth is, anymore.
I am turning 30 in a month. Those who know my story, are quite amused by it, it's difficult to tell for me, because I lived it, so it's simply real, and not that amusing after all. 
Perhaps it's similar to story of Forest Gump. I was born at an interesting time, and I had a loving mother. Just like Forest, I was a little slow. My application to school was rejected because it did not pass some tests, so I had to stay back another year in kindergarten before I was accepted to begin my learning journey.
Just like Forest, at times I had to face some bullies, and that is where it starts to deviate. 
My story starts in 1989 in an interesting and mysterious place called the USSR. The first memories I start to recall, it was already re-branded to Russian Federation, 1 superpower fell apart to create 15 countries. We had democracy and freedom, and all those amazing things that resulted in crimes, and gangs and oligarchs.  Overnight, Russia became the land of opportunity where freedom was not that free. We did not have the beautiful story of how founding fathers fought the wars, and came together to sign the declaration of Independence with 14 amendments that are the holiest of laws. In Russia, we had rich history of many wars that were fought and human will and spirit that it took to fight for the motherland.
So, early 90s, the opportunity was available, but it was also a land where survival of the weak was something the country could no longer afford. After 70 over years of that fake equality and propaganda, when democracy and capitalism came, there was no time to wait. The weak were preyed, the strong prevailed.
I was a kid, and witnessed some of it. A lot of it, I managed to live through, thanks to the price my parents paid. But I was slow. My mother had to work, and so did my dad. Being slow, was weakness, and the bullying that happened in schools back then, would probably amount to juvenile detention based on foreign standards of today. For me, that was daily life. So, mama did not have much choice. She could not look after me and herself at the same time. She loved me dearly, but I was a slow kid. I was potential prey. So, instead of the iconic ""Run, Forrest Run!"" My mama taught how to retaliate, and punch back those who dared to hit me first.
....
I am 29 years old. I live in Singapore. You can see the previous and unsuccessful kick-starter campaign at (link). My bio is from then, so now, it is exactly that + what I've done since then. Please take into account that it was a few years ago, that kid was kind of arrogant, and had a lot to learn.  I started Project28, had ups and downs, and overall it is a pretty interesting story as well. 
...
 I'll expand this section further when time permits.
...
Expected delivery: Jan-March 2020 
Stretch goals will be revealed upon hitting funding goals.
...
I would like to print it into hard copy as well, have yet to do research on that. 
Also, I would like to write in two languages at the very least. My English is ok, my Russian is on 8th grader's level. So that will require more time to proof read and translate. 
...
Time is money, therefore, this kickstarter will help me manage my time accordingly to allocate for this project. 
...
I'll expand the rewards, after launching.

Micro-sized boards, modules, everything!




A small portion of what the tweeq platform has to offer





The tweeq platfom is designed to meet the demands of multiple functionality in a really small, low energy platform, while retaining user flexibility and ease of use.






K.I.S.S PrincipleYou'll probably know the K.I.S.S acronym as the famous ""Keep It Simple, Stupid"",  or the tons of other variations there are out there.During the hardware and software design process, we put a twist onto the acronym and stuck by the ""Keep It Simple & Small"" rule.The hardware platform and software that comes with it are to be kept really small, be it in physical dimensions or code size, and also have to be really simple to use across the board.The result, is the tweeq platform.Tiny, Powerful Cores




Our largest and smallest core next to each other for scale





Introducing tweeq cores. They might look tiny in the palm of your hands, but these little fellas boast a 32-bit micro-controller with loads of memory (up to 256KB!), and they come in 6 different configurations designed to best meet your wildest gadget ideas. 







Teeny Tiny Stamp Modulestweeq's stamp modules are possibly the world's smallest series of cascade-able modules that add a singular function to any tweeq core without any addition to the size of the overall board configuration.










Our largest stamp module currently available (EEPROM) measures 9.5 x 11mm. That's smaller than an average m&m chocolate!





Take a stamp module and make it an on-board feature!





All stamp modules are cascade-able thanks to the I2C bus line. This allows you to connect multiple stamp functionalities using the same 2 pins, leaving the other pins free for multi-functional and intermediate boards, as well as the many external modules available for plug-and-play.


At the back of each core is a space to put one (or more!) of these tiny lil' stamp modules.





Micro-sized Multi Functional Boards

We know how difficult it is to get your cool DIY gadget ideas looking as slim and sexy as possible, without having to design and build the PCB on your own. For things to be really slim, we found that stacking anything more than 3 boards starts getting way too thick. 




All stamp modules are kept to a maximum height of 3mm so that a multi functional board can be added on top of it, like this!






The tweeq cores are extended with the use of multi-functional boards, designed to provide at least 2 functionalities on a tiny footprint, in order to reduce the amount of board stacking needed.









Every FUNctional board is a marriage of functions that will either need each other, or an ingenious complement to the main function.We currently have 4 multi-functional boards available, with even more on the way. These 4 boards are a great start for a whole ton of applications, ranging from wearables to tiny robots!Intermediate Boards (IB)Intermediate boards are great for adding functionalities that complement the multi-functional boards. 







For this reason, having intermediate boards like the WIFI IB go in between a core board and, say, an audio board, opens up cool applications like a talking desktop companion that nags when you spend too much time on Facebook, or a talking virtual butler.


MITO:mOLED, IB:WIFI and FB:Audio





With just 3 boards stacked together, that's a whole lot of features in a really small area! (Slim too!)

Tiny Peripherals & Accessories


The tweeq platform is made awesome with the support of an ever growing range of tiny peripherals and accessories.








Tiny, meet tiny Plug and play external modules (extMod), cable connectors, speakers, motor actuators, batteries and more, are hand picked and/or custom made to help ensure that the entire set-up is kept tiny.Breadboard ModulesWe love breadboarding. And in the process of building the tweeq platform, we found the perfect companion when breadboarding circuits. We call them breadboard modules. 







Ever since we designed these breadboard modules more than a year ago, they have been crucial in every breadboard set up, with or without the tweeq platform. 







Plug the modules into the power rails, and use our jumper wires at the top to connect things up right where you can see them. We've used these modules so much, we came up with 3 breadboard perfect lengths of jumper wires that keep the set-up looking really neat.
For every breadboard module there is, a tiny external module(extMod) version for it is available for plug and play. This makes it easy for you to set up your tiny version of what you prototype on your breadboard later on!tweeq is OpenWe're looking forward to growing with you as part of a community that shares everything around the tweeq together. We're talking Schematics, PCB Designs, Hardware Libraries, Software Libraries, 3D Models, 3D Printing and Laser Cutting Designs (eg. Enclosures)... Everything.







All of tweeq's current and future hardware design files will be freely available for download from Github.Download, view, modify, and design around it. When you're ready to build your own boards for use with the tweeq, we'll be there to support you with the parts that tweeq uses, or even build it for you (we're awesome like that).Have Free Rein Developing With tweeq 




Have your pick - 3 Languages, 3 IDEs, All Free





At the heart of tweeq's  PIC32 32-bit core is an optimized chipKIT bootloader, allowing you to choose among 3 popular programming languages and IDEs you're comfortable with, and use the same USB to Serial Downloader across all compilers to program the cores.tweeq is Arduino Compatible







 The tweeq's onboard chipKIT bootloader allows you to program using the open source Arduino compatible MPIDE, which works with existing Arduino Libraries and Sketches. You'll be able to select the tweeq core boards from the drop-down menu in MPIDE, and use them with the open source libraries we'll be releasing that works great with our add-ons.If you're already familiar with the Arduino style of programming, you'll feel right at home when programming your tweeq platform.tweeq is Great for Advanced Users tweeq's onboard serial bootloader also means that you can program using Microchip's MPLAB X IDE in Microchip's PIC C Language, and download programs using just a USB to Serial Converter, without the need for a programmer/ICD.If you're no stranger to PIC or PIC32 chips and are looking for a tiny development platform, the tweeq is for you.tweeq is BASIC







Using the tweeq platform with Allegro IDE is perfect for those who just have too many want-to-dos. (You know who you are) Programs are written in BASIC minor (B minor), a subset of VB.NET that is very much like the English language, making it easy to pick up and getting things done.







Along with intelli-sense and syntax helpers, Allegro IDE also comes with utilities that make preparing graphics/User Interface a breeze.All tweeq hardware available currently and in the future will have full software library support, and tutorials to go along with it.  Allegro IDE is free, and will be available for download for both Windows and MAC OS.Open Source USB OTG Libraries We are glad to announce that among the list of open source libraries released with Allegro IDE, is a fully open source USB HID Driver written in BASIC for tweeq USB OTG MITO cores, with CDC support on its way. tweeq is Low Costtweeq is a low cost platform for rapid prototyping and proof of concept. Save time, save money.


Cores start as low as £8.90 (USD$14.90)

Product Photography - Kent Nguyen Photography","Risks and challenges will definitely be evident when hardware manufacturing and logistics is concerned, as it involves quite a few stages. 

Our core team has had more than 10 years of experience working together to release hardware development kits over the years, and we've established good long-term business relationships with a few key manufacturers and suppliers that we have been using regularly for more than 4 years. 

Should any of them fail to deliver due to any reason, alternative suppliers  that we have done business with have also been prepared, so as to reduce any possible delays in the process of component and parts procurement, fabrication, assembly and any other process that requires custom work to be done.

All hardware items will be inspected, tested, and packed in-house by our team in Singapore, before shipping worldwide via registered airmail to backers using Singapore Post. This is a trackable option which takes about 2 weeks to reach most destinations.

Of course, while we can try to pre-empt and prepare for as many obstacles and issues that may arise in the time before we ship (or even after we do), should there be any roadblocks due to unforeseen circumstances, please rest assured that we'll do our utmost best to overcome it and be as transparent as possible throughout the entire process.

Hello! I'm Mai, an artist from Singapore. This is my first ever Kickstarter, and I'm happy to share it with the world! Introducing Love is Sweet! a set of original pride flag enamel pins for those who love their Pride on the sweeter side.
You can find me on my socials at ADREM0RA!
About This Project
I have always wanted to create enamel pins, especially those to show off LGBT pride. 
The goal of SGD1500 is to unlock all 8 enamel pins offered in the banner - yes, all 8 of them! It didn't feel right to ""lock"" any sexualities and gender identities behind a paywall. Instead of conventional unlock new designs every X amount of dollars, I am offering a singular stretch goal, as well as possibly adding more flags or freebies to the mix if the reception is overwhelmingly positive.
WHY Kickstarter?
Kickstarter offers a back now, pay later model - your money will not be spent until the end of the campaign, and it only is spent if the project is fully funded! 
The Pins Offered
The pins will be approximately 1 inches wide, hard enamel with gold plating.
I have 8 designs to choose from! In no particular order, LGBT Pride, Lesbian, Bisexual, Pansexual, Transgender, Nonbinary, Asexual and Aromantic.
Colours shown are for visualisation purposes only and may vary in final product. The pin itself will be made of gold plating.

































































The Stretch Goal (singular)
At $3500, every pledge $14 or above will receive a Rainbow Candy PVC charm at no additional cost! Colours may vary in final product.","I have not created enamel pins before, however, I have created zines and miscellaneous merchandise in the past, so I am confident in my ability to deliver.

Hi! I'm Rachel, also known as @theconfettihands on Instagram! I have run a few similar campaigns before and I'm back again!


In this campaign, I created a series of Christmas character enamel pins and other goodies! Check out these three characters designed specially to get you in the mood.


The goals are listed below, so let’s unlock everything if you love Christmas and are ready to get into the festive mood!









Kickstarter uses a pledge now - pay later all or nothing system. You will not be charged anything unless the campaign is successfully funded on 9th December 2021.


Pledges are tied to pin quantities (1,2 or 3 pins) and not to pin designs so please pledge freely.  Surveys will be sent out to you once the campaign ends on 9th December so that you can choose your pins and other goodies.


You can cancel/edit your pledge any time before the campaign ends but of course I would love if you keep your pledge. Every time I see someone pledge, it makes a small business owner very happy and is very encouraging.


If you have any questions, send me a message rather than post it as a comment as I will be paying closer attention to my messages.






















































Items that will be included in every reward package.
1 Sticker Strip 
1 Merry Friend Card
Stickers are waterproof and best peelable only twice.
For both the sticker and the card it will be a random design but I will try to match it to your pin choice. The cards feature 6 more Merry Friend variations not from the pins so you may get a surprise character!















Discounted price for 2 pin tiers (1 pin and all 3 pins)
2 Sticker Strips instead of 1
Early bird promo ends on 28th November (10 day period)








Add these items to your rewards through the add-ons page. 


Sticker pack: Featuring 6 more Merry Friends, making a total of 9 stickers.
Stickers are waterproof and best peelable only twice.
Sticker sheet: Perfect for scrapbooking and journaling (matte paper stickers)























Local Shipping: Within Singapore through Singpost Normal Mail. If you would like Tracked Mail, please top up SGD 2.00 to your pledge and notify me through a message.


Your rewards package will reach 1-1.5 weeks


International Shipping: Only Singpost Tracked Mail is available to ensure your package is not lost. This is based on my past experiences.


You will be sent your tracking number and if you are unable to find it,  please send me a message. Track your package here: www.singpost.com/track-items/


Your rewards package will reach in maximum 8 weeks. UK & EU pledgers will probably receive rewards earlier than US pledgers.


I hope to mail out within a week of receiving the enamel pins. Please check both the status of your individual rewards as well as the campaign updates. I can only mail out rewards once Kickstarter has accepted payment from your card/account.
























18th November: Start of Campaign (Early Bird promo included)
28th November: Early Bird Promo ends
11pm (SGT) 9th December: Campaign ends. Surveys sent out to you (please check around this time to answer your surveys)
Mid December: Most of your packages should be sent out
February: Re-live Christmas with happy pin mail!","During this ongoing pandemic, I will be disinfecting each item individually once I receive them. To ensure your safety and health, we encourage recipients to disinfect packages prior to and even after opening the package as a form of normal practice.

Based on our experience during COVID-19, they will take an estimate of 2 months from the date of mailing out for pledgers outside of Singapore.

I will post updates on the progress of the campaign and production if successful. Do drop me an email at theconfettihands@gmail.com if you have any questions.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 11 or more\n\nAbout US$ 8\n\n\n\n1 Enamel Pin\n\n\nYour choice of any 1 unlocked enamel pin\n\nAdd-ons available (sticker sheet, sticker pack)\nIncludes:\n\n\nEnamel Pin\n\n\nFreebie Sticker Strip / Tape\n\n\nRandom Merry Friend Card\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nFeb 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 21 or more\n\nAbout US$ 16\n\n\n\n2 Enamel Pins\n\n\nYour choice of any 2 unlocked enamel pins\n\nAdd-ons available (fsticker sheet, sticker pack)\nIncludes:\n\n\n2×\nEnamel Pin\n\n\nFreebie Sticker Strip / Tape\n\n\nRandom Merry Friend Card\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nFeb 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 30 or more\n\nAbout US$ 22\n\n\n\n3 Enamel Pins\n\n\nAll 3 enamel pins.

However, I - like many others - strive to make the best out of it; by taking the time and personal space we otherwise wouldn't get to have, to fulfil a lifelong dream of writing and publishing a novel with a story about love that will hopefully pique your interest and inspire you to treasure your loved ones. 
The story is about a time after a cure has been found for the pandemic. But by that time, a large part of the world has already been destroyed from it. Most of Asia has been crippled by it and live in a world of ensuing anarchy. Singapore perished due to its small population and is a country no more. The protagonist of the book, who survived embarks on a journey on land,  across Asia to Shanghai to find his wife. She had returned to Shanghai before Covid got out of hand in Singapore and they had not been able to contact each other since.  This is story about his unrelenting journey in search of his Love. 
The funds raised shall help with creative, printing and editorial costs mainly. I'd like to print enough copies to share them with more people. I shudder to think that one day the digital age will fully deprive the newer generation the simple pleasure of sitting at home or at a cafe with a drink by the side and reading a hard copy in their hands. I would like to obstinately stand by printing hard copies; old school way.
This venture to realise the book will not only serve my own aspiration as I hope it also serves to encourage any individual keen to pursue a life of the arts; of creation, to persevere.  With the help of a community dedicated to supporting the arts, if I can do it, anyone can.
I hope to get better acquainted with all my pledgers in time to come and hopefully be able to foster a community where we can support one another's desire and enthusiasm for creation.

Notch envy.Love your iPhone X? Wish your plebeian phone stood up to the towering elegance of Apple's finest? Now all your devices can revel in the magic of the best the industry has to offer.Notch emulates the intense emotions of gazing in captive wonder at the stunning edge-to-edge display of the iPhone X. With manufacturers across the mobile industry scrambling to put phones out with the iconic top-mounted obstruction, it became clear that this was something all users needed.Here's what Notch does for you.Notch is anything you want it to be. A simple sticker. A symbol. A lifestyle.


Up your phone prestige game.








Bask in Notch's brilliance at work.








Timeless design.








Absolute magic.








No limits to Notch.





Stunning design & build.Exceptional materials. Razor-thin PVC*. Resilient adhesive backing.Over 600 DPI. Achieved with a precision die-cut process.


Make a statement.





Two incredible sizes.Notch comes in two beautifully judged flavours. Colossal and Classic.


Size matters.





It's just a sticker, guys.Greetings, fellow millennials! We're Charles and Aditya, software and automotive engineers from sunny Singapore. We’ve been longtime lurkers and backers on Kickstarter. With the release of the iPhone XS, Pixel 3 and other notched devices, we thought it would be hilarious to get our feet wet and deliver a fun project on one of our favourite platforms.


This is peak technology today.





It started as a joke among friends (across the whole internet, really). The iPhone X’s controversial design clearly put everyone’s knickers in a twist, and the trend continues to grow... for some reason.What really floored us were the copycats it spawned, from huge Chinese manufacturers to household names (lookin’ at you Motorola). This got us thinking, “What if all devices had a notch?” A month later, et voila.Think of Notch as a tongue-in-cheek jab at the ridiculous state of consumer technology and branding today. If you love avocado toast served with a side of dank memes, this is definitely for you.  Have fun!- Charles & Aditya*I said paper in the video. I apologise. Pretentiousness has its limits.UPDATES:12.10.18 - We're featured on Coconuts! Check it out here.
14.10.18 - We made the front page of Product Hunt! Show us love here.","- We might get sued by Apple. That won't happen... Right?
- We're getting stickers printed. I think we can handle that.
- Stickers are small and a bit tricky to cut, but we'll figure it out.
- Only challenge is our delivery strategy. We'll likely be serving our NA/EU backers with a printing company in NA, and Asia backers from Singapore.

Hello! My name is Tiffanie/Tiff, I draw and create cute artworks under the name Truffle Arts. I am a full time artist and designer based in Singapore and I have made lots of merch & stationery such as stickers, washi tapes, enamel pins, keychains and more. 
I recently started my shop about a year ago (I launched this campaign on my shop anniversary) I draw lots of my own characters and mainly adorable animals! 💗
For more updates on this campaign, I regularly update on my Twitter and Instagram.




Examples of my enamel pin and washi tape













I started this Breakfast Chonky Friends Mini Enamel Pin Series as I love drawing cute tiny things with faces on them, and it just so happens that it was breakfast themed! I decided to make them mini enamel pins 2.5cm~ as I like how intricate tiny enamel pins can be. As I always wanted to do a series of enamel pins, I have decided Kickstarter is the best way to go for me.










  Surveys will be given out at the end of the campaign to choose your rewards. 
  Prices below are in SGD (Singapore Dollar)









   Colours might not reflect how it looks when it is being produced due to the screen and lighting. Pantone colours has been settled but do note that Toast & Waffle has been slightly modified as the colours look different in real life & digital.











  All enamel pins comes with a Truffle Arts backstamp and a matching backing card!



































   Prices are in SGD (Singapore Dollar) but here is an estimated price guide for other currencies. 
  After this campaign is over and fully funded they will be added to my shop for a higher rate.



















   Kickstarter campaign starts (Late August)
  Campaign ends + surveys given out (Late September)
  Manufacturing begins (Late September - Early November)
   Pins arrive + Mailing them out (Mid November - Early December)










 Nearer to the date where the pins are shipped out, backers would be able to combine orders from my shop and shipping will be waived when checking out on my site!
  International Shipping

  All International orders are shipped with TRACKED SHIPPING at a flat rate of SGD9 (USD 6~) regardless of the quantity! Takes about 8-30 days, subjected to delays.
  All backers especially UK & EU backers are responsible for customs and import taxes that may apply. I'm not responsible for delays due to customs.

International Shipping (Most Asian Countries)

  Orders coming from countries near Singapore are shipped with TRACKED SHIPPING at a flat rate of SGD7 except Malaysia at SGD4 regardless of the quantity! Takes about 8-30 days, subjected to delays.

Domestic Shipping (Singapore)

  All mails are shipped with NO TRACKING at a flat rate of $1.50. (if you would like a tracked option please free to email me or message me on my socials!) Takes about 2-7 days, subjected to delays. Lost of shipment will not be replaced, please get tracked.

- Since enamel pins are handmade, it's normal for them to have minor imperfections such as scratches etc. Though I will be grading them and making sure it is up to standard to be sent over.
- I have settled all the pantone colours digitally, the colours might look different depending on your screen.

SHIPPING
- Due to COVID-19 mails being delayed are inevitable.
- To make sure all backers get their reward all pins will be shipped out using TRACKED mail.

REWARDS
- Once the campaign has been successfully funded, surveys will be given out! backers are responsible for filling it out by the given deadline. Or else I will hound you for it. Please check your emails!

How can we turn something as ugly as air pollution into something as useful as ink?That’s how we came up with AIR-INK. Through this Kickstarter, we are offering AIR-INK for the first time––as safe, refillable, high-quality, water resistant markers and screen printing ink. By using 30ml of AIR-INK, you can negate 45 minutes worth of pollution.







 



We are offering AIR-INK for the first time through this Kickstarter.  AIR-INK is currently available as 2mm, 15mm, 30mm and 50mm markers, and as 150ml of screen printing ink.

What is AIR-INK made of?








AIR-INK is made out of air pollution particulate matter––namely the unburned carbon soot you see coming out of the exhaust pipe of cars, chimneys, generators, and more.

The process
AIR-INK is created through a three-step process.Step 1. While cheaper carbon black inks are manufactured through the deliberate burning of fossil fuels, we use our proprietary device––what we call KAALINK––to capture soot that is already being emitted from vehicles. KAALINK is retrofitted to the exhaust pipe of vehicles/generators to capture the outgoing pollutants. It takes just 45 minutes worth of vehicular emissions captured by Kaalink to produce 1 fluid ounce of ink––enough to fill one of the pens being offered through this Kickstarter campaign. 



Our device attached to the exhaust pipe of a car.








Emission samples from various engines over a period of time.





Step 2. The soot we collect undergoes various proprietary processes to remove heavy metals and carcinogens. The end product is a purified carbon rich pigment.


Experimenting with the captured soot to extract pigments.








We purify the carbon pigment by cutting out the heavy metals, dust particles, and all other harmful materials.





Step 3. The carbon is then used to make different types of inks and paints.


We use standard industrial processes to create ink that is as safe as any on the market.





The end resultWe have created several grades of AIR-INK with different applications: 2mm round tip and 15mm, 30mm and 50mm chisel tip markers, and screen printing ink.

How can I use AIR-INK? AIR-INK is currently available as 2mm, 15mm, 30mm and 50mm markers, and a 150ml screen printing ink set. If this campaign is a success, we will be able to work towards releasing oil based paints, fabric paints, outdoor paints, and more.

RewardsWe are proud to offer the following rewards. If you'd like to add any additional items to your pledge (extra t-shirt, markers, post cards, etc.), just send us a message and we will do our best to accommodate!  The prices in the graphic below are in US Dollars (USD). They may differ slightly from the rewards prices on your right, which are converted from Singapore dollars (SGD). 















Where the money is goingAIR-INK follows industrial grade guidelines, and artists have been using AIR-INK for the past 6 months without issues.  Now, we are turning to Kickstarter to refine our KAALINK device and help scale up production.With every donation, you are giving back to the environment. In fact, you can negate 45 minutes worth of car pollution by using 30ml of AIR-INK.Even if just 15 percent of the world’s black ink supply is replaced with AIR-INK, we could end up cutting a lot of air pollution. Artist testimonialsIn July 2016, we collaborated with Tiger Beer and released a video about AIR-INK. The video was a huge success and was picked up by news outlets around the world. Artists from all over began asking how they could get their hands on the ink. Here are some of the kind words they shared.


Dibarah Mahmoob, Illustrator, Dhaka





""We're at a time where we need art not just for beauty. We need it for social and political purposes. We need it to create environmental awareness because pollution is at an all time high. AIR-INK will help a lot of people."" 


Sneha Sreshtha, South Asia Institute at Harvard University





""I wrote with ink made from 3 hours worth of pollution from Bangalore, India. It gave my art more purpose. This is how inks should be made""  


Kristopher Ho, Muralist, Hong Kong





""AIR-INK provides an environmentally friendly option for creatives and is high quality. The ink itself is thicker than most and can paint on rough surfaces without bleeding. The color of the ink is solid black which fits perfectly with my usual practice.""Our story







 


MIT Media Lab, Cambridge, MA





AIR-INK started out as an experiment at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, MA. We wanted to run a handheld printer that prints from candle soot, and demonstrated the rough prototype at several conferences. We quickly learned that environmentalists and artists loved it.


First prototype, 2013: Handheld printer that captures candle soot and prints from it





Later in 2014, we kicked off technological iterations in two Indian cities that are greatly affected by pollution––Delhi and Bangalore. We ideated further, prototyped, and saw that it could make a real world impact.







Moving beyond the prototypes, we started to ""harvest"" air pollution from engines and other sources. After treating that harvested air pollution, we turned it into inks. 


Early stages: Our team working in garages with cars and engines to capture air pollution before its released into the environment





Then in July 2016 is when we collaborated with Tiger Beer. Check out the video highlighting the experience below.

Why KickstarterPeople from all over constantly ask us how they can get their hands on AIR-INK and use it in their everyday lives. But at this time our pollution capture process is very labor intensive and can only happen at a very small scale. This campaign will allow us scale up and bring AIR-INK to as many of you as possible. On top of that, Kickstarter presents us with an incredible opportunity to form a creative community of human beings who hope to make the world a little more sustainable and beautiful. The Kickstarter community is already filled with these types of people, and we could not think of anywhere better to bring AIR-INK to life.We could not be more excited to give you the power to reduce your carbon-footprint and ultimately save lives while you create the things you love.

The concept revolves around portability. The initial sketch was a combination of the strength of different drones we pick up.


Sean, our design and mechanical engineer, started to pen out the concept of jetblack





And the journey starts to take the concept to reality ..


Sean taking it to the next level





With the finished CAD drawing, we were lucky to have a 3D printer at our place to print the separate components and pieced them together.


The 3D-printed prototype is thus born





The 3D-printed prototype reflected some structural issue. The back arms are loose. To make a foldable drone, we adopted a downward folding back arms, however the gap created the problem of securing the arms in place. Another problem was the initial thickness of 0.8mm, which results in 22g of extra weight. This exceeded our motor's specification by its 50% hovering threshold. The move to thin the thickness to 0.6mm started, and by thining, we have to reinforce the structure with perpendicular structs.


Closing up the gap of the back arms to secure for flight








Reinforcing the structure after thining, the structs are at the inner side of the frame





We leave the coloring process to our product manager, Ryan. He came up with a combination of a few colors using the theory of Color, Material and Finishing. Adding the iconic middle prop-up to reflect the curve of Jetblack. 


The initial vibrant orange was not being shown on the initial prototype due to printing on black surface





While the design was ongoing, we were working on a reliable altitude control, trajectory flying through finger drawing, and voice recognition features in our test area marked with motion capture cameras.


Testing in lab, and soldering components of the transmitting module








The mess of doing hardware, going through different components for test. Spot how many familiar devices and sensors you recognized!








Lots of batteries went through ups and downs to get where we are







Going through the manufacturing directives and instructions for Jetblack, the top row has the most problematic brushed motor component which the gear has to be mounted properly on the motor's rod





This is our very first time doing a drone for the masses, and we hope to have people experience Jetblack, that's our benchmark and standard for product. We adopted users' feedback through the initial batch of prototype at the courtesy our manufacturing partner, and have since improved Jetblack with reliable sensors, better camera, and longer flight time. Now that we are done with the prototype, we need to enter manufacturing with a minimum quantity. As we have exhausted our resources in the initial prototypes manufacturing, it has created massive financial stress on our team. We hope through Kickstarter we could convince our manufacturing partner to support us and also pay the initial deposit to kickstart the manufacturing. Help us realize our dream of having our plane fly in the sky. _______________________________________________________

It took us a long grueling journey to reach the stage of post-prototype production run. Why all the way to post-prototype? We want to be very sure that we are fully prepared to scale up for mass production.The only obstacle that is holding us back from a full-swing production compared to a prototype production run is cost. It takes a lot more money to run a bigger scale production, and more manpower, components and tools. The supports we have here at kickstarter give the team and the production partners confidence to make our dream a reality. We are here in Kickstarter to crowd fund a manufacturing run. We believed Kickstarter allows us to overcome the barrier, no matter which stage we are at. As a young team, we faced a huge financial challenge to produce a drone, it has exceeded our initial expectation. The prototype run we had have taught us many lessons regarding agreement, partnership, storage of sensitive chips like barometer, and the painfully expensive injection molding process. We were caught off guard with the cost of a manufacturing run. The manufacturing run is the very last stage, and by overcoming this stage here, we will be able to deliver our promise to our backers.Our strategy now is to raise just enough for the initial deposit for the manufacturing to kickstart the process. This is our immediate challenge, and the reason we are in kickstarter. We are very thankful for your support, and we appreciate all the backers’ support to help us make our idea a reality and share our excitement towards jetblack.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts,Alan, SK & RyanCo-founders - YYPLAY_______________________________________________________FAA?

As shown in the video, we have a completely functional prototype. The challenge here is to make more of them through a manufacturing process and ensuring they are identical in term of quality and reliability.

Here are the challenges that the team think we are up against:
-  Injection molding process. It costs a fair amount to set a mold for the process. 
- Procuring parts based on the BOM, and ensuring every single piece is reliable for delivery
- We have more testing to be done. Like more flight hours, more different environment (windy, cold just to list a few). Especially since we are shipping globally, we hope it will work in all the environment it is shipped to.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 89 or more\n\nAbout US$ 64\n\n\n\nFirst Officer （CHEAPER SHIPPING)\n\n\nOne JETBLACK\n\nEARLY PRICING WITH REVISED SHIPPING (Same as #1 option with HALF the shipping cost)\n\nThank you for your support.

Earlier this year, we brought our 4th generation artisan partner, Kushiram, down to Singapore to conduct blockprinting workshops at the National Gallery.

You spend so much money (You do know that those  bras can buy you a concert experience that lasts a lifetime) only to have those wires stick out to your skin. Everything is black, white, or beige - like, there is a reason movies are in colour now. Oh, and what about those days where you are offered lingerie that can pass of as your grandma’s? Ok stop. Not another dull day or dull stuff. Sugarplum Lingerie is a Singapore-based e-commerce startup with a mission to provide comfort in the most expressive way we know. Our bras and panties are designed with you in mind. No boring basics and overly sensual pieces here. A little spoiler? Constellations. Decadent sweets. Your dream island escape. Don’t worry, it’s going to be insta-worthy. 





We believe that shopping for intimates should not be a vexing activity, but a fun one. But not everything exciting has to harm others. The materials we use are organic cotton and environmentally-friendly elastane, because we owe nature at least that much. The finished product is not only sustainable, but also soft & comfortable to wear. To put this project into full force, we would need your support. The brand will only launch once our target is covered :) Inspiration Board


Moodboard of Sugarplum Lingerie's concept.





Boy, where do we start? It’s based on our true stories. How friends would talk about what their horoscopes say about an ideal partner. A Korean song written based on one of my favourite books. Photos curated for the ‘gram. Cult favourite brands beloved by the global audience. A sketch I made after a biology exam that led me to fashion school. Really, it’s pretty much infinite. The Debut CollectionEntitled Paradise Kiss, the debut collection features 3 bra models: Honeydew (Push-Up), Smooch (Seamless), and Bounce (Sports). The last two models won’t come with underwire for your wearing pleasure. Panties will be available in 3 models: Hipster, Bikini, and Boyshort. We created the collection based on the question “What would young women would be comfortable of wearing? What models would fit into their lifestyle well?” As we are (hyperly) active individuals leading dynamic lives, we put fit & comfort into top priority. The designs based on wishful vacations and dreamy escapes with a Tumblr aesthetic spin.On Sizing & FitWe understand that size is a major concern when you are shopping online, especially for something as fit-sensitive as lingerie! That’s why our website will feature a size calculator, where you can input your measurements in. In the coming period, we will have a virtual mannequin that you can use to mix and match models with each other or with your skin tone. Or if you’re short on time, you can always opt on the size you would go for, since our sizing system complies to the international industry standard.","The project is only in its conceptualisation stages, therefore subject to a various degree of risks and challenges. Due to the unique nature of our business, production only commenced for sample pieces. Only when the project is tested and approved in the market would we start mass production.

✧ My DREAMCATCHER ✧ Enamel Pins













Hi Everyone!I’m Thaddeus, an artist from Asia. Welcome to my first Kickstarter campaign! I'm so excited on this campaign and I need your help to make it come true!MY DREAMCATCHER is a series of large enamel pins and the concept behind it stemmed from an inspiration borne out of two elements: Animal Guardian Spirit & DreamCatcher. Animal Guardian Spirit was conceptualized from the belief that deep down, everyone has their unique character and the personality that they dream of emulating. I made use of different animals to represent individual character/role in our heart as a guardian spirit to lead us through. The second element, DreamCatcher it originated from the Native America. It’s believed that DreamCatcher helps to chase away negative dreams and attract positive ones.
I artistically combine these two deeply significant elements into one piece of modern geometry art to create different personalities that each user can relate with. For instance, one of my wolf pin design was named The Pathfinder DreamCatcher because wolf signifies courage, leadership, determination and perseverance while the DreamCatcher inspires people be brave in the pursuit of their true inner dreams and aspirations.   No matter what your character is, we've got something for everybody. What’s your personality? Are you a challenger? Go for Bear Pin. The Pathfinder with great courage? Try the Wolf Pin. Are you a Visionary? Nothing suits you like the Eagle Pin! Or you want something unique and exclusive? An Enchantress pin is your perfect fit! 

The choice is yours, Dream Catchers!
Please help me spread the word to your friends! Many Thanks!http://kck.st/2E2XpCA

70% of the total goal will be for production of the 100 of each pin, the remaining cost will go to shipping supplies, fees, backing cards, and extras.","I’m working with an experienced pin company that authorization from Disney, Universal Studio, Starbucks and other famous brands as well. I have a lot of confident on them and believe they will come out with superior quality for my pins.

I worked very hard to make sure everything was calculated and thought but as common with international shipping, there can be delays due to weather conditions, customs or some delay due to manufacturing errors that beyond my control. 

All the pins above are final designs, but there can be some small difference made due to the process of pin manufacturing. All the colors are chosen from Pantone chart to minimize the unnecessary errors but small changes in color still can be possible due to every screens accuracy may vary.

However, I will do my best and keep all backers the latest update.

Our forefathers came to Singapore early last century in seek of a better life, while the rest stayed in the tea plantations to continue the family trade of planting and crafting Iron Goddess Tea.

Decades and generations passed, but the tea business continues to this day. 


Our tea master picking the right tea leaves.





Tea Descendants was born out of a family trip to trace our ancestral roots back in the He Mei Village, Anxi, China. The Anxi county, south of the Fujian province, is best known for a number of varieties of the Oolong tea, the most revered among them is the Iron Goddess Tea due to its immense health benefits: high content of amino acids, vitamins and antioxidants; weight loss properties, etc. 


A bird's-eyed view of the village.





 Our village is a charming maze of Iron Goddess tea plantations. Every turn is greeted with a whiff of chlorophyll and a picturesque greenscape. The Iron Goddess tea we tasted is piping hot from harvest oozing with dew-coated freshness, much unlike the overly-processed and baked black-tea variety that we are often served in our usual Chinese restaurants. This finding inspired the birth Tea Descendants: a vision to preserve the tea-making heritage created by our ancestors and fashion it into a modern-day brand to promote tea culture. The tea Through the generations, the village produces only 1 type of tea – Iron Goddess Tea. The taste and scent varies depending on climate, seasons, method of processing and storage. 

The tea-making process is complex and generally the tea producers will keep a tight lip of their method of processing. 


A tea bud under the sun.





Our family member has inherited and perfected the tea-making art over the last 30 years. He needs to judge the conditions of the plant and soil, sunlight and water, temperature and oxidation process plus many other variables to produce a tea that tickles the taste buds and satiate the senses. 

Our family has a few plots of tea garden that are about 350 metres above sea level. Though they are not on the highest mountain in Anxi, the clean air, temperature and soil conditions are beneficial towards producing high quality tea. 


Making tea is a delicate art.





Fresh Iron Goddess tea is pale yellow-green with a floral taste and aroma. The baked variety is darker, with a strong earthy rich aroma. If a premium batch of baked tea is kept well, it will aged finely over the years and considered a collectible among tea collectors. 

We have sent our tea leaves to Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) to test for presence of pesticides. The report concluded that there are no traces of pesticides. We have modernized and fashioned a traditional Chinese tea to suit the taste and lifestyle of younger, international drinkers. The tea caddy collection we designed consists of a pastel palette to diffentiate among the tea varieties. We are excited to share these tea caddies with you when you become a backer. 


Tea Descendants Collection.





Our plan: We want to preserve our family’s tea-making heritage and sharing the culture with a larger audience internationally. We seek your help in a number of ways.Through your pledges we will purchase tea leaves from the village and offer to you as a token of appreciation. 
Your pledge will help them upgrade their production facilities and building. 
Your pledge will allow us to produce marketing materials for our retail distribution to cafes in Singapore. 
Your pledge will support our plan to design and produce packaging materials for a gifting company that will act as a trader to distribute the tea. 
Your pledge will help us develop innovative products. We will work with Food Innovation and Resource Centre (FIRC), a joint initiative by Singapore Polytechnic and SPRING Singapore, to develop formulas for the Ready-to-drink market. 
Your support will also help the village's young education efforts, to buy books for the poor children. 

The fundsThe Kickstarter funding will help to finance activities that are in line with our vision. We will distribute and govern the funds objectively and prudently. With your support, we aim to raise S$12,000. 


Distribution of fund.





The timelineOur plan is huge but our resources are scarce. At the moment, this entire project and the follow-up activities is only managed and executed by 2 partners. We need to commute between China and Singapore (5.5 hours by plane) in the next few months to organize all the activities. 


Timeline of project.





Shipping limitationsWe wish to send everyone the rewards. You deserve it! However, due to logistics limitations, we are not able to deliver to Russia, India, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Brazil, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen and Chile. So please pardon us for missing you out on the rewards for now if you are from these countries. Please also note that all local import taxes and duties will be paid for by yourself. What tea bloggers said about us?First Sip Thought: “Garden in a cup.” by Lu Ann Pannunzio, The Tea Cup of Life.

 ""Vegetal notes of sugar snap peas faded into an intense orchid aroma. The mouth-feel was buttery and thick with no dryness or astringency. I lost track of the number of infusions but that alone should tell you that there was a lot of them."" by Nicole Martin, Tea For Me Please.

 The PartnershipThe idea for this project was conceived, brewed and managed by us. For over 20 years we provide brand and visual design services to corporations across different industries in Asia. Last year, we decided to pursue our dreams and took up the challenge to preserve our family's tea-making heritage before they are lost forever. We know that the road ahead will be bumpy but with your generous support and encouragement, we believe we can achieve our goals. We hope you can join our vision and take this first step with us. This small step can potentially become a big leap for the tea industry in our lifetime. Drink. Share. Give.

Thank you. 


Christopher and Sun Ne.","Our project is relatively low in risk. We will do our very best to fulfill our objectives and if you can contribute any ideas or connect us to the right stakeholders, the chances of our success will be even higher. 

Due to our budget constraints, we did not hire a professional research company to understand the needs and perception of consumer. We plan to launch our product in friends' and acquaintances cafes at the start to study market acceptance. We will need more investment in future to reach out to a larger market. We will update you. 

The raised fund might not be sufficient to engage Food Innovation and Resource Centre (FIRC) to innovate 3 products. We will seek Singapore Government agency, SPRING for grants if we need to. In the event that the shortfall is too great to meet FIRC consulting fee, we will notify and update you of our plan to re-channel the funds.

Pins specifications:Craft: soft enamelClutch: 2 black rubber claspsDimensions: 3.5 cm, except for San Junipero* All comes with a Black Mirror themed backing card! Since there are 19 episodes in total, I'm hoping to make these 5 designs first (the most popular and influencing episodes). If I manage to get enough funds for these, I will manufacture the others as well!Here's the details about them:


Nosedive





How perfect it will be when you can live in a luxury apartment by gaining a 4.5 rating; how freeing it will be when you can just be yourself without caring for other’s opinion. The insecure Lacie had the perfect experience and would like to share it with you. Would you please give her a good rating now?




San Junipero





A romantic spark between an introvert and an outgoing girl in the background of each other’s broken life. A simulation of our afterlife, San Junipero gave those marred by the cruel realities of life the courage to pursue what they truly want.




Shut Up and Dance





 Who’s the real victim here? A mysterious hacker who blackmailed Kenny to complete a series of events with other ‘victims’, or an online vigilante? This episode showed a twisted reflection of ‘reap what one has sown’. Careful, they're always watching.

Small talk is hard enough, and it’s even trickier to delve into deeper topics right off the bat. Icebreakers have been used to welcome and warm up conversations among people and enable them to comfortably interact with each other. 
However, most icebreakers can be socially risky, we don't want to reveal too much of ourselves when we've only met in the past 5-10 minutes. We want icebreakers that helps us feel comfortable and encourage us to open up at our own pace. 
Our team understands it can be challenging to identify and narrow down meaningful or interesting icebreakers from the gamut of icebreaker activities on the internet. 
We believe there is an opportunity for us to curate and create a card deck that blends fun and socialising into a single deck. 
That's why we created Sloosh Cards. 
What's Sloosh Cards ? 
Sloosh Cards is a different take on icebreakers that promises to make socialising and play meaningful yet fun. The entire deck has been curated and designed to elicit a 'rush' of energy and sensation when you're playing and socialising. 









So tell me about these cards....
Each Sloosh card deck contains 40 cards (15 blue + 15 red activity cards + 10 catalyst cards + 1 instruction booklet!)




A splash of colour to uplift and energise your socialising and play experience !





Our Red and Blue activity cards contains handpicked icebreaker activities that you can utilise in any group setting/function. These activities have been carefully curated and shortlisted after multiple rounds of testing and iterations with different people, and we're proud to present them to you today!




Front + Back of each red and blue activity cards 





The Blue Activity Cards contains warm-up icebreakers that helps 'break the ice' and kickstarts relationships among strangers and even friends!




Blue Activity Cards





The Red Activity Cards contains icebreakers that strive to break down barriers and dive deep, catalysing opportunities for deeper, meaningful conversations and relationships!




Red Activity Cards





Pen em' down
It wouldn't be fun if everyone is just verbalising what they have to say. We felt that the socialising and play experience should be interactive, and allow people to express themselves in different ways beyond verbal communication, so we decided to add our own twist to the traditional icebreaker activity : The Catalyst Card 




The Catalyst Card





The catalyst card is essentially a blank canvas for everyone to visually express their personal responses in words, drawings or doodles! The goal is to move away from merely just verbal communication, and enable a different mode of expression for everyone to share  their thoughts and stories with others. 









It's our hope that the personal responses written and/or drawn on the catalyst cards will become catalysts in sparking and eliciting conversations about the stories shared long after the activity has ended. 
Did we already mention the catalyst cards are made of an erasable surface for repeated use ?  

            

          

Just wipe away to use it again !
How to play :
It works in just three simple steps: 









1. Hand each player a catalyst card. (e.g. If there are 4 players, 4 catalyst cards will be drawn.) 
2. Select a red or blue activity card as the activity everyone will be playing. 
3. Let the game begin!
That's it! It's extremely simple and fun. 
Sloosh Cards in action : 
Though a seemingly easy idea, we went through multiple rounds of considerations. We looked at identifying meaningful activities that could catalyse socialising and play. The activities we eventually selected were vetted through multiple play-testing sessions with different users. Instructions of the different activities were proofread and tweaked to ensure easy understandability yet provided a fun experience and a good time for everyone. 

























About Sloosh Inc :









We are a team of passionate individuals who believe socialising and play go hand in hand with each other. Our team has worked tirelessly to curate and assemble a deck of icebreakers and activities that we ourselves will play with. 
What's the meaning of Sloosh ? 




Why Sloosh ? 





Like it's meaning, we believe socialising and play go hand in hand with each other, and we want to help you feel that 'rush' of energy and sensation when you're playing and socialising.
Inspired by the 'rush of water' and 'energy'. 
We decided to adopt the 'waves motif' on our cards. 
We wanted our interpretation of the waves to be joyful, energetic, fun, casual and approachable. We wanted to capture the emotion and translate it into graphics that expressed such qualities. 




Wave Patterns on Sloosh Cards

To ensure the quality of Sloosh Cards, we'll be working with Print Ninja as our printing provider.

We are here today to ask you to help us do this.
Like more than 120 million people worldwide, we are involved in fitness. Yes, in the gym we look great and we are comfortable in sportswear. But what to wear if we go to work, a business meetings or cultural events? And what to wear for those who prefer always looks stylish and neat?
The clothes that the mass market offers are not very suitable for a sports physique. If your shoulders and back are a little larger, your pectoral muscles are a little more massive, then it is not easy for you to find clothes that will fit well. Such people should buy something of a very large size so as not to feel constrained in their upper body, and as a result, the clothes look baggy and loose.
We realized that many people really lack clothing that would be elegant as classic and comfortable as sportswear.









The first product of our brand is a white men's shirt, which you see in these photos. But this is only the beginning.
We have many interesting ideas, and not only for men, and not only for people in fitness. Today we would like to make the clothes of the future. A product in which new technologies help us to take a fresh look at clothes and how we feel in them.
We do not just suggest you buy a shirt at a particularly favorable price. We suggest you give life to the whole direction of comfortable, beautiful and technologically advanced clothes for people of a new time and their lifestyle.









Technology for the production of clothing and fabrics has gone far ahead in recent decades. Modern high-tech materials can not only provide comfort due to elasticity, but also provide breathing for the body, moisture removal for evaporation, and much more.









We wondered why progressive fabrics are used only in sportswear. And we decided to use materials developed for sports to create beautiful and elegant clothes for people of modern times.









A beautiful and toned body will never be an extra complement to the intellect and wealth of a modern man, so more and more people are finding time for fitness. But sometimes intense athletic training leads to muscle pain. In such cases, clothing with a high level of comfort becomes necessary.









We did not focus too much on old trends. Our main goal was to create a comfortable and truly stylish shirt. We experimented a lot and came to the stand-up collar, instead of the classic collar, since it is the small collar that provides maximum comfort. We know how important neck comfort is for people who are under physical stress or stress at work and in business. And also this form of a collar emphasizes your individuality.









The 70th floor shirt has a special cut: a narrowed waist, a wide upper back and wider sleeves. The 70th floor shirt is designed for those who have something to show and almost nothing to hide. But do not worry, it will not completely fit the abdomen, so that a little fullness after eating will remain invisible. But the wide back, built by hard training, will feel absolutely free. '70th floor' shirt is an athletic elegance that all of us lacked.









Yes, modern fabrics can have a smooth structure while being breathable and elastic. But we decided to go a step further and used a special weaving fabric with holes in order to provide maximum breathing for the body. The holes in the shirt are created in a special way to remove moisture from the skin and evaporate it from the surface. And also such weaving of a fabric creates a unique appearance. This is the design of a new time.









For development and great achievements, we must optimize our time in order to keep up with everything. If there is a tight schedule for the day, then you definitely do not have time to iron shirts in the morning. The 70th floor shirt is surprisingly easy to clean. The shirt does not need to be ironed if you dry it on a hanger. Just drop it in the washing machine for 30 minutes in the evening, and then hang it on the hanger. Even if you live in a humid climate, in the morning it will be dry and smooth.











* The appearance of the product and material may differ from the image in the photographs.","Now that we have described the product and its advantages to you, we would like to make clear why we came to kickstarter.

Current market conditions are very harsh. Advertising budgets play a very important role in brand promotion. Therefore, it is difficult for small teams like ours to start moving in a competitive environment without a large budget.

We are not sure that we are ready for investments in the usual form, since we are still at the stage of building our unique identity, and we would like to maintain independence at this stage.

Therefore, we came to Kickstarter to appeal to you, to people who are ready to support fresh and bold projects.

Over the past half year, we have been fully focused on product development. This required considerable expenses for experiments and searches. Our main goal was to create a unique and expressive product that would be ahead of the products on the market. And it seems to us that we did it.

But now we need your help, since the first sales and the first steps are the most difficult.

We specifically set a quiet low funding goal, since we need only a little push to start moving. But we also hope that we will have a chance to exceed the established amount.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout $4\n\n\n\nFuture special conditions\n\n\nThanks for your support.

Hello, you! I am Chloe, a final year design student from a college in Singapore.
To be very frank, I struggled very hard to find my footing in this project. and was very demoralised when what I had envisioned during ideation became an extreme flop. After some twist & turn, and a couple (read: heaps) of curveball thrown my way, I would like you to meet Daius, my brainchild, and also Chubbyyco's first product.
Arguably, the first & last thing we see when we enter and leave the house is a doormat. Daius has reminders for you to look at when you leave the house, and has a message to comfort you when you are back.",I am still looking for a supplier for the perfect finish for Daius. We are in progress and won't stop till we do.,"[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout US$ 4\n\n\n\nBabysteps, together.\n\n\nYou will get a instagram dm/email from me to thank YOU personally.\nIncludes:\n\n\nInstagram dm/email from me to thank YOU\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 40 or more\n\nAbout US$ 29\n\n\n\nDaius\n\n\nYou'll own the best of three worlds, a doormat that reminds you, dries your feet and looks good!

360° full-perimeter expansion to increase the storage capacity by 50% from 20L liters to 30L liters, giving you full flexibility to carry more whenever you need!

Waterproof lining, your electronic devices and important items are well-protected from internal water bottle leakage and double-protected from external weather!

80cm to 140cm long.





80cm - 140cm adjustable nylon shoulder strap with 9"" x 2.5"" shoulder pad made of 1680D nylon (top) and comfortable foam padding (below), allowing any body shape and size to carry the bag across your body and keep both your hands free for other purposes. The pass-through hole on the shoulder pad is wide enough for the adjustment buckle to pass through easily.











Not one but two lockable YKK zippers for both the Main (center) and Gadget (back) compartments.  Both your main contents and electronic devices can be safely locked when necessary.











No matter empty or fully loaded, this bag will stand upright by itself, looking smart and sturdy.  No more worry on the bag falling side way when you leave it on a desk or floor.






FRONT QUICK ACCESS POCKET

OUR JOURNEY






Stay stylish and professional everywhere you go!







Before we start to design this bag, we spend many months to research on the most sought after functions that users seek, the missing elements that users desire and the redundant features that users dislike. We want to avoid ""fanciful gadgets"" and ""cool features"" that have little purpose beyond mere ornamentation, worse often break down easily or cause inconveniences or limitation on daily usage.  We want to create the most functional bag that offers excellent functionality, top-notch quality and workmanship that last a long time.




11 prototypes made towards perfection!





After more than a year of hard work crafting 11 prototypes and spending hundreds of hours to perfect this bag, we are ready to launch it for real.  We want to craft the ultimate functional bag that will help you go everywhere and do everything in the most productive and organized manner!




Start every great day with the Infinity Messenger Bag!





If you love to make things happen and and can't wait to get up every morning to start a brand new adventure, the Infinity Messenger Bag by Edgyzo is the perfect bag for you!

INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING
Due to logistics viability and efficiency reasons, we can only ship to the following destinations listed below:
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom and United States.
If your location is not listed above, we suggest you find a freight forwarder or freight consolidator that specializes in shipping to your country.  If you need any clarification or assistance, feel free to contact us at hello@edgyzo.com.






SHIPPING POLICY
If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and the package returns to our fulfillment warehouse (either because you’re not there, wrong address was provided or you moved without telling us), it will be the backer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to re-ship the order.  When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package.






CUSTOMS & DUTIES
Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes and duties.  As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various taxes, duties, VAT and GST for each location through Kickstarter.  We will not be able to cover for these costs and would advise that you contact your local customs office if you are unsure of what these costs may be.","We know that unexpected delays could happen, but we're fully committed to ensuring all our backers will get the best product and on time.

We have already finalized most of the production and fulfillment details with our business partners even before we launch this campaign.  Once this campaign goes live, we can get the survey done and work with the manufacturing factory to order the raw materials and commence production very soon.

Production - There will always be some degree of uncertainty when it comes to crowdfunding because you are backing projects that are creating brand new products.  We are working with an established ISO9001 certified manufacturing factory which has have been making bags and travel products for more than 20 years (with >100,000 monthly output) so we are confident to meet the production output and projected timeline.   

Shipping - Shipping is another big challenge for a project like this because it is one of those few aspects that we do not directly control.  We work directly with a fulfillment company who has many years of experience in managing e-commerce fulfillment.  We do understand that if a problem does present itself, it is our duty to work with the fulfillment company to resolve the problem until you receive your bag so you will not be left hanging.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nEDGYZO Supporter\n\n\nThank you for your support to be part of the EDGYZO family!

(60 pages of Artist Grade 100% Cotton, watercolor paper) 
by Erwin lian & Bynd Artisan


The Story
Over the past 14 months or so, I have been traveling around the world and sketching... France, Germany, Spain, Italy, across Asia and the list continues to grow. The term ""sketch-hunter"", coined by Robert Henri, describes me best. I sketch almost daily, noting down everything from interesting people to the places I have visited. Whether it is in a moving subway cabin, a car, a bus or on a Tut-Tut, I sketch.
http://cherngzhi.tumblr.com/


me, my sketchbook and world travels












My passion has led me to try out numerous sketchbooks and I have tried using everything available in the market. With the need to perfect my watercolor sketches, I began to search for that perfect sketchbook. One that should be hardbound, compact, binds well, opens flat, and filled with  Artist Grade 100% cotton paper (makes it strong but pliable). Unfortunately, I couldn't find such a sketchbook out there... so, I decided to make one.








I went on and searched for quality sketchbooks manufacturers and discovered Bynd Artisan®; a premium leather and paper label in Singapore. The people behind this brand have been in the book-making business for more than 70 years, and were very receptive of my ideas on a sketchbook. They agreed to collaborate on this project, and their sincerity & earnestness to create the Perfect Sketchbook moved me beyond words.
The Perfect Sketchbook is a top-of-the-line sketchbook made with quality materials sourced from around the world.

photography by Erwin Lian













The ability to assess + establish correct values are two of the most important skills required in painting. Chroma inherits values and this is why many painters will first complete an under-painting (with only values) before applying chroma. Having a value chart with you, allows for you to place it against the subject to properly assess values.







Most artists hold their sketchbook in a certain way to keep it flat. The value chart was designed for ease of use for both left- and right-handed Artists. So if you are a left holder, you may flip to the left for the value chart and if you are a right holder, you may flip to the right for it. While this could be more user-friendly with a portrait- format book. The decision for a landscape-format was strictly based off reliable data which informs us that users who use a book of this size would prefer the landscape-format. Of course, given a chance in the future, I will release a series of different sizes and formats


Locating the right value with a value chart













You may be able to upgrade the existing value chart by punching holes on each step. As seen in the image above, I managed to pick the right value for the grass by hovering my value chart over it. Squinting your eyes helps a little with the assessment process. However, this would entail that your sketchbook be less aesthetically pleasing, and this is why The Perfect Sketchbook that you will receive will not come with these punched holes.







___________________________________________________________
GRAIN DIRECTION IN PAPER.

The Perfect Sketchbook requires up to 3 full sheets of watercolor paper. Why so many for such a small book?
Well, that’s due to proper grain direction. 
 Why paper grain is important?
If the grain is wrong, many undesirable things will happen:
1) The book will not open very well. 
2) The paper will crease and buckle 
(due to paper expansion) 3) Stress is put on the stitching and could even break it; An illustration to the utilization of paper with proper grain direction:







As there would be more paper wastage when we consider grain direction,  I am working on possibly re-cutting the waste to create paper swatches that can be inserted into The Perfect Sketchbook's inner pocket. The Artist can make use of these inserts to test their colors prior to actual application. This suggestion has yet been finalized, and I will keep everyone updated.







Many sketchbook-makers may not consider the grain direction in order to reduce cost of production. However, this will result in poor quality.


















                                                         

Please note that Singapore-based backers will also enjoy the free shipping offered to America-based backers. Simply back the reward at the amount without international shipping charges. Free shipment is ONLY for Singapore and U.S. based backers. Thank You

Me, sketching in the kingdom of Bhutan





My name is Erwin and I am an Artist from Singapore. I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Time-Based Media
Studies from the Columbus College of Art (2004) and completed my Master of Arts
in Design Development from The Ohio State University (2009).  I lecture at the Film Media Studies department in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore.

I travel extensively with my sketchbooks, recording the visages of the people who I meet, places I have been to and cultures that I have personally experienced. Through my craft, I hope to inspire and share the peace and joy I feel whenever I create and paint.I painted all the paintings,shot all the photographs and did part of the computer animation featured in this kick starter
project. The entire project was completed by me and two students, Jason Yong and Jacon Lim from DVFX, Ngee Ann Polytechnic

(www.cherngzhi.com)BYND ARTISTAN | Partner & Manufacturer







The Goy Liang Book-Making Company had its first true home in 1945 when it was set up in a little shop house along Mohamed Sultan Road. It was a family-run business that served a genuine need and it gradually grew beyond the boundaries of Singapore and Malaysia.
Through the intervening years, the business of book-binding has moved inexorably with the progress of technology. Yet at its heart, each and every book had its beginning much like in the days of old - hand-designed and prototyped by a small band of craftsmen who grew up in the trade.Bynd Artisan was conceptualized to celebrate the joy of traditional paper and leather making.  Bynd Artisan hopes to write its own history through the remarkable output of Singapore’s greatest practicing craftsmen.

The Company has manufacturing facilities both in Singapore & Malaysia.

Estimated Time Schedule










The thicker the arrow = more funds goes there






This really is a project derived through an impulse based on personal need. Due to the requirement of new materials that was unavailable at the manufacturer, the cost of materials would be very high if I only made enough for personal consumption, so I decided to open up the availability of this pet project so that supporters may enjoy the same high quality that I personally demand while driving costs down for all of us. Kindly note that funds are subjected to 5% commission from Kickstarter and 5% from Amazon for credit card transaction fees. I have made most of the graphics and shot the photographs myself. The computer animation was completed with help from two students of mine (Jason & Jacob) and a stipend was paid to them.","Risk: 
1)Since this book is constructed with quality materials from all over the world, shipment may run into delays. Prices and availability of raw materials may also fluctuate. We have cushioned our budget with a modest amount to account for such events. In the event that raw materials have to be replaced, I will update everyone accordingly (very unlikely).

Wake up, brush teeth, morning routine, wardrobe selection. Squashed up blouse vs unintentionally shrunken sweater. Inward groan. Decisions, decisions. Life shouldn't be so hard, right?


Exactly.


So we've developed your ultimate wardrobe hack. With the combined efforts of leading design experts from Singapore and New York, sourcing GOTS and Fairtrade-certified fibres, we created the ultimate Organic Mock Neck T-Shirt. Yes, a T Shirt.









It's essential, it's reliable, and the backbones to your closet.









#1 Made with 100% Organic Cotton - soft to touch, gentle on the environment.









#2 Certified Environmentally Friendly Dyes - all of the colours, none of the nasties.









#3 Ultra Comfortable - the next best thing to wearing nothing, but elevated.











#4 Designed for a Relaxed Fit - When They Go Low, We Go Comfy.









































Not to flex, but LW001 is made from 100% certified Organic Cotton by the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), grown by sustainable farms in India.









When you choose Organic Cotton, you're not just making an environmental impact, you're making a humanitarian one as well — you make a world of difference to livelihoods.











Growing organic cotton keeps farmers and their families away from toxic chemicals in the field, or through their food and water supply. It also sustains their livelihoods — farmers can grow more than one crop, which increases their food and income.



















The dyes we use are certified — meaning they are non-toxic and contain ZERO harmful chemicals. Our dyes also use less water and undergo treatment processes that recycle waste water, reducing the toxic impact of effluent generation, while promoting reduced water consumption. Our colours are bright, toxic-free and better for our Planet's future.









Co-designed in Singapore and New York, we collaborated with a leading technical designer with over 16 years of international industry experience. After months of tweaking and finessing, we finally landed on the perfect Relaxed Fit T-shirt that would fit all.









Not ""all"" as in 'one size fits all' — but actual, living, breathing human bodies of all shapes and sizes. We used over hundreds of body scans in our 3D designing process. Obsessed? You bet.









Our clothes will fit your body — not the other way around.









You know that feeling? The feeling when you referred to a size chart to make a purchase, and when you try it on after it arrives — it's totally off the *charts* (lol).
That was the problem we faced as online shoppers ourselves. What's the problem? 


 Most Size Charts are created after the clothing is designed — that literally means you are fitting into the clothes, and not the other way around. Hello? Reality check: the clothes are supposed to fit you. 


We know everyone is different, and each of us has a preferred fit. Some of us like it snugger, some prefer it nicely fitted... Others, perhaps, a bit more relaxed and oversized.
That's not an issue.


We've redefined Size Charts — elevating it into an art. But backed by data. For you, for effortless living.


How?



















We created our body forms before we started designing our clothes. Using our understanding of how the body changes, depending on age and gender, alongside with data from over 6000 virtual bodies and multiple sizing studies done around the world, we've created our own brand specific bodies forms, designed specially for Livingwear's vision to making our clothes fit a range of body shapes well.



















We designed the process from ground-up, in order to make sure that our clothes fit the way they were intended to, celebrating and loving differences in human bodies — not in spite of.









The details matter — our creative director measured every seam, angle, nook and cranny, together with our New York-based technical design consultant to ensure that each piece is cut as humanly close to perfect for our entire size range — from 2XS to 2XL. 



















Lastly, we've tested our size charts on real people to make sure that they work — for all genders. The results? A 92% accuracy based on the testers' individual fit preferences.
Still hesitant about finding your ideal fit? No worries — speak to us via DM and we're more than happy to help!

























We spun it tightly and densely, creating a mechanical knit that is much more durable than regular T-Shirts. Our T-Shirts won't bail on you — wear it yesterday, today, and tomorrow — it's going to look brand new.



















By using a heavier weight and tightly-knitted fabric, our T-Shirt will wrinkle less, naturally, after washing and drying — with no extra chemical finishing. Just pop on this trend-resistant staple and you're good to go!





















Organic Cotton is one of the better natural fabrics that allows air to pass through easily— allowing your skin to breathe and regulate moisture.


 Super Soft because your comfort is our priority 











Organic Cotton is known to be softer than conventional cotton due to it being grown organically. It is also OEKO-TEX100 certified, meaning there are no harmful chemicals or residues, so it's better and milder for our skin.

-----","This isn't our 1st project. When we launched our first Kickstarter in 2019, we delivered all products to our backers— even compensating missing packages on us, because we are committed to creating a company with great customer service at its core. Our customers appreciate the openness, transparency, and accessibility that comes with purchasing each Livingwear product. 

When this campaign ends, we are confident to deliver it to you by Mid-June for the first batch and August for the second batch.

Because of that, we will go with a *first backed, first delivered* policy for this campaign. 

Please take note in the event that we are oversold on a particular size and color, our 2nd batch of LW001- Organic Mock Neck T-Shirt will arrive in August, alongside our next 2 capsule items (LW002 & LW003) in our following KS Campaign.

WE AIM TO PLEASE > 

You can be assured that we are fully committed to delivering these products to you. We're proud to say that over the years, we have not received feedback on unsatisfied backers or customers- any error on our part has consistently been resolved promptly with utmost care and quality service. 

*If you're a backer slated to receive our 2nd batch of delivery, and have also backed our next campaign (LW002 and LW003)—you will receive both together.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, please take note that there may be delivery delays worldwide for packages. In the event of a delay, fear not! We will resolve it for you. All we ask for is a little bit of patience. To illustrate an example— we've experienced cases where packages have been held in transit customs for 14 days before getting shipped out successfully to the destination country.

""Then the omnipotent Father with his thunder made Olympus tremble, and from Ossa hurled Pelion."" 
-Ovid


Welcome to Mount Olympus, where the Gods of Ancient Greece resides. I am Magnus, a humble artisan who works on enamel pins to glorify the Gods. I see that you are here to acquire some pins. If you are searching for additional pins or good luck charms, you may browse my Instagram by clicking here.











I've included EARLY BIRD reward tiers for early backers.
Each EARLY BIRD tier has a limited discount available for the first SIX backers who pledge that tier,  so pledge ASAP to secure your spot and get your rewards at a discount. 


Designs will be unlocked as the campaign progresses and a funding milestone is hit. That is because the Gods require more offerings from us to satiate our devotion to them (Well.. the real reason is to get more funds to pay the pin manufacturer).


But don't fret, you won't be choosing your designs until the campaign is over, so by pledging now, you'll help push the goal forward to unlock the designs you want!













The pin designs are based on the theme of ancient Greek mural and pottery. 




Ancient Greek Painting               





Every rounded gold-plated hard enamel pins comes with an elegant Olympian design backing card. The size of the pins are 1.5"" X 1.5"" (3.8cm X 3.8cm).


































































Most of the funds will go towards:
◈ Production and delivery of the pins
◈ Shipping
◈ 10% Kickstarter fees
◈ Taxes











Please note the timeline below is just an estimation.
◈ Early December: Kickstarter starts! (29 days campaign) 
◈ Early January: Kickstarter ends and surveys are sent out shortly after 
◈ Early February: Funds are collected and production begins 
◈ Early March: Pins arrive
◈ Early April: Shipping begins











It is hard to predict when the pins will arrive to your doorstep due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The pin industry is currently experiencing lots of slowdowns related to power shortages, high demand, and shipping delays. So expect your pins in mid 2022 (from May onwards).


Once the pins have arrived, each pin will be inspected, packed and shipped out. Given the current unpredictability of shipping, please allow:
◈ 3-5 weeks


(Note: Please be aware that you may be responsible for additional import taxes prior to delivery.  UK and EU backers may be charged with additional VAT tax.)


If you have any questions regarding your order, please feel free to contact me via Kickstarter or by email at magnusarts79@gmail.com.











◈ I don't have a credit card/missed the Kickstarter, how can I buy these pins?
After the Kickstarter campaign is being fulfilled and after I have shipped to all the Kickstarter backers, what stock I have left over will also be for sale.
You can PM me on my Instagram. I also intend to setup an Etsy account to sell the remaining pins.


◈ My favorite character isn't unlocked, should I wait?
Please consider pledging early to help unlock new designs! All pledges are valid for all items from launch, regardless of their status at the time of the pledge. If it doesn't seem like the funds will reach the amount needed to unlock the design you want then you can cancel or change your pledge at any point during the campaign.


◈ Why is this project called Part 1? Where is the rest of the twelve Olympians?
Part 2 is dependent on the success of Part 1. I want to break the pins into two parts to allow for sufficient funding for the first six pins before designing the rest of the twelve Olympians. So please help me to fulfill my dream on producing all twelve Olympians and more Greek gods.","After this Kickstarter campaign has ended and the supplier has sent me the pins, I will do my best to send out the pins as soon as possible. However there might be a few problems and issues along the way, in which case please contact me and I will do my best to solve them. 

Also, as mentioned previously, manufacturing and shipping times are unpredictable and may lead to unforeseen delays.

(Note - There may be minor differences in the actual pin vs what you see on the screen due to hand enamel filled precision, color matching.)","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 19 or more\n\nAbout $14\n\n\n\n1XPin\n\n\nONE hard enamel pin of the Greek God of your choice from the unlocked options.\nIncludes:\n\n\n1×Hard Enamel Pin (1.5\"") of your choice\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 36 or more\n\nAbout $26\n\n\n\n2XPins\n\n\nTWO hard enamel pins of the Greek Gods of your choice from the unlocked options.\nIncludes:\n\n\n2×\nHard enamel pins (1.5\"") of your choice\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 43 or more\n\nAbout $31\n\n\n\nEARLY BIRD - 3XPins\n\n\nTHREE hard enamel pins of the Greek Gods of your choice from the unlocked options.\nIncludes:\n\n\n3×\nHard enamel pins (1.5\"") of your choice\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (2 left of 6)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 49 or more\n\nAbout $36\n\n\n\n3XPins\n\n\nTHREE hard enamel pins of the Greek Gods of your choice from the unlocked options.\nIncludes:\n\n\n3×\nHard enamel pins (1.5\"") of your choice\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 95 or more\n\nAbout $68\n\n\n\n6XPins (FULL SET)\n\n\nSIX hard enamel pins of the Greek Gods (FULL SET).\nIncludes:\n\n\n6×\nHard enamel pins (1.5\"") ~ FULL SET\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 16 or more\n\nAbout $12\n\n\n\nEARLY BIRD - 1XPin\n\n\nONE hard enamel pin of the Greek God of your choice from the unlocked options.\nIncludes:\n\n\n1×Hard Enamel Pin (1.5\"") of your choice\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n6 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 30 or more\n\nAbout $22\n\n\n\nEARLY BIRD - 2XPins\n\n\nTWO hard enamel pins of the Greek Gods of your choice from the unlocked options.\nIncludes:\n\n\n2×\nHard enamel pins (1.5\"") of your choice\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n6 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 81 or more\n\nAbout $58\n\n\n\nEARLY BIRD - 6XPins (FULL SET)\n\n\nSIX hard enamel pins of the Greek Gods (FULL SET).\nIncludes:\n\n\n6×\nHard enamel pins (1.5\"") ~ FULL SET\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n6 backers""}]",9.0,2

Swrl is the answer to that. It is able to function as a display and can be converted o a cat toy and back with ease. It is essentially a roly poly, taking a lot of effort to make it tumble and with its movement once hit, it will surely entertain your cat for hours.







  Having cat toys means that when guest are around, you have to find somewhere to hid the toys and it can be quite troublesome. Furthermore, having a cat toy that is able to keep a cat interested for hours was important since everyone may not have the time to always entertain their cat. Thus this was what inspired Swrl, a cat toy that was able to fulfill both the needs and wants of the pet and the owner.







   Swrl is made with a concrete bottom making each piece unique from the rest with different patterns resulted from the pouring process without compromising the durability or the functionality of it. Besides the base, the top section is made from 3D printed acrylic ensuring that the material is not only light but also durable, able to take any blows from your furry companion. 
  We also did not forget about you, Aside from the concrete base, the colors are yours to decide, with the ability to select from multiple colors, you can have Swrl fit perfectly into your household no matter what style you have.","Due to the weight of each piece, transportation is estimated to be quite costly. Furthermore the construction of Swrl is based of multiple components with different manufacturing for each and especially during Covid 19 there will be some delays.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout $36\n\n\n\nadditional cat toy\n\n\nGet a unique cat toy to add to your collection\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJun 2021\n\n\nShips to\nOnly Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (18 left of 20)""}]",0.0,0

Based on the famous saying of Steve Jobs to each and everyone of us on living with a sense of purpose, The Dentmakers deck featuring 52 prominent characters in Tech/Startup. 
52 cards are 52 different characters. They're geeks, tinkerers, founders, investors, CEOs, etc. They come in all shapes and sizes, from all walks of life, but the things that they have in common are working hard and dreaming big. 
They're the ones who have put a dent in this universe, the ones who made the future different from the past. We humbly call all of them as The Dentmakers.
This deck is a tribute to them, to celebrate the dreams they have brought to the world.  This is also a sort of inspirations for all dreamers out there who're gonna leave their own dents to this world.  









Each card in the deck represents a character in Tech with their signature quote 
This is the main difference as well as the most interesting feature of our deck compared to any other deck out there. 
Most decks only focus special designs and distinctive illustrations on A, J, Q, K cards while every single one card in The Dentmakers deck is special and unique.  
With 52 unique characters, the Dentmakers deck contains a roller coaster ride of emotions. Funny, witty, inspiring, encouraging, serious, harsh truth , insightful quotes, we have it all.

Whoever you are, whatever you’re working on, there will be dark days 🌘, there will be time when everything goes south 🌩. It’s when you pick a Dentmakers card, read it and just keep on moving 🏇

 

 That’s what the Dentmakers deck is all about, 🎲 in poker or in life, we cannot change the cards we are dealt, but we can always choose how to play them!. Let’s play them with dignity, passions and relentlessness 🙌

Therefore, we've poured all of our hearts into this deck, we hope it could serve as a daily dose of inspiration and determination for anyone out there who are working hard and dreaming big dreams. 









 Thank you so much for reading all of this, we got some final words to you guys.
We gotta be honest, it takes a hell lot of work to run a Kickstarter project. We started out thinking that this side-project would only take 1-2 months maximum to finish, give us some cash to continue our startup dreams. But it took us 5 months so far. OMG. 
I remember many late nights researching about all these terms from Embossing to Air Cushion to a million kinds of stock paper.  Well, sometimes, in the middle of the night, staring at the screen, I wondered if what the heck am I doing? this is like learning rocket science for a newbie like me :(
But the more time we spent on this, the more something dawned on us. We realize that this project itself is something, it's not just a side-project, it's bigger than that.
We used Wix built a landing page to introduce the deck prelaunch. The thing is that Wix has a function to notify you when someone visit the website and where they come from. I don't know how to describe it but I'll never forget the feeling after waking up from a short nap, checking my phone, and saw this list of notification. 

            

          

OMG, people all over the world are checking it. The prospect of delivering something meaningful that you made to people around the globe is just exhilarating.  
These little Wix notifications and Instagram followers kept us pushing forward. Fortunately, everything gradually fell into place. 
Finally,  we wish you all the best in what you're working on, no matter what it is.  Like this project, great things take time, just ignore the naysayers and keep on moving guys, keep bringing positive vibes to world.
And most importantly, remember that the journey is the reward, enjoy it, just like how we enjoyed this project.

As consumers are increasingly being environment conscious, ethical shopping is in vogue worldwide, this catches on in Singapore as well, hence, it sees an opportunity.     The tote bags are made by cotton and banana fibers which are practical and sustainable with floral embroideries. The tote bags are presenting in an A4 and an A3 size that both are easy-carrying. Ladies could carry this comfortable tote bag to any informal occasions which makes their life easeful, simultaneously, they are doing good to the society as making use of banana fiber helps to protect the environment.     The products are going to be sold in the lifestyle boutique, Monoyono in Singapura Plaza where is bustling every day.      The following image shows the big idea of my tote bags as they are in the process of manufacturing at present. Aside from that, embroideries are going to be sewn on one side of the surfaces.","Risks:
- The price for banana fibers may not be cost-efficient due to the difficulties of manufacturing into fabrics.
- The transportation process sometimes could take a comparatively long time while shipping from China to Singapore.

Challenges:
- Negotiating the price for banana fiber is quite challenging as banana fiber is not very cost-effective material comparing to many others fabrics.
- There are several times of revision on manufacturing at the beginning once the outcomes do not end up with a good quality. This process takes a lot of times to revise the prototypes and discuss with the manufacturers.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 20 or more\n\nAbout US$ 15\n\n\n\nMini Embroidered Jewelry Bag\n\n\nA mini jewelry bag with embroidered patterns are the payback for the backers who donate more than S$20 and live in Singapore.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\nShips to\nOnly Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""}]",0.0,0

Hi friends! My name's Jamie and I'm the owner of Amorettes Story.


This is my 9th Kickstarter and I would like to introduce my lovely little head, 'Dairy Friends'! This project features my take on a variety of our milky friends with a little flavor thrown into the mix! The possibilities of different flavoured milk usually seen in groceries stores remained in a cuter and lovelier way in their raw forms! I hope that you'll enjoy my lovely dairy friends!


Pledging will help these pins get produced, and all additional stock will go into my online shop soon after the Kickstarter is over! By pledging, backers get a discounted price, as well as freebies!


Let's pledge and unlock your favorite Dairy Friends!










  Kickstarter operates via Pledge Now, Pay Later system. This means that Kickstarter will not charge you until the end of the campaign and only if our initial goal is funded.
  Pledges are entitled to modify their pledges (i.e. Edits/cancel) at any given point provided that it is made before the deadline of the pledging period.
  The pledges accumulated will initially unlock the starting goal, Milky Moo ($400) as well as many others on the own respective milestones, with additional designs/ variants or special gifts the more milestones this project unlocks.
  By pledging, you'll get your favorite Pins at a discounted rate with freebies and also with standard grade (Grade A) - any extras Pins will then be sold on my Online Store at a higher price in the future.
  During the end of the pledging period, you will automatically be sent a kickstarter survey that asks inquire about your shipping details i.e. Delivery address, and which pin(s) you would like to receive. Please not that colors may slightly vary from monitor to monitor.









































My Dairy Friends will all be made as Hard Enamel Pins, each with a classical metal plating in colour Gold. Size will vary between 1.25 inch to 1.35 inch depending on designs. There are countless uses for pins such as accessories for clothing, collections, gifts and many more! We're aiming for the unlock or all our Dairy Friends and with that, bring about more hidden goodies! You will be eligible to pick any of the unlocked pins after the pledging campaign through a survey which will be sent to your e-mail!


Sticker packs are separated into 2 different version and consist of 10 different designs of each packs. Sticker size will be about 5cm and in sparkle holographic lamination. 
Every backer who pledged for 10 pins and above will also receive a sticker sheet consisted of 20 designs for free. 


(Do not hesitate to contact me via message through kickstarter or social media!)
I´m very active on Instagram and you can follow me for more information and updates!


Pledge Now, Pay Later! This means that Kickstarter will not charge you until the end of the campaign and only if our initial goal is funded. This helps to unlock the alternate designs as shown as stretch goals too!


When the project ends, you will automatically be sent a Kickstarter survey that asks for your delivery address, and which pin(s) you would like. Please note that colors may slightly vary from monitor to monitor.









 June: The campaign runs.


July-August: The campaign ends, all pledges are collected/cards are charged, and I will get the backer reward surveys set up and sent out.


August-September: It takes about 2 weeks for Kickstarter to release the funds raised to me. Once I get the funds, production shall commence! Production should take around 2-3 weeks with about a week of transit time for the pins to arrive to me after being shipped out.


September-October: Pins arrive! I will quality check and review everything before starting to pack up rewards and send them to their new homes.


Ps. This is a tentative timeline. I have included buffer time for in-case there are production snags or any delays. I will update backers throughout the whole process on Kickstarter and Instagram.









 Due to global slowdowns as a result of the Covid-19 situation, international shipping will be expecting an additional 2-3 months delay in addition to the usual shipping time.


All shipment will be ordinarily shipped from Singapore using SingPost's Standard Shipping. We are will be providing registered mails for all pledges received. A tracking number will be provided with all pledges once the shipment is ready to be shipped. The update quality of the status for your tracking information is based solely on each individual country's postal services.


Please be informed that the shipping duration will be equal for all forms of mail. On average, packages may take up to approximately 4-6 weeks to reach their destination. However, in rare occasions packages may be delayed up to 3 months due to factors beyond my control such as delays at custom, high delivery load during festive seasons and many others.","Risks are always involved during the entire procedure to the final product. From the manufacturing errors to extended production and also shipping delays, there are many factors that needs to be taken into account when providing an accurate shipping time. For this reason, I have decided to allot an extra month for the completion of this project. I have been running kick-starter projects for two years running and had made multiple pin projects along the way! As such, I'm confident in my management capabilities in monitoring a smooth cycle through the experiences I gained along the way.

I'm currently anticipating the risks that could arise when dealing with the manufacturers. I'm doing my best to work closely with my designated manufacturers to reduce any chances of possible risks that might happen during the manufacturing period. You might experience a little variant in the colors as it varies from screen to screen. They may also look slightly different from the featured designed in accordance to their production. As most variants have minimal effect on the final product, it will not result in any changes to the overall aspects of the pins.

Therefore, with all the factors in mind, I would like to remind everyone that the time line may not be reliable due to the different factors out of my control which resulted in my decision to allot an extra month for the completion of this project.

Our Story  

We all owned a wallet. As wallet users, we have faced with the inflexibility in a wallet. Our need change from time to time. Sometime, we want to carry more things but our wallet cannot fit. And other time, we want to carry lesser things but we cannot remove the part that not in used. We wanted a minimalist wallet that is more distinctive in its function and help to organize better. This is when Qutton Wallet is designed. The Design The design of the wallet inspired from a binder book that allows flexibility to remove or add pages. It is designed to keep credit cards, business cards, bank notes, passport, coins and small items. The Cover (front and back) with RFID Blocking











The cover can be use to insert credit cards, business cards and bank notes. You can use the cover on its own or combine it with the sections.

Dimensions

 








 









RFID Blocking helps insulate you from a very particular brand of electronic pickpocketing.

Section 1: for credit cards, business cards and bank notes.








 Section 2: for credit cards, business cards and bank notes








 



Section 3: for coins, keys and small items








 




 Section 4: for bank notes (fit almost all bank notes)

with more colour options!





After our first successful project MONSTERA FOTEBAG, we are expanding our Monstera family.  We asked everyone from the last project to help fill up our backer's survey and the product in highest demand is a backpack! We gave a new spin to the ubiquitous backpack, we did thorough research on user experience and came up with something that is adaptable to any situation in your day!




Survey Result





Ladies and Gentlemen, LOOP DESIGN STUDIO proudly presents to you.
MONSTERA BEPACK.









Our New BePack is a slim bag but it's incredibly spacious inside, we designed it with loads of organisational compartments and smart features.


BePack comes in two different sizes: 13” and 16” and we are launching with four colour options: For the first time in our product range we will have the colour ""Lake"". Lake is a dark green colour that is subtle yet elegant, it is something very special and not easy to find in the market as a backpack option. We are launching Lake Green along with Mystery Black, Navy Blue and Dawn Maroon!









It is super lightweight, secure, slim, minimalist, and convenient as an everyday backpack.









FEATURES.

















The 16"" size has a dual compartment, which first two small items such as, External Hard disk / Powerbanks, etc. The 13"" size come with a single large compartment, which fits any iPad.

We are launching our new colour Lake Green! Alongside our signature Mystery Black, Navy Blue and Dawn Maroon on our lineup as they are the favourite colour of your choice for our fotebag Kickstarter project!




All four colours in 13"" or 16"" sizes





*Actual colours may vary. This is due to computer monitors displaying colours differently and everyone can see these colours differently. We try extremely hard to ensure our photos are as life-like as possible, but please understand the actual colour may vary slightly from your monitor.

We tested it. It works.









With high-quality material and workmanship, our BePack is built to last. Our stringent quality control includes a tensile test on the aluminum alloy hook, the maximum exerted force before failure is 77.072kgf. That's a lot of force before it breaks!
ENVIRONMENT.
BePack.BeBlue.









At Loop Design Studio it's in our DNA to take care of the environment. We carefully select components that are equally responsible to the environment where possible. For example, we selected Duraflex for our plastic components. Duraflex is one of the leaders in plastic components and they are part of the Bluesign System Partner. Our goal is to reduce the use of non-recyclable material as we grow.
Resource savings at Duraflex's factory since partnering with Bluesign:
1. Energy: over 60% reduction
2. Water: approximately 20% reduction
3. Waste: approximately 40% reduction

  (Data source: ""A PATH TO RESPONSIBLE TRIMS MANUFACTURING"" - 28. Nov 2019)





We use Bluesign system partner accessories

I am grateful if you share this project!","Upfront Development: 
The design and development work have been completed. Samples have been made, tested and approved. Our suppliers are ready for manufacture. Some of the components(like packaging, key rings and carabiners) have already been ordered. We are confident of making, packing and sending out your Keystones on time.

Delivery:
From our experience with our previous Kickstarter, shipping to certain countries like Brazil and Mexico have proved to be challenging. Even though there is tracking for all packages, there is still a chance that the local post offices of these countries will misplace or take a long time to deliver.
If you are from a country where your local post office is unreliable, please note this risk.

First come First served:
The Keystones will be delivered in batches.
If you pledged in an earlier batch, your Keystones will be delivered to you earlier.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge US$ 1 or more\n\nAbout US$ 1\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\nI hope you will consider trying out a Keystone.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge US$ 25 or more\n\nAbout US$ 25\n\n\n\nEarly Batch\n\nFree shipping worldwide\n\n- One Keystone of your choice \n\n(Red, Blue or Gold)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2015\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n158 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (42 left of 200)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge US$ 25 or more\n\nAbout US$ 25\n\n\n\nEarly Batch \n\nFree shipping Singapore/Malaysia\n\n- One Keystone of your choice \n\n(Red, Blue or Gold)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2015\n\n\nShips to\nOnly certain countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (14 left of 50)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge US$ 48 or more\n\nAbout US$ 48\n\n\n\nDouble Early Batch \n\nFree shipping worldwide\n\n- TWO Keystones of your choice \n\n(Red, Blue or Gold)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2015\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (57 left of 100)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge US$ 48 or more\n\nAbout US$ 48\n\n\n\nDouble Early Batch \n\nFree shipping Singapore/Malaysia\n\n- TWO Keystones of your choice \n\n(Red, Blue or Gold)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2015\n\n\nShips to\nOnly certain countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (9 left of 20)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge US$ 70 or more\n\nAbout US$ 70\n\n\n\nComplete Early Batch \n\nFree shipping worldwide\n\n- All Colored Keystones\n\n(Red, Blue and Gold)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2015\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (15 left of 30)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge US$ 70 or more\n\nAbout US$ 70\n\n\n\nComplete Second Batch \n\nFree shipping Singapore/Malaysia\n\n- All Colored Keystones\n\n(Red, Blue and Gold)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2015\n\n\nShips to\nOnly certain countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (10 left of 10)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge US$ 70 or more\n\nAbout US$ 70\n\n\n\nComplete Early Batch \n\nFree shipping Singapore/Malaysia\n\n- All Colored Keystones\n\n(Red, Blue and Gold)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2015\n\n\nShips to\nOnly certain countries\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n10 backers""}]",7.0,65

I was thinking why not make Teddy alive too? Always remember that this cannot happen with YOU. 
If the funding reaches S$6000 Teddy will be unlocked, which means at the end of the funding period I will send out a survey form to all the backers. Then you are able to add on Teddy for the cheapest rate to your current reward pledge. That will make your final bill.









Hi pals! If you're feeling new to backing a Kickstarter project, let Raybie explains why you should definitely pledge here:

  By supporting this project, you're able to adopt Raybie FOR REAL! This whole crazy cottagecore inspired pals can slowly come into life. Also, this is the lowest adoption cost you can get and it comes with some hidden surprises. 
  By backing now, you will not be charged until this project is successfully funded. You may also make changes to it before the end of the funding period.
  This project has gone through hours of designing, creating, liaising stage to make it happened. It is not a buy-sell product. Thus, it is unique to this brand only. 
  Your support is a strong affirmation to us to keep it going. We thank you first.










To local Backers in Singapore :

  To minimize the risk of lost parcels, Raybie wishes to have postal tracking while she is on her way to her new home. All parcels will have a special tracking number. 
  Please be reminded to double-check your details before submitting so that Raybie won't be confused looking for her new home.
  Estimated Shipping Time: 2-3 business days.

To Backers all around the globe: 

  To minimize the risk of lost parcels, Raybie wishes to have postal tracking while she is on her way to her new home. All parcels will have a special tracking number. 
  You might be required to pay tax/ VAT when Raybie arrives at your destination.
  Please be reminded to double-check your details before submitting so that Raybie won't be confused looking for her new home.
  Please contact us if you have not received your parcel for over 2 months. 

Shipping Cost:

  Singapore: S$5 
  Malaysia: S$7 
  The rest of the globe: S$15 (FOR ONE RAYBIE PLUSH), S$22 (FOR TWO PLUSHIES AND ABOVE)
   In the event of Teddy plush is unlocked, the shipping fee will remain the same as we will ship everything together. 











   3rd October 2021: Kickstarter is live and will last for 30 days only. 




   2nd November 2021: After Kickstarter ends, we will need to accumulate at least S$1600 to make Raybie's dream come true. In the event of if it's successfully funded, I will send out a survey to all the backers who backed this project! Also, during this time you are able to choose to add on items from all the unlocked stretch goals. Finally, you will also be charged for your pledge. 




   End of November 2021: Raybie in the making...




   Early January 2022: The army of Raybie will arrive at my place. If there's no flaw or adjustment they should be good to go to their forever home.




   Mid-Late January 2022: Packing and giving them my blessing before they depart to their new home.




   February-March 2022: Backers begin to receive Raybie as their forever friend.



*Please note that the timeline given above is just a rough estimation. It will be great if we can get everything sorts out earlier and on time. If not, we implore you to have patience because good things are definitely worth the wait. *

About UsMy name is Gulshan and i am the founder of Spectre Time.The word Spectre, which means ""Ghost"" or ""Presence"" when looked up in the dictionary, came about when i wanted my my watch to have a dark and mysterious feel with a strong presence felt on any wrist. This flows down to the design of the watch as well.I have always been amazed of timepiece movement especially automatic movements. The miniature size of the clockwork from the gears to the escapement to the turning of the hands was something i found very fascinating. My first Automatic watch was chinese made and i took it apart to study how everything worked and what was in it. When i bought my first swiss made watch, i was totally blown away by the precision and quality of the entire watch. I found out why it was worth paying the premium price for such a watch.It got me thinking and after a few years i told myself that i want to create my very own watch that had close to swiss standards but at a price not marked up by premium brands and i knew this was possible. I then started working on my watch which i envisioned. Before i knew it, the design was put into production and the response i received was outstanding. Heads were turning and people asked where i bought the watch from and how much it costs. This made me decide to start this campaign to offer people a watch of such stunning designs with a premium quality and feel at a price which was very attractive.The JourneyThe time taken to produce this protoype has been a long and arduous one. It was difficult to find a manufacturer that had the same amount of passion as me for producing timepieces as I require perfection. Countless changes and tweaks were made just to meet my expectations on quality and precision.
 With the CAD designs, sketches and prototype in hand i am ready to start production of the Phantom Series watches. The watches will be produced of different variants ranging from steel bracelets to quality leather bands and so on. Updates will be released regularly as this project is being backed.All i need now is your support to back me up and make this journey a successful one.

All 3 will feature an integrated bracelet as shown in the image below.There will also be leather band options available at an additional cost:

Hello! My name is Addigni and I'm an artist and a fan of MCU, among other things. After the success of my first MCU Pin kickstarter, I have received feedback about your interest in more MCU character pins. After conducting a survey, these are the 5 most requested characters: Black Panther, Shuri, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and More Bucky. So here they are! Additionally, Loki is also getting much more interest than I expected so here he is again, for even more Loki restocking!









Here are the plans for the pins. It will be made of iron or zinc (to be confirmed), gold coated, hard enamel, and with butterfly clutch back. 
Here are the designs!

















The Casual Bucky Pin will be unlocked if we exceed $5000 :)

















♥ ADD MORE PINS  — $15 per extra pin
You can add more pin to your reward. For each additional pin, you add S$15. You can add pins of the following design: Shuri, Black Panther, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Loki, Casual Bucky (if unlocked)
♥ Getting the other Pins — MY ETSY STORE
If you would like to have any other pins (Dr Strange, Thor, Ironman, Spiderman, Bucky&Rocket, Steve&Groot), you may purchase them separately from MY ETSY STORE. 
This is because the stock of the above stated pins are limited in stock and therefore I cannot provide it freely here since it will be very difficult for me to gauge if I have enough stock left or not. 
However, the following pins (Dr Strange, Thor, Ironman, Spiderman) are included in the final reward tier but that tier is limited to 5 backers only.

















♥ Once the Kickstarter ends, you'll be able to pick your pins from any of the following designs: Shuri, Black Panther, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Loki, Casual Bucky (if unlocked) - I'll send out different surveys for different tiers for everyone to fill out with their picks.
 ♥ With the exception of the last tier, every other reward tier allows you to pick multiples of the same design. Just specify it in your survey answers (e.g. 1 shuri, 2 black widow)
 ♥ You can edit your pledge at any time - you won't be charged until the Kickstarter ends. 
 ♥ Shipping costs for the pins are as follows: - Singapore: S$1 

     - Rest of the world (Tracking number provided) : S$9 - 14 (Rewards with more items will mean heavier packets, which means shipping cost will become more expensive)
♥ Rewards with A5 art print will get a print of either MCU Chibi II or MCU Chibi I, depending on the specifics stated for your tier reward.","Most frequent problem encountered is not really a problem that I can control: it's shipping time. Tracking is provided for all international shipping, however for some countries, tracking may not be available throughout the shipping/transit process. Another thing to consider is the duration the packages are being held up at customs. Unfortunately I do not know and cannot control how long your country's customs is holding up your package. The only thing we can do is just wait. Based on my experience, shipping time is quite fast for Asian region ( you receive your package in 1-2 weeks). However for countries further away from Singapore (such as Australia, US, Europe region, etc), it may take up to 4-6 weeks to arrive.

Love. The most abstract, all-encompassing feeling, thought, experience - it creeps into our lives with unassuming gentleness, or rushes in like a roaring fire. But what exactly is love?
This documentary focuses on how youths of our generation perceive, feel and express love. We dive into love through the stories of different individuals - what is the difference between infatuation and love? How does social media affect our perceptions on love? Can life exist without love?
Through this project, we want to unravel what love truly means to the young people of our generation; to inspire them to form their own definitions of love, and find the courage to pursue it.
To have a holistic understanding of how our generation perceives love, we will be listening to the stories of profiles with different backgrounds. We follow five profiles and their personal journeys, as they uncover and discover the truth of love. As we do so, we hope our audiences, themselves, will form their own definition of love by the end of the film.
We are also using elements of the performative documentary style along with real life footage to express the abstract feelings of love. We wish to show the stories of our profiles through reenactments and also dancing as a performative form to emphasise the emotions and create a mood to engage the audience better.","Even though the film itself is a documentary, we are portraying the stories using performative elements such as dancing and reenactments. In the case that we are making a docudrama which is based on real-life profiles but they are represented by the performers in the film. In essence, we are constructing the visuals of this film unlike other documentaries and we are having difficulties covering our expenses with the limited funding we have. We are trying to cut costs as much as possible but at the same time, we are trying to maintain our standard of production and tell the story in the direction we strive to achieve.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout US$ 36\n\n\n\nEnd Credit\n\n\nDo you want to share how you define love?

Cryptocurrency is a 2-4 players game that puts the players in a battle of wits to make the most amount of money from trading and mining cryptocurrencies. You will take on the role of the CEO of a fintech startup, leading a specialized team of technological experts who will help you to evaluate, trade and mine various cryptocurrencies. However, some of the cryptocurrencies are scams, designed to rob the unwary investors of their money and it is up to the player to manipulate the information, to design the ultimate scam while tricking other players to invest in it. You must make strategic decisions in hiring technological experts, solve cryptocurrency mining algorithms and manipulate the information network, all while engaging in tactical coin trading and getting rid of the questionable coins before the game ends.

Do you have the wit to avoid the pitfalls and thrive in the volatile world of Cryptocurrency?































All Kickstarter backers will receive the Event Expansion with their copy of Cryptocurrency. The Event expansion mimics the fast moving global environment whereby governments and big corporations intervene in the cryptocurrency markets, changing the rules as the game progresses. Instead of 1 scam cryptocurrency, there may now be 3! Players need to adapt quickly or perish while trying. This expansion is not included in the Freemium edition.









Experts help you to spread rumor, trade or mine cryptocurrency more efficiently and you hire them to optimize your winning strategy! The Experts are organized into different categories, with each specializing a different type of strategy. Each expert has specific abilities that can be used each time you activate them to perform an action. Who you hire is the strategic part of Cryptocurrency as it will determine your dominant strategy in the game.









 When you choose to mine a cryptocurrency, you have to deploy your experts to solve a digital algorithm using the Hash cards in a push your luck mini game. Devote enough experts and your mining success is guaranteed, while using less will decrease your chances of success, but preserving your resource for future actions. Just like in real world Cryptocurrency, mining will get more difficult as more and more people mined the same resource.  A successful mining exercise will reward you with cryptocurrencies and transaction fees, while a failed attempt will yield you nothing. Will you depend on lady luck for exponential rewards or use your company's full capability to eliminate all luck? 









Cryptocurrency is still in an infant stage and big traders (called Whales) have the ability to influence the market through selling and buying. You can send your experts to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and every 4 units you buy or sell will push the price up or down. Meanwhile, you can take out a loan to speculate in various cryptocurrencies allowing you to multiply your profits quickly, or use the loan to hire the right experts, who will help you to manipulate the market prices with ease!







If fake news and social media is your domain, consider the rumor mongering strategy. At the end of each turn, each player will have a chance to deploy one open or hidden rumor card on each cryptocurrency. As a rumormonger, you do not have much mining or trading power but you can manipulate rumors at will and discover the hidden landmines your opponents placed at various cryptocurrencies. You will probably be the first to find out which cryptocurrency is the scam in disguised..








At the end of the game, all hidden rumor cards will be unveiled and the cryptocurrency with the lowest rumor points will be declared as a scam and will become worthless. The problem is, the player that holds the most amount of a particular coin will be richly rewarded with bonus points..  As each of you participate in laying down the rumor cards, you will need to deduce which coin is a scam based on the cards you laid and other players' actions. Do you HODL (crypto slang for Hold On for Dear Life) or do you SELL before the game ends...If you managed to avoid the scam, you may have a good chance to be the one to accumulate the most amount of money and be declared as the ultimate cryptocurrency investor!







If you feel that you have mastered the game, it is time for the advanced mode! Each Cryptocurrency game comes with a set of info and market boards where each cryptocurrency will have its unique characteristics, creating more varied play. You can mix and match them with the basic boards creating a different cryptocurrency world each time you play.





















                                            

 One key design philosophy of Capital Gains Studio is to design games that closely resemblance real world finance mechanics. We always embark on an intensive research before designing any of our finance games and the education guide is a summary of our research. It also serves as an interesting insight on how the game is designed and an introduction to the world of cryptocurrency. A hard copy of the guide will be included in every standard edition of the game and a preview of the education guide can be downloaded in the link below!  

























                                              

















                            

                  

 









  



























The Freemium Edition backer limit has been lowered from 300 as there are many backers who backed more than 1 sets of Freemium Edition. The backer limit will be lowered as time goes by to reflect this condition.
You must be asking... Why are we giving away free sets of our board game to people? Our play test survey results have produced extremely positive results across a wide spectrum of playtesters and we hope to share this game with as many people as we can.








​We have been wrecking our brains on how to get Cryptocurrency to more people and we decided to copy the freemium model of digital games with a slight twist - Backers have to pay for the shipping cost of a stripped down game. Shipping is one of the most expensive component when it comes to getting the game to our backers and cardboard is heavy. In order to keep shipping cost low for the freemium sets, we stripped the game down by removing the bulky and heavy parts such as the box, meeples, boards and punchboards, while preserving the lighter cards which makes up the core of the game. Meanwhile,  the boards are designed in such a way that they can be printed out quickly using standard size paper and the backers can quickly start a game almost immediately after receiving the free core game cards from us. Having said that, the core component of the game still has 207 cards and there is more than enough value to justify for its shipping price.

We hope that this promotion will help to bring in more people to the world of tabletop gaming and enjoy the games designed by us.

Debtzilla is a 2-4 player co-operative game where you play as a budget strapped vigilante hero trying to take down Debtzilla before it destroys Banana Republic. You may need to take out a loan to buy those fancy gadgets but each loan you take on makes Debtzilla stronger..

During the Summer of 2017, major financial news wire around the world saw the rise of a new asset class: Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin passes the $5,000 mark and news of newly minted cryptocurrency millionaires captured the imagination of the masses, people started paying attention and brave investors began to explore the wild wild west of cryptocurrency. Tech savvy people rushed to buy mining rigs to mine cryptocurrencies, hoping to unearth what is the equivalent of gold, in the digital world.  Shortly after, new cryptocurrencies are created via initial coin offerings (ICO) and some of these creators became overnight millionaires. However, many of these ICOs and newly minted cryptocurrencies are simply scams in disguise, hoping to rip off the unaware investors. 
We started asking ourselves, can we create a fun game, that can portray the dangers of cryptocurrency, while representing how it works accurately on a board game? With that challenge in mind, the team delved into the new frontier of cryptocurrency and designed a game that explores the goods and pitfalls of this new digital financial technology.








Steve Ng was fascinated by games as a kid, and began creating games with pencil and paper from the age of 8. His games spoke of adventure and heroism, and proved popular amongst his peers. It was not until later in his years of education in game design did he discover the world of board games beyond Monopoly. Something ignited within him, calling him towards a path of designing board games. 
Wong Chunxi  has been drawing stuff since young. Aspiring writer, creator, artist, and full time dreamer. Likes computer gaming and painting miniatures, and getting inspired by others.
Xeo Lye is the lead developer behind the games produced by Capital Gains Studio. Previously, he spent a decade in the financial world managing money, authoring financial books & blogs and giving public talks.
Ashley Woo is the ultimate fire fighter and problem solver in Capital Gains Studio. Armed with more than a decade of experience as a compliance manager in MNCs, she handles game design and training projects for institutions and corporations. 
Sam Chang has more than 20 years of experience in Banking and Technology and is the financial gate-keeper that prevents the product and marketing people from spending out of control. He also navigates the complex global supply chain and ensures that our products reach the hands of our backers.","Cryptocurrency is our 5th game and our 4th crowdfunding campaign. By now, our team has a solid grasp on the process of designing, developing, manufacturing and delivering a high quality tabletop game. When it comes to a project like this, there are always risks regarding production and delivery that are beyond our control and may cause delays. We are already in the process of working with our manufacturer to get our game produced and we are confident that we should be able to deliver on Nov 2018.  

For Spiel Self Collection backers, if we are unable to fulfill the pledge during Spiel due to unforeseen circumstances (Custom and shipping problems are our main suspects!), we will offer a full refund or offer subsidized shipping rate for the game to be shipped to your place.

As with any foreign production/logistics, we may still be faced with unforeseen circumstances such as manufacturing and shipment delays or errors. If we were to meet with an issue, we promise to keep everyone updated and will share details of the problems and our solutions.

Our names are Anmei Zeng and Nicole Quah, and we are current students of Yale-NUS College in Singapore. This summer, we will be traveling across Southeast Asia to complete an anthropological investigation of how migration alters the national, ethnic, and personal identities of ethnically Chinese individuals. To do this, we will film interviews, conduct ethnographic research, visit historical and cultural sites, and engage with Chinese diaspora communities in five cities: Singapore, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, and Manila.Anmei is a second-generation Chinese immigrant and Nicole is a fourth-generation Chinese immigrant. Realizing that the migration histories in our families have led us to develop mixed and sometimes ambiguous cultural identities, we wish to learn more about how aspects of identity can be preserved, lost, or expanded upon when people situate themselves in foreign environments. What are the choices, whether conscious or subconscious, that people make in characterizing their identities? In addition, what external factors influence these choices?To complete this expedition, we will need to sustain ourselves and our project for seven weeks. Although our school has graciously agreed to sponsor a significant portion of our trip, we are still in need of funds for accommodation, museum tickets, film gear, etc. Any amount of assistance for our cause would be greatly appreciated and go a long way towards helping us realize our project!At the end of our travel fellowship, we will be compiling a series of immigrant stories that we will share to the Yale-NUS community and hold an exhibition of our photos and findings on October 8, 2018.

안녕하세요 여러분, 제 이름은 제임스 ip입니다
Xin chào mọi người, tôi tên là James Yip
Hallo allerseits, mein Name ist James Yip








Here begins my story on the concept and objective behind designing and developing a Sports Bluetooth Outdoor Speaker. We all love to listen to music during our sports activities, and especially during outdoors.
Wearing headphones and in-ear true wireless earbuds is probably the  best option but to be truly hands-free having a wireless speaker allows you to do virtually anything with your hands while enjoying great music.
One of the constant challenges I have is to be able to enjoy music while ensuring I'm aware of what's happening around me.
With a device over my ear (especially those with in-ear design and noise cancellation technology), I have minimal knowledge of any danger that I might be exposed to.
And with a great speaker, you can share good music as well with your friends.
My first idea about designing a Bluetooth speaker for sports and outdoor is to make it virtually indestructible. 
The initial design i done was a hexagonal shaped speaker, but finally, i've designed it rounded to allow users to have a comfortable and good grip.

Code named BTS-NPLUS2 will have PLUS2 features on top of (N=Normal):
1. Drop resistance up to 1m
2. IPX5 water and dust resistance
*And to make it more accessible to use in multiple scenarios, we have included a free carabiner and a suction cup.
**The special feature of the NPLUS2 speaker is it's ability to be able to connect two speakers simultaneously from one source to boost the sound volume and bass.

After several 2D drawings we proceed to work with our design engineers to create 3D design of BTS-NPLUS2. With 3D software we are able to measure every detailed dimensions of the speaker structure and work on a 3D model prototype.

The structure of the speaker is important, to withstand drops at 1m it must be able to protect the internal circuit module and speaker architecture. To do this we have housed a rubber absorption cover around the speaker to minimize the impact. At the same time, we use a dual-layer ABS plastic with a softer outer layer and an inner hard layer.

At the heart of this speaker will include an IPX5 rating which allows the speaker to withstand low jet water pressure and resistant to dust. The speaker will come with a 40mm 4W double wave-type diaphragm design internal speaker which offers good sound reproduction at a frequency band between 100Hz to 16KHz. The built-in battery will use a polymer lithium battery that comes with a soft layer protective cover to ensure safe from knocks and prevent an explosion. The battery will have a variation of 500mah and 1,000mah. Charging the speaker will be around 2 hours while usage can last up to 6 hours for 500mah built-in battery and up to 12 hours for 1,000mah version.
The name of the speaker will be D.LAB Sports Bluetooth Outdoor Speaker. The model number will be BTS-NPLUS2 for 500mah battery and BTS-NPLUS2X for 1000mah battery. BTS translates to Bluetooth Speaker and more importantly, NPLUS2 refers to Normal + 2 unique features. The principle behind N+2 has got to be my time working at Asus which designs and manufactures PC laptops. We will win the competition only if we have a unique strength. Each product we design must have at least one unique strength which sets us apart from the competition. 
The speaker strengths would be 
1. IPX5 rating also known as International Protection Marking or Ingress Protection Marking classified under 5 which offer:
a. Dust protection - Ingress of dust is partially prevented, and cannot enter unless over-excessive quantity to interfere with the satisfactory operation of the equipment
b. Water-resistance - Water projected by a nozzle (6.3mm) against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects against the equipment
2. Double wave diaphragm design which is actually a combination of lightweight metal and plastic cone at the front of the speaker. The design architecture of the diaphragm is two-fold, one which is fastened to the outer part of the speaker outer metal rim and the inner part fixed to an iron coil (field magnet) that feed electrical signals through the speaker cables into the coil. With the double wave design, it effectively moves the coil and cone in a more stable motion and reproduces higher quality sound into the air.









We have designed the speaker keeping in mind comfort and a good grip. Since our initial prototype, we have continued to find better materials to construct BTS-NPLUS2. Finally, we have achieved our desired results for BTS-NPLUS2 after months of continual improvements. We are proud to say we have made it possible for small but powerful sports and outdoor speakers. 









With the round and hexagon shape design, you can rest assured you can have a good grip on the speaker without any discomfort.









You don't need to bring a big and heavy speaker, weighing less than 125 grams bringing along this speaker is a breeze.









You can hang it on your bag pack, perfect for any outdoor activities. 









You can also hang it on any personal mobility device (such as mountain bike or e-scooter) using a carabiner. 









And even while showering, you can mount onto the wall using a suction cup.  









Apart from direct Bluetooth connection with your mobile devices, you can also playback from a 32GB SD Card









Enjoy hands-free call with BTS-NPLUS2 which supports active noise cancellation. You can have a conference with your friends while having fun outdoors.









The speaker is powered with a polymer lithium battery (PLB) with an outer layer soft protective coat to protect it from hard knocks, so do not worry about any explosion caused by impact.











With all these features, head out to your sports and outdoors with D.LAB Sports Bluetooth Outdoor Speaker BTS-NPLUS2 and BTS-NPLUS2X and enjoy great music on the go!

















For product specifications and how to use, every speaker will come with an English and Mandarin manual. At this stage, we might not be able to provide different languages but we can provide the English words in the manual in PDF or Microsoft word upon request for your translation purposes. You can email to customer@dezign-lab.com.

















There will be 3 accessories included:
1. Micro USB charging cable
2. Carabiner
3. Suction cup









There are also 3 exciting colors for you to choose from.









Bringing BTS-NPLUS2 out to the resort makes the experience so much better.









You can bring BTS-NPLUS2 out to the outdoor showers









Tune in to some romantic music while at the sea side.









Do not worry about sand and rocks, BTS-NPLUS2 is strong.









Laze at the beach with some nice music.









Hang BTS-NPLUS2 at the beach tent to enjoy good music.









Use the suction cup (included) to mount BTS-NPLUS2 onto surf board or boats.









If you do extreme sports, hook on with the carabiner (provided) and take BTS-NPLUS2 for your activities.









I hope you enjoy my story and contribute to the success of my kickstarter campaign.

You can see more pictures of my enamel pins and merchandise on my Instagram page and Etsy Store and feel free to drop me an email/message if you have any queries! (:","There remains the possibility of delays in production and shipping duration. However, I will ensure prompt communication with the manufacturer during the entire production process and since I have worked with the supplier before, the risks are minimal.

There might be slight variation in the color of pin and shape of the mold between the mockup and actual production but such changes will be minor. (color codes provided match the official Pantone colors but may not display exactly the same on your display screen)

I will also personally scrutinize the quality of each and every pin prior to shipment to ensure that every backer receives their rewards in the best condition.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 12 or more\n\nAbout US$ 9\n\n\n\n*Early Bird* Single Enamel Pin\n\n\nGet one unlocked pin of your choice! \n\n*For the first 10 backers only!

The only adaptive and natural pet bed, DreamCastle pet bed uses only 100% natural fabrics & fibre fillings to weave the most luxurious sleeping experience for your pets. Imagine a pet bed that offers peace of mind as it is safe, chemical-free, hypoallergenic, odourless, breathable, clump-free, lightweight, and more importantly, comes in trendy designs that make your neighbours & their fur-babies jealous.







We saw a huge problem for the current market trend in pet's bedding which is leading towards synthetics, petroleum by-products and labeled them as GREEN. This is not only away from the truth but may also cause health problems for fur-kids especially those with sensitive skin and allergies.

Pet bed is composed of 99% filling/stuffing and 1% shell cover. If you go to your nearest pet store, you will either find a pet bed that is stuffed with polyester or foam. So what is wrong? they are SYNTHETIC & treated with loads of chemical.







Synthetic fillings are made from the chemical reaction involving coal & petroleum by-products. They are not breathable, perfect habitat for bacteria & fungus and worst of all it hold on to odors & chemical vapor.

To make the matter worst, most pet beds also use polyester fabric to seal the bed fillings. if you ever throw a polyester pet bed into the washing machine, you will find that the fillings will start to get clumpy and soggy as they absorb the moisture which creates a perfect habitat for fungus, mold, and bacteria. Some synthetic pet beds come with a natural cotton cover. However, the chemical-laden filling can still negatively impact our pet's health. This is an even more serious issue with fur-kids who have sensitive skin, dry skin, or allergies. Synthetic bedding can irritate the skin, causing itching and redness.









Being a small dog owner ourselves and having too many past experiences of purchasing pet bed that our dog wouldn't want to settle on, we had a clear vision, to create a pet bed that weaves the best sleeping experience for fur-kids.
The results of this vision is a DreamCastle pet bed, a bed that is not only a pleasure to sleep on, but also contains no harmful materials, not only easy to maintain but also attractive in designs. After searching high & low, we finally found the answer..the perfect natural fibers to fill each of our bed..KAPOK FIBER.









These fibers came from the majestic rainforest trees that only exist along Earth's equator, and we use only the fiber from the best species which is found in Java, Indonesia. They are totally organic, breathable, clump-free, light-weight, hypo-allergenic, odorless, moisture-repellent, and most importantly sustainably cultivated.
Kapok fiber creates a gentle, cloud-like feel that adapts to the fur-kids' body, helping canine companions get an incredible sleep.








To seal all the goodness from nature, we use only pure natural cotton fabric that provides that extra-soft touch on your pets delicate skin. And the best part is that the tops are easy to wash and exchangeable, making it super easy to maintain, and fits almost anywhere in your home.

DreamCastle pet bed will be your pet urban affairs partners for life, without asking for anything in return... well, maybe a little bit of love.

































We understand how time-consuming it is to maintain a hygienic, safe and clean bed for your pets, that's why our bed composed of a layer of inner mattress shell & a layer of cover.
Most of the time, you will only need to clean the outer cover as it will get soiled from their outdoor activities, all you need to do is to unzip the cover, place it to the washing machine & tuck in a new cover. That's it. The decorative cover comes in many designs; so you could treat the cleaning chore as a fun activity instead of a tiring one.

While most dogs and cats will not pee/poop anywhere near where they eat or sleep, accident sometimes does happen. If it does happen, separates the cover from the inner mattress shell and place them in your washing machine.

























Besides providing superior support for your pets, the unique properties of our fiber also plays a very important role to keep your pets feel comfortable while resting. 
Being an excellent insulator, kapok fibers regulates the temperature of the bed which keeps your pets cool in the summer and warm during throughout the winter night.

















This unique fiber is coated with natural wax thus it has a very low moisture absorption. If your pets accidentally wet the bed, the fiber will not absorb their 'pee-pee' thus the bed stay fluffy & odor-free for wayyy longer than your ordinary pet beds, although you still need to spot clean the crime-scene :)
















With our colorful & 100% natural cotton decorative cover designs, there are always choices that will delight both you and your pets.
































































Let your pet enjoy the luxurious sleeping experience of a down without having to feel guilty for the poor geese. Our source of fibers came from the fruit of the trees, they are sustainably & locally grown by our hardworking farmer in Java, Indonesia.








































Plastic horror is real, they are nonbiodegradable and therefore sticks around for a lot longer (like up to 1,000 years longer) than other forms of trash and if we do not take action now there might be no more clean beach left to walk our pets. 

At DreamCastle, we work very hard to reduce our dependency on plastic except for packaging purposes & zippers, our products are completely plastic-free.

















































This campaign is really just the begining of a journey to something much bigger. We want to make your DreamCastle literally the only pet bed that you will ever need. We have been prototyping with different types of bedding style such as sofa bed and that’s not the end. 

With adaptive covers, the possibilities of giving your pets the best sleeping experience are limitless.","Our #1 goal is to deliver the best quality and safest product. We've put together an amazing team with over 5 years of experience in design and in manufacturing. 

In this first production run, we will ensure all aspects of the product will not be compromised, with safety as the priority. 

With most manufacturing, there can be potential delays in the tooling process, leading to further production delays. 

However, we will do everything in our power to deliver the best product to you on time and to keep you informed along the way.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nPledge $2 or more (without rewards)\n\n\nThank you for supporting our projects, If you are a fan but your dog is too big for this fist version, support us which means we will be able to produce more sizes faster!

The Ultimate Board Game











The Ultimate Board Game is an exciting, competitive, fun game for 2 to 8 adults. The game is inspired by the Ultimate sport and reproduces the dynamics of a tournament between two teams, consisting of a Match, a Party and a Final Match. To become The Ultimate Champion Team, collect the most victory points from the three stages of the game:

  The Two Matches
  The Spirit of the game
  The Party





Phases of the game







> A basic knowledge of the rules of Ultimate is helpful, but not necessary to play this game.

            

          





Unboxing the game is always bringing smiles

Gameplay of Phase 1 - Match
The game begins with the team that is in possession of the disc on Offence. The opponent’s team plays Defence. If the team in Offence scores or cannot complete a pass, then a Turnover occurs - this means  that the teams switch roles and the disc goes to the opponent’s team. The goal is to score 2 points in the opponent's End-Zone.
Offence
On your turn in Offence, you could do any of the following actions:
1. (Optional) Play as many Fitness/Spirit Cards as you want
2. Play a Pass Card or Increase the Stall Count
When the Current Player on Offence (thrower) plays a Pass Card - the Current Player on Defence can attempt to intercept it. After playing a Pass Card, the Defence Player performs their actions to determine if the pass is successful - by rolling a die and/or playing a Defence Card.
End of the Match

  The first team to score 2 points ends the Match. This team is the winner of the Match.
  The winner of the Match earns 2 Victory Points.
  The winner of the Spirit Of The Game earns 2 Victory Points.

 

Phase 2 - The Party


       At The Party phase, you are meeting your teammates and opponents after the first Match. The goal is to have fun and use the Party Cards to influence each other’s Party and Fitness levels.
Gameplay of Phase 3 - The Final Match
Now with the new Fitness levels you play The Final - let's see if those who partied too hard will be able to play well on the next day. Fitness levels will reduce the range of cards you can play. But no worries - there is always a way to come back.










The Team Behind





 The Origin Story
Martin met Gabi while playing Ultimate (what else 😄) in Singapore 🇸🇬. The two quickly became friends and when one day, Martin dropped the idea of creating a board game based on Ultimate, the duo's creativity was unleashed.
People joined along our idea and helped us to build it all together - our team is from Bulgaria, France, Singapore, The Netherlands, Slovakia and Brazil. And we got a ton of help from friends from Austria and USA, too.

Contemporary designs, manufactured with premium materials only seen on watches in five-figure price ranges. That was our aim when we started designing this range of watches. We surpassed this goal with three collections offering a distinct character, yet at accessible prices.Each watch case is meticulously constructed with the latest CNC technologies. It is then individually handcrafted to bring out the contrasting polished and brushed surfaces.The dial is a brilliant array of surfaces. The sunburst brushed dial is paired with the finely engraved stepped dial. A minute rings sits high above the dial offering a multi-layered visual experience. 







 







 







We wanted to offer a timepiece that is unique to you. Marine grade bronze is a metal commonly used for ship propellers due to its corrosion resistance. An oxide layer, called a patina, forms a protective skin over time to protect the metal. This patina individualises each timepiece, creating pieces completely unique to you.  What starts out as a shiny rose-gold, ages with the atmosphere into a rustic brown. 







Meteorite is also used for the ‘Visionary’ collection. This amazing metal is 4.5 billion years old with a striking design unlike any other material. Each and every meteorite dial has a different pattern, otherwise known as the Widmanstatten Pattern. This is formed over millions of years of slow cooling, and cannot be reproduced synthetically. We use material from the Muonionalusta meteorite which is found in Sweden and landed over a million years ago.Meteorite dials have been used in Swiss luxury brands, costing more than $10,000. We are now able to offer this at an accessible price. 







 









Swiss automatic movements have been the benchmark of quality for decades. We wanted to offer these Swiss movements at a price accessible to all.Unlike a quartz watch which requires a new battery, automatic movements rely on your motion for power. They will run for decades with the right care.The ETA 2824 or Selitta SW200 are extremely reliable and proven automatic movements. They have proven themselves with years of accurate service among various luxury Swiss brands. 







The unique bronze cases deserves a strap to match, and we settled for only the best leathers. 







Each strap is made from Horween Chromexel leather. Horween is the oldest leather tannery in the USA and produces the best leathers using techniques dating back a 100 years. This leather will patina with use, just like the beautiful bronze case.

Are you excited by intense drama that keeps you anticipating how the next scene will turn out?
Have you ever wondered what kind of surprises you may get, when a low self-esteem oversized teenager meets with... Kung Fu?
Then you're going to love...

















The World My Arena Vol 1 is a 200 pages hardcover graphic novel which was successfully funded in September 2021.  









After 1 year, the highly anticipated ""The World My Arena Vol 2"" is finally here! The World My Arena Vol 2 is also a 200 pages hardcover graphic novel, picking up from where we left off in Vol 1.




The World My Arena Vol 2 Cover Page





Armed with hard-won skills and a new positive outlook, Nathan is poised at the beginning of a life freed from the misery that has weighed him down.









But when his little sister Chloe is kidnapped by a hooded figure in a back alley, it precipitates Nathan into the wider world of his allies and enemies, and a whole new level of danger.









Nathan is joined by Ethan, who helps to save Chloe’s life. In return, Nathan finds himself striving to help Ethan unlock the mysteries of his past, and to keep Ethan from throwing away his soul in a nightmare-fueled quest for vengeance.









As their paths cross, diverge, and cross again, Nathan and Ethan begin to learn the terrible secret that has driven Sifu Gideon into hiding - a secret which ties all of their destinies together.









Are you excited already? Check out more pages below!

SCREENTONE by
""Ace"" is a name that started off as a challenge to myself on my 20th birthday, to be what my namesake suggest, in art and in life. When I finally decided to take my art seriously and accepted that I could no longer afford to half-ass my art if I wanted to earn a living as a professional artist. I love drawing as a story telling medium and have always enjoyed the freedom it granted artists to express themselves in no other way, be it as a hobby, or a therapy, and sometimes both. I love cats. I love dogs too, but I am more of a cat person.

Thanks for checking my project out! I've been a big fan of Lang Leav's poetry since forever. I've picked out some of my favorite lines that spoke out to me from her poems and turned them into enamel pins.The goal covers the production of pins, backing cards, shipping, packaging, and Kickstarter fees.
 I'll be adding more designs along the way and will be throwing something special if we hit at least 3 goals!PIN SPECIFICATIONS
Hard Enamel
Gold Plating
Rubber Clutch
Specially Designed Backing Card
1 Inch Widest/Tallest
INITIAL GOAL - To you, love was about multitudes. To me, love was inordinate.






STRETCH GOAL #1 | $660 - We fly closer to the moon; we fall closer to the sun. 






STRETCH GOAL #2 | $990 - Like we existed in a time before love. 






TIMELINEMy Kickstarter runs for 30 days and is estimated to end on 16 November. After receiving the funds, I will place an order with my manufacturer and production will begin. Production and shipping of the pins takes approximately 3 weeks. I will be sending out a survey to collect your mailing address and pin selection options during this period. Once the pins arrive, I'll have it packaged and shipped out within 1 week. Do note that there will be a tracking number provided for every package.

You can expect to receive your Poetry Enamel Pins by PinFix around Mid-December. Perfect for an early Christmas gift! Updates will be sent out should there be any delays.","I have confidence in ensuring that every process goes smoothly and the pins should reach you perfectly. I have also owned a business previously and am experienced in packaging, shipping and updates.

Therefore, I would say that the two biggest risk I would face is not having this Kickstarter fully funded and shipping delays as overseas packages may take a longer time due to customs. Nonetheless, I will update accordingly should there be any delays.

Should you need to contact me, do email me at pinfixmail@gmail.com and I'll be glad to answer your questions!","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 11 or more\n\nAbout $8\n\n\n\nOne Poetry Pin\n\n\nChoose any one Poetry Pin from the unlocked designs!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 20 or more\n\nAbout $15\n\n\n\nTwo Poetry Pins\n\n\nChoose any two Poetry Pins from the unlocked designs and save $2!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 30 or more\n\nAbout $22\n\n\n\nThree Poetry Pins\n\n\nChoose any three Poetry Pins from the unlocked designs and save $3!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""}]",4.0,0

No More Squats


Not all pain is gain





We believe that showertime is sacred; the time to be alone with your thoughts. But just when you’re about to have eureka moment, you have to reach for the shampoo on the floor. Maybe you power-squat, or put one knee on the floor (ew) - but whatever your choice of acrobatics, that showerthought is gone now.









We want to dive into our adventures full-speed, without the drag of travel inconveniences. XUBE gives you the comfort of having all your trusted products at your fingertips (ironically hands-free), anywhere, effortlessly. Your Personal Dispenser - Anywhere!







Can’t fit all your bottles on that tiny soap ledge? Never put them on the floor again. XUBE lets you mount your soap on any smooth wall, and take it right off afterwards. Microsuction is reusable, never loses its cling, and leaves no residue. Just wash and dry, and it’s good as new. 


Take XUBE anywhere





Cut The Clutter







XUBE keeps all your essentials together; it holds what you need, and not a touch more. 
Now you can bring everything you need from locker to shower, no more balancing acts. XUBE is Versatile







Fill XUBE with whatever you want - Face wash, shampoo, conditioner, body soap, etc. 
Need to use specific brand of shampoo? Prefer to use one bottle for lotion instead? 
You just do you; let XUBE do the rest. Just Roll and Go







Make packing easier.
Say goodbye to stuffing oddly-shaped bottles into a toiletry bag. XUBE tessellates with itself, and then with everything else. Its compact cuboidal shape makes it stackable and packable.Save the Environment







Now you can stop buying tons of travel-sized versions of your shampoos, and replace your disposable bottles with a refillable dispenser.Made of silicone







●  XUBE is made of BPA silicone, so it’s 100% waterproof, hygienic, and easy to clean. 
































Process and Inspiration









We went through many, many rounds of ideation, prototyping and variations. Pencils were sharpened. All-nighters and doritos were had. We pondered our own travel ideals and were inspired by the form of mountain peaks. Taking this organic starting point, we abstracted it into a concept that was geometrically satisfying. The decision to work with silicone proved challenging, and we spent many weeks 3D-modelling through iterations to find the right balance between designing for manufacturing considerations, functionality, and aesthetic based on feedback from our community. No detail was left unscrutinized!














 















     










Meet the Team







We’re a small team of Singapore-based designers who believe that beautiful and functional products can make even everyday routines a pleasure. We believe that in life’s great adventures, there is joy to be found in the little things too. And nothing beats the simple, everyday joy of having streamlined, beautiful products that just work. Help us make XUBE a reality, and together we can change the way we live, starting with the essentials.","We are a team of designers that believe in delivering beautifully functional, quality products, and are committed to ensuring that backers are satisfied with what they receive. We have produced a working prototype, and are working towards final product refinement and volume production as soon as our project gets funded.

Over the last few months, we have worked closely with our manufacturers to ensure that everything runs smoothly. We will continue to maintain clear communication and conduct quality checks with them.

We are a small team, but we will try our very best to deliver in a timely manner! A ton of sweat and tears went into this project, and we would hate to see it fail. We're almost there, the only thing we need is your support. Manufacturing with silicone and plastic is an arduous process, but we will try our best! In the event of unforeseen circumstances, we will be transparent with you and keep you updated on the steps we will take to manage everything. 

We promise to keep everyone closely updated as we bring our dream to life! Thank you so much for your support.

Suds and love,

  I set out with a goal to create a portable mahjong set that looks good and feels good with the intention of making this product for people who would love to play mahjong anywhere they went.
  Why? Because I enjoy playing mahjong and it's not very accessible to play anywhere especially with the size of the tiles and table set up required. Some alternative solutions online include a mini mahjong set that seems cheap and hard to handle and cheap mahjong poker cards with no thought behind it.
Traditional mahjong is bulky, heavy and noisy. Thus what I was looking for from my solution is something small, light and quiet. 
 Without the intention of replacing your traditional mahjong but rather to make it more accessible to bring around, play anywhere and not disturb anyone with loud noises. With that, I decided to create a small portable mahjong set that looks good and feels good with a touch of modernization. 
  After testing and prototyping the cards ended up being 60 x 30 which I felt was just the right size. While playing, the cards will be placed on a mahjong card stand that will hold 13 cards while you draw and discard one card every turn to prevent overdrawing of cards.
  With a small profile, the mahjong set includes 148 mahjong cards, 4 sets of card stand, 1 NSEW tracker, 3 dice. Play mahjong anywhere.

GreenChamp Bikes, a new and dynamic start-up, makes bamboo balance bikes for children from as young as 18+ months to 5 years! 

































We are also featured in more than 100 websites and magazines! Visit our website for more details!About us

GreenChamp Bikes is based on the founders’ belief that children’s toys should be made from eco-friendly and sustainable materials. They believe that this would encourage parents to educate their children about the environment from a young age, in the hope that this will provide them with a greener future. 


Educating children about the environment starts young, really young!





Besides its eco-friendliness, GreenChamp Bikes are super durable, ensuring easy manoeuvring for children who are learning to ride a bike. GreenChamp Bikes is the brainchild of Daniel and Sunny. Sunny went on a solo expedition around the world that spanned 6,123km on his first handmade bamboo bicycle. 


Sunny with his hand crafted bamboo bike and fellow cyclist





After returning, he met his Dutch cycling partner, Daniel, who shared the same passion for cycling, sustainability and bamboo. 


Daniel and his love for bamboo





After studying many children’s bikes, they saw that many balance bikes in the market were not sustainable (e.g. made from plastic, plywood and aluminium) and lacked the lightness and durability of bamboo. 


Non-sustainable balance bikes





They spent 2 years creating and designing a bamboo balance bike for young kids, hoping to let them know that they can have fun and be eco-friendly at the same time.

“Through the GreenChamp Bikes we hope this will encourage parents to educate their young children on the environment and provide children a greener future.” Daniel Heerkens, GreenChamp Bikes.GreenChamp Bikes Facts1)	Made from bamboo - one of nature’s most renewable sources of raw material. It requires only sunlight and water and grows very fast, up to 1 meter a day!


Bamboo used to make GreenChamp Bikes





2)	Specially developed bamboo technologies: GreenChamp uses two specially developed technologies during production. Honey is infused into the bamboo fibre to prevent it from cracking. 


1st In-house technology: Honey Wax Infused Tech







GreenChamp bike frames are double-walled, in which 1 bamboo is fused between 2 bamboo walls to ensure the durability of the bike. This also increases the strength of the bamboo frame by approximately 50%.


2nd In-house technology: Double Power Fibre





3)	Smoothest ride possible for your child: Our nature-based joints and bamboo framework promotes the smoothest ride possible for your child, so no matter how they ride, the vibration dampening effects of our natural materials compliment their riding style for a glide-like feeling with maximum comfort.4) Super durable: ensuring easy manoeuvring for young kids who are first learning to ride a bike.Workshop in GuangzhouGreenChamp Bikes only employs local villagers in Guangzhou, China, who have extensive experience in harvesting bamboo for decades. They only select 0.01% of the best available bamboo for our bikes. By using this method of sourcing, we guarantee a stronger-than-steel frame for all GreenChamp Bikes. GreenChamp Bikes are crafted by talented local artisans, turning them into a unique and beautiful piece of art. They have more than 20 years of experience working with all kind of bamboo products.

     Delivery of your new products","At our current stage, we have accumulated enough knowledge and expertise such that GreenChamp Bikes are no longer a home-made beginner's product. It is a product backed up with 2 years of research testing, in-house technologies and certifications. Our workshop is not operated by computer systems or machines but by skilled artisans.

As each bamboo is different, the material and color of the bikes will vary according to many factors such as, the time at which the bamboo is harvested or unpredictable weather conditions around the village. 

1) Natural Bamboo's Surface 
Each bamboo is unique in terms of its thickness, natural surface finishing and color tone. GreenChamp Bikes are kept as natural as possible.

GreenChamp Bikes has stringent quality control protocols in place for all aspects of bikes, including aesthetics. For example, if there are too many spots on the bamboo or if the smaller branches on the bamboo affects the overall aesthetics, it will be rejected.

2) Natural Bamboo's Probability of Cracking

Problem: 
Bamboo may crack. It is its natural tendency to crack as the fibers of bamboo are parallel to each other. When bamboo dries up, the water between them will cause the fiber to split.

Solution: 
GreenChamp Bikes has 2 in-house technologies ( honey infused technology and double walled bamboo) to tackle this problem. Our bamboo have been tested in many different places under different weather conditions. After 6 months of testing, we are proud to say that our technologies have proven to be very effective. 


3) GreenChamp Bikes Delivery Schedule - 
Problem: 
GreenChamp Bikes does not rely on robots to build your bicycle. We commit to deliver on time and if in the case where we cannot meet the deadline, we will inform 2 weeks in advance.

Solution: 
After 2 years of experimenting and formalising the processes, we are committed to make it happen. With your support, we may be able to purchase better tools and hire more skilled craftsmen to increase the production and deliver earlier.
 
Please note: The bamboo used is specially selected, some delays may occur to ensure the highest quality promised. We will inform you in advance in the event that your shipment is delayed, and seek your understanding in this matter.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge €1 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nFirst support to GreenChamp Bikes and keep up to date with exclusive backer updates.

Feng Shui teaches the ways to balance the free-flowing of this energy, which is known as ‘Qi’.









Throughout the years, we have witnessed how Feng Shui has evolved with time. From a huge water fountain that can be found near commercial buildings to a smaller scale water fountain that now many people embrace in their home and living spaces. Based on statistics, water features are the most common Feng Shui as they bring about therapeutic effect and aid in the relaxation of the human mind. The continuous water flow and movement are believed to regulate the flow of the energy (Qi) in the atmosphere for the environment. Feng Shui followers believed that regulated energy (Qi) will improve their surrounding in terms of their well being.   


In our current generation, we are all cooped up with work commitments and there is little time for us to have our own leisure activities. Often than not, we urbanites are used to the long working hours and after a long hectic day of work back at our home, we would often be too tired and not want to do other activities than to rest. Often, this hectic lifestyle causes anxiety to build up in us from fatigue and stress. In lieu of the outbreak of the coronavirus and circuit breaker, working from home has caused a detrimental blow to many urbanites’ wellbeing as they are expected to work for longer hours and be more responsive to superiors’ demands.      


On the other hand, getting cooped up within all four walls and not being able to go out also adds up to the anxiety faced by the urbanites.

SHUI Inner Compartment








SHUI Exploded View with Water Pump





























Thus, we have decided to come out with our product, a portable water feature, SHUI, that is easy to maintain and user-friendly.


Our product is simple! It made use of a mini water pump and can be placed in any medium that can hold water. The water pump creates a steady rate flow that produces a therapeutic ripple effect for the sight of the users with a subtle hint of water flowing sound that soothes our ears.


At home, urbanites can easily retrieve water through the tap into a cup or bowl. They will then place SHUI inside the container. By turning on the power, a water feature is formed. Urbanites can place this portable water feature anywhere as it does not take up a lot of space.  


Our product, SHUI, is thought to address the current issue that urbanites faced from the anxiety from work, and the small space environment that we are living in. Relatable, isn’t it? We are here to help with the well being of urbanites so that their day will be better with healthier and stronger mental health.


Process
As product designers, the stage of researching and development is our well known trait before deriving with the working prototype. For a period of 9 weeks, we have documented our process of working towards our final prototype.

































From top to bottom in order. 1) Removable battery housing lid 2) Battery holder 3) Wooden buoyant 4) Water pump 5) Water pump housing structure









Initial idea for SHUI is a battery-powered floating water feature with the buoyancy support from the wood.









Our team realised the bulkiness of the whole structure and we decided to omit the aspect of floating, meaning that we want our final product to be sunk to the bottom of the water body. This was our initial testing with putting the water pump into a housing structure. The pump will then be powered external from a battery source.

















We made use of the 3D printing for fabrication as it is the most effective and efficient choice to produce a functioning model within a short span of time.









































The testing of the 3d printed SHUI model. We have finally achieved the ripple and sound effect accordingly to what we have planned for the portable Feng Shui water feature! It creates a therapeutic soothing effect for stress relieving and anxiety reduction.

About Us
We are three quirky product designers hailing from Singapore. Ik Hwa favourite past time is to research the latest healthcare products and keeping to date with ideas for the latest functional design trends, Chien Ping favourite past time is to spend his time in his workspace doing woodcrafts while blasting Mandopop from his mobile phone and Fyza favourite past time is to spend her time cuddling with her two favourite felines at home and going for a long run to stay fit. 


More importantly, we are making a bold paradigm shift to bring in modernization and refinement for SHUI, in the portability of the product and packaging for easy transportation. The small size allows urbanites to place SHUI in different water compartment body without the need to source for an external container. Lastly, our concept still carries the philosophical traits of Feng Shui with the continuous water flow and sound to provide soothing and therapy to soothe the stressful environment for the urbanites.


Once again, thank you for taking your precious time to read through our 9 weeks of portable Feng Shui water feature journey. If you appreciate our product, we would appreciate your kindness in pledging to our project and make SHUI a reality!

   https://www.totalpond.com/blog/psychological-benefits-to-owning-a-water-feature","The risks and challenges we faced revolves more towards the rewards system where we allow our pledgers to have their own individual customized pattern designs to be engraved on the SHUI product and the packaging. As we are currently not sure if we would require special injection molding for imprinting the customized engravings for everyone. 

The prototype that we are currently using is actually done by 3D printing, one main problem with 3D printing lies in the consistency and time taken. Although 3D printing is able to achieve the customized pattern designs, it would not be able to accommodate all kind of designs and 3D printing has the threshold and limitation for prints, which will result in certain designs to not be able to be printed out. 

Our current solution is to either come up with a list of fixed variations, like five different patterns that allows pledgers to choose from. This is to ensure that there is uniformity in the patterns.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nPledging without reward\n\n\nIf you appreciate our product and want to help is in fulfilling our dream, please lend us a helping hand by pledging without reward!

THE TEAM









Start Something Studios is a Singapore-based board game design studio that takes fun very seriously. Founded in 2018, Start Something was built to allow designers, artists, and gamers with crazy ideas to create new experiences in the realm of tabletop gaming.









This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 850+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $370M raised between them.","Burning Bridges is ready for print and all we need is your help to fund it! That being said, we understand that there are some basic risks and challenges that are beyond our circle of control.

Here are some of the issues we might face through the course of production:

MANUFACTURING & PRODUCTION
While we have an established relationship with our factory in China that has produced our first Kickstarter game, Unbearable Winter - the biggest challenge we face is the instability of potential natural or political disasters in China.

SHIPPING AND FULFILLMENT
We know that getting your product on time is of the utmost importance, and that is why we are working very closely with trusted shipping and fulfillment companies to get your copy of the game safely into your hands. We're working with trusted fulfillment companies right out of Singapore and Hong Kong so that there are minimal hiccups. These companies have shipped other successful Kickstarter board games before at various scales, and based on our consultations and conversations with them, should have no issues whatsoever with regards to our campaign fulfillment.

Enyware lets you do the impossible. Sit in a “zero-stress” posture where your spine is stacked in an ideal S-shape while your body is upright, balanced, with back muscles comfortably relaxed.
A few minutes in Enyware and you will never want to sit the same way again.









Enyware applies just the right amount of force from its dual lumbar to roll up your pelvis and shape your spine into a neutral S-Shape. At the same time, its patent-pending posture shaper structure gently lifts the front of your chest into a power pose that eliminates slouching in a way no other chairs can.









This unique approach stacks your spine into an upright and relaxed posture, with only minimal muscle force required to maintain this perfect balance.









Enyware does not lock the body in one posture. You are still free to write, look through the microscope or create a work of art. Enyware will continuously support your body, reducing the load on the spine and returning you to the zero-stress posture whenever you need.









Your phone, iPad, laptop and joypad require our arms and shoulders to be in different positions, but most armrests are set too far apart or at wrong height to support modern devices.
These poorly designed armrests force us into awkward postures. Leaning to one side to use a phone, slouching down to find armrest support when typing or bending our neck down to view contents on the tablet.









Enyware's dynamic, detachable armrest is created as the result of our research and forms a critical part of the total support your body needs at work.
Our armrest is adjustable to let the elbows rest at the right height to reinforce your ""zero-stress"" upright posture.
It moves out to support your arms when typing or moves in create a support platform to let both hands hold phones & tablets at a healthy eye level so you don't need to bend down.









With your neck properly aligned and the shoulders relaxed, the risk of shoulder pain and text neck are greatly reduced. 

















Combining dynamic armrest with the zero-stress posture is how Enyware provides total support to the body and helps transform your posture away from the ergonomic pain affecting most of us today.

















Even with Enyware’s zero-stress sitting posture and dynamic armrest, static posture for long stretches is still unhealthy.
To encourage dynamic sitting, we integrate a sensor into Enyware to be your habit coach throughout the day. 









Enyware tracks your torso movement and angle so it knows if you are sitting still for too long or too reliant on the forward support.  









Choose to set active time goals and reminders to get up for a short stretch. Since Enyware is smart enough to know if you have left the seat or shifted posture, it will send a nudge only when necessary.









Enyware lets you set active goals and work with you either through app notification, browser notification or just a report at the end of the day.









Enyware can remind you to periodically alternate between inclined seating in the backrest and perching on the seat. The perching posture opens the hip to the optimal 135 degrees, engages the core muscles and further reduces tension on your spine. With the support provided by Enyware, you can perch more comfortably for longer. 









By putting you in control of your health goals, Enyware provides the positive reinforcement you need to transform sedentary habits into a more active lifestyle.

















Enyware is the world’s first smart seat that considers both the physical and mental aspect of sitting.
While our physical support helps you achieve a “zero-stress” sitting posture. Our intelligent system also gives you a powerful tool to reach a “zero-stress” state of mind.
Integrated in Enyware's posture shaper is a sensor that calculates your breathing rate and even detects stress based on your breathing pattern. 









Breathing is a conscious act that you can create dramatic changes in your body. It can increase oxygen level in the bloodstream and reduce stress without the need for medication. 









Now with Enyware, you will be able to see your breathing rate, set a stress alarm in case of elevated breathing. Pick a technique to help manage your stress in the same way top executives employ mindful breathing to boost their performance. 









As a society, we are obsessed with how much calories we burn and what muscle group we exercise from just 1 hour in the gym. But we believe what we do during 8 hours of sitting is no less important and should be intelligently managed by you.
Enyware makes sitting as intelligent as our other devices, not to distract you with another piece of technology, but to help your body and mind live in the same moment, and enriching both.

















Enyware lets you take the zero-stress sitting experience anywhere. All you need is an even surface and Enyware will turn and place your ergonomic space.
Enyware weighs only 2.6 kg and is easily portable so you can use it in your kitchen chair for work and easily put it away during meals.   Freeing up the need to place out-of-place furniture like an office chair in your living space.
Just about everything about Enyware is adjustable. You can change the pan size, height and depth of the posture shaper to snugly fit your body type. its armrest is also detachable depending on your needs and sitting style.

















We designed Enyware for everyone. We took great care to test Enyware with people of all sex, body size, and ethnicity to ensure maximum comfort and support.











You need ergonomics everywhere and Enyware makes that possible, anywhere.




































            

          

See how Enyware gives our testers a posture that changes their lives, in and out of Enyware.

            

          

            

          

            

          









Enyware was vigorously tested with medical-grade motion capture sensors and EMG to measure both the participant’s posture and muscle strain over a 30-minute sitting session simulating tasks performed by modern workers.
The result proves that using Enyware can help you sit upright for much longer while imposing only half the muscle strain compared to sitting upright without support.









In time-lapsed comparisons, participants can keep the optimal spine posture without slouching throughout the entire testing period, with better neck and shoulder alignment.
The EMG results show that our “zero-stress” posture imposes only half the strain on the lower back muscle (Thoracolumbar fascia) and middle back muscle (Trapezius) when compared to sitting upright without support.
Even better, sitting upright with Enyware strains your muscle less than slumping.









This impressive result has been repeated both under laboratory condition and in real world scenarios with our beta testers.  




























            

          

In 2018, our team made the LEX Bionic chair and the kind people of Kickstarter made LEX the most crowdfunded wearable robotics product ever. LEX had a 100% Kickstarter delivery date went on to star in one episode of HBO's Silicon Valley.

















This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.","Enyware is not our first project and we use our learning from LEX project to minimize the risk as much as possible. One of our key objective has always been 100% delivery, just like with LEX.

Firstly, we are using some of the best manufacturing vendors in the industry who, apart from previously working with us on many projects has a long experience producing precision components for tier-one consumer device companies.  

Secondly, Our team of award-winning robot engineers, designers, software engineers and production experts have been expanded even further from 2018. We now have consultants with experience working with fortune 500 companies guiding us through our design process. Every components are put through vigorous testings and manufacturing feasibility study before it is made. 

Thirdly, Enyware draws from our experience working with aerospace companies in addressing their wearable robotics needs, combined with extensive interviews and studies of modern workers.

Lastly, This is not our first rodeo. In 2018 the kind people of Kickstarter made LEX the most crowfunded wearable robotics product ever. We learned a lot from both our mistakes and successes in order to make everything runs even smoother this time around.

We are not saying some problems will not arise, some design may need to be changed in the final run due to regulatory requirement or expanded test group feedback, but what will not change is the ability of Enyware to give ""zero-stress"" seating experience to every backers on time with no unexpected costs. 

Whatever the challenges or delays, we give pledge to you the same pledges. Transparency, timely communications, responsiveness and 100% delivery.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\nThanks for a Cookie!\n\n\nEven penny counts and believe me when we say this means a lot more than a few dollars to us \n\nThank you! and please receive a complimentary copy of \""The Seating Survival Guide\"".

01. Our StoryWHERE IT ALL BEGINS















 02. Problem and Solution for you
ATOMIC PROJECT  was founded on the basis of an urban utilitarian tool, made for the urban nomads, for everyday extreme use.

We began by questioning ourselves what impending design problems our common watch has. We narrowed down our thorough research and have identified crown-tuning and strap swapping issues as a potential suspect for further design intervention.

After a year of toiling hard work and design, this is our design solutions.



Introducing AG-01 | Technical Timeware










 
SOLUTION-01








The watch lugs is fused into a beautiful singular uni-body, making it unbreakable and durable. You can swap straps easily without any tool.


SOLUTION-2








Addressing the crown, we did a concise study of the movement. Our solution lied in rotating the automatic movement 90 degrees clockwise and positioned our crown at 6’O clock position. 








We achieved a symmetry and a seamless uni-body, with no protruding corridor. Thus, we have achieved ambidextrous usage.





 












03. Design

Our design process consists of 4 pillars, AG-01 Technical Timeware, Colorways, Atomic Straps, and Packaging.
AG-01 Technical Timeware
Design Process








 Moodboard in Atomic Studios. Heavily influenced by Tech Future.




Fig.01





We make use of 3D printing technique to test trial a couple of designs (as seen in Fig. 01 above) before deciding on the final design. We concentrate on the essentials and the timeware is not burdened with non-essentials. The final design is an unibody design, with a singular solid body. 


DIAL 
The challenge was to create a dial that is easy to read when needed, and faded in the background when not necessary. 









 After 7 trials and testing, the final dial design is our dual contrast effect dial. With the play of matte black base dial and transparent gloss coating, the markers shine when light hits on it.
DATE WINDOW
The date window is one of the most important aspect of the design, as we use it a lot personally. We like to celebrate the date dial and make it one of the highlight of the whole design. Our specification is not easy and not a lot of manufacturers like to take the risk to challenge the status quo, where the usual 3 or 4 O' clock position is at.  










6 O' clock position designed symmetrically to attain perfect balance.

One of a kind 3D red arrow aero indicator
Work seamlessly with our machined crown

CROWN
The crown is the most challenging component of the entire design. Our design is inspired from the rising sun and our design hero, Dieter Ram's principles, ""Less is more""
We spent countless back and forth with our vendor and 2 prototypes before we got it right at the balanced proportion and design details.

AUTOMATIC MOVEMENT 
When we went out to source movement for our Timeware, we want it to be rock solid and invincible in the field. Finally, we are tied between Miyota Caliber 8215 movement or the SII caliber NH-35A movement. 
Eventually, we chose the latter, which is known among watch circles as a workhorse and made by Seiko.
This robust machine is rated to run for a couple decades before needing a service.
TRULY THE SPIRIT OF 'GODZILLA'








GODZILLA GUTS // SII NH-35A SPECS:
 


Jewels: 24 synthetic rubies, used to reduce friction and increase the lifespan of the movement
 
Vibrations Per Hour: 21,600 BPH, means silky smooth satisfying mechanical sweep 
Power Reserve: 36 hours, keep running this long even if you completely stop moving. 
Winding Direction: Bi-directional,  translate your movement into power.  
Hacking: Yes, it’s easy to set the exact time because you can stop time(on the watch) Synchronize.

NIGHT GLOW LUME
Usage under extreme urban night conditions, hi-visibility is an essential. We need a durable and long-lasting glow that will functions without failure. Hence, we picked the Swiss-made Superluminova C3 glow lume to fuse into our Timeware's dial markers. 









Swiss Superluminova C3 (white that glows neon green)


Easily one of the most visible lume you can find. 


ATOMIC STRAPS



Strap Design Process
 








For our strap's design brief, our goal is simple, to design and craft an aesthetically beautiful, strong and utilitarian NATO strap. We test trial 3 rounds with our selected vendor, before we came to our satisfied solution where is up to our peak standards. 





Specifications










Format: ATOMIC straps are NATO format straps specified with the highest quality hardware and materials.



Hardware: Made from stainless steel hardware. 22mm in width x 1.4mm strap thickness.










Details: Black Ballistic herringbone weave design. Silky smooth to touch and ultra comfortable to wear on all day. 









We are thankful that we worked with a great vendor that deals with our sky high expectations. With your support and funding, we can make ATOMIC strap design a reality, onto your wrist.
COLORWAYS

ATOMIC PROJECT AG-01 comes in 2 colorways for you. The question is, which side are you on?


STEALTH BLACK EDITION 
Bold yet stealthy, Black-out edition. Surgical grade 316L Stainless Steel with Matte black w/ PVD hard coating. 








 
STAINLESS STEEL EDITION
Beautifully polished hairline textured Surgical grade 316L Stainless steel.









PACKAGING


Exclusive Stealth Black Package
We spent an equal amount of effort and time to make our packaging unified with AG-01. Our packaging design is inspired by utility toolbox. 








'Godzilla' AG-01 nested neatly upon unboxing. This packaging box is functional and can be used for storage of your accessories.










EVA black foam -Better protection and higher quality compared to black sponge foam

Matte black paper wrap with gloss black detailing - The details is stealthy, yet tastefully beautiful.

We are revealing thus far. The fun is when you unbox it yourself. We can't wait till you hold it in your hands!




Disclaimer Notice:
All photos were shot with our prototypes(Timeware, Strap, Packaging) made from our selected vendors, that we worked with over the last 6 months to 1 year. The final mass production unit might differ a little in details due to manufacturing refinements. We will update you what changes we make along the way to create a greater design for you. When it reaches your hand, you can appreciate every corners and details of the Timeware.

Lastly,
A gargantuan thank you from all of us at ATOMIC PROJECT!
Now, let's make Godzilla come alive!","Dear potential backers,

Firstly, thank you for your trust. With your support, it is our duty and  responsibility to bring the project alive, and deliver the prized timepiece to you.
 
As a designer myself, I understood the hard work, struggle and time to bring a product from concept to mass production.  

Manufacturing any product takes a lot of hard work, and things sometimes go wrong, with unexpected hiccups along the way. I've shared a few potholes above, but that is why we have been preparing for over a year now.

It means a lot to me and my team to meet the June 2019 deadline, and we'll do everything in our power to do so. I promise to do a weekly update for you till the product ships and reaches you.

If somewhere along the way we find that there is a setback in production, or that we cannot make the timeline, we promise to be as transparent as possible to keep you informed.

Best,
Alden

Timeline","Initially, it boil down as an idea to design a belt, that can be easily packed and brought about, with no unsightly belt holes and yet is elegant enough to be used for any occasion. 

The challenge came in designing a buckle that would function as according to what we wanted. We experimented through many prototypes. To produce the prototypes, we worked with 3D drawing artist and 3D printing company. 

The belt buckle need to be precise, as even a 1mm difference would had affected the M*belt’s form, fit and functionality. Although it had been a time consuming affair, we are glad our continued efforts and dedication got this right.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\nSupport Us\n\n\n~USD$1 or £1\n\nThank you!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 20 or more\n\nAbout US$ 15\n\n\n\nEarly Bird Special\n\n\n~USD$14 or £11\n\nStandard Pack:\n\n1x Buckle in any color.\n\n1x Strap in any color.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (82 left of 100)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 25 or more\n\nAbout US$ 18\n\n\n\nKickstarter Exclusive\n\n\n~USD$17 or £14\n\nStandard Pack:\n\n1x Buckle in any color.\n\n1x Strap in any color.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 35 or more\n\nAbout US$ 26\n\n\n\nEarly Bird Special\n\n\n~USD$24 or £19\n\nFun Pack:\n\n2x Buckle in any color.\n\n2x Strap in any color.\n\nUp to 4 color combinations.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (75 left of 100)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 40 or more\n\nAbout US$ 29\n\n\n\nKickstarter Exclusive\n\n\n~USD$28 or £22\n\nFun Pack:\n\n2x Buckle in any color.\n\n2x Strap in any color.\n\nUp to 4 color combinations.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout US$ 36\n\n\n\nEarly Bird Special\n\n\n~USD$35 or £28\n\nSuperb Pack:\n\n3x Buckle in any color.\n\n3x Strap in any color.\n\nUp to 9 color combinations.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (94 left of 100)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 55 or more\n\nAbout US$ 40\n\n\n\nKickstarter Exclusive\n\n\n~USD$38 or £31\n\nSuperb Pack:\n\n3x Buckle in any color.\n\n3x Strap in any color.\n\nUp to 9 color combinations.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 60 or more\n\nAbout US$ 43\n\n\n\nSuper Early Bird\n\n\n~USD$42 or £34\n\nUltimate Pack:\n\n4x Buckle in any color.\n\n5x Strap in any color.\n\nUp to 20 color combinations.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (48 left of 50)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 60 or more\n\nAbout US$ 43\n\n\n\nSuper Early Bird (Cheaper Shipping)\n\n\n~USD$45 or £36\n\nUltimate Pack:\n\n4x Buckle in any color.\n\n5x Strap in any color.\n\nUp to 20 color combinations.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (48 left of 50)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 65 or more\n\nAbout US$ 47\n\n\n\nEarly Bird Special\n\n\n~USD$45 or £36\n\nUltimate Pack:\n\n4x Buckle in any color.\n\n5x Strap in any color.\n\nUp to 20 color combinations.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (100 left of 100)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 70 or more\n\nAbout US$ 51\n\n\n\nKickstarter Exclusive\n\n\n~USD$49 or £39\n\nUltimate Pack:\n\n4x Buckle in any color.\n\n5x Strap in any color.\n\nUp to 20 color combinations.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 70 or more\n\nAbout US$ 51\n\n\n\nKickstarter Exclusive (Cheaper Shipping)\n\n\n~USD$45 or £36\n\nUltimate Pack:\n\n4x Buckle in any color.\n\n5x Strap in any color.\n\nUp to 20 color combinations.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (50 left of 50)""}]",1.0,6

She was born with Down Syndrome but beautiful nonetheless, and we loved her so. Emma's awesome daddy worked hard so that I could quit my job to be with our beloved girl 24/7. Yet, it was too heavy a burden for him when Emma was further diagnosed with heart defects. The very first embroidered pillow was made with love by Mummy, hoping it could act as a small comforter for our baby girl as she sleeps with it in her little arms.This is where A Mother's Heart Project comes in. 






 My wish and goal is for this project to be successfully funded, so that I could have the sufficient funds to officially start it as an online business, having enough resources to make good and personalised pillows meant for infants and toddlers. Actually, even for the adults who were once children. Each embroidered pillow takes roughly 16 hours to complete, 10 of them helps our little family with the medical bills for 1 week.  My aim is to sell at least 200 of them. This will help cover the medical bills for short term, and most importantly to kickstart the business that could run on long term.

A metal detecting system is designed and packaged into footwear such that it can be worn on both feet in lieu of carrying a hand held metal detecting device. The metal detecting hardware, coil and battery are installed in its entirety inside the sole and in the shoe.  In the event that a buried metal object is found along the path of the shoe swinging in the air while walking, the buzzers will sound through spiker, headphones or mobile app to alarm the user, thus fulfilling its purpose. This Metal Detector Shoes provides a convenient method of metal detection for treasure hunters and as a toy for children to wear metal detecting shoes instead of hand held devices that are inconvenient and attract attention from passersby. 


Amidst the multitudes of treasure hunters, hobbyists and children that roam the beaches, woods, and ancient sites this Treasure Hunter Metal Detector Shoes would be much appreciated. Thousands scour the beaches each year in hopes of finding precious gold. For the casual treasure hunter to even the avid explorer having this shoes would be a great addition to their arsenal. Since there is no visible hand held device. Metal detecting shoes are convenient to use and draw less attention from the passersby. Instead of leaving the site with a hunched back or weary arms all that a user must do with the portable metal detecting shoe is walk around wearing them and wait for a signal. 

















Metal detector shoes work by transmitting an electromagnetic field from the search coil into the ground. Any metal objects within the electromagnetic field will become energized and retransmit an electromagnetic field of their own. The detector’s search coil receives the retransmitted field and alerts the user by producing a target response. 


A metal detecting shoe consisting of:
- insulated wire coils for electromagnetic field generation, and field changes detection packaged inside the frontal (toe) area of ​​the sole of the shoe.
- an electronic module packaged in the middle (Fast Finder and Sand's Worker) or heel (Mountain Walker) area of ​​the sole.
- a battery packaged in the heel area of ​​the sole like on Fast Finder and Sand's Worker models or packaged inside a pouch that is attached to the outer upper body of the shoe like on Mountain Walker model.
- power switch mounted to the back of the shoe. 


The battery rechargeable by wall current or Treasure Hunter signature power bank. A recharging jack is installed inside the shoe and has magnet port for easy charger cable connecting.

Wireless connecting distance is up to 10 meters. Mountain Walker has waterproof design and equipped with a LiFePo4 rechargeable battery. Coin search depth – 30 cm.









Like a Sand’s Worker, Mountain Walker has equipped with a LiFePo4 battery, a full charge lasts for 24 hours of Treasure Hunting, battery packaged inside a pouch that is attached to the outer upper body of the shoe to give the user opportunity to replace the batteries on the go for long lasting Treasure Hunting.  
Mountain Walker connects with Metal Detecting Shoes iOS and Android application with the same features as Sand’s Worker. Metal Detecting Shoes iOS and Android application controls communication with shoes. With this mobile app you can connect your headphones and/or smart watch and get a target signal about the metal under your feet. Mobile app works in underground mode means no need to hold the phone in hands constantly. This is very useful when you don't want to attract attention of passersby.
This hiking shoes are good for walking through woods, weald or in the mountains and can be the best friend to find gold nuggets or meteorites.



















Brain of metal detecting hardware in Sand’s Worker & Mountain Walker is an ESP32 module.  ESP32 is a low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 employs a dual-core microprocessor. ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, a Shanghai-based Chinese company. This little assistant does all the calculations and transfers the data via Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) to the phone device.









With all the efforts we have developed a metal detector PCB to assemble with ESP32 module. We spent hours in developing and selecting the right components for PCB.









After great work done, we are able to create a truly unique device and now it is ready to serve all treasure hunters in our Metal Detector Shoes.









Our main goal is to assemble the most reliable PCB, mount the correct components and reduce the size to fit into the sole of the shoe.  And we proud to archive!

















In such a specific device as Metal Detector Shoes, reliability and safety are essential. We have selected the most reliable and safe batteries available at the moment - LiFePO4. These batteries are very reliable and have a long service life of 2,000-12,000 charge / discharge cycles.


LiFePO4 (also known as Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries are a huge improvement over lead acid in weight, capacity and shelf life. The LiFePO4 batteries are the safest type of Lithium batteries as they will not overheat, and even if punctured they will not catch on fire. The cathode material in LiFePO4 batteries is not hazardous, and so poses no negative health hazards or environmental hazards. Due to the oxygen being bonded tightly to the molecule, there is no danger of the battery erupting into flames like there is with Lithium-Ion. The chemistry is so stable that LiFePO4 batteries will accept a charge from a lead-acid configured battery charger. LiFePO4 life expectancy is approximately 5-7 years.


Lithium-Ion batteries and Lithium Polymer batteries are the most energy dense of the Lithium batteries, but they are lacking in safety. The most common type of Lithium-Ion is LiCoO2, or Lithium Cobalt Oxide. In this chemistry, the oxygen is not strongly bonded to the cobalt, so when the battery heats up, such as in rapid charging or discharging, or just heavy use, the battery can catch fire. To help counteract this problem, devices that use Lithium-Ion and Lithium Polymer batteries are required to have extremely sensitive and often expensive electronics to monitor them. While Lithium Ion batteries have an intrinsically high energy density, after one year of use the capacity of the Lithium Ion will have fallen so much that the LiFePO4 will have the same energy density, and after two years LiFePO4 will have significantly greater energy density. Another disadvantage of these types is that Cobalt can be hazardous, raising both health concerns and environmental disposal costs. The projected life of a Lithium-Ion battery is approximately 3 years from production.


Based on the research data, we decided to use the safe LiFePO4 rechargeable batteries.









The Fast Finder model is equipped with a magnetic charging cable that makes it easy to connect power to battery charging.









Treasure Hunter signature charger specially made for safe charging LiFePo4 battery to maximize battery life. 









 Like the Fast Finder model, Sand's Worker is equipped with a magnetic charging cable that makes it easy to connect power to battery charging.









And Treasure Hunter signature charger made for safe charging LiFePo4 battery to maximize battery life. 









Mountain Walker has equipped with a LiFePo4 batteries in charge case. Battery packaged inside a pouch that is attached to the outer upper body of the shoe so give user opportunity not only charge battery but also replace the batteries for faster back to Treasure Hunting.

















All Treasure Hunter Metal Detector Shoes models has Bluetooth connection functionality.  The Fast Finder model has Bluetooth 5.0 module to send audio sounds of detected items to your headphones. Sand's Worker & Mountain Walker have BLE 5.0 as using ESP32 in hardware to send data to mobile device.


The use of bluetooth technology in the treasure hunting opens up new opportunities, and with the Metal Detector Shoes we were able to make a product of high technological quality that allows the user to make daily activities and at the same time search for the treasures!

















 Sand's Worker and Mountain Walker models work with the Metal Detecting Shoes mobile application, available for iOS and Android. The microcomputer of the metal detector communicates via BLE with the mobile application and transmits all values and signals for detecting metal objects, the mobile application analyses the received data and display it on the screen.  You can easily connect bluetooth headphones and smart watches to your phone and track signals coming from sensitive detectors of shoes.  There is no need to hold the phone in your hands - the application works in the background mode, so you can simply close the application and hide the phone and you will still receive signals through your smartwatch or bluetooth headphones.









 We have developed the most convenient and intuitive application, there are no complicated settings in it - all settings of the coil and search modes are automatic and do not require any special actions from the user.  We are constantly working on app improvement and looking forward to receive comments and wishes from our fellow Treasure Hunters. 
































One of the obligatory features of our shoes is water resistance. This is especially important for beach treasure searches where you can get in the water at any time. 


Metal Detector Shoes have waterproof components and assembled the way its electronics and battery are totally protected. This allows the metal detecting shoes to be worn during rain or beach searches without fear to ruin the shoes.

















 Our shoes are strong, withstand the weight of their wearer and keep the internal components of the detector protected. We created and tested our Metal Detector Shoes for shock destruction. We have done hard work to develop the most stable and durable structure of the shoes. 


You can be confident in the durability of our shoes as evidenced by our warranty policy.




























This amazing stuff will be included in every Treasure Hunter's reward after we reach STRETCH GOALS. Please share our campaign on your social media to help us reach these goals!

















































 Currently you can find a huge number of metal detectors on the market, but there are no metal detector shoes! We are pleased to present our wonderful Metal Detector Shoe models to the whole world. Despite the fact we have no direct competitors, however hand-held metal detectors used by a huge number of people for treasure hunting around the world have certain similarities and purposes.  In the table below, you can find significant differences between handheld metal detectors and our metal detector shoes.









As can be seen from the table metal detector shoes have features which are not supported by classic metal detectors. Metal detector shoes:
- bluetooth connection with headphones and mobile app;
- safe LiFePo4 battery, service life up to 12,000 charge-discharge cycles;
- waterproof;
- lightweight;
- can be used for hidden treasure hunt.
And all this you get with a full-fledged metal detector for each foot at a competitive price.

For close to a decade, we have worked primarily with smaller businesses and helped them improve their processes through custom B2B web-based solutions.
The current global pandemic has affected our clients who are mainly smaller, independent businesses, and that has inevitably impacted us. Like many others, we are trying to navigate a new way out through this crisis. Through this campaign, we wish to present our craft beyond our usual clientele and to anyone who works with media, even slideshows or a documents. 
Why Kickstarter and Why Back Now 
Even though we already have most of the libraries converted and ready, running a platform on servers is not a small sum. We need some funds to pay for the servers and professional services that we need.
The prices that we have now are only for this Kickstarter campaign. Prices will be set at higher rates, in USD when we do go 'live' if we are successful. Also, as our backer, you will be able to renew your subscription for another year at the same rate that you have backed. 
What we are planning to make
1. For designers or non-technical backers, we have included two icon rewards. Icons are always created in-house by our artists for our code projects, and we are now releasing them as a standalone library in this campaign. The icons will be available in SVG and PNG formats, so that you can use them in a range of applications. 
a. Icons Pack
For this campaign we will release a small standalone pack of 100 icons in SVG format for a small annual subscription. This final number will increase if icons are commissioned and/or stretch goals are met. You can use these icons in your website and your daily work (for more details, please see exporter demo at the bottom of this section, and license details in Terms below).  
Currently we have around 25 icons, which are largely technical now. We will send out a survey for you to vote for your preferred categories for the remaining icons, when the campaign ends successfully. 
See samples in image below:-




Preview of our Icons Pack







SVG files have the advantage of retaining its resolution even when resized, but they can be hard to use for non-technical users. Our Icons Pack subscription will include access to a convenient export tool (available after logging in) for you to export the SVG file into a more familiar PNG format, in your required color and dimensions. This eliminates the need for image editing software just to modify color, which is particularly useful for users not using the icons on a HTML file.
A working demo can be found here on the webpage:  SVG exporter demo  (Also read Risks & Challenges for exporter limitations)

b. Campaign Special - Commission an Icon
Maybe you own a small business and you want an icon depicting your logo or your flagship product. Or maybe you just need a set of icons for your latest presentation that finally looks different from everyone else. 
Here is a chance to get the exact icon that you have always needed but couldn't find. Tell us about the icon design and we will create it for you.
Your icon design will be added to the Icons Pack and released as part of the collection. The icon name will contain your initials, and your name will appear in the icon's page as its sponsor. (Also read Terms below, for more regarding icon requests)


******************* BONUS for crossing 15% (almost at 20%) ******************
All our backers now get access to a new, small code library - Switch Button, if our campaign ends successfully. (Working demo here:  Switch Button Demo )




The bonus Switch Button library





Don't worry if you have never used a library before. We will include code documentations (see The Libraries are documented section below) and simple tutorials. If you have always wanted to try creating a website, what better timing than now?
******************************************************************************
2. For the programmers, we are offering access to a collection of codes that we have built and fine-tuned over the years through the unique requirements of our clients. Without going through that same mill, these codes can now become a valuable asset in reducing your development efforts.
a. Basic UI Code Pack
Stylized basic form elements with validation. (Note: File Input is for local file selection, see <input type=""file"">) You can access the interactive menu here:  Interactive Menu for Basic Code Pack

The libraries are..
1. Easy to Use
You can create a lean, professional-looking website even if you are a beginner. Include the library, add a class to the element and set the attributes. It's literally just 1,2,3.

2. Extendable (for field validation)
If our standard validation criteria are not good enough, you can include an attribute that points to your custom function instead. An example use case will be checking if a username is already in use on your servers. Your custom function will override our validation methods. 




Overriding field validation with your custom function





The standard validation messages are also localizable through a separate file. You can see a demo here:  Speak your Language for standard validation messages

3.  Documented
We have been working with clients with zero IT backgrounds. We understand that documentation (and communication) should be clear and engaging, instead of verbose.

Stretch Goals
This campaign is our first release, but we intend to keep updating or creating new expansion packs if proven viable. Here are our first stretch goals:
Stretch Goal #1 ( At $5,000 ): 

  Addition to UI+: Drop Selects 
  Addition to Icon Pack: +20 icons

Like the others, Drop Select is in use in our 'live' projects. Attached is how it looks like in its older iteration.

Other Information
Terms

  For Code Packs: One license is intended for one domain (sub-domains included) only. It's like you have engaged us to work on the javascript part of your project, minus the long development time.
  For Icon Packs: One license is tied to one individual. You can use it on your website or your presentations etc.

If you are a studio or freelancer who needs more licenses please let us know and we can design a reward for you. 
Important Note: Standard Software license's terms applies (e.g. non-exclusive, no warranty and not for resale on its own). By using our libraries, you agree to our terms of  use.

  For 'Commission an Icon: Backers can submit your icon(s) request once, with one allowed edit per icon. Icons will be drawn in our style (see samples above). Note that you risk forfeiture if you request for icons that are i) NSFW, ii) violent, suggestive, offensive or discriminatory, iii) not owned by you or trademarked by others e.g. logo of a business that you do not own. Like any Kickstarter reward, you do not own any exclusive rights to the icon(s), and we will include them in our codes and/or icons pack which we will sell. 'Commission an Icon' is purely for requesting an icon that might not exist in our icons pack otherwise. Also, note that an icon is a small graphic with only outlines, not an illustration - it should be legible within a 24 x 24px space. If a business logo: we do not design a new logo for you, but only convert your logo into an icon.

If in doubt, please contact us before you commit to a reward. We will be glad to clarify any queries.
Deliverables

  For code packs: Access to .js files in minified, obfuscated formats only. CSS files will be available in both minified and non-minified formats so that you can change the styling as required.
  For commission an icon: Your icon will be included in the Icon Pack, and we will include your initials in its name. Your name will also appear in the icon page, as its sponsor.
  For icon pack: The icon library will be provided in minified, obfuscated format. The icons are served primarily in SVG format on our site, and the PNG format will be made available for download via the exporter tool.
  All backers will be named in our thank you page (unless opted-out).

Subscription
Code Pack/Icons Pack rewards are termed as a 1 (one) year subscription. Subscriptions allow you to access any updates to your code/icon packs within a year. You can continue to use the libraries in your chosen domain/website, with the latest version you had downloaded before your subscription expires. For Icons Pack subscribers, access to the exporter tool is only available during your subscription period. You can still continue to use any image that you have downloaded during your subscription.
Timeline and schedule
All the listed libraries are used in live projects, in their respective older versions. For this campaign, we have cleaned up and written a new version of them in vanillajs, before the launch. However, we will still need to build a minimal portal for users to manage their subscriptions and access. This is projected to take approximately 2 (+/-1) months (with some buffer, in case).
Background Story
Why we began working on our own libraries
Like many developers, we used to work with free open source libraries. One fateful year, exactly when we were midway with a massive project, two frameworks we were using announced their major updates.
We tested the betas and the new frameworks will break all of the free libraries we were using. With the frameworks still in beta themselves, a library patch or update was not going to happen. We were then at the crossroads: continue with the version we were using and know we will be 'outdated' at launch, or adopt the new version. 
At the same time, there were several smaller issues nibbling us: libraries (from different sources) conflicted each other, codes were getting inflated because we were overriding or forcing in more modifications. The answer seemed clear.","All the libraries are in use in real projects. However, since it is our first time releasing a javascript library, there is a chance where the library does not fit perfectly in your existing framework. In such cases we will strive to resolve it as best as we can, after we have the minimum that we promised here delivered. It is also possible for a library to have logical bugs, which we will work on to fix once reported. The backer is able to download updated versions within their subscription period. Standard software license terms applies, including no warranty. Please do not use the libraries on live or critical projects without tests.

There is a also a small possibility that an interface is patented. While we try to do our best in our research, we do not have the resources to hire a patent agent to do this for us. In the event that a complaint is lodged, we will freeze the affected library while we work out an alternative.

All functions listed in both UI and UI+ have been tested on the major browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Safari. IE is not tested at the moment. Older browsers (e.g. IE7) are not supported. Development and testing was done in the Mac environment. Do test the libraries on your own development environment first before deployment.

The exporter tool will have a maximum file or dimension size limit, due to individual system limitations. It has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari only and may not work on other browsers. If you need to export a large file for print etc., please consider using the SVG format instead.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 8 or more\n\nAbout US$ 6\n\n\n\nIcons Pack\n\n\n1 (One) year subscription to our icons pack, so that you can beautify your webpage or presentations.\nIncludes:\n\n\nIcons Pack\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nSep 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 20 or more\n\nAbout US$ 15\n\n\n\nIcons Pack Bundle\n\n\nIcons pack for you and your loved ones!

I am Alice (@alicehwyy) and this is my first Kickstarter project which I am excited to share with you! I have been obsessed with Genshin Impact and their characters and I really wanted to make pins of them! This campaign will help put these enamel pin designs into production! 
In addition to the initial goal, this project also has multiple stretch goals; the higher the funding, the more new characters will be unlocked.


★ About Kickstarter: When you pledge on Kickstarter, you'll not be charged right away, you will only be charged after the Kickstarter ends and only if the initial goal is met! If the campaign is unsuccessful, you will not be charged at all. You can upgrade, downgrade or cancel your pledge at any time before the campaign ends!


★ About Pledging: Pledging helps unlock designs! So if a design you want is still locked, don't wait for it to be unlocked and make your pledge to help unlock them! You can edit your pledge any time before the campaign ends.


★About Shipping: Shipping is NOT included in the tier pricing! Shipping will be calculated and charged via Backerkit AFTER the campaign is over based on your country. Please do not add any shipping costs to your pledge! Please see the shipping costs charts below for an estimate of the shipping costs. All shipping costs are inclusive of tracking!


★ About Backerkit: I will send out a Backerkit survey to collect your shipping address and the specific unlocked pins you want to choose. 



























































































































































This campaign will run for 3 weeks and then there is an additional 2 week period before I receive the fund from Kickstarter. Once the campaign is over, I'll send out surveys through Backerkit for everyone to choose their products and fill out shipping addresses (to make payment for shipping, please refer to the chart below for the shipping rates). You will have 1 week to fill out the survey and during this one week waiting period, the Backerkit preorder shop will also be available to everyone!
Once everyone has filled out the survey and I have a final count on the quantities I need to order, production for all the products will begin! Hard Enamel Pins production should take less than 2 months, factoring shipping time to me, I expect to receive them in April. Once I receive everything, I'll quality check, package, and start shipping everything out to you guys! Current estimated delivery is Apr to early May!
Please note that this is just a rough estimate of the timeline and that exact times may vary depending on number of backers, external situations and holidays, etc.



















★ If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to leave a comment, or you can email me at alicehwyystore@gmail.com","1) Although the manufacturer has previously delivered great quality pins, there is a chance something may to go wrong in production and that may result in a delay in mailing of rewards as I get designs remade.

2) There will be some difference between the colors you see on screen and colors on the physical pin due to colors being different on monitors. The designs you see are mock ups so there may be slight changes to the design before manufacture due to practicality.

3) As there are a lot of designs, there is a chance the design you want may not be unlocked by the end of the campaign. Depending on the outcome, I will see if I can afford to fund any remaining designs myself and keep you updated through Kickstarter","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 15 or more\n\nAbout US$ 11\n\n\n\n★1 Pin★\n\n\nYou will receive 1 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 30 or more\n\nAbout US$ 22\n\n\n\n★2 Pins★\n\n\nYou will receive 2 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 45 or more\n\nAbout US$ 33\n\n\n\n★3 Pins★\n\n\nYou will receive 3 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 60 or more\n\nAbout US$ 43\n\n\n\n★4 Pins★\n\n\nYou will receive 4 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 75 or more\n\nAbout US$ 54\n\n\n\n★5 Pins★\n\n\nYou will receive 5 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 90 or more\n\nAbout US$ 65\n\n\n\n★6 Pins★\n\n\nYou will receive 6 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 105 or more\n\nAbout US$ 75\n\n\n\n★7 Pins★\n\n\nYou will receive 7 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 120 or more\n\nAbout US$ 86\n\n\n\n★8 Pins★\n\n\nYou will receive 8 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 135 or more\n\nAbout US$ 97\n\n\n\n★9 Pins★\n\n\nYou will receive 9 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 150 or more\n\nAbout US$ 107\n\n\n\n★10 Pins★\n\n\nYou will receive 10 hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs ★\n\nIf you wish to order more than 10 pins, please add 15 SGD for each additional pin to this pledge! ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 13 or more\n\nAbout US$ 10\n\n\n\n★Early Bird Tier★\n\n\nYou will receive 1 first grade hard enamel pin of your choice from the unlocked designs at a discount! ★\n\nIf you wish to add more than one pin, add +$13 SGD for each additional pin you would like to receive! ★\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n10 backers""}]",17.0,2

Hello! I started this card series to raise awareness for mental health, and to celebrate Pride Month. Due to the Covid-19 lockdown in many countries, many people have found it excruciatingly difficult being cooped up at home. This is especially felt more so for those who might face mental issues, such as depression and anxiety.
I wanted something cute to brighten up the day and cheer people onwards, hence the bunnies and all of colours of the rainbow leading up to a full rainbow. The message I wanted to send across, along with the title ""Just so you know"" could point to many different things. For me, I want to let you know that I care, that I am here to listen to you. I hear you, and I want you to know that step by step, you'll eventually be able to reach the rainbow. I hope you'll be able to smile like the bunnies in the card!

Thresholds of Being official poster







“The poet speaks on the threshold of being,” observes philosopher Gaston Bachelard in The Poetics of Space. So too does the artist. 


Our exhibition, Thresholds of Being, stages a meditative inquiry into what it means to be caught in the indeterminate spaces between established structures of thought, feeling, and experience. What is the poetic and artistic imagination? What happens when the artist stands in the liminal spaces between the familiar and alien, the known and the unknown?


❁❁❁❁❁❁❁❁❁❁❁❁


In 2018, Xuan and Sheryl saw (and recognised) that each other’s works were, for all their differences, curiously complementary. The seeds of the show were sown a long way back, when Mr Ivan Ng and Mr Chia Wei Hou were our A-Level teachers; they encouraged us to show our works together, and we met for the first time in 2019 to try to make this possible.
However, being 6747 miles apart, and going through a global pandemic threw a spanner in the works, and having our works held in such uncertainty drew a lot of fear. Eventually, in 2021, we finally managed to find a space that would be willing to take us in. Walking around the empty room, somehow we, and our works, felt lonely, holding a space that could accommodate so much more. How could we expand ourselves, so that the themes and sensibilities that we were so interested in might come into view more meaningfully?
We decided to reach out to other artists who we knew, and whose practices had left an impression on us, to see if they had works which dealt with a similar sense of being caught between things — of needing to speak, without words, in the gaps between established structures of thought, feeling, and experience.




Sheryl Gwee, Earth Sky (2018). Projection, bowls, mirrors.





The works we have encountered embody this quality of suspension between defined binaries. Xuan’s ma (妈) and Celine’s birth life death rebirth probe the porous boundaries between life and death, while Elizabeth’s animations and Joel’s paintings evoke dreamlike states of consciousness where everyday realities dissolve into a sense of the sublime. In A Brief Moment Of and Untitled (12:34), Angelica and Ker Wey grapple with the experience of time, which renders all things transitory. Even matter, in one of its most substantial forms — ceramics — takes on an ambiguous, almost nebulous quality of in-betweenness in Sheryl’s installation, Contain. Anya’s work destabilises the lines between the natural and the spiritual, inviting viewers to stand on the threshold between the material and the immaterial.

This is the first time that the both of us are curating and organising an exhibition and we’re excited to present some really impressive work at starch, an independent artist-run space in Singapore. For some of us, it will be our first show back home after interacting in educational spaces beyond Singapore, as well as an avenue to give back to home, and it means a lot to us to be able to make this happen. We are all young, emerging artists and your support will go a long way in bringing our practices to light. We’re hoping to give a token of appreciation to starch too, as the space has provided us with lots of resources, and is an important venue in Singapore for new and experimental work beyond state-run arts institutions.

The successful funding of our show will contribute to these specific costs;

  Printing costs (exhibition handouts, catalogue, posters, postcards) - 25%
  Artist’s fee: Profits from sale of extra catalogues, posters and postcards during the duration of the exhibition will also go to artists - 30% 
  Donation to starch - 11%
  Food for the artists and the opening reception - 6%
  Miscellaneous costs (eg. repairing equipment, patching walls, Instagram Ads) - 15%
  Kickstarter/payment processing fee - 10%
  Buffer costs - 3%","As a number of us are located overseas, there is always a 7-12 hour time difference that may impede the speed of the work done, the bulk of which is completed online (thanks to Google docs and sheets!). Orders may not be completed by the opening night, especially with catalogues, but we will expect them to be completed by the end of the show month.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\n###\n\n\nsincere thanks from all 8 of us ♥\nIncludes:\n\n\nInvitation to private view\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 10 or more\n\nAbout US$ 8\n\n\n\n;;;\n\n\nall printed material to be collected in-person, unless stated otherwise!\nIncludes:\n\n\nExhibition handout\n\n\n1 postcard of choice (signed)\n\n\nInvitation to private view\n\n\nA4 Poster\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2022\n\n\nShips to\nOnly Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout US$ 36\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\nall printed material to be collected in-person, unless stated otherwise!\nIncludes:\n\n\nExhibition handout\n\n\n3 postcards of choice (signed)\n\n\nInvitation to private view\n\n\nA4 Poster\n\n\nExhibition catalogue\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2022\n\n\nShips to\nOnly Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 100 or more\n\nAbout US$ 72\n\n\n\n***\n\n\nall printed material to be collected in-person, unless stated otherwise!\nIncludes:\n\n\nExhibition handout\n\n\nInvitation to private view\n\n\nExhibition catalogue\n\n\nAll postcards of choice (signed)\n\n\nA3 Poster\n\n\nInvitation to closing night\n\n\nSpecial thanks on our exhibition catalogue\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2022\n\n\nShips to\nOnly Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 499 or more\n\nAbout US$ 356\n\n\n\n~~~\n\n\nall printed material to be collected in-person, unless stated otherwise!\nIncludes:\n\n\nExhibition handout\n\n\nInvitation to private view\n\n\nExhibition catalogue\n\n\nAll postcards of choice (signed)\n\n\nA3 Poster\n\n\nInvitation to closing night\n\n\nSpecial thanks on our exhibition catalogue\n\n\nSpecial thanks on exhibition wall\n\n\nSpecial thanks on exhibition handout\n\n\nSpecial installation tour at starch pre-show\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2022\n\n\nShips to\nOnly Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""}]",2.0,0

Our goal at MILÉNEAL  (mi·lɛ nēəl) is to be a new and emerging brand of watches catering to an exclusive niche - the young and dynamic working class mainly comprised of millennials. Our design is an emphasis of a stylish combination of comfort, quality and versatility. We want to provide a solution to the millennials to own a timepiece that is of good quality, design & style. Saving up for an overpriced luxury watch would take a while, but time waits for nobody. At Mileneal, we believe the time is now.























 The Majestic Ocean Blue | A design inspired by the ocean's blue waters







 The Luminous Aurora Green | A design inspired by the northern lights phenomenon









The Winter Silver | A design inspired by one of the four seasons.























Inspired By Nature
 The Prestige is a piece inspired by nature - The Majestic Blue of the Deep Oceans & The Luminous Green of The Northern Lights. In order to re-create the breathtaking beauty of these two wondrous phenomenons on a timepiece, we came down to the idea of fume dials. Fume dials are not new and have already been seen in some luxury brands such as H. Moser & Cie. These dials are created using a method of multiple-layer paint application in order to achieve a smooth and beautiful gradient. Coupled with a ""sunray"" pattern, we were able to create a face that captures light at different angles, mimicking the changing glows seen in both natural phenomenons








With the idea in mind, we started of with a rough sketch and then transitioning into a 3D wireframe.









After which, we had the construction drawing drafted and started making samples out of it.

















 For each sample, we have our team wear it over a course of 6 months to see how it fairs over time.







 And over the course of 6 months, we noted areas which need to be improved or modified. 








With these, we went through a few revisions until we were finally satisfied with the outcome.















                             

























































Since day 1 MILÉNEAL was created, our intent was to introduce quality watches made accessible to everyone. The Prestige's case is made of 316L Surgical Grade Stainless Steel, making it resistant to corrosion over time. In the heart of the watch, two options will be given - Swiss Ronda Quartz / Miyota Automatic. Both movements have been used extensively in the watch making industry and have proven reliability. Meanwhile, the watch face will be protected by a Sapphire Coated K1 Crystal with a raised dome shape, giving the watch much organic touch, very much like that of the nature phenomenons.

Debtzilla is a fun cooperative Superhero board game where players have to work together to achieve victory over Debtzilla and its villains. To achieve victory, players must power up their heroes and defeat all the villains and confront Debtzilla as the final boss before Debtzilla grows too powerful and initiates the Debt Apocalypse or when all the citizens are bankrupted. Each superhero has a different playing style and hero synergies are important in beating the game.







A turn is played over the following PHASES:







The key to winning the game is to find the balance between powering up your heroes and preventing Debtzilla from becoming too strong:
 
Powering up your heroes too quickly by over borrowing money to buy gadgets will allow you to defeat Villains quickly and prevent citizen bankruptcy. However, your borrowings will grow Debtzilla's power more, speeding up Debt Apocalypse.
Powering up your heroes too slowly by saving money conservatively will allow villains to run rampant and bankrupt too many citizens, leading to defeat as Debtzilla will quickly wipe out the few surviving citizens   


To win the game, all heroes are to work as a team and take on the below duties to maximize the chance of killing the ultimate boss - Debtzilla :   

Early Game hero - Borrows money aggressively and buy gadgets early to prevent villains from running rampant.
 

Late Game hero - Starts slow but build up a strong cashflow to buy powerful Gadgets to take out difficult villains and Debtzilla later in the game.


Support hero - Focuses on slowing down Debtzilla by paying down debt and buying team support gadgets. Generally weak during fights. 

Specialist hero - Specializes in clearing difficult villains with weak points such as ""0"" and ""7"" that is outside of the normal dice range.


Once you have taken out Debtzilla, challenge a even more difficult boss: Instead of debt, Inflationsaurus feeds on luxury spendings and team discipline is key in defeating it.







 







 


 







                                                    







  







 



 









 


  







 


 







 


 







 


 







 


 







 








 


 







  







 

 







 







Debtzilla was initially conceptualized during our design of Wongamania: Banana Economy. At that point of time, we wanted to present the 2007 financial debt crisis in a more creative manner and we got our inspiration from Godzilla. Godzilla is a fearsome Kaiju that feeds on nuclear power and is a force that destroys both friends and foes. Debt has the same double edged sword effect as nuclear power and hence Debtzilla is born as a representation of the destructive power of the growing debt problem around the world.Debtzilla, was well received after Wongamania: Banana Economy is launched and many people asked us, ""Why is Debtzilla only represented by a card in the game? We want to fight Debtzilla!"" Hence the idea of turning Debtzilla into a standalone board game was conceived. At that point of time, there was a lot of discussion about Spiderman as a result of the reintroduction of the character back into the Marvel universe. We were inspired by the struggles of Peter Parker as a financially strapped young man, trying to juggle between school work, part time jobs and vigilante activities. That's when the key design concept of Debtzilla was born: Players get to role play as a secret identity superheros dealing with problems as a salaryman and as a vigilante. And if that's not bad enough, we have Debtzilla as the final boss lurking in the background feeding on the very financial woes of the superheroes. We shared the theme and concept with many people and the idea received universal thumbs up and hence, Project Debtzilla is born.... Check out our designer diary and find out more about the design and production process of Debtzilla!

These dice series are using fluorescent materials in combination with glitters.

 











Each polyhedral set includes seven pieces: d4, d6, d8, d10, d%, d12, and d20. There is only one design available at the moment. They can be used for Table RPG games, or as an upgrade of other board games.

















At the same time, it is highly appreciated if you can share about our project with friends, online groups or the local community. We are manufacturing the dice in parallel. Once the campaign is over, hopefully, we can ship the dice immediately. 



































Shipping
Dice ship directly from the factory to your doormat, still hot!
Shipping will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign based on how many you buy and where you live. The estimated cost for the first set of dice is 6 USD. For each subsequent set is 2 USD.
The estimated ship date is May 2021. We will keep the backers updated with the shipping status.









New to Kickstarter?
Just follow the steps below to become a backer:

  Step 1. Choose the reward level you want to back at the right side of this page.
  Step 2. Fill in all the necessary information about you, especially the address you want the dices to mail to.
  Step 3. Click the ""pledge"" button on the page! Just wait for the Fluorescent Dices!










Why are we doing crowdfunding?
Kickstarting will help us exposed the dice to lovers, to understand what they like and what they want. It is a direct communication channel where we can get first-hand message. More importantly, the funding result gives us an idea of how many to produce.
When the fund is collected, we are going to use them for manufacturing: raw material purchasing and cover man-hours. We already have the existing mold cast. So our colleagues will pour the resin inside the molds. After cooling, taking them out and polish them. After polishing, we will paint the numbers by hand. This takes a lot of effort and cannot be automated. So your kindly support is highly appreciated.

Pip&Jo is a Singaporean children’s wear brand. We commit to producing the highest quality organic childrenswear that provides the best comfort and is harmless to the child’s health and environment. 


We offer gender-neutral clothing for newborns up to children of four years old. A minimalist design is incorporated with fresh, playful prints and colors. Each collection is designed to be comfortable, sustainable, and stylish. 


The brand name Pip&Jo came from the term ‘Pip’ defined as ‘seeds’ and ‘Jo’ that is taken from the word ‘joy’. The ‘Pip’ also represents the brand’s commitment in using organic and natural materials. With this, the brand would like to give the best joy to the little growing seeds.









Pip&Jo's goal in creating Kickstarter is to raise funds for us to do more research on the sustainable childrenswear market and finding more ethical and sustainable materials and production processes. It has been challenging to find a manufacturer in Indonesia and Singapore that supply GOTS organic cotton with the same commitment to quality, sustainability and transparency. Thus, the funds earned will also be used to find more ethical and sustainable materials and manufacturers. We hope to bring this brand to life in the near future. Every dollar earned from this campaign is bringing Pip&Jo closer to achieving its dream.


This crowdfunding project will also be supporting and helping little friends who are less fortunate. We will be donating to MILK Fund, a Singapore-based non-profit organization, to provide our little friends with medical treatment, educational support, and other special needs.









Pip&Jo was developed by Audrey Clarissa, an International Fashion Business student in Singapore. The thought of creating a childrenswear brand started when I noticed that my younger cousins and nephews have sensitive skin and get rashes easily. I began to have an interest in the childrenswear market and decided to use the idea to create a brand for my Bachelor's Degree final project. I carried out research on suitable materials and also the market demand. The results pointed to organic cotton materials that are designed into fashionable and comfortable children's clothing. 


Thus, Pip&Jo is created with the idea to bring comfortable and playful clothing children can grow in. 









Pip&Jo aims to be Singapore's leading children's wear brand that can bring happiness to the little loved ones. Pip&Jo is dedicated to produce and offer the finest quality children's wear by using organic and natural materials that provide the best comfort and are harmless to the child’s health and the environment. Our products are made of organic cotton fabric that is hypoallergenic and breathable. It is also printed and dyed with eco-friendly dyes that are OEKO-Tex Standard 100 certified, which ensures textiles are safe from harmful substances and environmentally friendly. Eco-friendly dyes use less water in the process which only requires 10% of water compared to traditional dyes.


Additionally, Pip&Jo also commits to being socially responsible and will be sharing our happiness with those who are less fortunate by donating to MILK Fund (Mainly I Love Kids Fund). MILK Fund is a Singapore based non-profit organization that supports children from low-income families suffering from medical issues and special needs. The organization assists with educational support and medical treatments.","The most challenging factor of this project is to find suppliers and manufacturers with GOTS certified organic cotton that meet Pip&Jo's sustainability criteria, with a low minimum order quantity. Our aim is to find suppliers and manufacturers who are local or near Singapore to fit the brand's expected production cost. 

As for this campaign, there will be several risks and challenges. There is a chance of unexpected delays in production and shipping. The prints and colors of the garments may be slightly different from the images due to lighting and editing. We are also still adjusting and the colors that have a similar tone with Pip&Jo's color palette. 

For those who pledged S$85 or S$100, please make sure to order the right size that will fit for a month later.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 10 or more\n\nAbout $8\n\n\n\nTHANKYOU Postcard\n\n\nThank you very much for the support on this journey!

We are Albert & Owen, a team of landscape architecture design students embarking on our journey to design, create and realize our very first crowdfunding project on kickstarter.
Last Empire took months to be complete as we wanted to express our skill in design and imagination in the best possible way for our first kickstarter.







Besides creating a deck that is visually stunning, We also aim to create a deck of cards that features the histories of mankind and civilizations to give each card its' own character and personality. Bringing the game of poker to the next level.







Last Empire is an art and history driven concept that contains a set of 52-poker cards in each deck, featuring four vastly different civilizations that are Rome, Persia, China and Britons. All of which are represented by renowned and notable kings, queens and warriors of their own respective civilizations in the form of a monochromatic design. Using the hierarchy of shapes and patterns we aim to create interesting visuals that enhances the character and presence of each card. Our cards will be printed on silver / gold base colored cards. Some of the samples can be seen in the image below. (Cards printed are all WJPCC approved cards)


Preview of The Cards













Last Empire is simply more than just another deck of poker cards. Every card is specially designed individually by us and features different characters, history and culture.

Each poker card suit (Spade, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds) features a different civilization. The spade features the Britons, the diamond features Rome, the Jack features the Chinese while the hearts features the Persians.







Each character has its' own personalized story that are based on historical records as close as possible which will also featured in the fold-up pamphlets that is part of the stretch goals.

Our box is specially designed to bring off the idea and essence of medieval warfare which is in-tune with our design concept for all our card designs. The inspiration for the box design stems from the idea and arrangement of chess pieces for the back cover. While the design for the front is inspired by the designs of war banners most notably the Briton war banners.

The reason why it took so long to complete is because we wanted to have everything from the designs to the production all thought out of before looking to crowdfund our first product.

Possible challenges that we may face along the way are the delivery of cards and the printing quality for each card. There is always a possibility of delay of the delivery date due to unforeseeable and foreseeable circumstances such as printing and packaging delay by the manufacturer which are out of our control. However, these are all minor issues as the product will still be sent to the backers once received regardless of delay. As for the printing quality for each card, it will be resolved by us requesting for a sample deck before production to assure that the cards are up to quality for using and selecting the right company to process and print out the cards.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nTreat us a drink?\n\n\nConversion rate : US$1 = SGD$2\n\nYour help and drink will be greatly appreciated :)\n\nYou will receive :\n\n- Progressive updates on Facebook\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 7 or more\n\nAbout $6\n\n\n\nSupport Us!\n\n\nConversion rate : US$5 = SGD$7\n\nThank you for supporting Last Empire project and possibly making it a reality!

OUR PAST WORKS




Playing Cards by Skymember Presents","As discussed in the trailer and story, one of the biggest challenges for our team was finding the right manufacturer for such an ambitious project. By having a dedicated production line in the factory, we can proudly say that we’re now able to print playing cards and tuck cases entirely in-house. We have complete control of the production, so no worries here. 

We have solved the production issue, so what's next? Fulfillment. To ensure you guys can receive your pledge as soon as possible, we've teamed up with DHL E-commerce to fulfill the NON-USA orders. For all USA orders, we will ship with our fulfillment partner in the USA. No worries, they are professional in this. To reduce the risk of parcels getting damage during transit, our team has decided not only to subsidy the shipping fees but also designed a custom protector for this project. 

The only problem that we foresaw at the moment is uncertainty due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The pandemic might cause a slight delay in shipping or minor changes in the raw materials for production. Despite that, as a professional Playing Cards and Magic tricks publishing company, Skymember Presents committed to provide the best experiences to you guys. We will do whatever we capable of of to complete the products in tip-top quality and hands them to you in no time.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 37 or more\n\nAbout US$ 27\n\n\n\nSpecial Edition

They enjoy nerf, archery tag or foam sword tag but these games lack unbias scoring, and they could not have gameplay involving laser tag and other tag gaming or computer fighting games.   Tony commenced the development of a gaming sword that can be used for laser tag and various gaming in 2014. Currently the team has 6 engineers, 3 designers and 2 business persons: •	Tony Tan, Multipurpose Ninja, (University of Cambridge, UK), •	Vincent Lee, Hardware Ninja (Loughborough University, UK), •	Jacqueline, Money Ninja (NTU, Singapore), 
•	John, Marketing Ninja (SMU, Singapore), •	Vincent Poon, Production Ninja (Singapore Polytechnics), •	Starie, Design Ninja (NUS, Singapore), •	Winston, Electronic Ninja (University of Southeastern Philippines), •	Kelvin, Electronic Ninja (NUS, Singapore), •	Shuling, IT Ninja (Nanyang Polytechnics), •	Jefri, Animation Ninja (LaSalle College of the Arts, Singapore), •	Arthur Gomes, Graphic Ninja (Gracom School of Visual Effects, Brazil) working to improve the capabilities of the gaming sword in consultation with manufacturers in Singapore and China. The 1st laser tag sword is called RezaSword (Reza means laser in Japanese), which has motion triggered sound effects. The wireless sensor, RezaSensor, is secured onto belt and packs itself with sensors for both long and short range sensing.  After 2 years of development, and feedbacks from showcasing the prototypes in USA New York Toy Fair in Feb 2015, Singapore's Largest Indoor Laser Tag Centre in Mar 2015 and Hong Kong Rise in Jul 2015, 1st laser tag sword with dual mode: sword/gun and is launched in the laser tag facility in Singapore in Nov 2015.

 Next frontier for Laser Tag is Part-real-Part-virtual Gameplay. Packed with a suite of wireless modules, emitters and sensors, the laser tag sword is built to integrate with sensor belt and Kungfu tag vest, and to wirelessly connect to PC/mobile platform and/or smartglass/oculus for gaming.This project aims to realise the Part-real-Part-virtual gameplay concept as described below.
•	Laser tag and PC games    	A laser tag player partners its 3D character e.g. a Dragon running on PC game for a part-real-part-virtual gameplay against another laser tag player who partners a 3D Ninja character for a gaming duel.  In this game setting, the “real” portion is the 2 laser tag players and “virtual” portion is the 3D dragon and ninja characters developed using Unity3D and coming alive on a PC/mobile platform and/or smartglass/oculus. To realise this, we need to develop the API for the RezaSword and its SDK for Unity3D. 
•	Laser, archery and various tag games    	A laser tag gaming is mixed with archery tag using non-lethal arrows, or nerf or foam sword fight for a part-real-part-virtual gameplay.  In this game setting, the “virtual” portion is the laser tag where the “laser” beam is invisible while the “real” portion is non-lethal arrow / foam sword / nerf darts. To realise this, we need to integrate the wireless sensors to produce the Kungfu Tag Vest.What We Need & What You Get
The USD$18,000 fund is required to pay for 
•	US$13,000 to fund the external development of the API for the RezaSword and its SDK for Unity3D which can be used for development of PC games using the RezaSword on window platforms. •	US$5,000 to fund further prototyping and production of the Kungfu Tag Vest and the integration of the sensors to ensure that the long range and short range sensing works harmoniously, and the sensitivity of the sensing does not give rise to incorrect scoring like when one accidentally touches the vest.In return, we are •	Providing VVIP e-tickets for supporters in or flying into Singapore, where one of our team members will host the gameplay at http://www.tagteaminc.sg/downtown-east/ and update our supporters the latest development •	Offering laser tag swords and kungfu tag vest ahead of sale to the public and at promotional price •	Offering exclusive partnership business deals for those who are interested to be our resellers of the laser tag sword and kungfu tag vestOther Way You Can Help

Baku are supernatural, mythological creatures from japanese folklore that are said to devour dreams and nightmares. A child experiencing a nightmare will wake up and repeat three times, ""Baku-san, come eat my dream."" Legends say that the baku will come into the child’s room and devour the bad dream, allowing the child to go back to sleep peacefully. The baku can also be summoned for protection from bad dreams prior to falling asleep at night. It was common for children in the past to keep a baku talisman nearby when they slept.







The goal amount will allow me to produce 100 of these cuddly Baku plushes, cover shipping, packaging, rewards and kickstarter fees.















The Baku plush measures a big 30cm / 11.8inches and is a perfectly huggable size for keeping by your bedside or for comfort during scary nights. Made out of soft minky fabric, the plush features all the details from my illustrated design including a defined round shape, soft fluffy ears, embroidered eyes and spots as well as a large, detailed tail































The plush has gone through many reiterations over the past year and i'm really satisfied with this current prototype so far. I do however have plans to just change the position and colour of the embroidered spots to a similar colour to its limbs to keep it consistent and accurate with the main concept. Here's a small look at the design process! 















 Baku Plush - SGD$40









 Small talisman rewards - SGD$13 each

My name is Shermaine Tan (call me Sherms!) and I am an illustrator and designer based in Singapore. Growing up steeped in Asian culture, my goal is to draw awareness to and share the many tales that have been passed down from generation to generation! I am especially drawn to folktales and mythical creatures from japan. As someone who was always afraid of nightmares, the story about Baku was one of my favourite stories from childhood and was a creature that stood out to me. This Baku design was first conceptualised in a short student film done during my time in animation school and has since then been redesigned many times throughout the years.

 Thank you so much for taking the time to look at this project and I hope that you enjoy this Baku design. :)

www.twitter.com/shermstan","I have successfully completed 2 Kickstarter projects so far and am very familiar with the process! However, this will be the first time I will be working on plush toys, so there might be a learning curve to master. Fortunately, the company I am working with has been super helpful in guiding me through the process. After long nights of slogging away at the computer designing and making the template for the plush, everything is completed, and all we need now are funds and loving homes for the Baku plush.

I have given the campaign a month's buffer time just in case there are any problems with production! If the new colour variant stretch goal is reached, the production time might increase as well. I will update my backers every step of the way so that you will always know which part of the production process we're currently in.

I have been collecting playing cards and creating playing card art since 2009. In the past two years, I've also dabbled in resin art and have produced numerous cardistry trainers, including collaborations with other companies. 
My goal with the Danger Decks is to produce something that I think you will love to use every single day, whether you are a magician, cardist, or even a card collector looking for a unique deck of cards.
Let's face it: most playing card Kickstarters often take too long from the project's release date to the backers actually receiving their pledge rewards.
However, with the Danger Decks, the cards themselves are already in production as you are reading this! The aim of running this campaign is therefore to raise awareness and funds for logistics and fulfillment fees once it is funded. This also means that if you support the Danger Decks, you will receive your rewards FASTER than most other playing card projects out there!

Danger Decks are inspired by the signs we see around us in our everyday life. Be it directional, safety, or warning signs, they are very eye-catching despite the minimalistic design.  We want to capture the magic behind these designs and bring to you playing cards that are simple and bold.

We have the hardcopy proof of High Voltage Deck from USPCC and we're happy to say that the decks you see in these photos will be the same quality and design as what we'll be delivering out to all the backers!


OH! Have I forgotten to mention that every order includes an exclusive High Voltage Sticker? These are high-quality, waterproof, removable white vinyl-style stickers with a semi-glossy look. As these are more limited than the number of decks printed, while stock lasts!




Danger: High Voltage Sticker







In this project, I have also made a very limited run of hand-made trainers.  There will only be 5 sets available. Each set contains 5 pieces of trainers for your cardistry practice needs! They will only be available through the ""$96 High Voltage Trainer Set"" Pledge Tier.
I have spent 2 years experimenting with different methods of creating trainers and testing out the various brands of resin. I strive to deliver the best cardistry trainers in the world, with each and every single piece being hand-made individually. 
Each set of trainers also come packaged in high-quality polypropylene (PP) plastic case. Frosted coating on sides and backs for easy grip. Hinged on one side connecting lid and body and snaps closes on the other side. Protects your trainers from bumps and scratches.
Features of our hand-made trainers:

  Solid, clear, glossy look (non-yellow)
  Transparent borders
  Practice cardistry easily as it slides effortlessly when broken in
  Sticks together when pressure is applied against each other
  Double-backed design 
  Thickness of 5 pieces is equivalent to the thickness of a deck of cards
  Waterproof and virtually split proof

*Please expect slight variation due to the nature of hand-made products*

Add-on Earrings: 
I have also included a special run of hand-made hook-style High Voltage earrings, which will only be available exclusively to this Kickstarter project. With a design inspired by the cards themselves, the earrings possess a translucent look where the design can be seen through from the front to the back.
The hook of the earrings is made of electroplated metal.
They will be fulfilled separately from your main orders. The earrings will be shipped out by June 2021. Please add-on $28  to your existing pledge should you wish to order a pair of these bold but beautiful earrings.

The project is the outcome of months of research and development and it has finally reached a stage where it is ready to test into the Singapore market. About the ProjectFast fashion is changing the face of the planet as we know it not in terms of the number of customers opting for it or its high turn over but in a way you would never imagine: the fashion industry is one of the highest polluters in terms of the carbon emission and textile waste it is leaves.There is a noticeable shift from quantity to quality due to the change of mindset as the shoppers get more mature. There is a lack of awareness amongst the population is one of the major causes (due to the lack of manufacturing in the country) which gives way to these novelty buys. Their exposure to the impact is the bare minimum and they have to convey this information in a which is digestible and desirable to the Singapore market through a sustainable fashion magazine. This is where KEY was born. The magazine will have two hard copy issue a year (bookzine to engage in experiential marketing) as well as an e-magazine platform. It will also have a subscription box service in collaboration with sustainable brands to gain more revenue and treat their clientele. In collaboration with sustainable fashion organisations, the aim is to be an approachable, stylish, contemporary magazine which creates a desire for the products.The First Issue: TRANSPARENCYEach issue of the magazine will center around an important issue in the sustainability field that needs to be addressed. The first issue is centered around the importance of transparency in the fashion industry.  I few tpics we cover in the first issue are as follows:
Susutainable fashion designer's (zero waste garments) editorial shoot
Wearing is Caring- the impact on what we wear
Fashion week's top trends replicated 
Celebrities take on Sustainable fashion 
Luxury finds on a budget
And much more!
Why we need your help?

 Changing a mindset takes a lot of TLC- you heard that right, Time, Labour and Compensation/ Contributions. The concept is something that needs to be known, shared and desired and we know with your help that's achievable. Over the last 3 months, we have created the content for the first issue and it's wonderful. We have put in the time and the labour but we need your help to fulfil the C. Given the amount of research we have conducted we feel like we are ready to test the market with the final product and for this, we need to print the first batch of issues (50) which will be presented at an exhibition (To be announced at a later date). We want to be able to hold KEY in our hands, share it with our family and be a part of something bigger. Meet The TeamNatasha Rodrigues (Founder): Along with creating the magazine, I'm in charge of almost all the activities including- art direction of the magazine, creative direction on shoots, coordination and operations of the departments and the logistics departments, graphic design activities, etc.The team is entirely student-produced (undergraduates/ freshers)Paper Plane Productions: Video Production and Promotion Partners of the Magazine Creative Team:

The Future of KEYOnce we have got the ball rolling there's no telling where this project could go. The first print could open up avenues we never thought were imaginable and look at the responsiveness of the market could lead to the second round of production along with the second issue being produced. An entire phase programme has been created for its launch and after and if all goes well there nowhere but up and execution. More Fashion, More Quality, A Better World. 


Cover Shoot: Shot by HO ZHENG FENG","The final copy is ready to go, we just need your help to spread the word. The toughest challenge with a project like this is in terms of investments to keep the magazine running while the brand is being created. It requires financial investments for the printing of the first issue to test it at the exhibition. If the magazine doesn't get funded it will remind an online platform but will lack an experiential element (omnichannel- hard copy issue).","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout $4\n\n\n\nDigital Thank You Card\n\n\nA FRIEND indeed is what you are!

A short introduction
Hey there, we are V1PER, a small business where we turn our ideas into fine quality products. We are very excited to be launching our first Kickstarter as well as our first clothing line. We strive to achieve products that you can wear on any occasion, ranging from the gym all the way to casual daily wear.


V1PER Collection
V1PER started when we realised that many well-known companies charge a hefty price for a piece of clothing that doesn't require as much cost as they sell it for. We at V1PER plan to even out the stakes and provide reasonable prices for products that are actually worth the amount our customers are paying. We have a wide range of sizes ranging from 4XS all the way to 5XL(for the T-shirts) and all the way to 2XL(for the hoodies), we would like to cater to every need of our customers. To make it even better, the prices remain the same for all the clothes sizes!


Our goal is for V1PER to be a name that is on par with other smaller companies before we proceed to become a bigger and more established brand with the help of our customers. As we grow together as a brand, there will most definitely be an increase of products made under us, ranging from big popular items like joggers to small accessories such as hats and so much more! 


V1PER T-Shirts









The picture above shows the 4 colours that we are intending to manufacture for now. But do not fret, as we will definitely include even more popular colours for the public if this kick starter is a success! 
The pictures below are a closer in-depth look at our simple yet stylish design as well as the 2 Fabrics that we intend to use as our materials known as ""Comfy Cotton CT51"" and ""Cool Tech Dri Fit"".  The design is kept simple with our logo on the left side of the upper chest and the name of our brand on the right sleeve.

V1PER Pull-over Hoodies









Similarly to our T-shirts, the picture above shows the 4 colours we intend to manufacture for now. But again do not fret, as we will definitely include even more popular colours for the public if this Kickstarter is a success! 
The pictures below are a closer in-depth look at our design for the Hoodies as well as the colours that are available after success. For the Hoodies, we are using 50% Cotton & 50% Polyester The design is kept simple with our logo on the left side of the upper chest. 




































These are the attractive colours we offer!





To wrangle it all up!
We hope that V1PER does take off to become a decent business that benefits everyone. The reason we chose the name V1PER is that the number 1 in the name stands for how we intend to treat our customers; with the best. V1PER is also inspired by the fact that vipers have a worldwide habitat range which is what we are trying to accomplish too; to be able to reach worldwide and be used in any form of scenarios. To get updates, follow us here;  https://www.instagram.com/tk.v1per/ 


Do take note
The dates which we give to our customers are only a rough schedule based on predictions that everything goes well. The majority of it is dependant on the number of backers who are interested but our team will do its best to send out orders as quickly to our customers as possible. 
It takes roughly 2 weeks for the funds from you guys to reach us, during this time, our team will try their best to contact you regarding what you had Pledge.  Manufacturing from our supplier is estimated to be roughly 7 days. As soon as the products arrive to us, our team will try its best to ship them out the same following day. If there happens to be any issue or delay, our team will keep you updated to ease your worries.


Shipping Information to take note
Any orders made in Singapore may be passed by contactless delivery which may occur on the same day as ordering if stock is available.
International shipping could take a while longer depending on your area. Our team will inform you of when it will arrive after we post it with constant updates to ease your mind.
Please note that if any customs or import charges occur, you are responsible for them.","With any projects, there are always risks that arrive when creating them. Our team at V1PER plans to reduce and eliminate as many of the risks that may appear. We have predicted a smooth sailing launch and distribution of our clothing line to which we are confident it will run smoothly.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 13 or more\n\nAbout US$ 10\n\n\n\nV1PER T-Shirt\n\n\nIncluded;\n\n-V1per T-shirt colour of your choice\n\n-A custom \""thank you\"" note to show our appreciation for your contribution\nIncludes:\n\n\nV1PER T-Shirt\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 17 or more\n\nAbout US$ 13\n\n\n\nV1PER Pull-Over Hoodie\n\n\nIncluded;\n\n-Pull-over hoodie colour of your choice\n\n-A custom \""thank you\"" note to show our appreciation for your contribution\nIncludes:\n\n\nV1PER Pull-Over Hoodie\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 33 or more\n\nAbout US$ 24\n\n\n\nSecret Club\n\n\nShush... \n\nBeing part of the secret club grants you,\n\n-A discount every following purchase.\n\n-An invitation to join company meetings to brainstorm new ideas.\n\n-Sneak-peak at newly made designs\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (10 left of 10)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout US$ 36\n\n\n\nBe part of the Team!\n\n\nYou will be part of our first batch of Brand Ambassadors. \n\n-You will receive a first-hand look at any newly made product and be given it for free if it launches.\n\n-You are given your own custom discount code\n\n-You are to promote the brand and attract lovely customers\n\n-More details will be provided if you give us an email! \n\n-You will also receive a custom made item from the company to thank you on your pledge and welcome you to the team!!!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (5 left of 5)""}]",0.0,0

 Shipping Costs and Custom Duties  INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:  Every pledge for the Arc Board outside of Singapore will include an indicative cost for shipping. When we finalize shipping costs after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will have an update on the actual costs with you.   PLEASE NOTE:  Some countries may have additional duties, taxes or other charges applied through customs. We will not be able to cover for these costs and would advise that you contact your local customs office if you are unsure of what these costs may be.","Certification is a notoriously challenging task to get done for hardware products. We have built strong corporation relationship with manufacturers in Shenzhen, who will assist us in getting relative certifications. And we still have five months to work on the documents.
We are still working on the product to make it more diversified and adaptable. And there is a chance that you may like the product we put forward later after some modifications. In addressing that, we will offer you a chance to change the type of pillow you want before shipping off the product for you.
So far, we have been forecasting our past timelines and sticking to them accurately. With our productivity and enthusiasm, we are firmly convinced that we will be able to stick to the timeline in the future.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nGENEROUS SUPPORT\n\n\nThank you!

Kickstarter has a “pledge now, pay at the end of the campaign” option. Meaning that you will only be charged if this project reaches its goal. You can change your pledge or cancel your pledge at any point during the campaign. which means :  



  🌻  If the goal is not reached, everything will be cancelled and you will not be charged for anything!




  🌻  If the goal is reached, you will be charged for the amount you pledge. A survey will then be sent out so that you can let me know which pin(s)/Print(s)/Charm you want. 




  🌻 Kickstarter then will take anywhere from 2 weeks to a month to transfer the amount to me after that the production will start!❤ once I receive the pins, they will be quickly inspected and then a second survey will be sent out asking for your address so that your pins can be sent to you!



At the end of the campaign, only the pins that have been unlocked are the ones everyone will have a choice between! pledge to unlock the design you want  🌸 
After which I will send out a survey via Backer kit for you to select your chose which items you want!


Please note that you cannot change your pledge amount or add items after the campaign ends. Please pledge for all the items you may want during the funding period to get the special Kickstarter pricing.


Pledging actively helps unlock designs! Just because a stretch goal is locked, doesn't mean you can't pledge for it. Pledge for all items you want, regardless of unlock status to ensure that stretch goals get unlocked.


If you have any questions I am always available. This can be done by contacting me via Instagram which is the fastest method or leaving a comment!  My email is manmiart@gmail.com so you can email me if you wish to ask me anything about this campaign or any products now and in the future!


UK BACKERS PLEASE NOTE THE VAT AND CUSTOM DUTIES WOULD BE NEEDED TO BE PAID BY YOU. 









🧁June 20th: Campaign launches


🧁Late July: Campaign ends


🧁Early August: Send surveys out


🧁Mid-August: Begin ordering reward items
🧁Mid-September: Start receiving items


🧁November: Start shipping items to backers (should receive by Mid-December 2021)","Some challenges for this project:

-Delay in arrival of products due to COVID-19.
-Delay in receiving your orders due to COVID-19
-There can be minor variation in the final products

Luckily, there aren't too many risks with making pins! However, delays can happen. Mistakes can be made in production, and pins would have to be remade. This does ensure that the pins you get are as close to perfect as possible though. The final products may be slightly different in colours, or small alterations to the design depending on the manufacturing process. I will be checking each proof thoroughly before I approve production. If any significant changes are to be made, backers will be notified.

There is the possibility of shipping delays due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the concern for lost packages, there will be tracked shipping added on to your package when you add on shipping. Although I cannot guarantee shipping times, tracking will greatly alleviate any concerns. I am grateful for your continued patience and understanding.

It was created by a fashion marketing student as a school project. The brand name came from Chinese characters which mean ‘forest’.  We support sustainable fashion and beauty by offering 100% natural face mask and adopting eco-friendly and sustainable packaging.


Brand Story




Circular Economy(SenLin)





In the middle of our brand, there are bamboo trees because use them for our packaging. Bamboo fibers are well-known for its biodegradable properties, which means bamboo products can be naturally decomposed by bacteria when it is deposed.  After it is disposed, it decomposes naturally and turns into soil. From the bamboo trees grown up from the soil, we source our packaging which are a glass jar with bamboo cap and a bamboo drawstring bag. This eco-friendly and sustainable cycle is called ""Circular Economy"", and we completely support this idea.


100% Eco-friendly and Harmless Ingredients




Modelling Mask Powder(SenLin)





Our product is made from 100% natural ingredients such as coal, tea tree and lavender. The components have gone through a safety test already.  After you mix with water and apply on your face, it turns dry and hard. When it hardens enough, you can simply peel it off. 


Tree-planting Campaign
Bamboo tree is one of the fast-growing trees and bamboo planting slow deforestation. We would like to join a ‘Plant-A-Tree’ programme twice a year held by GCF(Garden City Fund) and SEC(Singapore Environmental Council). At the same time, we will create a campaign named #plantatreesg with the tree planting communities. We will let our customers know that they can use the hashtag for their post every time they purchase our products, and they can be a part of the community just by hash tagging. Our ultimate objective of this campaign is to increase engagement with our customers and to form a big tree planting community in Singapore and overseas in the future. * No money raised through this Kickstarter campaign will be donated to charity, community or a campaign.","Since we are a small start-up business, we have low brand awareness. Moreover, still many people are not conscious of sustainability. In order to increase brand awareness and sustainable consciousness, we are planning to connect with other communities caring about the environment, and we will participate in green events and shout out our messages.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 20 or more\n\nAbout $15\n\n\n\nA Random Type of Modeling Mask\n\n\nThere are nine kinds of 100% natural powder with different effect for different skin type.

TO NOTE: 1 SET OF KARIN: MONSTER PLATTER DINNERWARE CONSIST OF 4 DIFFERENT DESIGNS OF DINNER PLATES.","We looked at every possible nook and cranny to best pair with how we want our designer plates to be made available. They not only had to look good but also affordable and durable for everyday use and special occasions. Because it's made of porcelain, these plates are considered fragile and heavy which is also equivalent to logistics nightmare. 

Finding the right factory to work with was challenge #1. We needed a reliable manufacturer, who was patient enough to answer every one of our questions (this took 2 months), who was equipped with great experience and knowledge of the base product we wanted to produce and who understood well enough how we wanted our plates to be portrayed. -- Yes! We found an extremely reliable and patient manufacturer. 

Challenge #2. Because we wanted these plates to not only be affordable and durable but also made available to as many people we can reach out to, we had to go on a mission to find the right fulfilment company, a company with worldwide warehouses. After 4 months of hunting, emails, conference calls, webinars and odd hour phone calls, we found the perfect company. They have warehouses all over the world and are also very understanding and extremely patient to figure out which warehouse/scenarios best suits us. 

Challenge #3. Once we've locked in the fulfilment portion, we had to deal with a haystack of custom mess. The three countries we've decided to send our shipment to meant tons of complicating shipping terms and paper work. Finding the perfect customs broker thus became our biggest challenge. This person had to be experienced, reliable, patient enough to answer questions, putting every shipping language into laymen terms and had to have extensive knowledgable of the industry. Very thankfully, we found one that stood out of the crowd. They are knowledgable and beyond efficient enough to give us all the custom knowledge we needed. 

After a little more than 6 months, we not only increased our knowledge with international logistics but secured great working relationships with professionals who will deliver these dinnerware to your door step in mint condition.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge £1 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nNo reward but Thank you so much for your support.

Nice to meet CHEW


Meet CHEW





CHEW is the world’s first Pocketable, Chewable, Reusable straw that comes with a recycled plastic case to Spin-Dry your straw for multiple uses through the day. Whew that’s a mouthful.


Pocketable Spin Dry!








Small and compact





CHEW is a redesign on reusable straws, planning for the whole journey rather than just the moment you drink. You should be able to enjoy your drink to the fullest, which is why we wanted to keep sipping the drink of your choice effortless and enjoyable while still letting you be eco-friendly.Reusable Straws... Kind of Suck...You always end up having to adjust to their straws rather than the other way around.Residual WaterAfter using and washing your straw, you are left with a moist and dark inner straw wall to sustain a little microbe farm.


Unexpected Accidents...





And where does all this leftover water go? Into whatever you store your straw in.



Moisture in all the wrong places





Tooth Collision


*CHINK*





Each reposition or sip becomes a painful reminder of the presence of your reusable straw.Too Long to Pocket


Butts out are hot, but straw out... maybe not...





Reusable straws are always too long to comfortably carry around.CHEW is here for you TAKE IT FOR A WHIRLCHEW allows you to dry your reusable straw by taking it out for a spin.


Spin out all the moisture! Your case features precisely engineered vents for maximum dryness!





If you hate moisture in closed cases or just the idea of moist straws freak you out, don't worry. You can spin that residual water out of your case. Although once you spin we doubt you will want to stop.CHEW TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT


Finally! A straw you can chew on!





Finally, someone did it! A chewable, reusable straw.







Chew on food grade silicone tips inspired by nature and classic geometric elements


From left to right: Wavy, Basic, Hexagonal and Tessalate





Including one Kickstarter exclusive design based on the waves of the sea.







Pocket your straw


A split so that it can fit





Designed to be portable, breaking CHEW into two allows you to slip it into any pocket. 




Unlock yourself a cool move and finish this spinning + sliding move. Slick and sexy.








Sits snugly inside your pocket.








A sleek slide into any pocket








iPhone 6 Comparison





CHEW's case even aids you in easy assembly with a simple click.


Lock it in place with a *click*





Cutting Edge For those still transitioning into an eco-friendly lifestyle, CHEW's case includes a small tip for you to cut a slit in the cover of your drink.


A cut above the rest





Struggle no more against that final barrier to your sweet drink as this simple cut allows your reusable straw to slide smoothly into your cup.




Paving the way to your sip





How do you use CHEW 


Uncap and Assemble








Pop, Lock and Pull








Slide into your drink








Sip and cHew, Chew, cheW, chEw... you get it





Minor cleaning on the go To clean your straw 


Just rinse

And spin!





Major cleaning at homeWe have also included a small brush in the whole package so you can satisfy your OCD in cleaning the case thoroughly at home. Oh that feeling.


A rinse through of your silicone tip








A scrub through your straw








And a final rinse and brush of your case at home








Strategically placed vents to allow water to flow out





Process and Inspiration










Kickstarter Exclusive PDF containing our preliminary sketches of our ideations





We went through many, many rounds of ideation, prototyping and variations. After considering, what would be the simplest wildest way to dry a straw, we arrived at a new spin on things. Taking this as a starting point we designed a straw and case which would offer a fun way to jump onto using reusable straws.Rewards









Stretch Goals

















The money from the campaign will be used to start up manufacturing cost for CHEW. After which we hope to reach more people. By backing us, you get to be a part of the change that is about to come!Meet the Team


From left to right: Tommy, Kevin, JingJie





We are a team of 3 Singapore based industrial designers. We believe that being eco-friendly is easy, if you are given the right tools. By injecting a little fun and insanity into everyday problems, we can find the solution to save the world in our own little ways.The three of us have always considered buying reusable straws, but never quite found one that met our needs. Along with many major companies choosing to ban reusable straws, we decided it was time to do something about it. Thus, CHEW was born!Share our Story","Risks and Challenges
At this stage we are in conversation with several manufacturers to find the right one to produce CHEW.
Due to tooling costs, The start up cost to manufacture is also fairly high.
Do not worry though as once we get successfully funded, we will set up a trip to the factory of our manufacturers and discussing in detail how to manufacture Chew. 
We will also personally do Quality Checks before we ship out the products to you. We do not want the case where you have to wait for us to ship you another Chew. It saves you and us time.
There are also some aspects of the CHEW which we are still refining. 
And to be very honest with you, there will be changes, but these changes will be to give you the best CHEW experience.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout US$ 4\n\n\n\nSatisfying your Curiosity\n\n\nThanks for your support.

 Better wellness is just a Kura away. 
The Problem
While people attempt to cultivate well-being practices into their daily routine, there is a lack of flexibility in existing programs, causing a failure to cater to different needs.

Why is Positive Psychology important?
Positive emotions boost job performance and are contagious in the workplace. Small, simple actions can have a big impact on our happiness, meaning that it doesn’t take much to encourage your workplace to become a happier and more positive place (Kjerulf, 2016).


One of the benefits of practising a positive psychological outlook is, to put it broadly, success! Not only does success make us happier, feeling happy and experiencing positive emotions actually increases our chances of success (Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005).

 

















Bite-sized reflections that take less than a minute to allow you to set intentions for the day. Carves out and reinforces positive neural pathways.

The Research on Positive Psychology
Why practice gratitude?
Being grateful for the things you encounter daily can brighten up your days! Incorporating gratitude in your day-to-day routine lets you view life from a more optimistic and happier perspective, and experience an increased level of positive emotions (Emmons & McCullough, 2003). Practicing gratitude can reduce the chances of you feeling anxious, depressed or stressed. Plus, it can help you get better sleep (Southwell & Gould, 2017)!


Acts of kindness can also help!
Acts of kindness for others not only help people around you, but doing them also helps you feel better! Being kind to both others and yourself will bring about many benefits to your overall well-being, and provide you with improved mental health (Curry et al., 2018).  They also allow you to understand others better and put you in a more positive environment surrounded by your peers (Ghergel et al., 2019).









 We can't thank you enough for backing our mission but what we can do is offer you exclusive perks that will only be available through our Kickstarter campaign!","App Shipment

 No More Uncomfortable Travel Pillows.Travel pillows have one basic job: Make travelling more comfortable, whether on the plane, train, bus or car. Why can't travel pillows be the perfect combination of comfort, support and compactibility?My travel pillow should be fulfilling all 3 of these attributes:

 







 







The Perfect PillowSay hello to the CORI TRAVELLER Pillow, the World’s 1st modular travel pillow.Ever wonder if the pillows you buy can suit you? Now it can! Designed with the understanding that not all humans are made exactly the same, we want to cater to all travellers with different needs and preferences.







One of my personal favourite configuration of the cushions (L-shaped) ensures the deliberate support of the neck and chin that is required when resting.The CORI TRAVELLER Pillow allows for both customisation and adjustments to suit the user’s preferred resting position and neck size.  Try it and share your favourite with us.

Share The Joy & Comfort







 








 
Why CORI TRAVELLER? As curious beings, we are naturally inclined to explore and discover. And that’s why we love to travel.Being comfortable while travelling can really set the tone for the day (or a trip for that matter). I’ve tried many different travel pillows to fix this problem, but none of the current options on the market seemed to fit me right.And that’s when I decided to inject a little creativity to fix my problem, by creating the travel pillow that fits.  Modularity is VersatilityThe CORI TRAVELLER Pillow comprises of 3 separate modular components; “Bobby” (the short cushion), “Leonard” (the tall cushion) and the “Couch” (the holding strap). Decide how you want them to sit. Your imagination is your limit.









Compact Design

The compact design means no fret over the bulkiness of bringing a travel pillow. Measuring a mere 12cm in diameter, it is a great travel buddy anywhere you go. 







  Wearing Is Easy!







Features







Use CORI TRAVELLER Pillow Anywhere







Inspiration Behind CORI TRAVELLER

 Hi, I'm Phyllis. The idea for CORI TRAVELLER started with my love for travelling. Taking inspiration from the beautiful, simple and creative modern origami, I wish to bring more Joy and Happiness to travellers around the world.   







Working closely with great partners in design & manufacturing. I am happy to create the world's first modular travel pillow which promises to bring joy to fellow travellers whether for a short 10 minutes nap, hours of snooze or simply neck relaxation anywhere.    Grab a CORI TRAVELLER Pillow to feel the difference for yourself.

About Us

























Pass It On plantable candles pay tribute to iconic destinations that are endangered due to climate change.
Our candles are made of sustainable materials and are designed to encourage our users to give the candles a second life by repurposing them as planting pots.
Most importantly, for every purchase of a Pass It On candle, we will donate a portion of the proceeds to Eden Reforestation Projects to plant 10 trees. 




New scents, product upgrades and better rewards!
Thanks to your support towards our first successful campaign, we are back with new scents, products upgrades and better rewards!


(1) NEW SCENTS
For our two new scents, we draw inspiration from the lush Congo Basin and Venice’s breezy waterways. Finished in two beautiful earth tones, these new scents expand our colour palette.









NEW: Congo Basin - Orchid & Vetiver

                      In the Democratic Republic of Congo, refugees from armed conflict are forced to live off the land with severe impacts to forests and wildlife. Palm oil plantations and other commercial agriculture operations are a growing threat, putting greater pressure on the Congo’s forests and rivers.
NEW: Venice - Rose & Patchouli

                      As the city is built on marshland at the edge of a lagoon, its existence has always required maintaining a careful balance between the city and the natural world. But in recent years, rising sea levels due to climate change has threatened to throw off the balance.


(2) PRODUCT UPGRADES
Since our first campaign, we've gathered feedback and spent weeks enhancing our product to be even more socially responsible.
First, we realised that although many people loved the idea of planting our seed-infused candle lids, not many users did.
So here's the good news: We're providing you with soil!
For this batch, every candle will come with compressed soil pellets. All you have to do is add some water, and the pellets will expand into a handful of soil!

            

          

Second, we're upgrading our wicks to be twice the thickness so that it burns the candle more evenly, giving you stronger scent throw.









Lastly, our packaging is now made from FSC-certified cardboard. The FSC certification is considered the ""gold standard"" in eco terms for papermaking, as wood is harvested from forests that are responsibly managed, socially beneficial, environmentally conscious and economically viable.


(3) BETTER REWARDS
Previously, we gave away postcards; this time, we're giving away a bamboo candle cover to those who purchase 2 or more candles!









Bamboo is a kind of grass, which makes growing it about as easy as it gets.  Being extremely adaptable and resilient, bamboo is a super sustainable alternative to wood or plastic.
Also, we're offering 4 sets of limited edition larger-sized candles for our ultimate changemakers! Each set will include an exclusive 185g candle in these beautiful cement pots:




Alps (large) & Venice (standard)








Amazon (large) & Congo (standard)







The Green Factor 









Pass It On candles are made of sustainable materials. The candle wax is made with 100% soy wax, and does not contain any dyes, parabens, paraffin or phthalates.
Turn Pass It On candle holders into flower pots!

















Our candle holders have been designed to be repurposed as gardening cement pots (which is why they’re not glass jars), and our candle lids are made of biodegradable paper infused with wildflower seeds. So plant candle lid into pot after finishing your candle. 

            

          

Packaging boxes are made of FSC-certified cardboard. No bubble wrap or plastic materials are used.











The Scents
Pass It On presents its new collection of scented candles, inspired by iconic destinations around the world that are endangered due to climate change. 




The scents were created to remind us of these endangered destinations with the hope to encourage the current generation to do their part in protecting our environment.





NEW: Congo Basin - Orchid & Vetiver

                     In the Democratic Republic of Congo, refugees from armed conflict are forced to live off the land with severe impacts to forests and wildlife. Palm oil plantations and other commercial agriculture operations are a growing threat, putting greater pressure on the Congo’s forests and rivers.
NEW: Venice - Rose & Patchouli

                     As the city is built on marshland at the edge of a lagoon, its existence has always required maintaining a careful balance between the city and the natural world. But in recent years, rising sea levels due to climate change has threatened to throw off the balance.
Amazon - Goji & Tarocco Blood Orange

                     Brazil's Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world. It is home to the world's most diverse species, but expansion of agriculture has led to the destruction of the rainforest and wildlife.
Alps - English Pear & Freesia

                     Every year, the European mountain range loses around 3% of glacial ice, which means that by 2050, there might not be any more glaciers.
Great Barrier Reef - Wood Sage & Sea Salt

                        The world's largest coral reef, Australia's Great Barrier Reef, has decreased by more than half its size because of rising temperatures in the past 30 years.
Taj Mahal - White Tea & Ginger

                     The Taj Mahal is one of the most iconic buildings in the world, but some experts worry that the site could collapse because of erosion and pollution.


The Mission
The purpose of creating this product stems from our mission to grow more trees on our planet to combat devastating levels of carbon emissions. With every purchase of a Pass It On candle, a donation will be made to Eden Reforestation Projects to plant 10 trees.









Pass It On partners with Eden Reforestation Projects providing locals employment for their reforestation projects.
Why Eden Reforestation Projects?
Eden Reforestation Projects is a 501c3 non-profit who goes beyond planting trees and adopts the mission to provide fair wage employment to impoverished villagers as agents of global forest restoration.
Beyond planting trees, Eden Reforestation adopts the mission to provide fair wage employment to impoverished villagers as agents of global forest restoration.









""We hire the poorest of the poor to grow, plant, and guard to maturity native species forest on a massive scale. Our “employ to plant methodology” results in a multiplication of positive socio-economic and environment measures.""









Scientific studies have shown that Mangroves “sequester carbon at a rate two to four times greater than mature tropical forests”, and contain “the highest carbon density of all terrestrial ecosystems.”
Mangrove restoration on these islands are essential to reducing the effects of flooding, tsunami’s and soil erosion
Trees are extremely efficient at carbon sequestration and one of the most effective tools in the fight against dangerous Greenhouse Gases that contribute to climate change and global warming.
To keep track of the number of trees being planted, we have created a Trillion Tree account to ensure traceability for each donation. To see our tracker on Trillion Trees, click here.


Media Mentions
Pass It On plantable candle was previously 516% funded on our first ever kickstarter campaign.
During our campaign, we were also featured on the following titles:

































The Story
While on a trip to Australia's Great Barrier Reef, our founder, Michelle, was both astounded by its beauty amidst the destruction and saddened by the dire state of our planet’s largest coral reef.









When corals get stressed, from things such as heat or pollution, they react by expelling a marine algae, leaving a ghostly, transparent skeleton behind. This is known as ‘coral bleaching’. If we continue to pollute the air and the ocean with carbon emissions at our high rate, coral reefs around the world will face a catastrophic future in coming decades – in our lifetime.









A trip to Southern Great Barrier Reef in Australia, triggered a chain of emotions and actions, birthing Pass It On just 1 month after.
Thankfully, areas such as Lady Elliot Island in Australia, is still very much protected and many new initiatives and sustainable resorts have been sprouting up to conserve what's left of the Great Barrier Reef.
Despite the efforts of many, Michelle felt that more could and had to be done. Like what 16 year old Greta Thunberg aptly put it across

01: Eudaimonia








02: Geist








03: Dasein





















































Our designs emerged from a dissatisfaction with the generic minimalism that is currently flooding the micro-brand watch field. As designers, we view the watch as an artistic canvas, and are excited by its unique creative possibilities. But most watches never fulfill this potential.  
 We wanted to completely re-imagine watch design, to create a timepiece that makes the most of this medium's uniqueness. And the most unique and fundamental part of a watch, as we see it, is movement. We were inspired by the potential of using time's movement to create visual beauty, and perhaps even philosophical meaning. In our design research, we drew inspiration from the Kinetic Art movement, vibrant in the early 20th century. Kinetic artists broke from traditional static art pieces, and created art that produced beauty through movement. These innovative visual experiences created new interactive relationships between the artwork and the viewer. 


Tinguely (1954), Duchamp (1913), Riley (1964)





Design is an incremental and often meandering process as we research, experiment, discard, and refine. The journey from initial idea to final prototype took more than a year.  More than a thousand drafts were created as ideas evolved. We conducted five rounds of reviews and testing involving more than 50 people. It didn't help that we are perfectionists, tweaking every detail and casting way too many prototypes to make sure each nanometer was perfect.  
We are proud to present three designs, the final evolutions of a year of inspiration.Thank you for supporting us.























Since the industrial revolution, we have become subservient to external routines. Time has become a number used to regiment our lives.   
Our Kinetic Art designs use the movement of time to reconceive the watch's purpose. 
Instead of a keeper of routine, our watches turn time into spellbinding art, revealing the beauty of the flowing present.Time is no longer a number — time is beauty, time is art. The present is no longer to be planned away, but to be appreciated, as the flow of time mesmerizes and enchants us. 















Beyond pointing out a few unique visual aspects of each work, we will refrain from in-depth exposition here, as we believe the meaning of a work shouldn't be shackled by the creator.  Instead, the abstract kinetics in each design are springboards from which each viewer can draw different personal meanings and inspirations. We have already been pleasantly surprised by the diversity of interpretations we have received. We hope our watches will move you, too.

Four concentric rings of circles constitute this design. Alternating expansion and contraction make a play of perspective. Round forms, linear layers and smooth animation scales work together to produce a balanced design.  































This ambitious design discards geometricism, using the overlapping of uneven layers to produce organic forms that morph as they spiral outwards. Varying angles create an illusion of differing speeds, adding to the design's dynamism.  































Using three sculpted discs instead of two, this design allows for more variation across time. Patterns change in symmetry and size as the hour and minute discs move across one another. 
 

































If David hadn't stepped into the world of design, he would have been working in the non-profit field. Even now, giving back remains a personal necessity in each of his design projects.  To keep with this vision, 5% of our sales will be donated to The Red Pencil, a non-profit that uses arts therapy to help those suffering from emotional trauma.

Designing a watch requires hundreds of small choices, and at every crossroads, we have chosen the path that leads to quality. Here's an introduction to the premium components we use to craft our watches.























Unlike quartz watches which are powered by batteries, automatic watches are powered by human motion. Your arm's movement propels the hundreds of gears and springs precisely assembled in the watch mechanism — a feat of engineering artistry, and a refreshing change from the electronic circuitry we have gotten so used to. After much research, we chose the Japanese Seiko NH35A movement to power our watch, famed for its durability and reliability. A generation ahead of the already robust 7S26 and 8215, the NH35A is more refined, more accurate, and comes with hand-winding and hacking capabilities. 







Our custom movement design is a tribute to the Kinetic artists of the last century, who struggled with the tensions between human and machine as their lives became increasingly mechanized, even as they used these new machines in their art. In a way, the automatic watch, as a human-powered mechanism, is a vivid illustration of that relationship. It is poetic that the mesmerizing movement of time in your Kinetic Art watch will be propelled by your own movement.























To frame our kinetic art, we designed a case that is minimalistic, almost geometric, with carefully balanced proportions, symmetrical bevels, and clean, angular forms. The case is made from brushed 316L surgical steel, which is much hardier than the cheaper and more common 304L steel.Designed to be water resistant to 5 ATM, our watches can be brought to the shower or the pool. However, we suggest you order an extra Milanese mesh band if you intend to get your watch wet, as  leather straps are prone to water damage.























Sapphire Crystal is incredibly scratch-resistant, rating '9' on the Mohs scale of hardness, just one spot behind diamonds. We use sapphire crystal for both the top and bottom glass, with additional anti-reflective coating applied on the top glass.























Our straps are vegetable-tanned — a natural leather processing method that's much more time consuming than the more commonly found chemical-based chrome-tanning method. Vegetable-tanned leather ages beautifully, developing a patina over time.  We use full-grain leather for our straps — the strongest and most natural-looking type of leather, as it comes from the uppermost surface of the hide, where all the ""grain"" is preserved. Our leather straps come with quick release pins for easy removal. You can order additional 316L Milanese mesh straps for a different look.























All our watches are painstakingly hand-assembled. The expert levels of dexterity and skill required to handle our vanishingly thin discs mean that only veteran watch makers are able to assemble our watches. 























We are perfectionists here at Humism, and we take quality very seriously. All watch components are meticulously inspected before assembly, and multiple thorough inspections are carried out throughout the assembly process.  All watches are put through a series of stringent quality control tests, such as water resistance and drop tests. We take the additional step of manually regulating each watch's movement to ensure they keep time accurately. Our watches come with an 18 month warranty. 























































* Please note that duties and VAT are not included.















To commemorate the launch of our first collection on Kickstarter, the first 50 backers of each design, 150 total, will receive limited 'Founders Edition' watches.  























First forged in 19th century Italy, these straps are uniquely stylish, comfortable, and hardy. Add a set to your pledge if you'll like a different style option, or see yourself getting your watch wet. 


Milanese Mesh Strap in Silver








Milanese Mesh Strap in Black





















With 39mm case sizes, our watches can be worn by both men and women. Our leather straps will fit most wrist sizes.  























Kickstarter is a funding platform that gathers people to bring creative projects to life. We chose Kickstarter to launch our first collection because of Kickstarter's vibrant, entrepreneurial, and artistic community.  For Humism, you can see our Kickstarter as an opportunity to pre-order our watches before everyone else. To back us (i.e. make a pledge; i.e. pre-order your watch), simply click the green 'Back this project' button on the top right of this page, and select your reward tier (i.e. the number of watches you want) on the next page. Note that you can only choose one reward tier.









All in all, to bring you the perfect Kinetic Art watch, it has taken us more than a year, upwards of a thousand design drafts, and half a dozen prototypes. Here's a brief timeline of our journey.  

























We believe in our watches. That's why we have invested our own money in them, and are already deep in the production process. Our early start ensures that you can receive your Kinetic Art watch as soon as possible.","Making these watches has not been easy, as both precision and innovation were required to bring our artistic vision to life. However, as we are already deep in the production process, we are several steps ahead of other projects, and have greatly lessened the number of hoops our project will have to jump through after our campaign ends. It is always possible for delays with production though, so we have added some buffer time in our estimates to provide for this. We'll keep you informed every step of the way.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 323 or more\n\nAbout US$ 230\n\n\n\n1 Watch   |   Super Early Bird\n\n\nYou will get: ONE Kinetic Art Watch. \n\n(You will choose the model later) \n\nFirst 50 watches of each design are \""Founders Editions.\""\n\n(applies to all reward tiers) \n\n \n\nTo order extra straps, add 52 SGD to your pledge per set. \n\n(You will choose the type later)\n\nFree shipping worldwide. \n\n(323 SGD / 245 USD / 199 EURO)\n\nSave US$75 off future retail price.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n98 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (1 left of 99)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 348 or more\n\nAbout US$ 248\n\n\n\n1 Watch   |   Early Bird\n\n\nYou will get: ONE Kinetic Art Watch. \n\n(You will choose the model later) \n\nTo order extra straps, add 52 SGD to your pledge per set. \n\n(You will choose the type later)\n\nFree shipping worldwide. \n\n(348 SGD / 265 USD / 214 EURO)\n\nSave US$55 off future retail price.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n228 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 646 or more\n\nAbout US$ 460\n\n\n\n2 Watches   |   Early Bird\n\n\nYou will get: TWO Kinetic Art Watches, and one extra free set of straps. \n\n(You will choose the models later) \n\nTo order extra straps, add 52 SGD to your pledge per set. \n\n(You will choose the type later)\n\nFree shipping worldwide. \n\n(646 SGD / 490 USD / 398 EURO)\n\nSave US$190 off future retail price.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 969 or more\n\nAbout US$ 690\n\n\n\n3 Watches   |   Early Bird\n\n\nYou will get: THREE Kinetic Art Watches, and two extra free sets of straps. \n\n(You will choose the models later) \n\nTo order extra straps, add 52 SGD to your pledge per set. \n\n(You will choose the type later)\n\nFree shipping worldwide. \n\n(969 SGD / 735 USD / 597 EURO)\n\nSave US$305 off future retail price.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 backers""}]",15.0,163

Love Patina? Get LAVNG! 




LAVNG wallet getting beautiful Patina over time!





For those who don’t own something made with natural leather, might be wondering: What’s the big deal about owning a leather product? The big deal can be summarized in one word: Patina.
Leather ages in a similar way, much like your favorite pair of raw denim, developing a “patina” as oils from your skin and other elements of the environment absorbs into it. Like our tan color bags, starting with a beautiful pale tan shade, it eventually develops into any range of browns through wear and use.









BUNDLE PRICE - Available in the rewards section
 Simple Calculation : 
Quantity * Early Bird Unit Price for the wallets.
Big savings on shipping cost. The most shippers have a fixed starting price, regardless of weight and then progressive price increase based on weight. Since we will ship all your rewards together, obviously we will pass on the shipping savings to you.

 Leather 
We use full-grain, vegetable-tanned naked leather: we love it and we think you will too! 









 It is the leather that you can feel good about owning as it is totally environmentally friendly, our leather is luxuriously soft with grains that can outlast the many years to come 
 ""Veg-TANNED""
Our leather is tanned in an eco-friendly manner using vegetable extracts. There is no use of chrome, heavy metal, formal dehydrate or volatile solvents in tanning process; unaided by potent chemicals, organic tanning takes much longer than chrome tanning (several weeks/months vs a day).









""FULL-GRAIN""
The top surface of a hide, or the grain, is the strongest part of the hide. ""Full-grain"" means that the surface has not been buffed or sanded to remove imperfections. 









""ANILINE""
Our leather has been dyed the whole way 'through and through'. Pigmented leather, in contrast, has a coat of paint sprayed on top and is cheaper to make. Aniline leather without further artificial finishing is a fully natural product.
Care Instruction
Our leathers are naked and have no artificial finish - hence making is a fully natural product. A few scratches, marks, irregularity in color and texture are a part of this leather and only goes to show that it is a natural product; it is not water-resistant, prolonged exposure to water can cause splotches or marks - eventually becoming part of the patina.









The leather color appears slightly different in a different light and is noticeable while photographing it, especially the Tan color. Under the bright sun, it appears lighter and inside a room, it appears a little darker. This is the characteristics of natural leather. The pigmented leather, on the other hand, has the same appearance irrespective of the light.
 Shipping and Custom Duty
We have tried to be reasonable with shipping. We would use Singpost for shipping most of the rewards.
Singapore and Malaysia- No Shipping charges
Rest of the World - Nominal charge of S$13 to S$60 depending on the reward
Duty/VAT/GST charges: If you live outside of Singapore, you will be responsible for applicable duty/VAT/GST charges, if any. In many of the countries, there is no duty or taxes on online shopping up to a certain amount.
Customs: Some countries are known for being very slow with customs, and you probably know if you live in one. We're sorry that, in such case, we can't have any mechanism to help them get through faster.
 People and Mission




Geetanjali - The Founder of LAVNG





Hi, I am Geetanjali the founder and designer at LAVNG.
I love handbags but would not settle for low-quality fast fashion and would always end up overpaying for quality which I would not even know is environment-friendly or not.
The idea of starting LAVNG first clicked me when I was staying in Amsterdam in the year 2009 and visited Italy on a vacation trip. For the first time, I got to know the real price of high-quality leather goods which are made in an environment-friendly manner.
Its quite common for luxury brands to increase their price up to 10 times as compared to manufacturing price to fund the middlemen, expensive real estate and celebrity marketing.
We thought there must be a better way and hence we started LAVNG - Our reason reflects our desire to make high-quality leather goods which are made to last while preserving the environment.

We get it- life is hectic in Singapore, but let's not forget the important things in life amidst our ever busy schedule. Family.









Happy Folks was created as an avenue to shower our elderly with gifts of love. 
The founder was inspired by her father, currently a retiree who enjoys solving the Sudoku puzzles she regularly gifts. It was clear that it was impossible for this retiree to sit back, and do nothing contrary to popular belief.
Children are getting caught up with their increasingly busy everyday lives! The precious bonding and interaction time, is far and in between. 
She realized how a simple gift can bring her parents so much joy and is thoroughly convinced that it is not the price tag of the gift, rather the action of receiving something from their loved ones that brings about the warmth in their hearts.

Hello, we are Charmaine, Junel and Ruth. Before A Year of Us, we were running a sexual health and wellness platform in Singapore (because God forbid anyone talks about that in Asia!). 2 years in and countless chats with our followers later, we realized that underpinning all our readers’ questions and concerns was the desire to build better relationships.
From talking about “What to do after sex?”, to “How frequently should my partner and I go for an STD check?”, we realised that what people really wanted to know was “How should I build a better relationship with my partner?”
Complex, needy like a child, but also oh-so-beautiful ❤️
Our relationship with our significant other is one of the most important ones we will have in our lives - trust us, we’ve been through our fair share of not-so-great relationships! (You have our exes to thank for this game, tbh) 




A Year of Us!





Humans are complicated. We make understanding one another fun. With 9 different categories, learn about your partner in a more holistic way from communication styles, to what they like in bed.
Like a plant, love takes time to grow 🌱
Apart from looking like a cute journal to chronicle your favourite couple memories, A Year of Us is intentionally designed as a yearlong series of questions and activities for you and your partner to get to know one another on a regular basis. Weekly date night, settled!




Make our game a part of your dates





Make this the best year of your life
Designed with love, crafted for all couples. We use inclusive language in our cards so every couple can enjoy the game! 




A Year of Us is made for anyone and everyone 





🌱 New relationships: Learn more about your partner as you embark on an adventure  of a lifetime together
🪴Mature relationships: Rediscover your partner, recount your shared journey and renew your desire
We have spent the past 6 months researching, interviewing and lovingly planning for this card game. Our pilot run sold out within weeks, and we are excited to introduce our new and improved international version here! 




What people say about us!





We hope our game brings you as much joy as it has to us. Follow our instagram page for updates about this project, and also loving reminders to you, and your loved ones.


With love, 
Charmaine, Junel & Ruth

You can also help by sharing about us Instagram, Facebook and Twitter! We love love, love all of you reading this, and appreciate your support wholeheartedly. Cheers!","This is our very first kickstarter project, so we have tried our best to minimise risks by testing and prototyping as much as possible. 

Our prototype has been completed, printed, and tested with friends and family. Since this is our first venture, we wanted to go one step further to produce a small number of games in order to gauge sales and get more feedback from our target audience. Even though this increases our costs up front, it has greatly benefited us in improving our product for its final and best version – for you guys!

Right now, we are finalising our improvements to the design of the cards and is near completion.

 Hi! I'm Sabrina, more prominently known as the owner of @justpeachysg on Instagram. Apart from designing, I love to eat sashimi and baking. Recently I've gotten hooked onto Brooklyn 99, which resulted in this little project. 







The pins will be about 35mm (3.5cm), soft enamel, comes with a standard butterfly clasp and will be packaged with a specially designed backing for protection during shipment.







Jake Peralta's iconic ""cool cool cool cool no doubt no doubt no doubt"" phrase.







Jake Peralta's ""title of your sex tape"" gag in all seasons whenever someone says something with a sexual innuendo.







 We've all seen Terry sinning on yogurt, so why not create a pin that glorifies his strong appreciation for yogurt, amirite? I'm sure he'd be ecstatic if this actually existed. 







We all know Gina's not only a talented dancer and online streamer, but also always right in most situations. This pin will be gold plated, befitting of such a glamorous character. 







 I will be very happy to reach the goal of SGD$700 to make all of these pins and if this actually picks up, I might actually create more. 







 Apart from being a gay icon, Holt's expressions (or lack thereof) are a literal mood. Due to the details on Holt's uniform, this pin will only be unlocked after this project has reached the target goal. I've been designing enamel pins for a while now and I really love Brooklyn 99, so it'd be great to see this project take off. I've got plenty of ideas for another batch of B99 pin designs, especially since I haven't included Amy Santiago, Rosa, Boyle, Scully or Hitchcock in this collection. If you like the way these pins look, do support this project and I'll work even harder to ensure a second collection will come to life! UPDATE:


ta-da! A sixth pin for getting this kickstarter to over $2000!



If you guys haven't noticed yet, there's now a reward for backing $48 or more due to the additional sixth pin to this collection, as an additional reward for everyone who has supported this Kickstarter so far. 








Kickstarter Fees- 10%
Pins Production- 69%
Shipping and Packaging- 31%
If I reach my goal in September, it would take another month (or less, no promises though!) for all the pins to be made and another month for me to send the pins after receiving them from my manufacturer. I'll also be schooling then, and will be focusing on this whenever time allows me to.  Thank you all so much for taking a look at my project and I hope to show you all the wonderful pins come November!","I have already chosen and spoken with a manufacturer and they are ready to make the pins for me. They've sent me images of the pins they've created and I believe they are reliable and highly recommended, so I don't foresee any problems arising with them. 

The risks/challenges I have is whether this project will be fully funded or not and if I am able to find a carrier that is able to ship out the pins in time to everyone. I'm currently still searching for a suitable carrier and will update you guys once I've found the right one.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 8 or more\n\nAbout $6\n\n\n\nPledge $8 or more\n\n\n1 x unlocked pin of your choice! \n\n1x specially designed pin backing!\n\nThank you for supporting my project!\nIncludes:\n\n\nPIN\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 16 or more\n\nAbout $12\n\n\n\nPledge $16 or more\n\n\n2 x unlocked pin of your choice! \n\n2 x specially designed pin backing!\n\nThank you for supporting my project!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 24 or more\n\nAbout $18\n\n\n\nPledge $24 or more\n\n\n3 x unlocked pin of your choice! \n\n3 x specially designed pin backing!\n\nThank you for supporting my project!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 32 or more\n\nAbout $23\n\n\n\nPledge $32 or more\n\n\n4 x unlocked pin of your choice! \n\n4 x specially designed pin backing!\n\nThank you for supporting my project!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 40 or more\n\nAbout $29\n\n\n\nPledge $40 or more!\n\n\n5 x unlocked pin of your choice! \n\n5 x specially designed pin backing!\n\nThank you for supporting my project!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 48 or more\n\nAbout $35\n\n\n\nPledge $48 or more!\n\n\n6 x unlocked pin of your choice! \n\n6 x specially designed pin backing!\n\nThank you for supporting my project!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 6 or more\n\nAbout $5\n\n\n\nPledge $6 or more\n\n\nEARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM!\n\n1 x unlocked pin of your choice! \n\n1x specially designed pin backing!\n\nThank you for supporting my project!

We are The Nurturing Co, an award-winning sustainable products start-up based in Singapore and the UK. 
We are a new generation sustainable products company focused on the creation of sustainable less impactful alternatives and have already launched the world's first ""retailer ready"" zero plastic bamboo home care brand, Bambooloo, in 2018.


Like many of us concerned about the world's resources, we spent endless hours thinking about the problems we face and how we might best manage them. That's why we have created Wipeless™.









We think its time you became 'Master of your Throne""


We've all been spending more and more time in our homes, with the new normal. With all the new Zoom meetings, a new way of hanging out with friends. But we are still doing one thing the same old way.  Going to the toilet. Yes, going to the toilet...  









We use the toilet three to four times a day but yet we are still dragging dry paper (when the stores are running out) across our tender regions, spreading what we are seeking to clean up, and kidding ourselves we are all cleaned up! It is time to give our bums the treatment they deserve and care more about the planet at the same time.


Go Wipeless™: Greener cleaner cleaning, down there









The person's got a point don't you think? Why do we spread things around and expect that to be clean when we wouldn't do that with any other part of the body, let alone the dirtiest? We've all been there where we had one too many toilet visits that left the cheeks in great despair or had an especially big poop and left scrambling to clean up with sheet after sheet. 




Be a sprayer, not a spreader





With Wipeless™, any toilet scenario would have a clean and peaceful ending. No more worries of dingleberries or irritated bum cheeks. 






















Reduce toilet paper usage





Every roll of wood pulp toilet paper out there takes 37 gallons of water to make!  That's a lot of water we are using folks. Plus each sheet uses 2 grams of carbon to make and deliver to the stores... yes, that's per sheet, plus there are the 27,000 trees a day we cut down just to make wood pulp toilet paper. None of this is good news we think you will agree...












Save up to 6000 gallons of water





But by adding a Wipeless™ Bidet Bar to your toilet you will reduce the amount of toilet paper used by 65-80%. Immediately this will cut your overall water use, your carbon footprint, help save trees and save you money. You may still need some toilet paper when using your Wipeless ™ Bidet Bar, and we highly recommend our sister brand, Bambooloo®.












Be a sprayer, not a spreader





Peanut butter on nice warm toast, yeh go ahead and spread that on there! Divine smelling lotion on your body after a nice warm shower, of course!  These sound great, but not everything is meant for spreading. 












Be gentle with your tender areas





We've all dealt with times where toilet paper has left us itchy and uncomfortable. Put an end to that with the Wipeless bidet bar. With an easy soft turn dial and variable pressure it is perfect for children, adults and the elderly. Give your bum the respect that you would give the rest of your body and give it the cleaning it deserves. Plus, it avoids having to deal with unpleasant dingleberries and remnants.














Bernie knows comfort, be like Bernie





One thing COVID has reminded us is when you keep your hands clean, you keep yourself safe. With the Wipeless™ bidet bar, cleaning is as simple as a turn of a knob and patting yourself dry. No more having to contort our hands to get the angle just right and wiping carefully to make sure you don't get any on your hands. It is so simple that you can even do it with your gloves on.









We have put everything you need is in the Wipeless™ Kit so you don't need to go to the hardware store to get fancy tapes or tubes, or hire a plumber. 




Unboxing Wipeless: What's in the box?





The DIY Instruction Manual will break down every single step and sub-step so that you feel at ease throughout the installation. 
The 6mm Slim Wipeless™ Bidet Bar universally fits 90% of toilets (unless you have a really fancy-schmancy designer toilet bowl). The accessories kit includes all the necessary fittings you would need. 
For all the handy household folks out there, you would find the list below very familiar.
Accessories include:

  1/2"" brass adaptor
  1/2"" rubber washer
  80cm TPU hose
  Teflon Tape
  1-year warranty card

Meet the Wipeless Bidet Bars








Wipeless Bidet Bar Model GT








Wipeless Bidet Bar Model MK1














  Soft Turn Dial

With the soft turn dial, you can always get the pressure that is just right for you. Every time you use the Wipeless™ bidet bar, the nozzles go through a self cleaning before water sprays out onto you. This make sure that only clean water will hit your tender areas, no leftover nasties. 




Using the soft turn dial to get the pressure that is just right





The Wipeless™ bidet bars come with variable pressure control so that you can always get the pressure that is just right for the situation.




Get the pressure that is just right








  PeeGuard© (Only on the Wipeless™ Model MK1)





Keeping the nozzles clean at all times





The PeeGuard© is for the man of the house whose aim is not always perfect. It keeps the nozzles clean at all times from nasty splashes and bad aim. However, the PeeGuard is only an added extra level of protection. Both the Model GT and the Model MK1 come with self cleaning nozzles that clean themselves up before they clean you up. So PeeGuard© or no guard, you will always be kept safe and clean. 



  Front and Rear Spray Nozzles










Use the dial to control whether you want a front wash or a rear wash and let the bidet take care of the rest. The nozzle needed would go through a self cleaning, descend and spray the water so that it hits you just right and cleans you up. Just a little wiggle to adjust and you'll be clean in seconds. 




Gentle on your tender areas













All you need to fit a Wipeless™ Bidet Bar is about 20-30 minutes of time and a screwdriver and maybe a spanner if you have to deal with a tight nut. 
Everything else that you need, from detailed fitting instructions to all the fitting accessories, come in the kit that you receive, which also come in one-time-use plastics free packaging. 
So normally there is no need to spend time and money calling out a plumber to figure it out for you, but we absolutely won't judge you if you want to.


In summary, it is easy as 1,2,3.
1 Turn off the water supply and remove the toilet seat completely. 
2 Place Wipeless Bidet Bar on and screw it into place.
3 Connect the bidet bar to the water supply, reattach the toilet seat and you're done!

            

          












The main man- David





Toilet talk is not new to us. Wipeless™ is created by the team behind sustainable homecare products brand Bambooloo©, which is loved for its 100% bamboo toilet paper.  The 0% plastic, 100% love product has been focused on reducing the use of carbon, water and single use plastic and has saved 1728kg of plastic from being used in just 2020 alone. We have been caring for bums all around the world from 2018 and we are now taking it one step further and coming to you with the Wipeless™ Bidet Bar.




During the product design stage of Wipeless





Our plan and our pride and joy
We have been designing Wipeless since 2020 and it went through many different rounds of tweaking and testing and we finally arrived at the Wipeless Model GT and the Wipeless Model MK1.  




Sample that we tested in our own office





We brought in the Wipeless Model MK1 and installed it in our shared office space and it was an instant hit! With the feedback we got, we made a few more tweaks and now we have the final products ready to be shipped out to you!




Yes, we shoot in the toilet





All the videos that you see are shot in real toilets with real plumbing and real issues.  Wipeless is designed for all our toilets and we made sure that the installation is easy (takes under 30 mins and doesn't require special tools) and that's why you'll see no studio shots in our videos. They are all shot in real toilets and show you the bidet as it is.




Our crew has spent alot of time in toilets

Beyond the pages, Beyond the stories Beyond the ordinary, as the tagline refers to the books We produce are beyond the ordinary. It is not like other books, that dives into a story. Beyond ORDY books, break the boundaries of book and the surrounding. By having a storybook with activities on different pages to engage both the right and left brain as well as their 6 senses. To spark their curiosity and imagination Furthermore, have the freedom to express themselves and to have a stand and option on something they believe in.
 It is redesigning a book and creating different, unique experiences with it. With the help of words and graphics, the book uses the child's imagination, makes every interaction and experience unique to each child.

How the project Begin
This project begins when I went back to my childhood home and memories of my childhood follow back the times where we build forts, act out stories and play dress up. Whether it was an adventure to space or Finding for Dinosaurs in the storeroom, my imagination was boundless and limitless.
As technology advances, I saw the benefits that it brings, but I also saw the downfall of children playing with toys and engaging their imagination without the help of technology. Especially being the oldest of 6 children. That inspired me to want to share my experience and help them to expand their imagination to wide horizons while also forming unforgettable childhood memories that would last a lifetime.




Imagination took me everywhere (according to my relatives i was claimed to be digging for gold here) 2002








Watching youtube at a young age 2015







Why do I care?
As a person who had a pretty imaginative childhood it has brought me here I am today. Being Imaginative has given me a leg up on being able to think differently and break the boundaries that many people
Being imaginative as a child has given me a leg up in many situations, as I was able to think outside of the box, and differently from others which led me to many out of the world ideas and concepts that are eye-catching and refreshing. Instead of mundane ideas that now with even Artificial intelligence can come up with very easily.
Jack Ma once said: ‘ The only way we can compete with machines, is by changing our educational system.” Which was referring to soft skills. Which includes being able to be creative with what one can do, and being flexible at with the form and interpret emotions and feelings.
Why support us and how will your support help
Like mentioned, we stand for being creative and different to go out of the norm and experience the world without boundaries. We come to this world with a promise to make the mundane fun again. Thus your support will help make these dreams come true and our first step is to redesign children’s books that can be used to interact with the surrounding to create different experiences overall.
We also carefully selected the age group, due to widening their horizons from a young age. To inform that being creative and different is not bad but a good; positive trait that they can anchor on and bring it to the next generation. To make design and good experience a norm rather than a luxury.
Risk and Challenges in pictures 
- Books that are very 1 time off, can be engaging at the moment but does not sustain the kids' attention very long.

One of them is the research part as the book was mainly Targeted at kids age 5-8, years old, which was a narrow age range and was an in-between the different stages of a child's development.

Thus the front process took a while to figure out before being able to even come out with the storyline and interactive elements

Other challenges presented its way when there was a user that mentioned that books typically only appear interesting and new to a kid probably only once or twice. Anything after that seems boring. 

Which made me think long and hard of how to make the activity more engaging and something that can be done a few times but still engaging them. With the help of a few tools and experiences, I was able to come up with activities that will give them a unique and different experience despite doing it a few times.


 With the help of the compass, they could use different directions to widen the radius of interaction between the book and their surroundings. 

Apart from the above-stated problems, as we are a small team most of us had to help with each other's tasks. Where we have little to no training in that field. One of which was the graphics of the book, none of us had much knowledge of graphic design other than the basics so it took us a lot of researching of styles we can do and styles that appeal to children.

One of the styles we tried was hype-realism.
Seeing that most books seemed too kiddy for the older kids. We wanted to cater to this group too.



Next, we tried watercolour, a typical children's storybook type of style. After testing it with children and even people who work with children, most have expressed that it seems a bit dull and unsaturated to be a children's book and it seems too dark overall.

Eventually, one of us was able to find a style we all like and was realistic enough to draw and produce. 
Many of our friends, mention to outsource or have a collaboration with other artists and designers. But we thought it would mean so much if it came personally from us. Apart from that, we are a tight team and would be able to control the quality control of the product.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\nPersonalised PostCard\n\n\nGet a postcard illustrated by the author with a personalized message.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\nShips to\nOnly certain countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (100 left of 100)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 30 or more\n\nAbout US$ 22\n\n\n\nFull set ( Book + Compass)\n\n\nThis option you get a reusable file packaging, that contains a copy of Parker goes to Space and a compass, and some limited edition stickers!\nIncludes:\n\n\nSome stickers of the items in the book\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJun 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (500 left of 500)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout US$ 36\n\n\n\nFull set + Stickers and a surprise item\n\n\nThis is the ultimate support you can give!

My name is Boon Keng and I’m an aspiring motivational speaker.I am different. I have a condition called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy that gradually weakens the muscles in my body. Because of that, I rely on a powerchair to help me move around and there are many things I need some additional help in.But I didn’t quite like to admit that I’m different. In fact, I wanted to live a 'normal' and ordinary life. I want to get good grades, get a good job, make many friends, fall in love, get married… be just like anyone! I don’t want to be different in any way despite my physical disability.Things didn’t work out exactly how I wanted. And a few years ago, I got really unhappy (probably an understatement). I felt increasingly frustrated and in despair despite having a good and supportive environment.I realised that I felt so lousy because of this expectation to have an ordinary life. I had actually let go of living my own life just to chase the wind of an ordinary life.I learnt that…

It’s okay to be different
Different ≠ negative things
You can live an unordinary life and be happier
And I want to share this with a lot more people!









I did a degree in social work as part of my plans to become a motivational speaker. I had intended to gain experience in working with a diverse group of people and also learn from their story too. But somehow I got lost in my ambitions (had to make a U-turn to be back here!).You might be wondering what initially inspired me to be a motivational speaker...

Ideally, the talk will be open to the general public so I can share LUL with more people! Seats will first be given to the Kickstarter supporters who have pledged for their attendance, as well as close friends and family whom have been always there for me. Any leftover seats will be open for public registration at a later date. There will also be a tea reception (cos’ we all love food, don’t we?).When?
The talk will start sharp at 1.30pm. Registration starts at 1.10pm.For those holding VIP passes, it’ll be an additional 30 minutes of meet and greet! So please leave a 2-hour slot in your calendar for the talk.
Where? The venue would be at Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability. It should be able to comfortably accommodate 60 seated attendees (with some on wheelchairs). (It can get more cosy with more than 70 attendees!)What? The talk will cover a couple of things including:
Choosing the life of the unordinary over an ordinary or even extraordinary life


Gratitude
How an unordinary life encompasses being realistic in life
What living an unordinary life truly means
And more! (Eh I can’t possibly write a thesis here...)Note: Tickets are transferable. Don't worry that you’ll be wasting a seat even if you’re unavailable on that date!















How will this breakdown change with more money raised?
Bigger venue will be sought to accommodate more people. It costs at least $100 more for venues that can accommodate more than 100 people.
More food will be catered if there are more attendees. It costs around $5 each for additional persons.
Hiring of AV technicians for a smoother seminar experience. All the venues charge a fee of at least $200 for AV technician. As such, I'm only planning to get a friend to help out with the AV unless the funding allows for a professional.
Of course, a little more training allowance to give me an extra motivational boost!
Refer to Stretch Goals below for more details!







The budget of $1000 is meant for a turnout of 70-80 attendees. I’ve actually catered the pledge amount for 100 Kickstarter supporters/attendees… and possibly 20 more for the public or my beloved family and friends!
$1100 for better food with more variety!$1250 is for a bigger venue (and more food) that can comfortably accommodate at least 100 persons.$1500 allows for the hiring of AV technicians (of the venue) for a smoother seminar experience. But oh well... this probably doesn't sound like a Stretch Goal benefit except for reducing the chances of Murphy's Law occurrence.$2000 will allow for an even bigger venue (and yes, more food!) for at least 180 persons. However, I’m hoping to use the money to hold 2 talks (70-80 attendees each) instead of 1 to give everyone a better experience.$2400 and more… Wow thanks! I think I can erm… let everyone invite 1 more guest? Maybe we can get better food? I don’t know, but I know for sure I can start to conduct more talks. (We’ll talk more about that when we get there!)","It’s my first Kickstarter project and I’m sure there are some things lacking. So do let me know if I’ve missed out anything!

I’m taking a more cautious approach in planning for my talk’s logistics (and calculating the budget!). So I hope you understand why most of the details are tentative until I’m certain that the funds are going to come in.

The talk will only happen if the project reaches its funding goal. But once the funding goal is reached, I’ll start to liaise with the venue providers and finalise the details within a month after the funding period. You’ll be notified at least 3 weeks in advance of the talk’s location, date and time.

In the event that you’re unavailable for the date, you can transfer the tickets to anybody you know. Simply register the other person’s name (instead of yours) under the email address you provided (at the end of the funding period).

It’ll be a massive help if you can pledge your support as early as possible!","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\nGive your support\n\n\nIf you aren't keen to attend the talk but still want to give your support, you can do so too!

The Mini Essentials creates mini bags using 100% biodegradable vegan leather made from Pineapple fibres, sustainably sourced. The brand supports the Pineapple farming communities in rural Philippines, providing an income stream for them. 









The brand started with addressing the problem of bringing bulky bags while encouraging women to evaluate the purpose of every item carried and be more organised. Created for carefree women. 








Comes in different shapes to fit your daily essentials such as phone, cards and money. As a multi-bag set comes in 3, you could customise it in different bag shapes available such as round, square and rectangular. 
The bag is retailing exclusively on the brand's website to keep a competitive pricing while providing an affordable alternative for leather bags' enthusiasts. 
In order to provide more colour options for customisation, we are raising funds to research and develop the leather in custom-made colours such as Beige, Khaki and Nude Pink. The funds including a trip to the rural Philippines and visit the making of the leather. 
We started to plan the business from the past 3 months, followed by the sourcing of the sustainable materials. We are now exploring on the customisation part of the business, hoping to launch in early 2020.
The S$9000 funding goal breaks down into the flight and accommodation to the rural Philippines, the customisation, the shipping of the leather to Singapore and the making of the rewards.",The potential challenge could be a delay in the production of leather in custom-made colours. We would then stick to only one colour (Black) until the customisation is successfully produced.,"[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nAppreciation Card with handwritten notes\n\n\nPrinted thank you card with the brand's image and hand-written notes from the Pineapple farmers.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (48 left of 50)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 60 or more\n\nAbout $43\n\n\n\nCard holder\n\n\nA small card holder made from the Pinatex leather in a special customised colour!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (5 left of 5)""}]",0.0,0

2) Give you a sneak peak into the world of New York's fashion industry and the manufacturing processes of our sample rooms, and what a production line in our industry looks like.

---“Dare to dream about a world that hasn't existed, and design for that world.” - let’s change the fashion world, starting now. Project DescriptionThis project aims to fund my research trip to Ubud, Bali, which will be one of many more research trips in Asia to come. From these research trips, I am hoping to learn and build avenues of collaboration with local communities, in understanding how to build a more responsible way of making and using clothing. In the long run, this will help me create a more informed fashion business system, by being able to understand firsthand, who makes the materials, how they make the materials, and how these materials can be utilized to their fullest potential.-“From the runways of Paris, Milan and New York, to rural garment factories worldwide… The production of clothing and textiles has grown into the second most polluting global industry— employing millions around the world in working conditions that are often unsafe and unhealthy. From widespread chemical dumping, pesticide and toxic chemical overuse, worker abuses and child labor to unprecedented levels of air pollution, carbon emissions and waste, the list of the industry's issues is too long and too urgent to ignore.” – www.ResponsibilityInFashion.orgIt’s no secret. The fashion industry’s production ethics and standards leaves much to be desired, and less talked about is the cultural propaganda and appropriation it assumes. And within this narrative is us, the consumers, who are complicit with these unsustainable practices when we continue to buy from these corporations. This has to end. The current modes of production fail to think about little else except arbitrary trends, benefiting their profit margins and fail to recognize that we are human, we are smart, and we care about the world we live in. I dream of a world that values transparency and removes the invisible barriers between the people wearing the clothes, the people making the clothes, and the resources we are exploiting. Fashion wields this admirable power of narrative -- but it has been used to tell us what we are “supposed” to wear, what we should consider beautiful, what we need, what we want, what color is “in” this season, and the list goes on. However, I believe that we can generate a fashion business that prioritizes human engagement, treats our environment responsibly, and respects all cultures equally.This TripFor this trip, I want to travel to Bali to learn from Made and Iwan of TARUM NATURAL DYE, and Ibu Tjok Agung of BISA in Pejeng. After spending more than 13 years of research combined to perfect this science of natural dying, their work aims to produce textiles that do not harm our natural environment. Both studios also work to sustain not only their natural environments, but to provide a sustainable livelihood for the local community they work in.TARUM NATURAL DYE:
Made and Iwan dedicated themselves to establishing protocols and tools for a palette of plant dyes using sustainable, locally available materials. Nine years of research revealed that most of the colours they needed could be obtained from the leaves of common plants, and four of those years were dedicated to standardizing the colours. They set out to find solutions that didn't harm the environment in any way.Today, their studio dyes both textiles and finished garments for clients, but also spins and weaves hand-loomed cotton, silk, wool and hemp fabrics to order. Off-cuts and scraps from Bali's garment factories are also over-dyed and woven into sturdy upholstery fabric.BISA: Tjok Agung Pemayun is probably Bali's leading indigo wizard. He's studied the plants and indigo dyeing techniques intensively for four years. An economics graduate, he worked as a financial controller for a Bali-based textile and garment manufacturer, where he learned the environmental hazards of cheap chemical dyes. Although his company used more environmentally-friendly German dyes and neutralized the wastewater, he still felt drawn to natural dyes. Today BISA, his studio in Pejeng, produces hand-blocked and hand-drawn batiks using natural brown and indigo dyes.After much experimentation and research, Tjok Agung has imported seeds from different varieties of indigo plants from Thailand and Sumatra. Deeply concerned about environmental issues and sustainable livelihoods in Pejeng, he's already involved in several community projects. Growing indigo offers an opportunity for village farmers to benefit from a new crop while nourishing the rice fields. Planting indigo between rice crops allows the rice fields to rest or be sown, which has not been done in the land for a long time. “Not only can they sell the indigo to me, but the fields benefit from the extra nitrogen since some indigo plants are legumes.""Some Objectives Include:
Understanding and learning first hand the process of designing, wax stamping, painting traditional batik 
Have a better insight into the various batik traditions specific to different regions in Indonesia 
Ecosystem of natural environment and community resources involved in making and sustaining these crafts and heritage 
Learn how this initial research journey can shape the next steps towards building a more responsible fashion system I aim to develop
Eventually, I want to be able to travel to other countries in, and surrounding, the Southeast Asian region, a broader idea of home and cultural heritage in which I relate to as a Singaporean. I want to know more about the traditions, textiles and crafts that belong to us as a region. For example: hemp weaving and indigo dying in Sapa, Vietnam; Intricately patterned hand-woven silks from Thailand; Lotus Silk Weaving in Myanmar; Nettle and Silk Weaving in Bhutan; Cotton farmers in India and Pakistan who are in the process of converting their farms into organic cotton farms… the list goes on. The shift towards a Western ideal for the sake of modernization happened so quickly  in the past half century that our invaluable cultural knowledge has often been diminished as a result. Fashion need not only take on western cultures -- I know it, you know it, but the industry at large needs more to show for it.
 
This research trip is crucial towards outlining my business model, ascertaining a production and supply chain, formulating the best way to communicate and exemplify values of transparency and community-building, and taking a bigger stride towards shifting existing modes of information and consumption in which the fashion industry currently relies on. This is not something that happens in a snap -- there is more research to be done after this one trip, but this is your investment towards building a world that has not existed yet, but we dare to dream of now. -$200 REWARD

https://www.facebook.com/pg/Tarum-Natural-Dye-236518499753576/photos/","Being the first step of this journey, I don’t have all the answers or figured out what this looks like. However, this is not on a whim and I have been deeply committed to these issues throughout my work thus far. I believe the learnings and outcomes from this research will inform my next steps in a way that is true to its origin -- and any meaningful step in the right direction can only be through first-hand experience and actual connections within the region. 

In addition, some of the best and most brilliant like-minded individuals in the industry happen to be close mentors and peers, many of whom are educators and academia at Parsons and professionals in the industry who are there to guide me every step of the way. So, take this big leap of faith with me and let's start this journey waiting to be written.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout US$ 4\n\n\n\nshoutouts!\n\n\nA public shout out on Facebook for your support!

Ever been a victim of an overbearing Bad Boss or a backstabbing colleague?
Bad Boss is a simple yet fun card game that includes the most distinct characters you will ever find in the office!
The objective is to get rid of all the cards and stay away from the Bad Boss card. It's a quick game you can play during your break without getting fired!
We created this game while laughing at our own experiences from all our previous jobs. Our desire is to capture typical office characters using bold illustrations. Please support our Kickstarter campaign to make this game a reality. 
Maybe you can give a pack to your boss and a pack to that annoying colleague!




































Kickstarter exclusive limited edition A3 poster (frame not included)








Kickstarter exclusive limited edition Bad Boss white cotton tshirt 





























We sincerely hope that our card game will encourage people to laugh at themselves. Better humor than fists in the work environment!!

















In our humble opinion, the Bad Boss card game would make the perfect office gift exchange present so our production and delivery schedule is aimed towards the Christmas season!









We want the shipping of the card game to be affordable but yet reliable. Therefore we opted for registered mail which we think has the best balance. In addition, registered mail packages can be tracked for selected countries. To protect your Bad Boss card game from damage during shipment, bubble padded envelopes will be used.
Please note that the shipping rate above is for a single deck and will be adjusted accordingly with additional packs and items ordered.

















We are a small bunch of entrepreneurs who used to slog daily in our corporate jobs. Seeing all the different characters in the office gave us the inspiration to portray them in a humorous way. 
Ming - the creator and designer of the bad boss characters and game
Philo - she takes care of our customers and ensures prompt deliveries
Kong - he is the guy who made the video and drank all our coffee


Other ways you can help
Help us spread the awareness on bad bosses and co-workers today!
Beyond making a monetary contribution, we would greatly appreciate it if you could help us spread the word by sharing our campaign link on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter. Our dream is to create a fun community and more games about office politics and horrible bosses.

The Backstory
Hi there, my name is Ah Long, and I’m the lead creator of HUSTLE!
I would deeply appreciate your help and support to get this passion project started. Your contributions will go a long way toward developing the local board game community, alongside helping me to improve the product's artwork, quality (with glossy cards if we reach $10,000 or more) and overall design. We will be teaming up with local retail logistics company blu for affordable home shipping and self-collection.
•The concept of 'Hustle: A Singaporean Card Game' arose when I was considering the impact of the pandemic, and the massive disruptions it had caused to our lives, jobs and communities. Amidst the chaos, there were stories of individuals who had found out ways to secure their financial independence and stay afloat through a variety of means - admittedly, both legal and illegal. In particular, the KTV hosts and Temasek mask thieves stood out to me.
There's also been much discussion in the media over the 'hustle culture' and 'side-gigging', and how many today have taken these hustles on to pursue both their passions and their financial freedom. The economy is a funny thing, and this brave new world has created a whole new range of opportunities for livelihoods.
I then thought, 'Why not create a card game to capture this crazy, wonderful, terrifying moment in time?' The silliness of HUSTLE! was born as a result. I'm deeply grateful to the many family members and friends who have offered their criticism (feedback is love!), time and encouragement to birthing this baby.
This game is dedicated to all trying to make the best of this pandemic, and in particular, to our heroic frontliners who continue to ensure that this society keeps running. Kudos to you all.
I hope you will enjoy this game as much I as did creating it, and that this game can set you on the path to understanding your own journey to financial freedom.","We want to be frank and honest with all our generous backers so that you get the most genuine experience with our product.  

PRODUCTION  
We are in the final stages of sourcing and procurement with a local production company for printing our prototypes and will plan to engage them for our official decks as well.  To mitigate the risk of delays, we will be producing our cards locally to get the decks straight to you as fast as possible, and restricting distribution to the local market. We are also currently extensively prototyping and checking the quality of the cards to ensure the best version of our cards gets to you quickly.  

STRETCH GOALS AND REWARDS  
With some backer rewards requiring custom cards playable in-game, this might cause a slight delay. Our stretch goals also include cards that are not necessary for the basic version of the game but offer a more unique and dynamic gameplay. If we were to hit this stretch goal, there would be a slight delay in production as we add in these cards. 
 
FUNDING  
Kickstarter has an ""All-or-Nothing"" policy where the campaign gets $0 funding if the campaign doesn't reach its target. It would mean so much to the HUSTLE team if you could help to spread and share the word about this game so it becomes a reality for you (and for us).  

The HUSTLE team genuinely believes in this game being able to start new conversations about what it means to be financially independent in Singapore in this day and age.  The risk we are taking with Kickstarter is that if we are unable to be fully funded, we are not able to get the funding needed. We may have to delay the release of CHAO RECRUIT! the card game if we are unable to secure the required level of funding. Nonetheless, the team will do our very best to get this card game out and deliver a high-quality, fun, and exciting card game by our proposed date.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nThe Supporter\n\n\nEvery dollar counts in hustling!

It’s no secret that our planet has suffered the consequences of urbanization in the past decades. With the increase in population comes mass production of goods, of which none had brought about more environmental harm than plastic. But have we paused to think if the short-term convenience brought about by single-use plastic products justifies the long-term harm of our environment?
While many of us conscientiously make the effort to recycle plastic products or reuse them, do you know that only 9% of plastic waste is recycled annually? Humans are producing and disposing of plastic at a speed faster than ever with 46% of annual plastic waste coming from plastic packaging.









The grim reality is that even the most technologically advanced recycling plants can’t keep up with our plastic consumption, which increases exponentially every year.









Quinn and Oliver’s mission is to help reduce damaging plastic footprints by changing how you go about otherwise unnoticed activities in day-to-day life, such as taking a shower.









































Quinn and Oliver products are biodegradable, cruelty-free, organic, vegan, halal-certified, and do not contain harsh chemicals typically used in body care products. Plant-based ingredients are carefully chosen to ensure our products are kind to your skin, as well as the environment.

With the rise of the clean beauty movement and the desire to create products that are more environmentally friendly, Quinn and Oliver was born.
About Shanna:
I grew up using personal care products that smelled great with tons of suds. The more fragrant and suds, the better. As I became a mum and read about the detrimental effects on our planet as a result of human consumption and behavioral patterns, I am concern about the world my children will inherit. I worry about the things I used and bathed them with. Less became more. Lesser ingredients, chemicals, and more natural, the better. The world is still beautiful but it is at a different state now. It needs to heal. I believe we can do our part one way or another. Quinn and Oliver is a small step towards a bigger movement for a sustainable future. One that begins with you.     
About Jerrine: 
I have always been more of an animal lover than I am knowledgeable about environmental pollution issues. Watching how our daily life choices can cause a cascading detrimental effect on our environment and leading to animals’ suffering in recent years, I wondered what can be done beyond the usual recycling of plastics.
Quinn and Oliver is not just a body wash product. It is the ideology and approach that gives us a chance to stop creating the endless loop of destruction to our planet. The focus is not on us, it is on your important decision to effect a change we need. Because of your leap of faith in us, we hope we can all create a better, renewed world for a very long time to come. Welcome to your new cleaning ritual.","Our product is currently in the development phase and we will start full production if we reach our funding goals. We are planning to start shipping the first units around September 2021. Our mission is to convince people that switching to powder body wash is a better alternative to conventional liquid body wash. Changing of habits and mindset is our biggest challenge and we hope to effect the change our planet badly needs through the support of our backers.

It’s a safe space for you and your brain 
The activities will nurture you throughout your inner turmoil 
Learn more about yourself as you analyse the pages you’ve ‘destroyed’
There are no limits 
Bad Points: There are no limits JournalDrawing, destroying, and leaving kiss marks on ‘INTERNAL SCREAMING: The Book’ are encouraged. Packed with 170 pages of activities, this is an A5 sized journal, with durable paper, as we will ask you to do some pretty stupid shit.

Hello everyone! Previously, I have been making countless enamel pins with chibi designs! Holidays are one of the greatest joys in life. A time we look forward to every time of the year. This time, Halloween is just around the corner and I thought it's the best time to include a special little ghostie; Mimikyu!

 

   Originally, I got really interested in Mimikyu due to its story. A story about a cute little Pokemon trying to make friends! It inspired me to make my new series, Mimikyu Doll Plushie Friends! In this project, it includes Mimikyu dressed up in many different outfits to prepare for Halloween with many fan favourites like eeveelutions and many more! I hope that not only Mimikyu has a blast during this Halloween but also make a ton of new friends with everyone! I hope everyone is excited to have a new cute friend!










  Kickstarter operates via Pledge Now, Pay Later system. This means that Kickstarter will not charge you until the end of the campaign and only if our initial goal is funded.
  Pledges are entitled to modify their pledges (i.e. Edits/cancel) at any given point provided that it is made before the deadline of the pledging period.
  The pledges accumulated will initially unlock the starting goal, Mimikyu Pin ($300) as well as many others on the own respective milestones, with additional designs/ variants or special gifts the more milestones this project unlocks.
  By pledging, you'll get your favorite Pins at a discounted rate with freebies and also with standard grade (Grade A) - any extras Pins will then be sold on my Online Store at a higher price in the future.
  During the end of the pledging period, you will automatically be sent a kickstarter survey that asks inquire about your shipping details i.e. Delivery address, and which pin(s) you would like to receive. Please not that colors may slightly vary from monitor to monitor.










My Eeveekyu will all be made as Hard Enamel Pins, each with a classical metal plating in colour Gold. Size will vary between 1.25 to 1.5 inches accordingly. There are countless uses for pins such as accessories for clothing, collections, gifts and many more! We're aiming for the unlock or all our Elemental dragons and with that, bring about more hidden goodies! You will be eligible to pick any of the unlocked pins after the pledging campaign through a survey which will be sent to your e-mail!

I´m very active on Instagram and you can follow me for more information and updates!


Pledge Now, Pay Later! This means that Kickstarter will not charge you until the end of the campaign and only if our initial goal is funded. This helps to unlock the alternate designs as shown as stretch goals too!


When the project ends, you will automatically be sent a Kickstarter survey that asks for your delivery address, and which pin(s) you would like. Please note that colors may slightly vary from monitor to monitor.









August: The campaign runs.


August-September: The campaign ends, all pledges are collected/cards are charged, and I will get the backer reward surveys set up and sent out.


September-October: It takes about 2 weeks for Kickstarter to release the funds raised to me. Once I get the funds, production shall commence! Production should take around 2-3 weeks with about a week of transit time for the pins to arrive to me after being shipped out.


November-December: Pins arrive! I will quality check and review everything before starting to pack up rewards and send them to their new homes.


Ps. This is a tentative timeline. I have included buffer time for in-case there are production snags or any delays. I will update backers throughout the whole process on Kickstarter and Instagram.









Due to global slowdowns as a result of the Covid-19 situation, international shipping will be expecting an additional 2-3 months delay in addition to the usual shipping time.


All shipment will be ordinarily shipped from Singapore using SingPost's Standard Shipping. We will be providing registered mails for all pledges received. A tracking number will be provided with all pledges once the shipment is ready to be shipped. The update of the status for your tracking information is based solely on each individual country's postal services.


Please be informed that the shipping duration will be equal for all forms of mail. On average, packages may take up to approximately 4-6 weeks to reach their destination. However, in rare occasions packages may be delayed up to 3 months due to factors beyond my control such as delays at custom, high delivery load during festive seasons and many others.","Risks are always involved during the entire procedure to the final product. From the manufacturing errors to extended production and also shipping delays, there are many factors that needs to be taken into account when providing an accurate shipping time. For this reason, I have decided to allot an extra month for the completion of this project. I have been running kick-starter projects for two years running and had made multiple pin projects along the way! As such, I'm confident in my management capabilities in monitoring a smooth cycle through the experiences I gained along the way.

I'm currently anticipating the risks that could arise when dealing with the manufacturers. I'm doing my best to work closely with my designated manufacturers to reduce any chances of possible risks that might happen during the manufacturing period. You might experience a little variant in the colors as it varies from screen to screen. They may also look slightly different from the featured designed in accordance to their production. As most variants have minimal effect on the final product, it will not result in any changes to the overall aspects of the pins.

Therefore, with all the factors in mind, I would like to remind everyone that the time line may not be reliable due to the different factors out of my control which resulted in my decision to allot an extra month for the completion of this project. I will be relentlessly trying my outmost best to be able to provide a solution for any given situation at the shortest possible time frame. I will also be sure to keep everyone posted and updated on all situations. Thank you kindly for your support and Have a great day!","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 8 or more\n\nAbout US$ 6\n\n\n\n1x Acrylic Charm\n\n\n♥ All designs are available as Acrylic charm. \n\n♥ Size will

The 22seven ORION backpack system is designed so that you can quickly pack for the day’s needs at work. Completely customizable to ensure your professional gear is organized and easily accessible.









What’s more, it looks and works great for after work get-togethers or even a workout at the gym too.

















And because everyone has a different style, we have two options – Stealth Black in ballistic nylon and Urban Heather in high weave polyester.

















Configured with its ergonomically designed FacePak, it offers you all the features you need for your busy lifestyle.









Or personalize your BasePak with the multi-dimensional StylePak accessories so that you have the flexibility to adapt during the day.









Unlike other brands that offer the same bag in different colors, we brought you two different backpacks. Both distinctively styled for individuality. 

















 Pick one that reflects your style. It is all about expressing your unique personality!






















































The BasePak features patented FIDLOCK magnetic snap fasteners. This ultra-reliable fastening system makes it quick to remove the FacePak and allows you to securely attach the optional StylePak accessories.









Configure it, however and whenever you need to. It is fun and easy too.









Back us now so that we can create more exciting StylePak accessories for your lifestyle, personalized. Be ready to adapt on the go and don’t get caught out by what the day throws at you!









Unlike other modular backpacks that offer several combinations for a few pre-conceived uses, the 22seven ORION backpack is completely adaptable with a wide range of StylePak accessories. This is beyond modularity. 









No two people have the same needs and style. Create your unique backpack and make a statement now!









We mean it when we say the 22seven ORION backpack is the only bag you need for a lifestyle personalized!









With these innovative StylePak accessories, the 22seven ORION backpack system will change how you work and how you live your life.









We need a successful Kickstarter campaign so that we can introduce our first series of StylePak accessories after the campaign. 









With the 22seven StylePak accessories, the power of customization is in your hands.









Help us bring the 22seven StylePak Ecosystem to life so that we can create even more innovative accessories!

















We know that practical functionality and ergonomics are the cornerstones of user experience. So we aim to maximize your convenience and satisfaction!









We designed it so that you have quick access to all your documents and gear. 









We want to help you keep your day organized.









Beyond just clever design and complete customization, we have selected top-grade fabrics and quality components for a premium look and feel on all 22seven products.











Of course, don´t just take our word for it! We have conducted extensive lab testing and field testing to ensure we deliver on our promise of performance and quality.

















Our experienced 22seven team members have longstanding relationships with some of the most technically proficient factories that are trusted by many of the world’s most established brands.


Help get us funded so that we can work directly with these partners to bring you not only the best craftsmanship but also ensure you get the greatest value too!









We all have several bags stashed somewhere around the house yet most times we end up using one bag for most occasions because it is just too much trouble swapping bags and repacking our stuff!









No one bag suits all our activities for the day but let’s face it, none of us like to carry more than one bag. So we spent three years creating the ONE customizable backpack for all your work and lifestyle needs.

















After years of designing and making products for major brands in the sporting and lifestyle markets, we have seen many great products brought to market but the unique “you” is still missing in the product.
So we put our brains together and founded a different kind of brand, focused on designing products of great value that truly make a difference to the way you live.
With our experienced developers and direct access to material suppliers and factories, it means we only invest in what truly makes the product better for YOU.
By creating and delivering premium products made of the best materials, modern manufacturing technologies and true craftsmanship, the result is a range of ever-evolving products that live up to your lifestyle needs.
At 22seven, we are dedicated to creating premium products that are timeless in design and adaptable to your changing needs for years to come so that you can live your lifestyle, personalized!","Unexpected issues with deliveries in light of shipping disruption during the current pandemic.

If you are a parent you may own a baby carrier and babywear often but how do you keep your child warm and protected from the elements in cold weather? Avoid layering bulky jackets in-between the both of you and use your combined body heat to create a cocoon of warmth for you and your child.
We are excited to launch a winter babywearing cover that is affordable, functional and looks as good as your carrier! 
The Cocoon is made from two fabrics. The front panel is made from a specially designed three layer fabric. It has a waterproof outer, windproof middle layer and a warm fleece on the inside. The back panel is made from a stretchy fabric.
It is:

  Unisex
  Can fit a range of sizes
  Waterproof
  Windproof
  Warm 
  Looks great underneath your jacket

Like a Cocoon the design makes sure wind and cold cannot pass in through the sides and allows body heat to become trapped creating a small oven of warmth.",We already have manufacturing set up and have funded the initial development and sampling. The funding achieved from Kickstarter will help us to manufacture a our first round of Cocoons and bring them to market.

Made Well & Lived InJournal Projects is an independent label based in Singapore. Launched over a year ago, we had the simple belief of creating products that are timeless in its value and aesthetic. Our pioneering product was in small batch raw selvedge denim, we loved the high standards set in the artisanal denim market and were determined to strive for it.(Raw Selvedge Denim can only be woven on special shuttle looms and is differentiated by their coloured fray-less denim edges, a hallmark of premium denim. Unwashed and untreated, the denim fabric will fade and develop character with multiple wears.)


Raw Denim Worn For A Year





Individually Custom Made Our venture into custom-made selvedge denim was driven by customer demand and we believed that it tied-in well with the ethos of personalisation and wabi-sabi lifestyle that came with raw denim. Through customisation, you will own a pair of denim jeans that is truly yours. Each pair of denim is individually crafted to your specifications by the experienced hands of our family of craftsmen in Indonesia.Customisation is a 2-way collaboration between you and us and we believe in getting things right the first time. Therefore, we have created 5 easy steps to help you create your own custom made denim jeans.







Once you have pledged your reward, we will send out a survey to your email. Customize Your Selvedge Denim In 5 steps.1) Choose your Fabric2) Choose your Design (Front & Back Pockets and Fly)3) Choose your Buttons, Rivets & Thread4) Choose your Fit and Size (or key in your own measurements)5) Opt for any Free Add-ons (waist adjusters, cargo pockets)

Jubileon is an independent and aspiring watchmaker in sunny Singapore. Jubileon was founded in 2015 – when Singapore celebrated the Golden Jubilee – by two mechanical engineers in the advanced manufacturing industry who are fanatical about mechanical watches.We have deep respect and reverence for the traditions of watchmaking, and our dream is to produce high quality Made in Singapore watches one day. Till then, every Jubileon watch will be of Swiss Made quality.







The Superellipse is a premium Swiss Made automatic watch at an accessible price point. Its unique and unorthodox design - a combination of the beautiful cushion case and screwed down bezel - is highly provocative and is destined to polarize opinions. The name of the watch is inspired by the superellipse curve, which is the mathematical representation of the cushion shape.Personally, we love it very much, and we hope that you will love it as much as we do!At a glance:
Swiss Made.
Designed and engineered in Singapore.
Swiss Made ETA 2824-2 movement.
39 mm wide, 9.4 mm thick, 50 mm lug-to-lug.
Sapphire crystals front and back.
50 m water resistance.
Stainless steel 316L case, brushed and polished.
Custom decorative screw heads for bezel and caseback.
Engraved logo on crown and buckle.
Dial with applied indices and date window. 

Leaf-shaped minute and hour hands with Super-Luminova C1.
First 500 pieces individually numbered.










 







Every detail matters - Many watchmakers opt for stock components in order to minimize cost and maximize profit. Not us. We have carefully designed and customized many of the components in Superellipse to ensure that it is an exquisite and truly unique watch.Masterfully engineered - With deep experience in the advanced manufacturing industry, we uphold the highest engineering standards when it comes to the engineering of the Superellipse. Every component is modelled on computer, so that our manufacturers know exactly what we want and we know exactly what you are getting.







 







""For me, it feels like a timeless choice, that should be at home in the office, with jeans, or with the Hawaiian shirt eating pineapple shaved ice. Some things are just modern classics.""- WristWatchReview [Link to full review]







The quest for perfection - As perfectionists, we have impossibly high standards and don't settle for less. We have worked very hard with our manufacturers to ensure that the Superellipse is crafted meticulously to extremely high quality.







Swiss Made - A high quality watch must be manufactured by the very best, and that means Swiss Made. We are partnering with reputable and experienced partners in Switzerland who produce watches for several of the top brands in the world. It goes without saying that every Superellipse watch is hand-assembled in Switzerland by highly skilled watchmakers, as proven by the coveted Swiss Made brand.







 







The perfect package - When it comes to delivering quality and value, we don't cut corners. The Superellipse is an assembly of features typically found only in high-end Swiss Made watches.







Dimensions:
Case width: 39 mm.
Case width with crown: 43 mm.
Lug-to-lug: 50 mm.
Case thickness: 9.4 mm.
Lug width: 20 mm.








The dominant theme of the Superellipse is the iconic cushion shape, which is our personal favourite shape for watches. The cushion shape can be mathematically represented as a superellipse curve, which inspired the name of the watch. In Superellipse, the cushion shape is hinted through the bezel, the caseback, the crown, the minute markings on the dial (although the prototype photos do not currently feature this), and at the base of the three hands. 

 


Geometry definition of the bezel





 







The heart of the Superellipse is the Swiss Made ETA 2824-2 movement, an extremely rare choice for watches at this price point due its high cost. We chose ETA over other Swiss, Japanese and Chinese movements as ETA is one of the most trusted and established powerhouses in movement manufacturing. With a reliable workhorse powering every tick, the Superellipse will be your trusted companion for many years to come.







ETA 2824-2 features and specifications:
28,800 vibrations per hour (8 ticks per second). 
Swiss Made 25 Jewels. 
38 hours running time.

To manufacture, each piece is first stamped out from a blank to get an approximate shape, and then machined to the final form. A non-circular shape means that the Superellipse case is more difficult to produce, where a lathe alone is insufficient.Lastly, the chamfers are expertly polished to achieve the scintillating mirror finish, while the remaining surfaces are carefully brushed to get the beautiful hairline finish. The case has been meticulously designed, which is apparent from the many continuous curves on the case, such as the one joining the lugs to the side of the watch.








 







Being mechanical engineers, we make no secret of our love for screws, bolts and nuts. Naturally, rather than pressed-down, the bezel and the caseback are screwed-down to the main body with four screws each. The screws, which have customised screw heads that are beautifully polished, also double as ornamental adornments to the four corners of the bezel and the caseback. 







The word ‘SUPERELLIPSE’ is laser-engraved on the top half of the caseback, while the first 500 Superellipse watches additionally feature a limited edition running number (No. 1, No. 2, … , No. 500) at the bottom half.







 







Both the bezel and the caseback are encased with sapphire crystals, which stay practically scratch-free even after years. For the caseback, the sapphire crystal provides a clear window to the intricate inner workings of the ETA 2824-2 movement.We use sapphire crystals instead of mineral crystals even though they are several times more expensive. With hardness that is second only to diamond, the sapphire crystal is extremely scratch resistant and retain its brand new look even after many years in service. 







 







The dial is a combination of pad-printed minute markings and applied hour indices. The hour indices are our proprietary design, which have multiple chamfers to improve reflectivity.

The length of each minute markings have been carefully modified so that they form a unique superellipse shape (which unfortunately has been left out in the present prototype, but will be included in actual product).For the wording layout, there are also two options:

Singapore edition - with 'JUBILEON SINGAPORE' on top and 'AUTOMATIC' below. This gives the dial a well-balanced feel.

International edition - with 'JUBILEON AUTOMATIC' on top and blank below. This is an alternate dial for backers who prefer not to have the word 'SINGAPORE' on the dial.








Note: You can choose the type of dial layout at the end of the campaign. 









Like many of the components in Superellipse, much attention has been paid to the design of the three hands. The leaf-shaped hour and minute hands are derivative of the superellipse shape – achieved by joining together two opposite curves in the superellipse shape.







In addition, each of the hand also sport a superellipse-shaped base. To ensure great visibility at low light, Super-LumiNova C1 pigments are applied on the hands, while an angled top surface (rather than a flat top surface) improves light reflection and legibility during the day.







 







To complete the Superellipse, we are offering three great strap options to pair the watch head:
Black genuine calfskin leather, embossed with crocodile pattern.
Black genuine calfskin leather, smooth.
Black woven nylon.
All three options come with a customised tongue buckle bearing the Jubileon logo, brushed to the same hairline finish as the case. We only have photographs of the first option at this moment and are working on high quality photographs of the other two.Note: You can choose the strap type at the end of the campaign.


Genuine calfskin leather, with embossed crocodile pattern





Also, we are exploring the possibility of working with a local leather artisan in Singapore to provide hand-stitched genuine leather as a premium option.







The Superellipse series is offered in three amazing styles:
Jet Black
Metallic Silver
Sunburst Grey
Each of the style pairs beautifully with the three strap options offered.
Note: You can choose the style and strap at the end of the campaign!








 









 







First backed, first served - The first 500 Superellipse watches are classified as Limited Edition and will be individually laser engraved with their respective number. The earlier you back, the lower your number will be!







 








We have not decided on any stretch goal for now, but we have some exciting ideas and so we are reserving this space!Do let us know if there is anything that you would love to see on the Superellipse!







Based on the first prototype, we have made several design enhancements. As these are minor changes, we have decided not to go through another round of prototyping to save cost and money (which ultimately translates into cost savings for backers). These changes are listed below:
Minute markings in superellipse shape.

Logo on crown and buckle updated with a cleaner version. 








 









 







 







We are committed to delivering products of the highest quality to our backers, and Superellipse is designed to be a timekeeping companion for many years to come. Therefore, we provide a limited warranty of manufacturing defects for a period of two (2) years for every Superellipse watch after the original purchase. 







The Superellipse has already been prototyped and is fully ready for production. Personally, we absolutely love the watch and have been wearing it for a daily basis. We would love to see this amazing watch on your wrist too.However, we run on a shoestring budget and cannot afford to pay for the tooling and parts required for a minimum order of the Superellipse. Therefore, your help and support will be needed to realize the production of the Superellipse. In return, we offer the Superellipse at a heavily discounted price (>40% off future retail price), which we think is a great value as branded watch of similar (or even inferior!) quality is several times more expensive.Also, your support will mean the world to us. Besides enabling the production of Superellipse, they fulfil our dreams of designing and manufacturing our own watch series, and will be great encouragement for us to continue innovating and designing more great watches in the future.Thank you very much!","We have already received the first prototype from our partner in the Switzerland. The quality and craftsmanship of the Superellipse is superb and eclipses the very high bar that we set for the product quality. For the dial, there is slight deviation between the minute markers printing in the prototype and our design, but we have since communicated the issue to our partner and have received assurance that it can be easily rectified for  the actual production batch.

With the method of production and the quality of the product already proven, you can be assured that a top-notch product will be delivered to you. As the watch assembly takes place in Switzerland, please be aware that unexpected circumstances beyond our control may lead to late deliveries.

In any case, we will be maintaining a regular and personal communication with our partner in Switzerland to ensure that the production is on schedule. Lastly, we will also be providing regular updates to our backers during the production process.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge AU$ 5 or more\n\nAbout $4\n\n\n\nJoin the Bandwagon!\n\n\nThank you and welcome onboard!

 THE DILEMMA



Have you ever experienced the embarrassment of holding up the queue from keeping change?





Accepting change is easy, but keeping it has always been a struggle. It's the year 2016, but we haven't really put a lot of thought into how we keep our change. So we wanted to create a wallet that would not only be beautiful, but would put our change receiving woes to rest.




Do you fumble with a coin pouch in your bag just to keep your coins?





 


Have you ever tried to improvise with your coin pouch, to no avail?





 


Do your coins magically disappear after you put them in your pocket?





MEET KIN 







KIN is the world’s first wallet that separates your cash and coins in a cinch. The wallet offers a simple solution to manage an age old dilemma, and is designed to manage coins and cash efficiently in ways not imagined! 
WHY YOU'LL LOVE KINKIN does the separating for you.
 We’ve always received our change together, so why do we separate our coins and cash? With KIN, simply put all your change from the top, and let the wallet do the separating for you.







 


KIN catches all your coins safely, so you don't have to worry about them falling out.






       
KIN makes coin management so much easier.



To take the coins out, simply open the flap on the side. Take what you need, and close it with a snap!





KIN holds as many coins as you need.



Lots of coins? Don't worry, KIN's got you.





SPECIFICATIONS








 



KIN does the job without adding unnecessary bulk to your wallet.





 



Many of you have asked us how thick KIN would be with cards. Here's a comparison of the wallets filled with 9 cards!





 




KIN is water resistant and built to last with state of the art industrial materials.





KIN comes in three beautiful colours, guaranteed to add a splash of fun and joy into your life.

 



KIN in original Burnt Sienna.





 



KIN in Olive Green.





 



KIN in Ultramarine.





 




NEW: KIN in Meteorite Grey





 



NEW: KIN in Kepler Black





 

 THE PROCESS
KIN was born when we noticed the problem of keeping change had gone by unaddressed for so long. After months of sketching, making, and creating, we have finally created something that we are truly proud of. 











 








  








 STRETCH GOALS



Meteorite Grey is our very first stretch goal, and you have helped us unlock it! Thank you so much!





 



For those who live for the colour black, we are excited to announce that KIN's new addition: Kepler Black is unlocked! Thank you so much!





  









 
THE TEAM
We are a team of industrial designers from Singapore who want to make meaningful products to solve everyday problems. We made KIN to make your life easier and more convenient, and we hope that you can back us to bring KIN to the world.

 Donation ‘One person's trash is another person's treasure. When you donate to Timeless Clothing we either convert it to a design of higher value or it is purchased by people who genuinely like it as it is.Pop- Up workshops Workshops will be held ones in three months in shopping malls around Singapore where artist and designers will teach sustainable techniques and spread public awareness about up-cycle by creating something that has better environmental value. Provide DIY & hacks to make simple garments by yourself from your own Sarees or materials.Funds raised through Kickstarter, we will be able to conduct a Pop-Up workshop and do a marketing campaign to kick-start our brand.We buy more clothes than what we need, cheap and low-quality clothes which is not environmental friendly as it is not sustainable, not renewable nor biodegradable. How can we contribute to creating a balance in the environment?Upcycling is a new emerging trend that serves the purpose of giving new life to items that are considered as waste material or items that are to be disposed of. The way we produce and consume clothes need to be changed and the change starts from within:
BUY LESS - Buy only what is needed to Know the story behind it - what is it made up of? who made it? is it ethical? 
Shop local or get your clothes tailor-made 
Up-cycle the clothes you stopped using as it helps reduce the volume of discarded clothes and waste materials that go into landfills every year. In turn reducing the production of new or raw material which also means a reduction in water wastage, air pollution, etc and helps in conserving natural resources.","-Lack of brand recognition - it is a new brand and not many people know about it and not many people are open to the idea of converting an ethnic wear to a western wear

What you see on this campaign page is still in the developmental stage and we are trying to make the best shoe bag we can before we send the design to the manufacturers. We will constantly provide updates on improvements, manufacturing and shipping along the way.

There may be unforeseen issues with manufacturing which may cause delays in shipping, so we hope that you understand that we will try our best to send the bags to you on time. We also want to ensure that every single bag passes the quality checks so that you will get the best quality products that we offer.

 Mao'm a starving comic artist who is too poor to pay for the manufacturing of the pins. By pledging to this project, mew help me pay for the manufacturing of the pins!  As gratitude, mew will get the maogic pins first before anymao else and at an exclusive kickstarter discounted price. 









The higher tier mew pledge, the more value it is for mew and if mew pledge at all the pins ($35) tier or above, mew will get some stickers for free! Mew can also purchase these stickers by adding the add on price!

























There are many other characters in Tails of Magicat which i would like to make into pins if we reach and surpass the stretch goals mao will start cweating more! Throughout the course of the campaign, Mao will be adding more stretch goals, so stay tuned! 

















Mew can purchase stretch goal pins at anytime during the campaign by adding your tier pin prices to mew pledge! If mew really want to have any character to be turned into a pin or feeling extra generous, mew can also pledge at the king pin tier!









Here's the plan for this project but if anything pops up, mao will be sure to update mew! 









































Mao'm magicatchoo, cweator of tails of magicat! Mao enjoys creating imaginary worlds and telling stories through picture! Mao dream is to start a studio one day! 
While waiting for mew pins to get made, feel free to read Tails of Magicat webcomic for free on Webtoon. Help support me and fund new projects on Patreon. You can also find me on Instagram or Twitter!

Stampede is a 2-4 player game (best played with 4) pitting animals of The Savanna against each other in a race for survival.
Players reveal race tiles each turn to progress their animal’s journey, while playing Power cards to further their progress, or hinder other animals from winning. 

































Polly the Flamingo: Polly prophesied and convinced the animals of an imminent attack that could potentially annihilate all life on Earth. The animals shrugged the idea off, claiming Polly was just a nut-bird who lacked sleep. Despite that, Polly was undeterred. She knows the apocalypse awaits... And boy, was she right.









Cassie the Cheetah: Born out of a noble coalition of cheetahs, Cassie was imparted the rich etiquette and traditions of the Felinae family at a very young age. She has excellent posture, neat silky fur with elaborate spot patterns, and the face of a movie star; she even has a distinctive beauty mark - if you look close enough - on her left cheek.









Erica the Elephant: Separated from her parents and deported to a foreign traveling circus, Erica was only left with a charming pink cape - adorned with delicate floral embroidery - in her possession; a memorabilia bestowed by her mother before they parted. Erica soon fled the circus, and after months of drifting, found her way into The Savanna. 









Hank the Hippo: Hank has a long, goofy face, eats whatever he could get his hooves on, and weighs a ton. Oh, he smells funky too. A hippo that insists to be referred to as a ‘river horse’, Hank leads a rather bohemian lifestyle in The Savanna. 









Kobayashi the Kangaroo: This geeky marsupial may look nerdy and amicable, but was a highly skilled boxer back in the day. Kobayashi now spends his time as a full-time bookworm.









Theophila the Toad: After the fall of her native kingdom, Princess Theophila of the Royal Toad Family was exiled for months before seeking asylum in The Savanna. The other animals are always in awe of her grand tales of royalty and subsequent mishap. But as we all know, things only got worse.









Jazz the Norwegian Blue: The last of her kind, Jazz is a little bird with big dreams. She always imagined herself to be an ace-pilot; her body being the aircraft. The other animals are madly in love with her talent and irresistible beauty, making her highly popular among the animal community.









Nick the Crocodile: A Freshwater Crocodile that hails from Northern Australia, Nick is easily distinguished among his animal peers by his heavy Aussie accent. Through his turbulent childhood, Nick’s naturally fearsome appearance induces fear on the other animals; but he really doesn’t mean any harm, heck, he’s a closet vegan.

MANUFACTURING & PRODUCTION

We have learnt a lot from producing Unbearable Winter and Burning Bridges. During the process, we've identified the right formats of artwork to send our factory and appropriate communication in terms of production materials. However, this is still our third game only - and we are still striving to improve our manufacturing process to deliver what we can at a better pricing and with high quality. It's important for us that you receive a great product based on all these fronts.

GAME DESIGN & PLAY-TESTING

We've playtested this game extensively with a wide range of players -- ranging from kids, to casual adult gamers, to seasoned tabletop enthusiasts. The game is fine tuned to ensure that every move is meaningful, and that there's tons of player agency, all the while retaining the fun elements of a race (where it's not over till it's over). With over hundreds of playtest sessions, and learning from the design processes and philosophies that we've learned from our previous releases, we're confident that Stampede is a balanced and fun experience for all.


SHIPPING AND FULFILLMENT

Getting your product to you on time is our goal, and that is why we are working very closely with our production and fulfilment facility to ensure that all products are trackable from when shipped out until delivery. We use our CRM system to capture all tracking codes and automate the issuing, while the community management team will be present to answer any queries you may have. In addition to that, we are also taking caution when shipping to countries with customs thresholds to ensure backers do not pay more than what they are supposed to. Shipping of our products come out of Singapore and China, depending on where the backer is located.


TRANSPARENCY, CONTACTING US, AND UPDATES

At the end of the day, there may be certain obstacles that are beyond our control, but we are committed to updating all our backers regularly during and after the campaign with full transparency. As backers of other games ourselves, we know the importance of being accountable, and as such we'll have our Discord channel and e-mails more than ready for you to contact us. We'll also be active in the comments section of our campaign page. During the campaign period, we want to communicate as much as we can with you, so feel free to reach out to us should you have any concerns.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nFriend of the Savanna ($1.5 USD)\n\n\n\""Thank you for being a friend\"" - Lenny Leonard\n\nThank you for supporting this campaign, backing this tier grants you Discord access to see all the conversations about stretch goals, development and gameplay discussion.\nIncludes:\n\n\nDiscord Access\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 55 or more\n\nAbout $40\n\n\n\nStampede Kickstarter Edition ($40 USD)\n\n\nReceive one copy of Stampede, complete with all Kickstarter exclusive stretch goals we unlock during the campaign.\n\nAdd $55 SGD to your pledge per extra copy.\n\n*Note that shipping is charged AFTER the campaign, please refer to graphic at bottom of page for shipping estimates\nIncludes:\n\n\nStampede\n\n\nRacetrack Playmat\n\n\nKSE Slick Character\n\n\nAll Kickstarter Stretch Goals\n\n\nDiscord Access\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 500 or more\n\nAbout $358\n\n\n\nKing of the Savanna ($370 USD)\n\n\nKing of the Savanna, by backing this tier you will get to design your very own character.

It draws inspiration from the events of covid19 2020, taking on a futurist projection for what is next in fashion. The collection explores the aesthetics of futurist themes and motifs of the pandemic, as well as the functionality of passive personal protection equipment (PPE), slow fashion and product design.
The inception of the project began in the midst of the pandemic, June 2020. The multitude of social and cultural changes throughout major cities drastically affected the lives of millions of people worldwide. These changes occurred on an institutional level and have forced countries to alter their social habits overnight. This collection stems from that curiosity of how these social and cultural changes would affect the industry of fashion in Singapore, and attempts to project a futurist aftermath of how Singaporeans can try to assimilate to these changes in terms of their relationships with wearables.




Entry Stickers of ""I M Okay""




The firestarter to the series began with the single image of a wall of stickers. 
 To be specific, this wall of stickers began as a plain white facade but continuously became littered with “I M OKAY” stickers until a painting of polka dot green, yellow and red with tints of white alphabets is formed. This is a common sight in many Singaporean neighbourhoods as the stickers are used to mark patrons who are temporarily cleared to enter the supermarket premises and these walls are available to get rid of these stickers in case of litter. The concept of marking customers with such a bright neon colour draws reference to many fashion designers who had explored neon palettes in early spring/summer 2020 such as Christopher Kane and Brandon Maxwell. Furthermore, the emblem of “I M OKAY” proves to have some visual affiliation to urban streetwear and its ties to logos. Hence, giving rise to the idea of an entire collection revolving around covid19 motifs.
As covid19 overturns the norms of the world pre-2020, society has to face the fact that specific societal practices will never be the same. Common activities such as air travel or big group events are inhibited, and social lifestyle activities are erased into a blank slate. This applies to fashion as well, as the mentality of day-to-day living has been questioned- we have to question whether our choices for fashion might create a problem of the same magnitude in the future- this refers to fast fashion. Throughout the lockdowns of covid19 ; aviation, transportation and various factory related outputs have greatly reduced. China, for example, had their emission rate reduced by 25% at the start of 2020 due to compulsory lockdown. (Henriques, 2020) The statistics of the emission rate worldwide was what activists had advocated for unapologetically, yet only possible with the immediate threat of a viral pandemic. Luxury is placed on a microscope, as we dwell on the fact that whether air travel, social parties and freedom to not wear a mask is worth risking your own or other peoples’ lives. It is therefore, the perfect pedestal to start creating a new canvas of slow fashion, garments that do not harm the environment as much because we are not producing more than we can wear. These garments would be customizable and fully mendable, the “Chanel” equivalent of 3d printed futuristic garments that you can pass on. In the Journal “Fashion, Sustainability, and the Anthropocene”, we toss around the idea of a closed-loop recycling for fashion. Essentially we utilise unwanted garments as raw materials for another round of production for garments, instead of the detrimental cycle of manufacture, retail, usage and disposal. (Brooks, 2018)
In this collection, we covet the utopian ideal of printable, wearable plastic through a 3D printer. This practice has been around for ages, commonly rapid prototyping machines and 3D printers are owned by individuals and often linked to their own home computers. (Quinn, p144) Eventually, open sourced initiatives will be made available where people could print already designed files into wearable and usable pieces. The way we tackle the mentality of fast fashion is to fight fire with fire- that is attacking the need for individuality and luxury with the user’s own individuality and luxury. With the usage of 3D printing, garments could be fully customizable with the right adjustable pieces, where consumers could print different colours, different sizes, and different styles- all with the simple adjustment of their own computers. This provides an endless variety that negates the need to buy more clothing as it would be cheaper to manufacture for yourself, it would be faster to do it yourself and remove the redundancy of retail and shipping, and it would definitely be the correct sizing, taking away the excess need of overproduction.

4 Ready-to-Wear Sketches","First and foremost, the first challenge for this project is the funding because 3D filament and fabric cost a lot. This is a self funded final year project, which led to the initiation of this kickstarter project. Secondly, another challenge of this project is ensuring that the 3D printing works because we are look for specific aims and functions. This might be problematic because 3D printing is specific and sensitive to the conditions that we set. Lastly, time is also a problem because this project is a year long exploration and a 7 piece collection of this scale might take a while.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 10 or more\n\nAbout $8\n\n\n\nShowcase to the Runway\n\n\nOnce we carry out the runway I will send u a link to the video of the showcase!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 30 or more\n\nAbout $22\n\n\n\nI will print a fabric keychain for you\n\n\nI will print for you a prototype of the 3D Print fabric that is stitched to any pattern you like!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout $36\n\n\n\nI will stitch u a 3D Print beanie\n\n\nThis will be a fully 3d printed beanie made out of a colour of your choice.

BACKGROUND
Neminus XTREME DIVER 300 is an extension to previously launched CuSn8 Bronze MASTER DIVER 1000. This new collection pays tribute to Xtreme Divers (who are also qualified Master Divers) for their love of diving and their commitment to their professions. Xtreme Divers work in some of the world's most treacherous and dangerous environments, which include servicing nuclear power reactors, salvaging marine vessels and platforms, harvesting underwater logs, swimming with sharks and crocodiles and so forth. 









REVIEWS 









THE COLLECTION
One of the key features of the Limited Edition Neminus Xtreme Diver 300 is the multi-colored and 3-dimensional dial or soul of the Xtreme Diver 300. Unlike most dials, where they're monochromatic, the dials of the Xtreme Diver 300 are each unique, dynamic and mesmerizing. Each dial produces different hypnotic effects under different lighting. 
The time and processes taken to make (from design to making the mold to color coating) the dials are 2 to 3 times more time consuming and complicated than for a monochromatic dial. The skills needed by the crafter to make the mold require patience and years of practice. Multiple trials and errors were committed when crafting the exact proportion of the dial to coating the colors on the dial. The ultimate aim for doing all these is to provide added experiences to the wearers and/or owners - be it in-the-water or out-of-water. 









NUCLEAR (REACTOR) DIVER

  Nuclear divers though work in suppression pools (because nuclear plants depend on vast amount of water to drive turbines, create energy and prevent the reactor core from melting), their job entails inspecting and maintaining tanks. While they're fortunate to dive in uncontaminated water, they're exposed to radiations. 
  Inspiration for the color of the dial is from the yellow nuclear symbol. The irregular formations of the dial resemble cracks that could be caused by nuclear blasts.

 DEADHEAD LOGGER

  ""Deadhead Logger"" is one of the most dangerous logging work in the world. The dangers include bites from poisonous snakes, alligators or 250 pound snapping turtles or getting caught in fishing lines and nets. However, the biggest risk is been pinned down to the bottom of the river from rapidly moving logs.
  Inspiration for the color of the dial is from the darken/black logs that are stuck in the rivers. The formations on the dial resembles that of charcoaled logs.

(MARINE) SALVAGE DIVER 

  The main job of a (Marine) Salvage Diver is rescuing vessels in distress. It's job entails solving problems of a ship or drilling platform when it leaks, sinks, crashes or catches fire. The dangers they faced include falling cranes or bulldozers, getting lost, or parts of the vessel collapsing onto them.
  Inspiration for the color of the dial is from the rusty hull of huge vessels roaming the open seas. The cracks resembles that of rust formed at the hull of the huge vessels.

ROULETTE DATE DIAL 
Another key feature of the Xtreme Diver 300 is the date dial. Unlike traditional date dials, inspiration for this creative design is derived from the colorful roulette wheel. The date dial is a colored roulette date dial with red and black background. To make reading the dates more interesting, the 31st is colored GREEN. 
 Another discreet design to reading the date is an unconventional date window to fit the colors nicely in.




Uniquely Designed Colored Roulette Date Dial & Date Window





LUME 
One of the brightest lume in the market, BGW9 Swiss Super-LumiNova Lume are used for the XTREME DIVER 300. The beautiful blue lume exposes the graphic numbers and indices on the ceramic inserts and dial. It also brings to light the unique design of the hour and minute hand. 









EMBOSSED BACK CASE  
Instead of an open back case, a more jovial and passionate skull is designed. Unlike most lightly engraved back cases, the XTREME DIVER 300's is an all-in-one case design and deeply embossed to provide a deep and solid 3D image. To instil motion when admiring the embossed skull, wavy waves are crafted in the background. 
Additionally, ""LIVING DANGEROUSLY"" is discreet engraved on the back case to pay tribute to the Xtreme divers.     









STATE OF MIND OF XTREME DIVERS
According to Maggie Roodt’s “Diving into danger : The 5 most extreme diving jobs”, “… whether you choose to live in a diving bell, dive (in) underwater caves, or simply dive deeper, nothing can weigh you down into eventual nothingness more than not pursuing a passion because of fear. While danger is very real, fear is optional.”
Thus, the word “NO FEAR” is discreetly embossed at the 6H position of the case to bring to light the state of mind of extreme divers - working passionately in the world’s most challenging, dangerous and treacherous environments.     









SCARCITY OF THE XTREME DIVER 300 
Limited pieces (ONLY 100 per model) are produced for the XTREME DIVER 300. The limited edition number is engraved between the lugs to remind owners of its scarcity. 









BEZEL
Rounded ceramic is used as the bezel insert to add toughness and aestheticism to the holistic design of the watch. Perfectly aligned at 12 o’clock, the bezel rotates anti-clockwise and 120 clicks. An applied PIP is added at the 12 o’clock position to provide more light (BGW9) in the dark.     









EMBOSSED CROWN
Deeply embossed is the NEMINUS logo to add aesthetics to the main crown. Crafted smoothly and robustly is the crown guard to protect the crown from unconscious hits and knocks.     









QUICK-RELEASE STRAP
Quick release strap is chosen for the XTREME DIVER 300. This simple mechanism allows easy removal of straps without any replacement tool. This adds ease for owners who like changing straps for different experiences.      









MULTI-LAYER RUSTIC STRAP
Customized for XTREME DIVER 300 is a unique strap comprised of 3 different layers of material – canvas, colored genuine leather & full-grain Horween leather on the underlay. Strap is stitched with colored thread that corresponds with the dial color. The loose strings/threads are purposely pulled to add ruggedness and “rustic-ness” to the strap. They are not due to poor quality control.  









CNC WAVY BUCKLE
Specially designed and customized, the 316L stainless steel buckle is CNC-ed to form the curvy and wavy flow of water to coincide with the nature of the collection – a dive watch. A detailed goggle is also engraved at the back of the buckle for added enjoyment of the beautifully designed and crafted buckle.   









SUEDE LEATHER WATCH ROLL FOR 4 WATCHES  









NO STRETCH GOALS TO UNLOCK
Two (2) extra straps are added to the package after the campaign is funded. All backers will get an extra premium rubber strap from ISO certified company and an extra leather NATO strap in corresponding color.

SHIPPING","RISKS & CHALLENGES

SHIPPING & DELIVERY
Backers are advised that some or certain countries/postal services are slow in processing packages. We, on our part will try to make sure our products are shipped either on time or earlier. If there is any delay, we’re keep you posted.  Upon shipping your watches, we’re email you the courier company, the tracking numbers and the link to use. Having said that, we seek your understanding that once the package leaves our hands, there’s very little we can do to speed things up. We request you check the tracking numbers for the status of the package.

Additionally, due to possible restrictions on shipping by our selected courier companies (EMS International Priority Shipping) during this pandemic period, there might be some delay (currently, mostly good and hopefully by the time we start shipping, the situation is better). If backers want to use an alternate courier company such as DHL, FedEx and so forth, backers will have to bear the additional cost associated with this switch. We will inform backers of the potential price difference.      


MANUFACTURING & QUALITY CONTROL 
Manufacturing, testing and assembling watches are by no means an easy task, especially when there are so many details and small parts that require discreet handling and management. And of course, we want to make them as good a quality as we can. That's why sometimes things don’t go smoothly or the way we want them to go. If that happens, we will make sure to inform you, the backers, well in advance and provide an estimated new shipping and delivery date.  Having said that, during production and quality control period, we will keep you abreast of all developments.  

IMPORT TAXES, DUTIES, VAT, GST 
Additionally, backers are made aware and responsible for any import taxes, duties, VAT or even GST for your country. Backers are also advised to check the value of the import taxes, duties, VAT and GST. MULTIVERSE ENTERPRISE is not responsible for any of backers import tax, duties, VAT or GST when they purchase any of NEMINUS products.

Body Cleanser, Body Oil, Body Lotion, Body Scrub





The Organic Lane is business plan proposal created under the Future Fashion Project module, from International Fashion Business Faculty at Raffles College of Higher Education. The Organic Lane  Thailand’s homegrown organic body care, was found by Ms. Mingkamol Tangtamniyom in 2019. The Organic Lane is for ladies who love to pamper themselves in the comfort at their own home with the blissful Asian scent.  The products are cruelty-free, 99.5% organic with natural ingredients from Thailand with USDA and Ecocert certification, and Dermatologist test.  The ingredients include Thai’s signature Bamboo Charcoal, Thai Jasmine Rice, Carambola, Centella, Jasmine and Chamomile. We strongly ensure that our manufacturing process are good to the environment every step of the way.
Why creates The Organic Lane?
Since The Organic Lane first launch in Singapore. the warm and humid weather all year round can cause scorched skin drenched with salty sweat. Including, Stress is the number one health issue of Singaporean employers, stated by Willis Towers Watson’s 2017 Survey. For 60% of employees revealed to have high levels of stress. The built-in stress can highly effect your skin in a form of dryness, dull, flaky, breakouts, and more. In addition, Singaporean cases of sensitive skin are increasing such as eczema, which caused by new anti-ageing and whitening products (www.asiaone.com, 2018). 
From these issues, I came up with the idea to produce 99.5% organic body care for SEA women who has sensitive skin. Thailand is the neighbourhood country that is rich in natural resources, the herbs and fruits is not only use on Thai cuisine but also impressive arrays of health benefits. e.g. Centella is use for increases blood supply, Chamomile helps to reduce the stress, Thai Jasmine Rice provide anti-ageing benefits and plump skin with deep hydration. Therefore, the brand aim to provide organic body care that suitable for sensitive skin and console your stresses. Together with organic body care will helps to support the organic agriculture that have positive impact on biodiversity, humans, climate, and planets in long run (UN sustainability goals, 2019).

Mission 
As an ethical brand with a concern for sustainability, we offer pure quality of organic products made of natural goodness, that enrich women’s body, skin, and well-being.
The Organic Lane consists of 4 products 
1.Body Scrub (200ml)  : Bamboo Charcoal with Coffee (Purify & Anti-Oxidants)
2.Body Cleanser (192ml)  : Carambola & Centella (Brighten & Refresh)
3.Body Lotion (192 ml)  : Thai Jasmine Rice (Nourish & Youthful) 
4.Body Oil (118ml) : Jasmine & Chamomile (Anti-Aging & Mood Booster)
The plan
I need a little help from our kickstarter friends to support the business proposal to further explore on the real process of R&D of skincare from organic farming certified by USDA and Ecocert.  After produce the products, I plan to launch a first online store on January, 2020, offering our first Origin of Healthy Skin line of body care.
With your support we will: 

  Invest on R&D of The Organic Lane first products line with USDA and Ecocert certified manufacturer (S$260 / 1 product)

With love ❤ Aethereyr","Pin designs shown above are for illustrative purposes only and are subjected to minor changes during final production.

(1) Possible manufacturing defects

I have made many of my pins with my current manufacturers and they are of high standards. Hence, I have good faith that my current manufacturers will do the same for this collection of pins. However, if there should be any defect, I will reproduce the pins which may cause shipping to be delayed.

(2) Colour variations

Actual colours of the pins may differ from the images you see on your screen. I will try my best to ensure that the actual colours resemble the original pin designs.

(3) Line variations

Slight changes in the line art may be made if manufacturers need to do so, as the lines are made of metal and may fused into each other.

(4) Shipping duration

There may be unforeseen delay due to different countries' customs clearance procedures, which are beyond my control.

I will do my best to ensure that packages are packed properly and handed to my local courier service provider promptly. However, please note that anything that happens during the shipping process is beyond my control.

Any additional tax, fees or customs’ charges are the responsibility of the backer.

Backers will be responsible for any returned parcels due to negligence such as providing the wrong shipping address or failing to collect the parcels from their local post office during the collection period. Additional shipping cost to ship the parcels again will be charged accordingly.

Hello there, welcome to our Kickstarter project. We are Alex and William from Singapore, and we are aiming to make high functioning air purifiers cheaply available for all.
We started our journey because we wanted clean air on a budget. A quick look around the market found that a simple HEPA air purifier would set us back by more than SGD 100 per unit, and we wanted 5! Thankfully, our homegrown tech whiz Alex came to the rescue with all his skills in 3D modelling and printing, circuit design and electronics fabrication.
Since we were building our own air purifier, we thought we might as well get the best that technology had to offer. This was when we chanced upon plasma emitters and its effectiveness in killing bacteria and removing odors. To our surprise, we could hardly find such purifiers on the market, and those that are cost around SGD 300.
After some prototyping and cost estimates, we decided this can be produced much more cheaply if we retained functionality without excessive resources pumped towards exterior design, branding and marketing. It is our eventual aim to automate the entire production process to bring down the cost of each purifier down to its bare minimum (SGD 25 for a portable plasma air purifier, SGD 60 for a home plasma&HEPA air purifier). Your contribution will help go a long way in making clean air cheaply and widely available for all.
Design
The process started with hand sketching and then 3D modelling the external casing that houses the purifier components, including the power inlet, circuitry, plasma emitter and fan.




Hand sketch of the Home Air Purifier








3D model of the Home Air Purifier





This went through various iterations to better user experience, increase functionality and streamline production processes.
3D printing
Next we put the 3D model to print.









Assembly




3D printed exterior, fan, plasma emitter





Our Prototype: Presenting the Home Plasma&HEPA Air Purifier









The HEPA filter in blue is made using HEPA-12 (with 99.5% filtration efficiency) and can effectively remove allergens and particulate matter such as dust, pollen, airborne fibres etc). It is coupled with a plasma emitter which emits both negative and positive ions across two emitters, it creates ozone at a rate between 0.14 and 0.18 milligrams per cubic meter. While ozone is a great reducing agent that can both kill bacteria and remove odors, we had concerns about ozone poisoning, but found that the production rate is far below what the World Health Organization suggests is harmful to human health. (160 milligrams per cubic meter)









In effect, what plasma emitters would do for you is to bring the sanitizing effect of the sun into your indoor and enclosed living space.
And then it struck us that no one would lug a 30-centimeter air purifier around even if they wanted fresh air, and so we moved towards making the product portable.
Testing
In order to check that the product was indeed working and purifying air as per the design goals, we subjected the Home Plasma&HEPA Air Purifier to a smoke container test.
We were chiefly interested in particulate matter (PM) and odor, which can respectively be measured by the PM10 and PM2.5 indicators, and the latter by the Total Volatile Organic Matter (TVOC).
We are very happy to announce that within 5 minutes of the purifier's operation the off-the-chart measurements of PM2.5 and PM10 returned to safe levels, while TVOC was drastically reduced within 10 minutes. 

            

          

 Making it portable
We soon found HEPA filters would not fit a portable design, primarily because integrating a fan into it would be expensive and make it more bulky than we hoped. We thus resolved to make a lightweight, small and convenient plasma air purifier. The device features the same emission capabilities as the Home Purifier, but is only 10% of its bulk, and can be powered by portable batteries, computers or car USB ports. In terms of color, we decided to offer a black version to better complement your table top or car dashboard. You even get to choose a more rounded or squared version.

















The Larger Goal
We do not intend to stop here.
Currently production costs are still higher than we hope. In 2020, we will be designing and building a production facility which features robotic arms in a bid to automate the process of printing and assembling the air purifiers. Our eventual aim is to bring the costs of producing them down to SGD 25 for portable purifiers and SGD 50 for home purifiers. The reduction in manpower would be a crucial step towards producing a high performing air purifier which many more in the world can enjoy. We are also exploring the possibility of localizing production and assembly, which could be possible with the increasing availability of 3D printers and the robotic arm which we are in the process of producing.
Any contribution you make would make clean air possible for many more in the world.","Piecemeal production is already possible, albeit at a slow rate of about 3 portable purifiers or 2 home purifiers a day. This is the reason why delivery dates are set at 6 months after the end of the Kickstart campaign. The larger challenge is to develop an automated production facility by 2020, but we are already working on refining the working prototype for the robotic arm, and think it is feasible to put them into use within 3 months.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout US$ 4\n\n\n\nHelp develop next-generation purifiers\n\n\nHelp us bring down the cost of the next generation of AirPurifiers for Everyone.

Gifting is an important social culture in our everyday lives. We do it to maintain relationships, to feel appreciated and make someone feel appreciated.


Problems of Gifting





 But many-a-time, we don't know what to get for our friends and loved ones and sometimes, we find it difficult to find the time to go gift-shopping. 

Many gifting services online try to solve these problems by categorizing gifts based on group types or provide customization. However, we feel that categorising gifts leaves the gift items highly unpersonalised and customisation services are too expensive. At Shhhcrets, we provide a hybrid solution where we offer personalisation of gift boxes at affordable prices. Our Solution: ShhhBoxes









Choose from 4 different themes and we will personalise the gift items in the box for you.  Read on to see how our service would work!

After a lifetime's worth of artistic pursuits (jazz band, acting in a school musical, Afro-Brazilian drumming, etc) and spending the past few years finding my identity as an artist, everything is finally culminating in my debut 5-track EP that I'm so excited to share with you. Some highlights/milestones from the past couple of years include:
Joining a televised singing competition on Singapore national TV 
Putting up 5 shows at the Esplanade Waterfront and Concourse stages
Amassing a wealth of performance experience with countless corporate events (DBS, SingTel, Rolex, F1, etc)
Receiving the Noise Award after being a mentee in the National Arts Council's Noise Music Mentorship programme 2016 
Transitioning into and embracing vintage style and glamour every day
To those who have been following my journey, it should come as no surprise that I absolutely adore the 40s, 50s, and 60s, and I believe it shows in my songwriting as well as the production of the songs. Taking a Big LeapIn April of this year, I decided to take my music career to the next level and flew out on my own to L.A. to record the Glamour Vintage Songbird EP with Mikal Blue, a producer and songwriter who is best known for his work with Colbie Caillat, Jason Mraz, and OneRepublic. After 10 days in the studio with Mikal Blue and Dean Dinning (bassist of Toad the Wet Sprocket), we've created a collection of classic vintage pop songs that I'm so proud of.


The record is currently in the process of being mastered by Eric Boulanger at The Bakery in L.A., which is a Grammy-winning mastering studio (La La Land OST, Colbie Caillat, Diana Krall).WHY 'GLAMOUR VINTAGE SONGBIRD'?I wanted to bring back what I love about the glorious past and breathe new life into them with updated 21st-Century methods, stories, and modern sensibilities. Expect to hear doo wop backup vocals, punchy horn lines, Motown drum beats and more, but all with a twist. The songs I've written and recorded for this EP are a result of my experiences navigating adulthood as a young woman and they revolve around themes like independence, heartbreak, beauty, and self-esteem. I wanted to write catchy, simple songs that people of all ages can understand and relate to - though some of them are really letters to remind myself of lessons I've learnt along the way.

How did The Haque Collective come about?
We believe in the positive force of a global community to impact individual destiny. The craft of our democratic collective of global artists, all connected by the HCAC family, responds to the richness, diversity and complexity that is Singapore. We produce and present made-with-Singapore, original, contemporary, groundbreaking, provocative, culturally diverse work for the stage and screen. 
What is the point of the collective?
Because of its relative youth, the existing theatrical landscape in Singapore is small and as such cannot yet provide the variance of roles reflective of the extremely broad cosmopolitan population found here. So many wonderful and dedicated performers here unfortunately are not afforded the opportunities they deserve simply because of their background, experience, vague ethnicity or appearance. As such, the collective seeks to provide roles for these people.
While there are some drama groups that cater to this community, there are even fewer still that are able to perform work written in-house by a professional writer. Our playwright, James Thoo, has been a screenwriter by profession in LA for over a decade now, and by virtue of marrying a Singaporean woman, now finds himself here workshopping and developing original material for production. Our director, Kamil Haque, a Singaporean of multi-ethnic heritage, has spent over 30 years in the performing arts producing, directing and acting in several award-winning and critically-acclaimed productions in Singapore, USA, Malaysia and Australia. Both James and Kamil facilitate acting and writing workshops at Haque Centre of Acting & Creativity (HCAC).









For the pilot production; what is the work, and what is the development and rehearsal process?
Our inaugural production is 'The Jugular Vein'.
It is a play about a group of women on a bachelorette night who, over the course of the evening, come to realise that they don't all like each other as much as they thought. Tension builds, tempers begin to flare, and before long the entire situation breaks down into all out anarchy.
The other founding members of our collective, all alumni of HCAC, who will serve as actors in The Jugular Vein, are all women. This is a frequently cited issue as there are a lot of plays or shows produced in Singapore with roles for women but, seldom offer the range of characters or the breadth of definition to allow a performer to do their most interesting work. The Jugular Vein, features four strong female roles and no male roles. They are all wives and one of them is a mother, but this is not the thing that defines them as people.
Kamil, the director, knew that he wanted to produce a play for these four actresses, with James as the playwright. With everyone together for several weeks, we shared our current circumstances and frustrations surrounding our current artistic trajectory. James knew that he wanted to give the opportunity for the four actresses to play the kinds of roles that they were not given access to either due to their ethnicity, their background, or their gender. With that in mind, we escalated our discussion to our hopes and desires on what our debut production  would be. 
James devised the overarching plot and the characters, and then for two months Kamil worked with the four actresses on refining the characters, improvising scenes, developing back-stories and motivations whilst James refined the dialogue and story.
The final draft of the The Jugular Vein was completed on July 1st, and from there, the Collective will rehearse 4 times a week, and then every day until opening night.




Some our HCAC community at our 5th birthday!





The HCAC community

Our community is 6 years old and over 2000 members strong since our inception on June 3rd 2013. Many of our alumni have graced the screens of Hollywood blockbusters, international, regional and national TV series and theatre stages. Many of our community are considered Creative Double-Lifers who straddle a corporate job in the day time and on weekday nights and weekends have aspirations to be performance artists, have a creative outlet, network or perhaps pick up an essential skill from the arts that benefits their professional and personal lives. More information is available at: www.methodactingasia.com

Funding Distribution:
We are raising funds for our debut production, The Jugular Vein, to be staged in a blackbox theatre in Singapore. We've already cobbled together $10,000 of our own money and we need your help to raise the rest. Our desire is to ensure the long term sustainability of The Haque Collective. We seek your help to produce at least one major production every year as producing theatre in Singapore can be a very costly affair. 
We're looking at raising a production fund of just $20,000 to start with. We would distribute the $20,000 in the following ways:











$5000 - Approx. 50% rental cost of theatre space for The Jugular Vein
$2000 - Technical Crew
$2000 - Props/Set Design/Costumes
$2000 - Marketing Efforts
$9000 - Seed funding for The Haque Collective Project 2020","85% of funding for the arts in Singapore comes from the government. Without their support, large swathes of the artistic community in Singapore would struggle to survive. Perhaps we may eventually seek government funding at the appropriate time. 

Our mission of producing made-with-Singapore shows means we want our global citizenry to feel like they are active contributors and patrons of the arts. We are fully prepared to self-fund the work of THC and have our Collective move forward even if it means at a loss for our debut production. Our hope is even if we don't hit our target with our first crowd-funding campaign, the quality of our first show will encourage future patronage","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\nGenerosity is its own reward\n\n\nWant to help us make good theatre but don't expect anything for your generous support?

Having a bidet is great.
Apart from the fact that it is undeniably the best solution to total bum-hygiene, it also saves us a ton on toilet paper consumption... and the number of trees killed for our lifetime supply of it.












Surely toilet paper doesn't protect us either, from COVID-19! 🦠





But there's simply no portable bidets that are good enough.
Automatic bidets are troublesome to charge, and manual bidets simply aren’t portable enough, with their long nozzles and large bottles. The smaller ones are not ergonomic enough for easy squeezing and aiming. Many of them leak if there’s water in them... we just simply couldn't find the right one.




While many of them emphasize on functionality, few actually focus on the entire experience of using it.





Plus, filling a bidet at the public sink gets you weird stares.
There is still an unspoken taboo about using the bidet in many parts of the world, and because of this, using bidets outside of the home might be subject to curious stares which can be uncomfortable to the user. 




""What, you've never seen a bum-cleaning device like this before?""





So, we developed the solution.









A universal plug, bidet-style.
Our Bidoo™ Nozzle fits to most common PET bottles so you can use most available water bottles in your bag without compromising on space.









So for those times you’re really short on space, just pop the Nozzle in your pocket, and you’ll have a bidet with you for those emergency moments! 









Ergonomically designed for the best squeeze.
We spent months researching and testing the best materials, bottle shapes and nozzle lengths... even down to the angle of spray- so that comfort comes out tops during the entire washing experience.

























Seal in your own water source anytime, anywhere.
Say goodbye to filling bidets at the sink in public restrooms while people stare. Every Bidoo™ has its own cap to seal in the water so you can have a water source with you at all times and places.

Although we are still subject to external factors such as sudden manufacturing delays (especially due to the coronavirus), we have factored in enough grace period for us to sort out the problems in order to ship to our backers on time.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 46 or more\n\nAbout US$ 33\n\n\n\n2 x BIDOO\n\n\nYou'll receive 2x Bidoo™ Universal Travel Bidets, complete with water-proof storage bags and packed in eco-friendly packaging.\n\nWill retail for $85 | you get 45% off retail!\n\nWhen the Kickstarter ends we will send you a survey where you can choose your colors.\nIncludes:\n\n\n2×\nBIDOO in the colour of your choice\n\n\n2×\nWaterproof storage bag\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n255 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (45 left of 300)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 88 or more\n\nAbout US$ 63\n\n\n\n4 x BIDOO\n\n\nYou'll receive 4x Bidoo™ Universal Travel Bidets, complete with water-proof storage bags and packed in eco-friendly packaging.\n\nWill retail for $168 | you get 47% off retail!\n\nWhen the Kickstarter ends we will send you a survey where you can choose your colors.\nIncludes:\n\n\n4×\nBIDOO in the colour of your choice\n\n\n4×\nWaterproof storage bag\n\n\n50% off shipping\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (32 left of 50)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 125 or more\n\nAbout US$ 90\n\n\n\n6 x BIDOO\n\n\nYou'll receive 6x Bidoo™ Universal Travel Bidets, complete with water-proof storage bags and packed in eco-friendly packaging.\n\nWill retail for $252 | you get 50% off retail!\n\nWhen the Kickstarter ends we will send you a survey where you can choose your colors.\nIncludes:\n\n\n6×\nBIDOO in the colour of your choice\n\n\n6×\nWaterproof storage bag\n\n\nFree shipping!\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (42 left of 50)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 42 or more\n\nAbout US$ 31\n\n\n\n2 x Early BIDOO\n\n\nYou'll receive 2x Bidoo™ Universal Travel Bidets, complete with water-proof storage bags and packed in eco-friendly packaging.\n\nWill retail for $85 | you get 50% off retail!\n\nWhen the Kickstarter ends we will send you a survey where you can choose your colors.\nIncludes:\n\n\n2×\nBIDOO in the colour of your choice\n\n\n2×\nWaterproof storage bag\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n45 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 80 or more\n\nAbout US$ 58\n\n\n\n4 x Early BIDOO\n\n\nYou'll receive 4x Bidoo™ Universal Travel Bidets, complete with water-proof storage bags and packed in eco-friendly packaging.\n\nWill retail for $168 | you get 52% off retail!\n\nWhen the Kickstarter ends we will send you a survey where you can choose your colors.\nIncludes:\n\n\n4×\nBIDOO in the colour of your choice\n\n\n4×\nWaterproof storage bag\n\n\n50% off shipping\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n20 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 113 or more\n\nAbout US$ 81\n\n\n\n6 x Early BIDOO\n\n\nYou'll receive 6x Bidoo™ Universal Travel Bidets, complete with water-proof storage bags and packed in eco-friendly packaging.\n\nWill retail for $252 | you get 55% off retail!\n\nWhen the Kickstarter ends we will send you a survey where you can choose your colors.\nIncludes:\n\n\n6×\nBIDOO in the colour of your choice\n\n\n6×\nWaterproof storage bag\n\n\nFree shipping!\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n20 backers""}]",20.0,117

About Us

What are Magitags?



Magitags are designed for ease of use and to streamline play. Never lose track of ongoing effects again.





Magitags are colored acrylic tokens, engraved with symbols for your favorite spell effects. They're designed to be highly functional, yet aesthetic complements to any tabletop RPG game, card game, or board game.Design PhilosophyMagitags were conceived, designed, and redesigned after extensive play, with our Kickstarter release being Version 2 of our original. With Magitags, we don't just want to solve a problem. We want to create something that discerning gamers and avid tabletop RPG fans will recognize as a quality of life improvement for game masters and players alike. That's the driving philosophy behind Magitags, and why we emphasized clarity, effectiveness and ease of use in the development process. 
 
 

 


We made tokens that fit on miniatures, not under them.





This philosophy also pushed us to introduce a tapered groove into our design, allowing Magitags to be affixed to most miniatures so they can freely ""float"" above a character, allowing for greater visibility. 

Of course, you can place them under your miniatures too, and they'll fit in any typical 1"" (5-ft) square.  Magitags will also be compatible with our future Kickstarter projects. Features


A set of eight (8) Magitags, with classic fantasy frame and custom iconography for (top row, left to right) Radiant, Necrotic, Acid, Cold and (bottom row, left to right) Electricity, Fire, Poison and Thunder effects, inlaid with gold paint.





Each individual Magitag is: 
Cut from superior, industrial-grade acrylic
Laser etched with classic fantasy frame and custom iconography designed by our in-house artists
Highly wear resistant
1"" x 1"", sized to fit on most map grids and the classic ""5-ft square"" 
Tapered groove allows easy, yet secure affixing to most miniatures
Smooth groove surfaces to help prevent damage to paint jobs 
Ships pre-masked and fully paintable, allowing you to customize the colors of frames and symbols on your Magitags
Compatible with future Kickstarter projects @THEGUILD



Crystallized Mana - A crystal clear alternative you can purchase in sets, or get as a bonus for participating in our Social Media Campaign.




 

PriceMagitags are competitively priced. Should we be funded, packages will include bonuses from Stretch Goals. We also intend to offer bonuses for backers who participate in Magitags related social media campaigns and giveaways. 


Our limited time Super Early Bird and Early Bird offers, for adventurers who seize the Initiative.





 



Our reward tiers are reasonably priced, and will include all Stretch Goals.





Add-OnsMagitags sport a classic fantasy frame and ship pre-masked, allowing you to paint the symbols and frames a color of your choice. We also offer Magitags with frames adorned with magical symbols and steampunk gadgetry at a nominal fee. Simply pledge the additional amount listed here, and indicate what add-ons you want when you complete the backer's survey.

My skin would go through many adventures due to the wildly varying climate—from extremely humid and sweaty hot days to dry sunny weathers. As a beauty enthusiast, my constant chase of different skincare products from many different brands ended when I stumbled upon the 100% pure Argan Oil, also known as the liquid gold and one of the rarest oils in the world. I simply wanted control over my skin and the ability to choose what goes on it and I just fell in love with this liquid gold; It’s light enough to use as an everyday moisturizer and powerful enough to soothe ailments such as dry and red skin.That is how Cleyà was born. My goal was always to highlight Argan Oil as a wonderful skincare product because of its amazing natural properties. Cleyà is derived from the word “Clear”. Feeling clear, hydrated and glowing can go a long way into making you reach your goals and living a successful and happy life; so if you haven’t found your daily care routine, I invite you to join the mindset!I want to share with the world a skincare line developed using 100% pure, sustainable, & ethically sourced Argan oil that is extracted from the Argania Spinosa tree. My product is 100% pure, no additives, or dilutions, good for you and our planet. Nothing is ever tested on animals. What is Cleyà Organics? -Cleyà Organics Liquid Gold is a daily beauty regimen for vibrant, healthy looking skin and hair - extracted from the Argania Spinosa tree that is endemic to Southern Morocco. With its high content of antioxidants, vitamin E, and essential fatty acids, the benefits of 100% Argan Oil naturally help hydrate and revitalize the skin, and consistently restore shine to dull lifeless hair to regain a youthful appearance.Why Cleyà Organics? -Our bottle of argan oil liquid gold is a “World-Changer in a Bottle”, organically grown, then harvested and processed by the Berber Woman of Morocco, who fully understood that the Earth is the way that can solve their financial and social problems. And I am certain when I planned this business, i want to combine environmental protection, local economic development, and also women’s empowerment. Cleyà want to source the materials in a way that can support the Berber’s Woman in economic and social empowerment to their workers, who work to conserve the Argan forest. Most importantly, I want to ensure my consumers to feel special when buying my products because they have contributed to saving the earth while getting the best treatment for their skin.I need your help to make my Cleyà Organics dream come true! -In order to truly advertise Cleyà as organic, and cruelty-free, there are a lot of tests we need to pass and certifications we need to acquire.

I spent almost a months planning and preparing the successful roll out of the brand but due to my country's prohibited and restricted imports, I have the difficulty to import my ingredients from overseas. Because I am sourcing only the best ingredient from its main and original source, Morocco- there is also always a small risk of having shortages and logistics issues, which can delay delivery schedule by a few days or weeks. Also for the quantities required to get me started, this funding will help to minimize the risk. 

I have already source some manufacturers, and designed labels, and currently working on the import issues in Indonesia.

When raindrops start falling, you need to know that you are prepared. You put too much time into your outfits and schedule too many important appointments to walk around soaking wet. You want to stay comfortable, and you want to be ready for whatever may come – including the most severe thunderstorms in the middle of an otherwise-sunny day.
Fortunately, help has arrived. After sending the HAILSTORM umbrella through three different versions, we are proud to present the final version – a superior umbrella sure to alter the umbrella industry forever. 











We understand the inconvenience of opening the umbrella when you have only one hand available. The umbrella automatically unfold itself with a press of a button.











Every step of the way, we have spared no expense in developing HAILSTORM. Unlike other umbrellas, our umbrella inverts upon closing, keeping the wet side closed off – and opening and closing with a single button press. 











The umbrella itself is made up of eight fiberglass ribs and a premium-grade stainless steel shaft, making it lightweight but durable. The ergonomic designed handle eases your pain by providing maximum comfort grip.




Wind Resistant Structure







The 41"" canopy is made of two layers, one extremely water-repellent and the other rated for UPF 50+ in accordance with Australian Standards/New Zealand Standards (AS/NZ) 4399.




Anti-UV and Extremely Water Repellent







Since completing the latest version of our umbrella, we have also tested the fabric, which is rated at extremely low UVA and UVB detectable transmittance – 0.000 across the board, which is accordance with the highest standards for UVA and UVB detection.




UPF Result







This is a product months in the making. Since starting on the first version in January 2019, we have invested significant time and resources into making our umbrella the best umbrella possible, and we are proud to move forward with large-scale production.

The inspiration for this project came from my obsession with the use of scented candles. I noticed many popular brands use paraffin wax. Paraffin wax is a non-natural based wax that may have adverse effects on your health and well-being, and also to the environment. From this concern, I came up with the idea of making a healthier solution for users and mother nature.
 About Kandel

 
Kandel is a sustainable scented candle made of 100% natural ingredients made with love by hand. The brand objective is to spread joy to people and the environment. The brand cares about your body and mind and each scent has a purpose and benefit to help customers relax.









All ingredients are natural and Kandel uses soy wax which is derived from vegetables - which makes it vegan and is cruelty-free. Other types of wax use animal products such as beeswax from hives of beeves. Soy wax also burns longer than other wax by 25 to 50%. It burns cleaner, and does not release harmful toxins into the air. Our products use natural essential oils derived from herbs and plants creating a soothing smell that is beneficial for our body and mind. Natural essential oils are proven to positively affect people's mental health. The wick is lead-free because lead may cause adverse effects on mental and physical development. Each candle is decorated with dry flowers that identifies each scent.
 Objective

 
The objective of the brand running a crowdfunding campaign is to build the prototype and knowing people's opinion about the product. The money will be used to purchase materials and ingredients needed to make the product. Through this action, I would like to know key things to be improved for the business.
 Our Scents' Purpose

 









Frangipani - inner peace and confidence









Jasmine - a natural remedy for stress, anxiety, and fatigue









Lavender - relaxes mind and body









Rose - anti-depressants









Sandalwood - concentration and calmness









Vanilla - increases the happiness level","As I am currently a student, the challenge that I am facing is financial.

I am Dinojar, and this is my 7th Kickstarter Campaign! You can check out my previous Kickstarter, Chibi Pets Series and Chibi Friends Series!
I'm super excited to run this Kickstarter and I hope you will enjoy them as well!
How does Kickstarter work?

   Pledge now Risk-Free and Pay later system! You can always change your pledge anytime during the campaign. You'll only be charged if the funding goal is met.
  All pledges help unlock new designs! Even if the design you want is still locked, you can still pledge to help unlock it!
  Click the 'Back this project' button and choose the tier you want. You can select your add-ons after you have chosen the main rewards.
   Survey form will be sent at the end of the campaign to choose your rewards.




















Total of 13 Designs for you to choose from! You will get the FREE mini pin if you pledge 5 or more pins from THIS CAMPAIGN! :)
All designs are available as pins or stickers. More design coming soon! You can also suggest your design in comment section or message.
Pin Features:

  Gold Plating
  Hard Enamel
  2 Rubber Clutches
  Standard Pins: ~ 1.25 to 1.5 inches (30mm to 40mm) 
  Mini Pin: ~1 inch height (25mm) 
  Mounted to beautifully designed Backing Card

 What are Hard Enamel Pins?
Hard enamel pins (lapel pins/brooch) are decorative art that can be worn or otherwise displayed. They have raised metal lines forming the 'line art' and the recessed sections between the lines are filled with colourful hard enamel. The piece is then polished smoothly so it can be at the same level as the metal lines.




Past Campaign Sample Pins (Chibi Pets 1)













Due to popular demand, you can add past campaigns' pins and stickers as add-ons.
Limited quantity available.




How do we know which design you would like?
At the end of the campaign period, we will send you a survey form for you to indicate the design you would like. You will be able to indicate which pins, stickers or add-ons you desire.










   4th Dec - Kickstarter campaign starts and runs for 15 days.
   19th Dec - Campaign ends. Backer surveys are sent out afterward to your email (to indicate your choice of pins, stickers, and add-ons).
   Early Jan - We receive the fund pledge from Kickstarter. (2 weeks after the campaign ends). Production begins.
   Feb/Mar - Pins and stickers expected to reach me - I will proceed with quality checks and grading.
   Feb-Apr - Pins and stickers will be shipped to backers.










I really thank all of you for making this dream come through! This project could never become a reality without your support! And I would be honored if you share the project with your family and friends!
~ Love, Dinojar | Instagram


If you have any question, feel free to ask me!
I will add any questions and their answers to the FAQ section as they are asked. If your question isn't on the list or you need further clarification on something, feel free to comment or message me!","REWARDS
The final pins may vary slightly from the designs shown here. Every single pin is handmade, there is expected to be minor defects or flaws. Standard grade pins will be used to fulfill pledges and these pins may have minor defects that are only visible under extremely close inspection. Pins with more noticeable flaws are lower grade and will NOT be used to fulfill pledges. The actual color or size of the pins may differ a little from the descriptions, but I'm confident that any differences will be minimal. I am working closely with an established manufacturer, to ensure smooth fulfillment of all the orders.

TIMELINE
Delays in shipping and production of pins may occur when creating enamel pins. This may happen because of production errors and manufacturing defects. If there are any delays, all backers will be immediately updated!

FULFILLMENT
I will update here on Kickstarter and Instagram so that backers have an idea when their rewards will be shipped out. Please double check your address in the reward selection confirmation email to reduce the chance of a package being lost! Once a package is mailed, it is out of my control but I will do my best to assist and accommodate for any lost packages for TRACKED shipment. We always encourage you to upgrade by adding TRACKING service to the shipping with a small fee for peace of mind.

ADDITIONAL FEES
Backers outside of the SG are responsible for any and all customs fees, import taxes, VAT, GST, or other additional costs associated with importing goods into their country, and those costs are NOT included in their pledge or shipping cost.

REFUNDS & CANCELLATIONS
Once the campaign is complete, refunds or cancellations will not be issued for any reason.

Yamada Yuuki is an ordinary Japanese college student with an extraordinary hobby: the classical martial art of Kukishin-ryu. One evening, a demon rips through the fabric of space-time, abducts everyone in his dojo, and transports them to another world. To return home, Yamada and his friends must join forces with other abductees to conquer the dungeon that runs through the heart of the world. 
Standing in their way are endless hordes of bloodthirsty monsters, treacherous traps, invisible clouds of poison gas, and unfathomable horrors lurking in the lightless depths. Armed only with steel, faith and sheer guts, they must battle their way through the winding catacombs and confront the demon waiting at the bottom floor. 
Yamada was once a student. Now he must become a samurai.
Dungeon Samurai is a trilogy of military fantasy novels running to about 65,000 words per book. It is the story of a harrowing campaign into the unlighted depths of a monster-filled dungeon. No pity, no mercy, no room for error. 
If you ever wondered what old-school Dungeons & Dragons would look like if it were run like a military campaign, Dungeon Samurai is for you.
In the words of Matthew P. Schmidt, author of The City and the Dungeon:
""Like if Tom Clancy had written an isekai, this action-packed trilogy will blow your mind with its loving dedication to martial arts detail and grim, heroic violence. Faith, courage, and honor are weapons as well in this magnificently crafted world of dungeons and demons. Banzai!""

--
The world was an illusion. The sweat-stained gi plastered to his back, the armor weighing on his bones, the hot air trapped within his full-face helmet, the fatigue sinking into his muscles, they were all meaningless. There was only him, his sword, and his opponent.
Yamada Yuuki raised his weapon.
“HAJIME!”
The other man began circling to Yamada’s right. Yamada followed, slowly sneaking his feet forward, closing the distance between them. His opponent did the same. Yamada bided his time, stepping closer, closer, closer, seeking the proper ma-ai, the perfect combination of space and timing, to strike.
Now.
“EEEEEEEEEEEE!” Yamada yelled, stepping in with a powerful slash.
The other man shifted just so, and Yamada’s sword whooshed through empty air.
Yamada swung again.
“EEEEEEEEEEEEEE!” 
His opponent vanished.
“EI!”
A heavy blunt force thudded into his breastplate. 
Yamada stumbled away. His opponent had slipped out of his field of view and delivered the blow. Already the man had cleared the ma-ai, sword ready for the next exchange.
“Good hit,” Yamada admitted.
This was randori. Free play, not combat. His sword was a shinai made of flexible bamboo, not a katana built of live steel. Hiroshi Matsuo was his best friend, his childhood friend, not an enemy. 
Still, getting hit sucked.
But Hiroshi was just a tad too close.
“Let’s go,” Hiroshi said.
Yamada charged in, swinging at Hiroshi’s neck. Hiroshi parried. Yamada arced the shinai around, going for the other side of his neck. Hiroshi blocked.
“HO!” Yamada yelled, bringing his shinai down.
Hiroshi yielded, swinging his sword through a tight circle. Yamada’s arms dropped through empty space—and Hiroshi’s sword rapped his exposed wrists. 
“Daijoubu?” Hiroshi asked. Are you alright?
“Hai,” Yamada replied. Yes.
Hiroshi had supreme control. He had struck Yamada with just enough force to make him feel the blow without bruising anything more than his pride.
Again and again, the men clashed. Again and again, Hiroshi’s blade struck true, while Yamada’s found only air. Hiroshi had been studying the koryu longer than Yamada, and it showed. 
Still, Yamada had to land a blow. No matter what. This was his first randori. He had to show Sensei he had learned something.
Yamada readied his shinai. Hiroshi did the same. Warily, the men approached each other. Yamada breathed in. Out. In.
Stepped and cut—
Bamboo slapped against Yamada’s forearms. 
They reset. Advanced again. Yamada stepped in, closer, closer, his sword probing at Hiroshi’s, shielding his relentless advance while responding to Hiroshi’s maneuvers. The shinai circled and thrust and bounced off each other, testing strength, finding weakness, seeking a moment of opportunity.
Hiroshi’s sword batted down Yamada’s. Yamada flowed with the energy, circling his shinai back up and bringing it crashing down—
Hiroshi stepped aside and cut his arm.
Yamada stepped aside. He hated being hit so many times. But this time, he saw Hiroshi move. He was learning. Next time, he could land a hit. Yamada raised his shinai and—
Hiroshi stepped in and thrust at his throat.
They reset.
Yamada was doing something wrong. Hiroshi was a defensive fighter. He had the timing and the reflexes for it. Yamada did not. He had to do something else. He had to use his brain, to use what Sensei called heiho. Strategy.
What was it Sensei had said last week? There is an opening in every stance, and by skillfully positioning your weapon you could lure the enemy into a trap. But it wasn’t enough to simply pretend to lower your guard. You had to convince the enemy it wasn’t a trap. Selling the technique required a proper set-up.
They closed again, each feeling the other out. Yamada launched a barrage of slashes at Hiroshi’s neck, keeping him on the defensive, giving him no time to respond. One last cut and Yamada abruptly dropped his sword, as though fatigued, just enough to expose his head.
“EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!” Yamada yelled, rearing up and pulling his sword low.
Hiroshi slashed at Yamada’s head.
“EEEEEEEEE!”
Yamada exploded into a rising cut, his shinai colliding with Hiroshi’s left arm. The arm went slack, but the sword continued to arc towards Yamada’s head.
“EEEEEEEEE!”
Yamada twirled the shinai around, cutting Hiroshi’s weapon arm and bashing it aside. Hiroshi staggered back, and Yamada closed.
“EEEEEEE!”
The shinai struck Hiroshi’s helmet.
Elation flowed through Yamada. He’d finally did it.
“Good one,” Hiroshi said. 
Yamada smiled. “Thanks.”
Three loud claps reverberated in the dojo.
“MATTE!”
Randori was over. 
Yamada unfastened and removed his helmet. The night air was cool against his face. He was soaked in sweat, his muscles burned, but he felt good. He felt right. Sure, he’d taken a beating and then some, at the hands of Hiroshi and at the other senior students, but he’d survived. He’d even managed to land a few hits. That counted for something.
The students gathered around Sensei. Sensei Sasaki Makoto was a slight, short man, coming up only to Yamada’s mouth. Sensei’s short hair had run to white, dark spots speckled across his skin, and his lined face seemed cast in weathered stone. But under his loose gi were muscles hard as iron and nerves trained to perfection, and when he stood his posture was perfectly balanced, ready to spring into action. Everywhere he went he radiated intensity of focus, and woe betide anyone who dared cross him.
“Everyone, well done,” Sensei said, his voice deceptively gentle. “What have we learned today?”
Sensei always ended classes with a brief recap of the day’s lessons, beginning with principles and techniques, concluding with general observations and mistakes.
As he wrapped up, he turned his gaze on Yamada.
“Aggression is, of course, necessary in combat. However, it must also be tempered with wisdom, with timing, with heiho. Blind courage merely leads to your death.”
Yamada nodded. He had to remember that.
His closing remarks finished, Sensei closed the class with meditation. Yamada knelt on the hard wooden floor, ignoring the pain in his joints and muscles, straightening his back and resting his butt on his heels. This was seiza, the traditional way of sitting. 
Yamada closed his eyes. Breathed in. Breathed out. Let the world fall away. Let every thought disappear. Let everything he had learned today sink into his body, his mind, his heart.
“You have been chosen.”
His eyes flew open.
Where had the voice come from?
Looking around, Yamada saw that a few others had broken meditative discipline. Including Hiroshi. 
And Sensei.
Sensei scanned the room. Returned to seiza. And closed his eyes.
Hiroshi followed. So did Yamada.
Yamada breathed. Maybe that was nothing. Or perhaps some idiot was playing a prank. If so, Sensei would ensure it would never happen again. It wasn’t his problem. He just had to focus. To breathe.
Two claps brought him back to reality.
The students bowed.
“Thank you for teaching us!” they recited.
Sensei bowed back. “Thank you for teaching me.”
A deep, gleeful, alien voice filled the room.
“And thank you for being my food.”
“Eh?” Yamada said.
Strange, intricate designs covered the floor, the ceiling, the walls and windows, filling the dojo with crimson light. Chains of interlocking circles, of circles within circles, branching off into spirals and horns and semisolid cubes composed of tiny interlocking pyramids whose sides melted and flowed into each other. Impossible shapes danced at the edges of Yamada’s sight, his brain almost but not quite recognizing the forms. Harsh voices whispered and cackled and gibbered, speaking in nonsense tongues that clawed at Yamada’s ears.
“Masaka!” someone exclaimed. Impossible!
Yamada covered his ears and gnashed his teeth. He snapped his head from side to side, and everywhere he looked he saw more circles, more alien geometries, more things that should not be. Men screamed and stumbled and lashed out at the things, Sensei himself was wobbling about, barely able to stand.
This was impossible. But he had to act or perish.
Men sprang to their feet, seizing weapons and scanning the room, barking observations and orders. Yamada clawed at a complex arrangement of triangles and lines with his fingers, but all he felt was solid wood.
“Everybody run!” Hiroshi shouted.
But there was nowhere to run. The windows were gone, the door engulfed in the disorienting designs.
“Find an exit!” Sensei ordered.
A student ran his hands along the wall, feeling for the doorknob, but found nothing. He slammed his palms against the walls to no avail. Other men pounded at the places where the windows used to be, but they were all gone, replaced by walls crawling with monstrous shapes.
The darkness grew deeper, the scarlet light brighter, the voices louder. Thunder boomed in Yamada’s ears. Cursing, Yamada dropped to his knees. A sudden chill shot through his bones, so cold he gasped in pain. He clawed at the closest design on the floor, a string of miniature globes that seemed both two-dimensional and three-dimensional at once, and electricity ripped through his fingers, his palms, his arms, his chest, blazing up into his brain. 
An atomic bomb exploded in his skull.
Then, darkness.
--
Of course, this is only the beginning. Blood and death, fire and steel, sorrow and courage, they are all waiting in the deeps.

Stretch Goal 2: Integrated Leather Strap for S65 Sport Watch





Stretch goals are now published! So, we’ve heard your suggestions and are launching two tiers of stretch goals. Read on below or simply check out the updates page for a full breakdown!







 




""Bespoke was once an option only offered by high-end brands ... What is unique about Schaffen is that it includes the possibility of personalizing the rotor."" - MONOCHROME





  




Designing Your Unique Timepiece (Overview)





 We're proud to introduce the Reference 65 Collection - the A65 Dress Watch & S65 Sport Watch - timepieces that capture your stories and express your unique individualities.Each Reference 65 timepiece is truly one-of-a-kind, because you are going to be co-creating the watch with us.At Schaffen, we aspire to take watch customisation to new heights. We like to ask - if every watch told a story, what would yours say?   









 







 


    







 







In self-winding automatic watches, most rotors come pre-built in the watch. In pushing the boundaries of custom-made watches, we decided to challenge this assumption and delve into the movement of the watch.The rotor, or oscillating weight, winds each movement and provides space for designing freedom, capturing stories and allowing for an even further expression of creativity!







 


After the campaign, send us your designs to create mockup previews





 










 


Sample of 3D-Printed Rotors (Actual Photo)





  









If you don't have a design in mind yet, that's alright! After the campaign, we will discuss with every backer and recommend personalised ideas and motifs which would make great designs on your rotor.







 


 







 


Dial Personalisation





To begin the creation of your Reference 65 timepiece, go bold by designing your own hour markers and/or choose to have your signature or motif on the dial.We can also recommend designs such as classic roman or arabic numerals. Shown above is a series of Burmese numerals commissioned and designed by a client.Alternatively, keep the dial simple for a clean look!







 







The devil is in the details, and we're proud to offer customisation to an unprecedented level of detail:Choose a black or white date window, or go without one for a purist look.
Select blue or silver watch hands, or go with a mixture, such as silver hour/minute hands & blue seconds hands.We have different customisation options available for each collection. Read on below to find out more!After the campaign, each backer will receive an exclusive invite to an online dashboard, where these components may be selected.




A65 Dress Watch & S65 Sport Watch





 







Inspired by dual-toned dials popular in the 50s & 60s, the dial of the A65 Dress Watch is vertically brushed in the centre, with a matte outer ring containing the appliqués.Both the appliqués and watch hands are faceted to catch light at different angles when rotating the watch. For additional contrast, the case-side has a brushed finish
 while the bezel is polished, finally completing it with sapphire crystals to the top and the case-back.




A65 Dress Watch with Silver, Blue & Grey Dials





 







 







 







 







 


 







A Genta-inspired design, the S65 Sport Watch bears an integrated bracelet while keeping the case at a versatile 39.5mm.Made of 316L stainless steel, the case comprises two bezels: a circular-brushed round bezel sitting atop a polished, rounded-hexagon sub-bezel. The dial is finished with a horizontally-ridged texture, a novel design which creates a unique stylistic element.




S65 Sport Watch with White, Blue & Grey Dials





 







 







 







 







 


 







We believe that designing your rotor is only meaningful when built on a reliable and recognised movement, making each watch worth keeping and sharing.We are proud to collaborate with Sellita Watch SA in using their ""Swiss-Made"" SW200-1 movements, a trustworthy caliber with 26 jewels. Our choice of movements are further regulated in Élaboré grade and completed with heated blue screws.









You are going to treasure and share your custom-made Reference 65 timepiece, and we want to give you our assurance.Each Reference 65 timepiece will come in a wooden box, with black PVC leather cushioning the watch. The box comes complete with a personalised warranty card & certificate of authenticity.Working with top-class manufacturers such as Sellita Watch SA, we are confident in the quality of our watches, providing a 2 year warranty on all our watches.







To realise the dream of truly customisable timepieces, we amassed resources and expertise from all over the world. The reliable and robust movement is made in Switzerland, while the rotors are individually 3D-printed by cutting-edge manufacturers in Leuven, Belgium.The rotors are then hand-polished and finished by jewellers in Singapore, before assembly by our watchmakers. We personally check through every single timepiece to ensure that each watch is a beautifully-crafted, well-made piece.







 







 







 





 







Hi, I'm Nicholas (right) and to share with you more about ourselves, I started this company with my brother, Jonathan, 2 years ago. I remember it was on 14 October 2015 that we started making watches.Working with jewellers and watchmakers we have known for years, the goal was simple: to create an exclusive collection for the family. The very first watch we made, we dedicated it to our father on his 50th birthday. And to make it a one-of-a-kind, we printed his signature on the dial, much to his delight!Word spread and before we knew it, the Republic of Singapore Air Force commissioned us to make a custom timepiece for a retiring colonel. This time, we had the colonel's name and years of service on the dial to make it a truly meaningful retirement gift.Since then, we have gone on to make hundreds of personalised timepieces, creating countless special moments for others... And it is because of these exact moments in our journey that led us to where we are now - the Reference 65 collection.The number 65 pays homage to the year of independence of our home country Singapore, and is also the birth year of our parents. It is therefore our dream to create valuable and meaningful keepsakes for every individual through this new collection.Our name Schaffen (ˈʃafṇ) means ""to create"", and this has represented our passion from day one. In this collection, we would love to work with you to co-create a timepiece that is truly the only one in the world...

Check out our review by Watch It All About","Finding proper, good quality suppliers was a challenge that we had to overcome. We searched and experimented with over 20 suppliers before we finally found the ones which proved to be excellent.

Another challenge is that every watch will require certain lead time as watch production, individual rotor manufacturing and watch assembly take place sequentially. We have taken this into account in our lead time and fulfilment projections.

Over the past 2 years, in a previous watch collection, we have made over 300 watches and worked closely with our manufacturers and suppliers.

SYNOPSIS
Destiny (Story and Art by Kang Jing, Colours by Pavith C, Edited by CT Lim)
In his past life, Chung Wai Man was Constable Chung, the renowned constable of the imperial court in the Song Dynasty. A thousand years later, reincarnated as Chung Sir, Inspector of CID (Criminal Investigation Department), Chung Wai Man began having constant flashes and memories of his past life. Little did he know that his fate today, was determined by his actions in a previous lifetime. ‘Destiny’ is about a story where the present collides with the past.


The UnXplainables (Story and Art by Alan Bay, Edited by CT Lim)
In a safe little island, a mysterious case brought Inspector Dave and Jill to Aunt Lilian, a psychic medium who can connect them to the 'Netherzone'. What lies within it and how will the duo be entangled with the in-betweens and the unexplained?

This is my first time on Kickstarter. It has been quite the journey from an idea to a market-ready product in less than a year. Today, I want to share my story with you, as to why; after working for over 20 years at Fortune 500 companies, a couple start-ups, being an engineer, and a recent graduate from a top-tier b-school (http://www.linkedin.com/in/grohit); I have decided to pursue a path of developing open-source based products for homes and small offices.
Working at large enterprises, I have experienced many technology solutions. However, I do not see most of these solutions in our homes or small offices. For example, at home, we use cordless phones and answering machines where as large businesses use soft-phones and voicemail. The reasons span factors of cost, complexity of skills, manageability, etc. This has motivated me to find lean ways to create high-end solutions at a cost-efficient price point. The journey with Crux LX has been full of challenges but we hope to find your support, which will make the journey worthwhile. We would love for you to support us, try this product, benefit from it, and share your feedback.

Stories shape who we are. It's time for different stories because our children deserve them! We at TiffinTown Books want to be a part of that change. By combining the diverse stories of women with AR technology, we want to build communities of future leaders.







The truth is, growing up, we couldn’t find many stories of women of colour. When we did, the journeys the women went on often sounded the same. There was one voice. One pathway to success. But what about the others?








 









We’re working with Amplified Robot, an established AR company, to bring our stories to life! A variety of features will be incorporated into our books, accessible through the TiffinTown Books app. 3-D rendering, for instance, will allow readers to enjoy lively visuals and entertaining scenes. 









Through our technology, readers will have a chance to travel through the forests of China and hear the animals Ruth Harkness encountered, and immerse themselves in the ocean to learn about marine life with Eugenie Clark. Our books will take children back in time to explore these women’s thrilling journeys.
To get more ideas on what the AR experience will look like, check out some of the great work Amplified Robot has done on their website.









Each of the women we write about falls under these seven categories: 
Every year, we release one book a month from one of the categories. Children will be able to see that women have always and will continue to shine in every avenue of life!








The first four books tell the stories of Josephine Baker, an internationally famous African-American dancer who fought successfully for desegregating theaters; Ruth Harkness, fashion-designer turned explorer who sparked public interest in panda conservation by bringing the first panda to America; and Eugenie Clark, a leading ichthyologist who explored the mysteries of the sea and championed marine conservation; and last but not least, our mystery woman! 









Hint: she was a hugely influential chef who transformed home cooking in America!








Our first book, the Story of Josephine Baker, is ready - written and fully illustrated. 
Here's just a few of the pages: 







 







 







 








You can read the first 10 pages here!
Now, we just need your help to get it printed! We're also working on the other three books and planning on what's to come in the following year!








 









Our books are suitable for anyone above the age of nine, who loves illustrated books about real, inspiring women and children from around the world!  








Tiffiners Magazine, our quarterly e-magazine, complements our books by providing a rich array of innovative and interactive content on relevant cultural, social, historical, and scientific issues. Our magazine makes learning about the world fun! Those interested in Eugenie Clark, for instance, can treat themselves to our section on sharks, while readers moved by Josephine Baker will be able to follow her moves as she dances across the screen. 








The magazines will also introduce our readers to children driving amazing change today. Age should be no limit to achieving great things. We want to work with these young leaders and showcase their stories to inspire other children and share their efforts with the world.








 








Here's a little look at the artworks of the artist who'll be drawing your personalized portraits! 








 









 









 








 








 








We’re Sneha and Gladys. We met while working at World Wildlife Fund’s Earth Hour Global Team in 2016! 








Sneha has always been passionate about making positive change and working at a nonprofit organization reinforced her desire to give back to society. She also loves books, particularly those that feature female protagonists and boarding schools! For her, TiffinTown Books was the perfect opportunity to work on her two favorite things: empowering girls and giving back to communities.
From ghost-writing to scriptwriting, Gladys always dreamed of becoming a full-fledged author, so when Sneha suggested starting a company that would not only leave the world a better place but allows her to live amongst books, she said yes immediately!
We would like to thank everyone who’s helped us in building TiffinTown Books from an idea in our head into this Kickstarter project that you see today! Special thanks to:
- Jules, our go-to for everything 
- Chelsy, our first book illustrator 
- Marie, our very own in-house designer of everything 
- Veronica, our social media post-creator 
- Natalie, our branding aficionado 
- Ernie, our illustrated video creator, director, and producer","With the first book complete, we’ve already begun work on the other three books. Printing and shipping have all been arranged. We just need the funding to get our books to you.

We are working with 12 artists for our books, and more will be involved for the production of our magazines. The biggest challenge for us: Time. But good things come to those who wait! We want to give our artists the most amount of time they need to truly showcase their best pieces for your children to enjoy, even if it does mean that the books will take a little longer to get to you.

We love the AR technology for our books, and we can't wait to show you.But tech is tech, so app glitches in the first version may occur. But don't worry! We've got a dedicated team on board who’ll resolve these issues as soon as they occur, so our children readers can enjoy a seamless and enjoyable reading experience.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 7 or more\n\nAbout $6\n\n\n\nBookmark\n\n\nPledge and receive a TiffinTown bookmark for your daily reading!\nIncludes:\n\n\nBookmark\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 21 or more\n\nAbout $16\n\n\n\nSpecial Digital Activity Book!\n\n\nChip in just a little more and you can receive our beautifully designed digital activity book!\n\nThe activity book will be shared with you via email before the 1st of December!\n\nIf you order\nIncludes:\n\n\nDigital Activity Book\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 34 or more\n\nAbout $25\n\n\n\nOne Book\n\n\nReceive your first TiffinTown Book and a free digital activity book.\nIncludes:\n\n\nThe Story of Josephine Baker\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nApr 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 66 or more\n\nAbout $48\n\n\n\nTwo for me please!\n\n\nReceive \""The Story of Josephine Baker\"" and choose another story of your choice!\nIncludes:\n\n\nThe Story of Josephine Baker\n\n\nYour Pick: Ruth Harkness, our special surprise, or Eugenie Clark\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 124 or more\n\nAbout $89\n\n\n\nFour Books Only!\n\n\nReceive all four books in our first series!\nIncludes:\n\n\nThe Story of Josephine Baker\n\n\nThe Story of \""The Secret Chef\""\n\n\nThe Story of Ruth Harkness\n\n\nThe Story of Eugenie Clark\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 132 or more\n\nAbout $95\n\n\n\nAll Four Book Set\n\n\nReceive all four books in our first series. the activity book, and a beautiful book collector's box.\nIncludes:\n\n\nThe Story of Josephine Baker\n\n\nThe Story of \""The Secret Chef\""\n\n\nThe Story of Ruth Harkness\n\n\nThe Story of Eugenie Clark\n\n\nCollector's Box\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 157 or more\n\nAbout $113\n\n\n\nAll Four & eMagazine set\n\n\nAll the above AND the first Tiffiners E-Magazine\nIncludes:\n\n\nThe Story of Josephine Baker\n\n\nThe Story of \""The Secret Chef\""\n\n\nThe Story of Ruth Harkness\n\n\nThe Story of Eugenie Clark\n\n\nCollector's Box\n\n\nThe First Issue of Tiffiners eMagazine!\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 197 or more\n\nAbout $141\n\n\n\nExclusive Behind-the-Scenes Access\n\n\nRead our manuscripts before everyone else and participate in the writing process for 12 books (starting with Eugenie Clark)!

在新加坡最异乎寻常的主题公园内，两位中国籍的年轻匠人是否能够实现新加坡老师傅寄予的厚望？","The Last Artisan has received seed funding from National Heritage Board (NHB)  and Ngee Ann Polytechnic, which carries with it a requirement to complete the film in 2018. This deadline creates a sense of urgency to get the film completed so that the project is not prolonged indefinitely.

With the film already shot, our team is now at the post-production stage. The amount of animation and archival footage in the film is largely dependent on donor support - more funds will allow for more animation and costly archival content. Regardless, this film WILL BE COMPLETED and will play at festivals and through other outlets to reach an international audience.

How will the Kickstarter money be spent?

Our designer independently selects the most fresh and beautiful fruits and vegetables in the markets of Singapore to create edible masterpieces.







Every dollar collected from the sale of our products will go to the development of the project: modification of the website, contract with a delivery service, production of packaging materials with corporate symbolic, etc. Our dream is to open a physical boutique, so you could watch over us during the working process ;)Please feel free to contact us:

Hi! My name is Vieri, a freelancer animator artist! and a director of Miraculous Works - game and animation production.
It is my dream to produce my own animation and share it to the world, but i can’t afford the production costs, but with your help it will be possible!









How Kickstarter works? 
If you pledge for this project, you won’t be charged at the moment. Kickstarter only charge when the campaign reach the goal.









The protagonist of the story is Emii, a shy and insecure girl. Emii has always struggled to find a stable job and sincere friends. Her dream is to have a family and finally be able to stop being afraid.









Emii is a girl very close to the family, her sister and her grandparents.
Unfortunately, the health of the two elderly people is not very good, her grandma begins to suffer from senile dementia, forgetting the name of her grandchildren. And her grandpa starts to have severe back pain and suddenly dies during an intense heatwave.









Emii spends the next few days at home, depressed, and with no desire to do anything. To ease the pain, the girl starts eating chocolate she bought from a market.
Emii is anxious because the chocolate bar is the only thing that allows her to get a vision and to have serenity. The girl feels that her life is improving and does not want to go back to being the girl of the past.









We’re packing all rewards with as much content as we can gather, and the contents will almost certainly expand as we go through production. However, at a minimum, you’ll get:

International shipping is a huge task, but we will ensure to provide fast and tracked shipments.


the pledge manager will be live
a few weeks after the campaign ends to submit your address and any additional details.
Therefore we can estimate the cost of shipment, and finding the best shipping partner.


Additional items may increase shipping costs.
Shipping cost includes tracked courier shipping in a highquality package.","Creating Anime is a really huge task, and requires lots of peoples and divisions involved. But this is not my first time working on an anime project, I’ve also been in anime studio as an Animator, Compositor, and Designer. And i’ve been working on hundreds of commissioned animation and illustrations online.

The biggest challenge would be the shipping and producing the physical item.
And please keep in mind that shipping rate and times vary from country to country. There may be possible delays in delivery due to the current pandemic situation.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 40 or more\n\nAbout $29\n\n\n\nDigital Version\n\n\nDigital Version of Movie and OST\nIncludes:\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Movie\n\n\nDigital Downloadable OST\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nSep 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 90 or more\n\nAbout $65\n\n\n\nDigital Complete 🌟\n\n\nComplete Digital Version of Movie, OST, Artbook, Gallery (Wallpapers)\nIncludes:\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Movie\n\n\nDigital Downloadable OST\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Artbook\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Galleries\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nSep 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 140 or more\n\nAbout $101\n\n\n\nDisc Version\n\n\nPhysical version of the Movie and OST\nIncludes:\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Movie\n\n\nDigital Downloadable OST\n\n\nPhysical Blu-ray Movie\n\n\nPhysical Disc OST\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nSep 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 200 or more\n\nAbout $143\n\n\n\nDisc Complete 🌟\n\n\nComplete version of Physical version + Printed poster and Digital Artbook\nIncludes:\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Movie\n\n\nDigital Downloadable OST\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Artbook\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Galleries\n\n\nPhysical Blu-ray Movie\n\n\nPhysical Disc OST\n\n\nPhysical Printed Poster\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nSep 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 335 or more\n\nAbout $240\n\n\n\nCollectors Edition 🌟\n\n\nAll Previous Rewards + Physical Artbook and Animation Genga (Animation Keyframes)\nIncludes:\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Movie\n\n\nDigital Downloadable OST\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Artbook\n\n\nDigital Downloadable Galleries\n\n\nPhysical Blu-ray Movie\n\n\nPhysical Disc OST\n\n\nPhysical Printed Poster\n\n\nPhysical Artbook\n\n\nPhysical Printed Animation Genga\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nSep 2022\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""}]",0.0,2

Hello!! 

           My name is Zhi xin or you can call me Zee. 
I am the creator/artist behind Potaytoeee on instagram! I animate in the day and be a couch potato creator at night. Welcome to my Kickstarter campaign and read on! :)

 
This is my second Kickstarter project and this time round, I’ll be bringing something different as compared to the previous project!

           This will be my very first potato plushie project and I hope you'll love this as much as I do! 
My first pins kickstarter project was a huge success with over 250 backers thanks to the lovely support from all the potato lovers!! I'm stoked to be able to create another big potato project and share it with you all!

 

           Owning plushies is a huuuuge part in my life growing up and never would I ever imagined making my very own plush!! 

           I’m really excited for you guys to cuddle with this little potato when this project comes true!!

 

           Let’s get started!!



























It all started with a random idea of my potato wanting to be a fearsome shark…

 











     It slowly evolved to wanting to be a toast, something closer to the carbs family just like him. 











             Then I thought why not make a French fries head, just like how I started drawing my potato! A potato with a French fries on his head! 











THE SPECS:
The plush is approximately 20 x 15cm in size 

             Comes with interchangeable head gears:

             1 x Baby shark fin (no sharks were harmed)

             1 x Toast 

             1 x French fries
DISCLAIMER:

  The shape of the plush maybe misshaped when you receive them, don’t panic! Just squish it a little :)
  Colors may vary between the actual product and what you see on your screen due to monitor differences and lighting
  As the plushies and pouches are all handmade with lots of effort and love, each of them may have small flaws like, loose threads, wrinkled fabrics or unevenness. 

           Please understand that they will not be 100% same to images shown :)



 Besides our plushie, we have the little potato pouch available as part of the project as well!!









This cute little pouch is approximately 12cm x 12cm

             Perfect for for coins / cards / tissue packs / keys / etc that you can fit in!

             (does not fit a phone)

Risks and challenges

  This is my first Plushie project, a lot of time and research has gone into the process of preparation and finding a reliable manufacturer to make sure you get the best quality products.
   PLUSH QUALITY: The manufacturer I have chosen has a lot of experience in plush making and is professional in making them.
  Do note that minor defects like loose strings or slight irregular shapes are normal as these are all handmade!

In any case if some plushies come with huge flaws, they will be put for sale as B grades on my shop after the Kickstarter ends. If most plushies have a large defects in an unfortunate event, they will be remade, which will lead to the increase of production time and the timeline will be pushed back. Be rest assured that the plushies will be quality checked before mailing them.

  Colors may defer due to screen color differences

Cost Distribution:
10% Fees and Tax
60% Production
40% Shipping & Packaging

 Kickstarter uses a pledge now - pay later all or nothing system. You will not be charged anything unless the campaign is successfully funded on 3rd october 2021.


Pledges are tied to pin quantities (1,2 or 3 pins) and not to pin designs so please pledge freely.  Surveys will be sent out to you once the campaign ends on 3rd October so that you can choose your pins and other goodies.


You can cancel/edit your pledge any time before the campaign ends but of course I would love if you keep your pledge. Every time I see someone pledge, it makes a small business owner very happy and is very encouraging.


If you have any questions, send me a message rather than post it as a comment as I will be paying closer attention to my messages.









 Choose from just 1, 2 or a whole set of 3 pins from the rewards tiers on the right.









































Items that will be included in every reward package.
1 Dragon Holographic Sticker
1 Dragon Card
Stickers are waterproof and best peelable only twice.


For both the sticker and the card it will be a random dragon but I will try to match it to your pin choice. They are feature 3 more dragons not from the pins so you may get a surprise dragon!

 Thank you for your support, it means a lot to a small business owner like myself. Your pledges motivate me to do more and create more things. I hope you will enjoy your goodies. Please tag me @theconfettihands as I love would love to see these fantastical beasts aka dragons in their new homes. Let's turn this mystical, magical campaign into a reality!","During this ongoing pandemic, I will be disinfecting each item individually once I receive them. To ensure your safety and health, we encourage recipients to disinfect packages prior to and even after opening the package as a form of normal practice.

Based on our experience during COVID-19, they will take an estimate of 2 months from the date of mailing out for pledgers outside of Singapore.

I will post updates on the progress of the campaign and production if successful. Do drop me an email at theconfettihands@gmail.com if you have any questions.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 10 or more\n\nAbout $8\n\n\n\n1 Enamel Pin\n\n\nYour choice of any 1 unlocked enamel pin\n\nAdd-ons available (filler pins, sticker sheet, sticker pack)\nIncludes:\n\n\nEnamel Pin\n\n\nFreebie Random Dragon Holographic Sticker\n\n\nRandom Dragon Card\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 18 or more\n\nAbout $13\n\n\n\n2 Enamel Pins\n\n\nYour choice of any 2 unlocked enamel pins\n\nAdd-ons available (filler pins, sticker sheet, sticker pack)\nIncludes:\n\n\n2×\nEnamel Pin\n\n\nFreebie Random Dragon Holographic Sticker\n\n\nRandom Dragon Card\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 27 or more\n\nAbout $20\n\n\n\n3 Enamel Pins\n\n\nAll 3 enamel pins.

The game hopes to feature roughly 40 handcrafted levels which aims to showcase challenging yet fun gameplay experiences!* All Levels are individually handcrafted to give the best experience to the player.* Game is ergonomically easy to play, suitable for people to play while commuting to work/school. * A new twist towards the familiar memory genre games.GAMEPLAYPlayers would be given a blueprint of the current level they are on first. Once the player has memorised the pattern or the timer runs out, the player will be transported to the planning phase.Within the planning phase, players must regurgitate whatever they have just memorised and key in the steps in the correct order in an attempt to reach the end. The game will feature special tiles that requires the player to think more before placing down their steps. For example buttons that activate a falling spike on the adjacent tile, this requires players to move back and forth in order to avoid the danger. More of which will be within the game for the player to learn and explore. :DTHE FUNDSBasically all the funds will be used for the Apple Developer Account. It costs around SGD$ 128 after conversion. The stated price of $140 includes the commission and misc costs. I intend to to release the game for *Free* in the app store, my goal remains the same, I wish for everyone to be able to enjoy this game. The $140 would be very beneficial in assisting me to offset some of my financial burden. WHY SHOULD YOU FUND ME?It is because you guys out there will be kickstarting not only a single mobile game, but many, many more which I will strive to create. It's not easy upholding your passion in such a uptight and practical society, but I have decide to press on and pursue what I love. So, why not join me? :D





 Thank you all!","Current Progress:

- Core gameplay loop is already fully done.
- 10 fully functional levels.
- Player progression 

The entire gameplay is generally done, all thats left is the creation of more levels and bug testing. Level creation is already made to be modular therefore the creation of levels is not a major obstacle.

The greatest challenge now would be catching up with school assignments and play-testing for the game.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nBenefactor\n\n\nA great thank you to all of you kinds souls out there!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 25 or more\n\nAbout $18\n\n\n\nPrime Supporter\n\n\nExpect a custom Thank you message featuring you, in a level within the game!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (5 left of 5)""}]",0.0,0

Masquerada: Songs and Shadows is a colorfully grim song of masked deception, set amid a Venetian-inspired city haunted by the shadows of civil war, misplaced faith and fey manifestations.
 







What is a mask? A craftsman would say it beautifies the sight of the human face. A criminal desires the mask for what it conceals: identity, intention, capability. But a mask is more than what we wear. We put up masks around our hearts so none may see what capabilities and intentions - for honour, for faith, for betrayal - lie within. In the world of Masquerada, masks are all that, and much more. The masks, now powerful artifacts which are known as Mascherines, bring out the innate destructive capabilities of man into reality. With a Mascherine, the everyman can channel nature’s elements into deadly magic.Now, magic isn’t just a game for spellcasters. Every battle in Masquerada will be a dance of steel and spells, where players set the pace. Feel the need to pause combat every few ticks and exert granular control over your party members’ positioning? Sure. Or think you’ve got the skills to dive in a la Diablo and set up crowd control in real time? Have it your way.







Our myriad inspirations for Masquerada are owed to superlative, genre-defining titles like Baldur’s Gate, Dragon Age, Transistor, and much more. 































(Proper Nouns are coming. You’ve been warned.)  In the turmoil-ridden Citte della Ombre, religion holds no sway. Only the songs sung of one’s deeds will carry an Ombrian’s legacy beyond death. Those who hold even the smallest morsel of power will make every effort to ensure their songs live on. Thus have the Mascherines become the cornerstone of a culture of class warfare between the power-hungry guildsmen known as the Masquerada and the impoverished lower classes, the Contadani. Five years ago, the War of Bearings descended upon Ombre. Ignited by Contadani rebels who had stolen Mascherines from the Masquerada, the war was severe and the scars of mistrust it drew across the Citte remain today. 


From the streets to the sewers, Ombre is fraught with a dichotomy of vibrant color and grim strife.





One who bears the heaviest of scars is our protagonist, Cicero Gavar – one of Ombre’s finest sleuths with a deeply haunted past. Originally banished for war crimes against the state, Cicero has been brought back from exile to solve the kidnapping of the diplomat Razitof Azrus.  During Cicero’s investigation, other members of the Masquerada will join his party with ulterior motives, each of them unable to trust in their fellow men and women within this culture of deception. As they discover a darker conspiracy lurking in the shadows, their faith will be tested to its limits.


Cicero’s party confronts members of the Sorelle, the blue Guild. Trust fall, anyone?













We’re making a game about battles where flutists bend wind to their will and war dancers kick up earthquakes, but Masquerada isn’t just a pretty face in combat.  







Players will bring in Cicero and two companions into every battle, each equipped with their own combat styles and magic. You can control one character at any given time while an AI partner drives the other companions. Pause combat at any time, and plan out the next few seconds of combat with precise positioning of your party: 


Unpause to crush your enemies and see them driven before you, exactly as planned.





Or, for the more cocksure amongst you, engage every battle like you’re playing at the frenetic pace of a MOBA, planning be damned: 


Orchestrate violence without skipping a beat.













Magic wouldn’t be magic if it couldn’t be used for crowd control or to inflict debuffs! Cicero and his companions have a variety of spells that can directly influence enemy movement and positioning, forcing opponents into an undesirable corner. 


A well-timed heal spell is absolutely essential in a sea of red. Just ask your raid leader.





Elemental spells can also be cast in succession to leverage element-based status effects, like blinding smog or a debilitating cloud of steam. For example, an earth spell inflicts an enemy with an earth elemental tag, which can be triggered by a water spell to ensnare the enemy in show-stopping mud. 


Being Ensnared doesn't sound nearly as bad as getting Smothered.





There are three main combat forms on the battlefields that offer differentiated selection of skills: the roguish Sicario, the monolithic Pavisierre, and the bardic Dirge. Each of Cicero’s companions specializes in one of these stances in combination with a specific element, while Cicero himself is able to choose his own element and swap between the stances at will. We’ll be finely tuning Masquerada’s combat systems such that players can experiment with different combinations of companion skills to find something that rewards their play style! 







Let’s get this out there: We’ve eschewed an inventory system. Masquerada isn’t meant to be a loot fest like Diablo. We aimed to create an experience that meaningfully balances deep combat mechanics with a haunting narrative. We don’t want you distracted by the grind for a +10 Sword of A Thousand Truths.  That said, every character still carries a signature weapon that can be upgraded with sigil engravings and ink patterning, which improves weapon strength and provide buffs to existing skills and magic. You’ll want to explore the vast hand-drawn environments that Cicero and team investigate, if you hope to find new sigils and plant inks!


Imagine what Man At Arms could do with these inks and engravings.








An engraved sword is a better sword.





There are more features we’ll be highlighting throughout the course of our Kickstarter campaign, so stay tuned to our updates! 







When we decided Masquerada was to be a narrative experience with a deeply dramatic and emotional core, we pulled together everything we had to bring on the very best voice talents we could get our hands on. Working with heavyweights like Matthew Mercer, Dave Fennoy and Jennifer Hale has been an absolute dream! Have a gander at our shortlist of the main cast: 


A former Inspettore (inspector general) facing an unwelcome return to Ombre. Cicero neglected to side with both the Masquerada and the rebels during the War of Bearings, and is haunted by the public branding of him as a coward and traitor.
















A young, reclusive woman who centres her life upon the study of an ancient civilization known as the Dimenticate. Amadea’s intense fascination with her work contrasts starkly with her acerbic attitude to the living, breathing people around her.
















Simple sincerity defines a man who is determined to guard his friends and family fiercely, and his secrets even more so. Kalden lives for the children of the orphanage he runs, but Ombre has taught him to be careful in revealing the nature of his heart.
















Stale platitudes and tired excuses dominate her speech, as if to weakly belie the thinly-veiled nature of her attachment to Cicero Gavar. Tiziana is a spy for her guild, and she will uphold her faith to the guild’s notion of justice, no matter the cost.
















A loud, flamboyant and witty bard who thrives on attention and isn’t afraid to let others know it. Vasco works for an information dealer known as the Bloodless, and few understand the dark intentions that lie beneath his facetious façade.
















A fellow Inspettore like Cicero, Lucia draws immense strength from her personal beliefs and faith in things yet to come. Through this, she commands and persuades effortlessly, for nothing impresses the faithless of Ombre more than one who believes.
















The epitome of baleful, unapologetic pride. Faveo is Tiziana’s guild leader, and in a guild that obsesses over order and discipline, Faveo will not stand to be argued against or challenged by anyone, even those who fall outside the establishment.













We would be remiss if we didn’t give a shoutout to our brilliant voice director, Michael Csurics of The Brightskull Entertainment Group, who assembled the amazing cast and engineered, well, everything voice-related. Hats off to you and your team, Michael. 







The wellspring of colours and 2D linework that you see in the environments of Masquerada are the hallmark of French comic books, reflecting the influences of renowned artists such Moebius and Hergé (the creator of the Adventures of Tintin). We want every instance of the game, whether in battle or in dialogue, to feel like the player could print-screen and land themselves a beautiful illustration anytime. 















Of course, the game must absolutely move as well as it looks in still life. We’ve invested a great deal of time into crafting a painterly 3D character animation style that harkens to both the golden age of Disney character animation and the iconic works of Don Bluth. We’d love for Masquerada to be played 10 years from now and have its timeless aesthetic still remain gorgeous. 




When the moment calls for in-depth action, a cutscene will kick in with richly illustrated comic panels.





















We have the inimitable Josh Whelchel as the composer on the soundtrack of Masquerada! Songs being as vital as they are to the culture of Citte della Ombre, we needed someone who could do justice to the complexities and drama of this world we built. Josh previously worked with us on the soundtrack for Ravenmark: Scourge of Estellion and he has also composed for games like Oblitus and Mojang’s Scrolls to mention a few. Have a listen to a selection of his OST: 


Backing up Josh with ethereal vocals on the trailer track “Broken Clay” is our homegirl, singer-songwriter iNCH. She’s been showcased twice at the South by Southwest music festival and we couldn’t be happier to have her contributing to Masquerada’s tapestry of music!Last but not least, another shoutout to our trusty audio crew at IMBA Interactive, who are responsible for balancing the complex soundscape of Masquerada. Between the voice acting, the sweeping soundtrack, and a whole boatload of mood-specific sound effects for the flora and fauna of Ombre, they have a huge task on their hands, and all we can say is, they’re incredible at it. Put on a good pair of headphones when you try the demo of Masquerada and you’ll see what we mean!







Now you’ve read all these wonderful things about our ambitious little RPG, and might be chomping at the bit to back our campaign. But you’re probably wondering: other than the game, what the heck do you get for chipping in? Well, we’re making the basic game available at a 20% discount from our intended retail price. However, we think you’d much prefer LIMITED EDITION rewards to sink your teeth into. Some of these rewards will never be produced again. A very limited quantity of these rewards will even be signed by the cast! All of these will be exclusive for people who helped us out in our time of need. Yes, that means no Slacker Backer type of schemes.Here's a detailed look at each individual reward:







The masterfully written original score and soundtrack of Masquerada with over 2 hours of listening pleasure. 















A book packed with pages of the vibrant art of Masquerada layered next to excerpts of the game’s narrative script. 


Note: Item shown is a 3D mockup. When shipped, the final production piece may differ in appearance.













A handsome fully hand-painted poster from our lead artist, specially designed for this Kickstarter campaign. 
















A flash drive branded with the sigil of the Registry, the organization that governs Ombre. Comes pre-loaded with the following:  
A DRM-free copy of Masquerada: Songs & Shadows 
A digital copy of the Masquerada Soundtrack 
A digital copy of the Masquerada Artbook 
A digital, high-resolution copy of our Kickstarter Special Poster



Note: Item shown is a 3D rendered prototype. When shipped, the final production piece may differ in appearance.













An intricately sculpted, 10 cm (approximately 4”) tall figure of Cicero Gavar. Dynamically posed and ready to take on whatever cursed Fey lie lurking in the shadows of your desk. 


Note: Item shown is a 3D rendered prototype. When shipped, the final production piece may differ in appearance.













A life-sized mask modelled after the very same Mascherine that Cicero dons in our cinematic introduction. The pièce de résistance of all our physical rewards, the mask will be produced just around 18 cm (approximately 7”) in height. Spells and abilities not included. 


Note: Item shown is a 3D rendered prototype. When shipped, the final production piece may differ in appearance.





 Now here's a look at the Reward Tiers we have to offer: NOTE: All rewards tiers will receive their copy of Masquerada: Songs & Shadows as a digital downloadable version of the game via a Steam (PC/Mac) key or a PSN code. 































































The team at Witching Hour Studios, hailing from the sunny island state of Singapore, are a diverse bunch. Our nutty family of 15 artists, programmers and designers led by Creative Director, Ian Gregory, have been hauling butt together for nearly six years now, working on RPG and strategy games that we hope have delivered on our core principles of thoughtful gameplay mechanics combined with meaningful storytelling and worldbuilding. If you’d like, check out our previous work on Ravenmark: Scourge of Estellion or Romans In My Carpet! 







We aren’t your usual rogue’s gallery of ex-AAA game developers. We may not have double-digit man-years of game making experience. What does matter is that we would like to prove you don’t need all that to make an incredible game! Hopefully what you’ve seen here gives you a sense of our dedication and our vision. 







We’re in the final stages of production for Masquerada, and we’re hauling ass right now to finish the game. In fact, we could release the game next month after telling you all these awesome things about it. Nobody would be more eager than us to push the game out right now so we can actually relax for a bit after 2 years of grueling work. However, eagerness does not equate to satisfaction. We could release the game next month, but we would not be satisfied with the final product. It’s like giving up on a personal best in the gym just because you’re really exhausted. Problem is, we don’t directly have the means to keep on working on the game.
Back in 2014, we signed a publishing partnership with Ysbryd Games to secure a funding warchest for the development of Masquerada that basically lasts until April 2016 (i.e. end of this month). Of course, because we don’t have the financial means to continue beyond April, we asked Ysbryd for a bit more to see us through this period of extra refinement. Unfortunately, even their hands were tied with respect to further funding. But they are helping us push out this Kickstarter, and now we need your help!It’s famously said in game development that the last 20% of production is the last 80%. We will work our bones off if we can grasp the chance to make the game feel exactly as we envisioned it. Our target funding keeps the lights on and feeds people for another three months so we can pour ourselves into this final stretch.With your money, we’re going to continue iterating on the hundreds of combat encounters in the game to ensure they are balanced in a deeply satisfactory way for all skill and character configurations. And we’re going to throw more tweaks and layers at our visuals, so that things don’t just shine, they’ll be eye-popping. (Well, ours might literally pop so that yours does figuratively. Just saying.)







Oh, before we forget. This Kickstarter campaign gives us a chance to put together physical rewards like what you've seen above! We love games and we’re even more manic about quality collectibles, so the opportunity to create and share tangible tokens from Masquerada’s world with you is really special. Naturally, a significant portion of what we raise will go towards the manufacturing and distribution of our pledge rewards. Here’s a chart detailing what we’ll be doing with the funds we receive:","Game development is a challenging endeavour we’ve become well familiar with over the last five years at Witching Hour Studios. With practically every new project we’ve undertaken, we've bitten into an apple that’s far more ambitious than what came previously.
 
Having come this far with Masquerada, we can assure you that the game is feature complete and primarily needs QA testing. Again, we could launch the game next month if we so desired. There is practically no risk that would impede the eventual release of Masquerada on Steam by the end of the summer, short of a force majeure situation where our office AND our off-site backup are simultaneously carpet bombed.
 
That brings us to the main issue of why we’re on Kickstarter – giving us enough time to polish the game and make it as perfect as we can. The biggest risk to you, the potential Masquerada audience, is that you get a game that delivers less than its full potential. If our campaign is successful, everyone gets what they want! (Except those people who want Half-Life 3.)
 
We could launch on Early Access, but we feel that isn’t the right venue for singleplayer RPGs. The RPG audience deserves an experience that’s been tweaked and fine-tuned to perfection; you don’t deserve to be guinea pigs. That would be more of a risk than asking you to pledge money to us.
 
Having said all of that, we’re determined to share Masquerada with the world, and we will figure out a way to ensure our labour of love is completed to our heart’s desire, one way or another. We have faith!","[{""rewards"":""Pledge £1 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\nMASKRUNNER\n\n(I just want to help!)\n\nYour name will be featured in the credits.\n\nThank you for your support!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge £14 or more\n\nAbout US$ 17\n\n\n\nSICARIO\n\n(Game Only)\n\nA digital downloadable copy of Masquerada: Songs & Shadows on Steam (PC/Mac) or PlayStation 4. \n\nYour name will be featured in the credits.\n\n(Check Rewards section for more details!)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,206 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge £20 or more\n\nAbout US$ 24\n\n\n\nDIRGE\n\n(Game & OST)\n\nRewards from the Sicario tier, and a digital downloadable copy of the Original Soundtrack of Masquerada!\n\n(Check Rewards section for more details!)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n300 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge £28 or more\n\nAbout US$ 33\n\n\n\nPAVISIERRE\n\n(Ultimate Digital Bundle)\n\nAll rewards from the Dirge tier, plus the following: \n\n- A digital downloadable copy of our Artbook\n\n- A digital copy of the Kickstarter exclusive Poster\n\n(Check Rewards section for more details!)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n140 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge £40 or more\n\nAbout US$ 47\n\n\n\nMAESTRO\n\n(Physical Box Set)\n\nA classic-styled physical game box packed with a selection of fine swag!\n\nIncludes the following:\n\n- A digital downloadable copy of Masquerada: Songs & Shadows Steam (PC/Mac) or PlayStation 4\n\n- A Sigil of the Registry USB Stick, pre-loaded with all our digital rewards and a DRM-free copy of the game\n\n- A vinyl figurine of Masquerada’s protagonist, Cicero Gavar\n\n(Check Rewards section for more details!)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2016\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n194 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge £75 or more\n\nAbout US$ 87\n\n\n\nREGENTI - FIRST RUN\n\n(Deluxe Collector’s Edition Box Set)\n\nThe Collector’s Edition for Masquerada: Songs & Shadows, where we’ve assembled the choicest of rewards for those who wish to own a piece of Ombre.\n\nIncludes all rewards from the Maestro tier, plus the following:\n\n- A physical copy of the Masquerada Artbook \n\n- A printed copy of our Kickstarter exclusive Poster\n\n- A full-sized collectible mask, modelled after Cicero Gavar’s Mascherine\n\n(Check Rewards section for more details!)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2016\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n99 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (1 left of 100)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge £90 or more\n\nAbout US$ 105\n\n\n\nRegenti Tier\n\n(Deluxe Collector’s Edition Box Set)\n\nThe Collector’s Edition for Masquerada: Songs & Shadows, where we’ve assembled the choicest of rewards for those who wish to own a piece of Ombre.\n\nIncludes all Maestro Tier rewards plus the following:\n\n- A physical copy of the Masquerada Artbook \n\n- A printed copy of our Kickstarter exclusive Poster\n\n- A full-sized collectible mask, modelled after Cicero Gavar’s Mascherine\n\n(Check Rewards section for more details!)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2016\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge £180 or more\n\nAbout US$ 209\n\n\n\nSEIMORA’S CROWN\n\n(Signed Deluxe Collector’s Edition Box Set)\n\nTake the grandest journey with Cicero and his companions.

Why Dynamics 3D PrinterDynamics 3D printer is a new era of 3D printing machine with unique design and better functionality that utilizes innovative mechanism functionality. It is Light, Small, yet with large print volume that outperformed many established branded printer on the market.

 







                 Lead Screw Drive System with Anti-BackSlash Nut Dynamics 3D Printer uses Lead screw system with Anti-backslash nuts that ensure your every print is accurate and also longer lifespan for printer.

 









 Conventional rubber belt drive systems that will loses tension over a period of time.







  

Fixed platform, with Special heatbed surface optimized for PLA materialA stable platform for printing is extremely important.Many FDM/FFF 3D printers utilizes movable printing platform for easy mechanism design and movement and there are some disadvantages.For large object printing, on movable platform during normal to high speed, the printed object will lose grip at first layer if is not stick properly on the platform and later into the printing, the high rate of movement of the platform will creates vibration and that causes the grip to weaken further, thus warping will occurs more easily.If printing narrow, tall and thin object, moveable platform cause the end tip to resonate at the top and the layering will be stacked unevenly.Hence a Fixed platform is the most ideal.









Fixed Platform for stable printing, with special heated bed surface optimized for PLA.  

                                   Dual FunctionBesides creating a 3D printer with many good functions, we add more excitement into the realm of 3D printing machines by incorporating Laser engraving/cutting function to unleash your creativity to the next level.

World First Smallest Direct Drive Extruder Module & High Efficient Laser ModuleWhere space is a luxury, after countless prototyping and testing, we had come out with a 3D printer design that is compact yet packs a huge punch above its weight in performance.We have developed the World Smallest Direct Drive Extruder Module and World Smallest High Efficient Laser module to match the purposes and functionality design and usage of Dynamics 3D printer.







 







 Small yet Large Print Volume (You get MORE for less)Many 3D printers are huge in size and have a small to acceptable print volume, to have larger print volume the printer size needs to be even bigger. We solve this issue with the creation of Dynamics 3D printer, small yet large print volume of 10143 cubic/cm that outperforming many 3D printers.This is only made possible by our unique mechanical design that utilizes every available space without sacrificing performance. Yet performance is enhanced using lead screw and other items mentioned.







 







 

 Portable and Easy StorageThis is achievable by the rotational symmetry of the Z-Axis housing via our robust mechanical clutch system that is able to rotate and hold steady on the Z-Axis Housing. It is a very unique and bold design, that is totally different from other 3D printer and we had tested and proven it works beautifully.









 







Most 3D printers are huge in size yet with small print volume, taking up a big space out of your desk and too heavy to carry it around.

With Dynamics 3D printer, you will never have this problem, it is portable and weight approximately only 5.5kg, you can keep it inside your cupboard when not in use to free up your spaces  and You can also carry it around easily. The unique ZEN design and beautiful fine surface finishing of the high grade aluminum body can also enhance your work desk looks.







  

           Robust Aluminum Body and Customized CNC PartsDynamics 3D Printer main body is made of aluminum by laser cut and stamping technique. The mechanism of the moving parts and other items are customized CNC parts and laser cut steel.Most of the parts (about 95%) are 100% made customized to meet the functionality of the Dynamics 3D printer and it is not buy off-the-shelf parts or 3D printed parts which make this printer extremely robust, unique and also costly to manufacture, but with your massive support, we can made it happen and only at kickstarter.com, we can achieve this prices for you.







                                Fully Assembled For You

 Timeline","To make a 3D printer that utilize every aspect of the advantages and shrink it smaller yet retain a huge print volume and enhanced performance is extremely challenging. This challenges are overcome by countless hours of careful planning and design before rigging up the first prototype by using acrylic sheets.

When the initial few concepts is working, we move on to fabricating the metal body and CNC parts. At this stage on June 2016, it is only the 9th prototype machine out of the 19th prototype(Final prototype as seen in this page) that we had made altogether.

Every space must be utilized hence all parts are CNC customized and Laser cut that made this 3D printer very unique with it own signature functionally and design.

A machine with approximately 580 parts to assembled, calibrated and tested for you is time consuming but we are confidence and with our knowledge and experience in manufacturing processes we will be able to navigate around the obstacles. Beside this, while designing Dynamics 3D printer, we have take into consideration of how the assembly process will be and most of the parts are snap on and screw on, thus it will be quick and an efficient process.

We will keep our backers updated and inform any issues we encounter or good progress as we more forward.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 10 or more\n\nAbout US$ 8\n\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nThanks for the support and We are greatly appreciated.

 We know how important it is to be seen when cycling in the dark. Blincclip is a high-performance reflector which clips in seconds to virtually any saddle. It blinks dynamically under the power of your movement so you can be noticed by approaching drivers. Blincclip will always be there blinking and reflecting headlights.
 Original Blincclip is featured on: 









Here Are Some Testimonials from around the globe
""Sometimes it’s the simplest ideas that make the most sense. Case in point: Blincclip, a simple, double-sided flat card of reflective material that’s designed to blink while you ride. It uses no batteries, has no mounts to affix to (or break), and weighs less than a dollop of chamois cream.""-- CyclingTips
""Just a couple weeks ago, I discovered that one of my blinking lights was not working as I was  leaving work in the rain, so I can definitely appreciate the value of a low tech backup."" --James Thomas, Bicycle Design
""It is one of those simple, but very effective, 'why didn't I think of that' type products !""

  -- Mark Sander, UK, Designer of IF Mode, Strida folding bikes
""The Blincclip easily clipped on my saddle rails and has stayed there through sun, rain and high-speed descents. It is reassuring that it is there jiggling away and making me more conspicuous on the road."" --Tom Webster, Singapore/London, Bicycle infrastructure engineer/amateur racer









 Worry the rear light dies during a ride? 
Have you ever experienced the frustrating moment, to start riding home at night and realize the light battery is dead? It is an incredibly palm-sweating experience to cycle at night with a dead rear light. The fear of being rear-ended will haunt you throughout the journey and it is definitely an awful experience. Even worse, most of the time we don't notice it is dead halfway during the ride. Frustrated with such situations we decided to create a super reflector for those emergency moments.









Why blincclip is a better reflector?
Blincclip is super bright, Blincclip can blink by itself. 
To attract the motorist's attention,  a blinking reflector is more powerful than a static reflector. In case your light suddenly dies, Blincclip will always be there reflecting headlights to get you noticed.









How can a reflector blink?
This is where the magic happens. It simply hangs freely over the seat rails and responding to every movement as you pedal. The material, shape, size, and weight are optimized for the great pendulum effect. Plus, It blinks dynamically throughout every situation. It is responsive to the speed you are riding, terrain, and wind. On top of that, it goes static when you brake! 




Easily clip in and clip out for extra visibility.





























As colorful as possible. You can flip it for daylight use with bright fluorescent yellow. Any additional brightness to your ride won't hurt.









Specs
Blincclip: 88 x 66mm. It is incredibly thin (1mm) and light (3.5grams). Carry one in your wallet for that spontaneous needs.









Blincclip is flexible, it can fit on any bike from foldie to roadie in a snap. No screw, no glue. Leaving your bike clean and sleek.









Material
We use 3M Diamond Grade reflector that is usually used for high-performance purposes such as in highways and airplane runway signs. It is incredibly bright and has an amazing viewing angle to ensure that you will be seen throughout any angle. It is also reassuring that Blincclip will be as durable as it can be.









Application
Have a saddle bag? No problem! with the included string, you can practically attach blincclip anywhere. So, you can go blincc blincc anytime.




Saddle bag hanging effect








Feeling creative?





















It works with your favorite cycling light. Blincclip is designed to be used with other cycling accessories as additional visibility. 

















This is us~~
Designed by the community for communities




Francis and David





We have amazing collaborators and testers that come together to make Blincclip great. Our community is growing and We hope you can join our ride too!




Hands in the air!








Thank you collaborators! These are just some of them. Unfortunately, we can't put everyone inside the picture.








A Line of Blincclips











Started from this





 How it all started
It started back in 2011. Francis was involved in promoting safe-cycling in the community. He realized it is important to catch the driver's attention from far, and that allows more time for the driver to respond to the cyclist. He developed several versions of ""safety flag"" which move dynamically to attract attention from the drivers. The latest version is the Blincclip!









It looks incredibly simple! However, every material, shapes, sizes, weights and ways of attaching effect greatly in the blinking performance. Hence, Together with the community, we identify the needs, possibility and opportunity to make Blincclip perfect! Super Simple & Super Effective, KISS




Size matters! Blincclip were fine-tuned to blink at the best rate 





  Help us share our project :)

HOPE: Rainbow Earrings Collection 2.0




Hope Rainbow Earrings 2.0





HOPE Rainbow Earrings Collection 2.0 is an extended project focusing on introducing 9 new designs to our collection of handmade art earrings based on quilling techniques. All our earrings are crafted by our skilled, persistent and passionate artisans. 
Our collection is named after Rainbow because it symbolises peace and serenity. More significantly, rainbow is often seen after a rainstorm when the sun breaks through the clouds. This provides us with a very powerful and important message. Good and beautiful things often follow the darkest storms.
Rainbow can motivate us to continue and endure through dark times. Another way that rainbow provide us with hope and motivation is by being a symbol for good luck. Rainbows are often thought to bring good fortune.

























Art of Quilling
Paper Quilling is an art form that involves the use of strips of paper that are rolled, shaped, and glued together to create decorative designs. In our earring collection, papers are rolled, looped, curled, twisted and manipulated to create shapes which make up our earring designs. Quilling starts with rolling a strip of paper into a coil and then pinching the coil into shapes that can be glued together.

The aim of creating this game was multifold. As a fan of tabletop games, I wanted something that I could play with friends and get drunk. As a parent, I wanted something that would be educational, as well as entertaining for impatient kids to get away from screens. As a man who likes to hide in my cave, it is something I can play alone. So I created a flexible card game suitable for many occasions and age groups.









Think about this - How much do you spend on entertainment outside? A typical trip to a shopping centre will cost around 50 to 60 dollars, depending on what you do. That is the typical cost of 2 movie tickets, popcorn and a cheap meal for two.
As for kids, each activity or enrichment course costs around 130 dollars a month. Art class, martial arts, sports, programming, it all adds up easily to a few hundred dollars a month. Time with kids away from their screens and addiction? Priceless.









For only 60 Singapore dollars, you get to have a deck of Twist cards that can be played during gatherings, as well as for family fun. All rewards come with free global shipping. I'm not making much money per deck. It was done to share the joy of playing card games with the rest of the world. Instead of a few hours of entertainment outside, or 2 piano classes, you get many hours of fun with Twist!
As it was designed for the brainy ones, every player has to Twist their mind somehow to win! For those who are not so smart, you can win too! In fact, my 8 year old kid has figured out how to win me without stretching his mind too much! Also, he gets to be creative by playing with me!









90 unique cards, 3 levels, and many ways to play. Comes with instructions for recommended gameplay based on computer optimization. I ran many simulations to make sure it was difficult to win.

















Twist is a flexible card game, designed for many different occasions. It can even be used to educate your 2 year old! There are 3 difficulty levels and multiple game modes available, all in one deck, for up to 6 players! If you are more of a caveman like I am, there is even a single player mode available, where you can lose to dumb luck! Imagine that.
The exciting part is when you play with a group of friends. Punishment: Drink beer, or do some pushups, or whatever twisted punishment you can come up with. Twist is one game where you can sabotage one another, gang up, and turn the tables with certain cards! No one knows the outcome until the end. Even the smartest person in the room can lose if you know how it works. You can be a kamikaze player, and no one wins!









If you play with kids, adjust the difficulty level accordingly and let the kids challenge their personal limits by playing! Not only will it train kids to push their personal limit, it is a game where the imagination is the only limit! I've had lots of fun playing with my 8 year old. He won the intermediate level by knowing how to game the system. He won by a razor thin margin on the hardest level. If you want your kids to be away from electronic devices and train their minds to be sharp and fast, play Twist.
For 2 year olds, there is a special way to play. As long as the kid doesn't eat up the cards, of course.
What is special about Twist? The rules are not set in stone. It is up to your Twisted mind to imagine which rules rule.
Here is a brief video of the gameplay.

Early birds can buy a single deck for S$55 (only 100 available). You can also buy two decks for only S$100, to share with another friend. Only 50 sets available. For the rest, S$60 per deck. I'm not making huge profits per deck, and I chose a reliable supplier to ensure that you get the cards as soon as possible. To ensure you get good quality products, I made a sample deck at very high cost, just to check.

















Stretch goal - reach S$30,000 and instead of the normal deck, everyone gets a collectors' edition deck. I will include some modifications to the game to empower the weak minds to win! Only on Kickstarter. I will also modify the box so that you can brag about the limited edition Twist. After this campaign, I will only produce the normal deck.









Don't hesitate, support my campaign! It will be fun, for a very low price!









I'm a typical Asian parent, as well as a designer, educator, engineer, scientist and gamer. As geeky as it gets.","I used a reputable manufacturer to make these cards. You can rest assure that the quality will be good, as I have made a sample deck for myself, at very high cost.

To ensure that you receive these cards as soon as possible, I decided to make less profits per deck. It should take around 1 to 2 months to reach you (maximum expected time should be 3 months).

There are contingency plans such as alternative suppliers.

I've also spent the last month testing this game with other people, to ensure that you have the most fun!","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 60 or more\n\nAbout US$ 43\n\n\n\nStandard Deck at Retail Price\n\n\nThis comes with a standard deck of Twist cards, at normal retail price.\n\nStretch goals - collectors' edition Twist cards, with special cards included in the deck that will not be produced in future.\nIncludes:\n\n\nOne Deck of Twist cards\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 100 or more\n\nAbout US$ 72\n\n\n\nDouble the fun, only 50 sets available\n\n\nThis comes with 2 standard decks of Twist cards, at a discounted price.

Remember buying a planner in 2018, but it's almost 2019 and you haven't used it? 




We never expire.





The Timeless Journal is a premium, undated monthly stone paper planner suitable for the generations to come. We don’t restrict you to a certain calendar year, so you can use it anytime, anywhere and how ever you want–it’s all up to you. You’ll never have to wait for January to begin a new journal.   Made with Stone Paper, Timeless Journals is waterproof, tear-resistant and thus, ultra durable. Using stone waste from mining industries, and zero water or wood, our paper is environmentally friendly, silky soft and paper-cut proof. 







Timeless Journals will never discolour, disintegrate or crumble with time. Whether you stop halfway or keep your journal in a collection, your Timeless Journal will look exactly the way you left it.















                                                  















We designed Timeless Journals to revolutionize the way people use, style and keep their planners. In our research, we discovered Stone Paper, an alternative to regular paper. Stone paper is waterproof, paper-cut proof, fire-retardant, tear proof and generally lasts way longer than regular paper. This was in line with our goal of creating a journal that was longer lasting, and sturdy enough to resist tears or water spills.Also, stone paper uses no wood or water during production, unlike regular paper! This results in grainless paper that is oh, so smooth.
 


















Yes, that's us washing the book.








12 undated monthly spreads. No restrictions - you’ll never have to wait for January to start a journal again.








Also,  large boxes that maximize your journal’s space and potential while maintaining a professional and clean design.








Dot grids with 5 mm spacing, providing writing, sketching or drawing guidance without the distraction from lined or grid pages.
















Most importantly, Timeless Journals are waterproof! Don’t worry about spilling your drinks or writing with wet hands because your journal is absolutely WATERPROOF! WORKS WITH WATER AND OTHER COLOURED LIQUIDS!








2 waterproof and tear-proof stone paper pockets to keep all your loose sheets, stickers, notes or photos.








Self-healing PU leather that is scratch-resistant and waterproof, along with a reinforced elastic band that is longer lasting.








Lay flat binding








Handy A5 size to bring out on your daily commutes





























Timeless Journals are suitable for everyone! 

A working professional who simply needs a space to note his schedule and write meeting notes or to do lists.
 
A student who only needs to organize their schedule during the academic months and pen down notes and mind-maps during lessons. 
 
A traveller or backpacker who needs a planner that's sturdier, durable and weatherproof!
 
An artist who pens down his ideas and drawings on the go. 
 
A parent who wants to record her journey as a parent, or even simply, use it as a personal cookbook!
 
A budding entrepreneur who needs to keep track of his accounts, and manage an ever so packed schedule.
 
As a gift during anytime of the year.

and most importantly, YOU!

 









With undated months and dot grid pages, Timeless Journals are extremely versatile. Draw, scrapbook, create your layouts or work with none, it’s all up to you.

 We give you the essentials, you create.








As a thank you to all our Kickstarter backers, we are offering not one, but TWO exclusive features for you guys!


Timeless Journals come in Timeless Black, and a Kickstarter Exclusive Twinkle Pink!













Also, customize your Timeless Journal!









We are providing customized gold foil text for every backer! You can choose to have your name, initials, favourite word, special dates or even your company name! (Up to 10 characters).































Timeless Journals uses no trees or water in production, and we want to take it a step further. As such, we pledge to plant one tree for every Timeless Journal purchased. Each tree planted helps to make our planet a better place. We have chosen One Tree Planted, in their quest in reforestation in North America, Latin America, Asia and Africa. 


We will be focusing on reforestation in Indonesia, where deforestation and developments have reduced the habitats of wildlife. In Indonesia, jungles are still being illegally logged daily to make room for palm oil, rubber and paper plantations. Each tree planted helps to reforest the country and protect the wildlife. Every little bit goes a long way in reforestation.","Every Kickstarter campaign comes with its own risks and challenges. Despite all the preparation and planning we have done, we cannot ensure that there will be no risks or unforeseen challenges. However, here is what we are prepared for.

1. Production Delays
To avoid delays in manufacturing and production, we have a shorter campaign period, allowing us to collect the surveys and send the items for production right on schedule. Also, once our campaign is backed, we have intentions to proceed with the production of the inner sheets to speed up the manufacturing process. 

2. Customization
Should there be any issues in customization errors, we have backup debossing suppliers that we are able to work with. Nevertheless, to minimize the possibility of such errors, we have set up systems and processes with our manufacturer to ensure that this is a foolproof method.

3. Quality Control
To ensure that your Timeless Journal is of the highest quality, we will be checking every single product before dispatching it out. We will be hiring additional people and activating our friends and family to help us out in doing quality checks and highlighting any potential issues to prevent a delay on dispatch. 

4. Unforeseen Challenges
We’ve heard of horror stories where a creator goes MIA after a campaign is backed. We don’t want to be like that. Follow us on both Instagram and Facebook, where we’ll post regular updates on the progress, and also share behind the scenes videos and photos on production and packing! We will always be contactable at hello@timelessjournals.com as well.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\nA little goes a long way!\n\n\nThank you for supporting us on our journey to making our dream come true!

What is Scratchbac?
Scratchbac helps you connect easily with people physically around you to enable meaningful interactions and resource sharing.









Scratchbac started as a Telegram bot to bring people closer amidst the isolating pandemic. Over the past year, 60,000 users have joined Scratchbac and the impact created by the community has blown us away:
> 50,000 meaningful interactions were enabled. 10,000 items were given away. 22 lost pets were found and 1 suicide was prevented.
However, to provide a safe and impact-focused experience for our users, we must move beyond the technical limitations of Telegram and build our own app. But we've reached a point where the ongoing cost of operation and development is no longer sustainable. 
We're almost there but need your help.
The development of the app will tie up our whole team for the next few months. If we meet the Kickstarter goal, we can hire additional developers to help with code reviews and get interns to help maintain the bot. Simultaneously, the core team can focus on making the dream app safe, secure and robust. If we go beyond the goal, we can go further and build more exciting features!

Why Build a Different Social App?
We realised we hardly know the people in our communities.









Technology connects us to anyone anywhere in the world, yet we know nothing about the people around us. We're alone in our neighbourhoods filled with strangers and closed doors.


In fact, there was no easy way to get in touch with the people and activities around us.









We tried to join dozens of social media groups to interact with people in our area. But often those exchanges were merely transactional. We wanted a platform that could help us meaningfully connect with others nearby.


Hence, we're creating a safe space for everyone to form true connections.









We want to take away the pressures of “views” and “likes” on social media and let you genuinely connect with people around you. Our goal is to create a positive social platform where people can engage, collaborate, and help one another easily.

Check out Scratchbac's features:
1. Keep up with the hyperlocal happenings on your Live Location Feed




Posts from around your real-time location








E.g. Jeanette reuniting a lost toy and its owner





2. Keep track of what's important all the time in your Home and Work Feed




Posts from around your Home/ Work








E.g. Colin sharing his bakes with neighbours







3. Interact meaningfully with Comments or Chat

How do we plan to be sustainable long term?
Scratchbac Coins
A paid coins system will be our primary source of income. They can be used in 2 ways to improve your Scratchbac experience:


1. Scratchbac Virtual Items 









Virtual Items are digital objects used in Scratchbac for users to commend one another or to recognise certain milestones. These items let you express your creativity, establish credibility, and are a symbol of your achievements. They will be displayed on your posts and can also be found in your profiles.


2. Scratchbac Post Add-Ons









To help you spruce up their posts and reach your people more effectively, you can use coins to add URLs or Commercial Features to your posts.

 Our Commitment to You:









1. Your Privacy is our Priority
No other users can direct message you privately unless both of you are connected. Non-connected users can only Chat with you through your post and you are in control of who can reach out to you.


2. Nobody will ever know your exact location
Your location data never leaves your phone. We obscure your position in Geo-hashed data that represents an area instead of a specific point. In other words, you can never be tracked on Scratchbac while still enjoying the proximity services!


3. We will never sell your data
Your personal data is yours to keep. Scratchbac will never sell your data to third parties. You are our customers, not our products and we are here to serve you.









 Our Team  




From left to right: Ryan, Cheryl, Bala, Princeton and Jerry.





Our humble team started as a group of unlikely friends who met in university (SUTD whoo!).  Between the 5 of us, we've worked on countless projects. From hardware to software, if you can name it we can probably build it (please don't say nuclear power plant...).
Jerry Neo,Team Lead
Jerry is crazy about smart city tech and the environment. In his free time,  he practises Muaythai and coaches his varsity team occasionally.  His background is in entrepreneurship, computer eng and renewable tech. 
Fun fact: Designed an Automated Letterbox System for the Smart Cities of tomorrow. 
Cheryl Low, UIUX & Marketing
Cheryl is passionate about user-centric design and tech. In her free time, she volunteers at TechforShe, mentoring and helping to facilitate workshops. Her background is in design science and mechanical eng. 
Fun fact: Designed Tello! a communication tool for those with lock-in syndrome that won the Startup Weekend 2019.
Princeton Poh, DevOps & Front-end
Princeton is enthusiastic about Human Behaviour and Social Integration. He is our unofficial ""Chief Morality Officer"". Currently, he is completing his masters in computer science and tech entrepreneurship at SUTD as a scholar. 
Fun fact: Wrote the first lines of code for Scratchbac and the OG Telegram Bot.
Vivkebala, System Architect & Back-end
Bala is a modern-day farmer, interested in Urban Farming and Education. In his free time, he cultivates mushrooms at home with the hope of creating decentralised farms in the future. Currently, he is completing his masters in computer science and tech entrepreneurship at SUTD as a scholar.
Fun fact: Helped to develop the Singapore National Day Parade Online Ticketing System in 2019.
Ryan Yip, Front-end & Data Analytics
Ryan is all about front-end development these days. He loves to bring life to UI designs through code even though he is also darn good at data analytics. His background is in business analytics & operations research, machine learning and AI.
Fun fact: He was president of the SUTD Muaythai club and he's even better than Jerry.

He sent me this picture and said in Chinese, ""These little houses just got out of the kiln."" 




Andrew sent me this on WhatsApp





It has been almost a year since we first did MAKE100 with the cute Owl-carinas, and Andrew was very delighted with the support. After the first kickstarter project in 2020, we briefly discussed about this year's MAKE100, and how he wants to launch more kickstarters to share his work with the world. Although I am helping him with these campaigns, it struck me one day that I do not really know his story . 
This campaign marks the start of a series of Andrew's life as a potter in Singapore, a beautiful journey about one who chose to pursue art in a city at a time where it was, and still is, difficult making a living out of art.  
*Note: Scroll down to 'About the Project' for the rewards. 


part 1 - THE WEDGE
Clay has to be wedged carefully to remove air pockets that might be trapped, and to ensure that the clay is uniform before a potter starts. Not consistent and you face problems moulding it. Too many air pockets and it explodes in the kiln. The fate of a finished piece is decided much earlier on...
Andrew was one of my instructors when I was an apprentice at Boon's Pottery (Mr Boon, a master potter and the owner of the studio, allowed me to learn from the instructors for free while I was struggling with my startup life in 2019. A story for another time!) As we both live in the west side of Singapore, we would take the same bus back after lessons. I would bombard him with questions on pottery techniques and sometimes he would share interesting snippets of his past. One day, he told me to go over to his place to take a look at his collection, and that was how the first MAKE100 campaign started. For this first interview, he was playing 'Angry Birds' on his computer when I got there :)









Andrew: ""I was born in Singapore in 1949, but just 40 days after I was born, my family relocated to Indonesia because my father had a business there. Since we also had family in Singapore, we would come back to Singapore a few times each year for visiting. I was lucky to be born with a silver spoon in my mouth because of my family's thriving business, and I basically got whatever I wanted as a kid. My parents bought a piano and violin for me when I was just 6, however, I had zero interest in music although my third brother was very musically inclined. 




Andrew with his parents and brother. He is on the far left.





We lived in a nice house along the river, and big boats sailed along daily. I would sketch and paint the scenery, and I was only 7 when I started. I could also recall that my love for art started at a young age. I would sketch actors and celebrities on the print commercials and was passionate to pursue commercial arts when I grow older. My parents dissuaded me because they see no value in art, and partly because all they knew at that point was that artists and designers have to scale heights to paint malls and buildings. 
While my childhood was pretty comfortable, things took a bad turn in the 60s. Due to political unrest and conflicts, my school was shut down. It was unsafe, and my grandfather had to bring me back to Singapore in 1963 and to live together with my grandmother. Although I had to relocate, life was still comfortable. My pocket money was $5,  which was a lot at the time because one bowl of noodles was only around 30 cents. During Chinese New Year, I also received lots of red packets from my father's business associates. 
One happy memory was an adventure with my friends back in the early 60s, when I was just 14 years old.  It was before Singapore's independence, and one of my relatives told us that it was the harvest season for one of the fruit farms they owned in Pontian Kechil, Malaysia. I gathered 6 of my friends, and we brought our identity cards and some allowances, then made our way to the fruit farm. Back then laws were lax so we could travel to Malaysia without a passport. We didn't know the way, so we asked around as we went about. We took buses after buses and finally arrived at the farm. We had a great time traveling and exploring, and we even caught a show in Johor Bahru, Malaysia before making our way back to Singapore. 




Andrew as a young boy having fun





I received a bad piece of news one morning in 1966 and my life turned upside down. My grandfather told me that my father passed away due to leukemia. He was just in his 40s. I was devastated emotionally, but there were more problems. My dad was the sole breadwinner, so with no financial support, my grandfather couldn't afford rent and we had to shift around a couple of times. We ended up living together with 2 aunts. 
Life was tough without much income, and we had to resort to eating leftovers from hawker centres at times. To supplement my household income, I would do whatever job I could find while schooling. I helped a photography studio to develop photographs at 2 cents per photograph, and I remember setting up a small shop to sell handmade keychain and jewellery to make ends meet.
In 1970, when I finished secondary school, my family was too poor to afford high school. Without a high school education, I could not go to university. I thought my future was bleak, so all I had in mind was to start working as soon as possible to put food on the table for my family. However, with no skills or qualifications, I could go nowhere. My cousin was then a shell craft instructor at the Baharuddin Vocational Institute, and recommended the school to me. The Baharuddin Vocational Institute aimed to nurture skilled designers and craftsmen, and he told me to join the 9-month long rosewood furniture making course so that I will be able to start work after I graduate as a carpenter. 
The admission test required applicants to carve an elephant and a pencil holder out of a block of wood. I did well, and the teacher was curious on how I did it and so I explained my process to him. I then got accepted into the course. We learned to build furniture with rosewood and learned to join wood using joints, without any screws or fasteners. In the rosewood furniture workshop, there were 'No Smoking' signs all over because the wood and sawdust are flammable. The teacher and his assistant would always remind us not to smoke in the workshop, but they would sit with their feet up the desk and smoked as they taught the class. We were pissed off because they were not leading by example and it was dangerous. We were young and cheeky at that age, so one day, we ganged up to all smoke together in class with our feet up our desk. The teacher was furious, and he grabbed the smallest guy and threatened to punch him. The few of us stood around him (I was one of the tallest guys there) and dared him to try, and in the end he stomped out of the class. 
After 9 months of training, the rosewood company offered a coffee table making job at $5-8/hour at 10 hours a day, but we had to purchase our own tools. That wasn't very attractive at that point in time, so I decided to stay in school and applied to the interior design course with my course-mate, who was also my neighbour. However, after the smoking incident, the rosewood furniture teacher was transferred to the interior design course. He rejected our applications. My neighbour went to speak to the principal, so he ended up joining the course, but I didn't. The interior design industry was booming after our graduation, and my neighbour became a very wealthy man running his own company. 
That rejection hit hard, but it was also the reason why I took up the pottery course. I picked up my fundamentals from those classes. At that point I didn't think I was going to be a full time potter, but I knew that I really enjoy creating things and seeing my creations come to life. I picked up hand-building (slab work, coiling, pinch, sculpting) and wheel-throwing, and experimented with different forms and glazes. My wife-to-be was a good thrower in my class, and we would both be chosen for commissioned production work whenever there was one. At that very same time period, I was picking up shell-craft from my cousin, and we would go to the beach and skin-dive to pick up shells and corals on our free days. Although my future was uncertain at that point, I was carefree and felt at peace. 




Andrew with his shell-craft art on a local newspaper





As a young man at that time, I did what made my heart sing, and got involved in whatever I was interested in, even though at that point I was not sure what I could do for the rest of my life. The pleasant surprises when the glazes turned out pretty after every firing, the countless hours practicing on the wheels, the heartbreaking failures whenever I made mistakes - all turned out to be wonderful memories and they prepared me for the years to come. 




Andrew featured in a local news article





After I graduated from Baharuddin Vocational Institute in 1972, I was conscripted into the army for National Service (NS). Back then, NS was not as structured as it is today because it was quite new. One of the sergeants was my former schoolmate, and he saw that I had design background, so he recommended me to the commanding officer to help out with the interior design of some offices in the camp. In those days when the defence force was just starting out, the conscripts served in different ways, with their talents and skills to improve the standard of our armed forces and the conditions that we train in. My basic military training was pretty unique. I got to skip some military training, except for certain key activities like live firing and physical training sessions, to help out with the interior design and decoration of the camps. Once the basic military training ended, I got posted to the signal school to become a signaller. 
When I got posted to the unit, coincidentally, the clerk there was my former volleyball teammate back in school. He was also the son of the founder of Cathay Photo. Back in school, he was the setter and I was the spiker. He was elated to see me, and told me that I could represent the unit for volleyball competitions. I trained day and night. The finals for the armed forces volleyball competition coincided with the final exam for the signaller course. In the end, I got exempted from the exam and my unit won the 2nd place for the volleyball competition. Our superiors were proud of us and gave us two weeks' off from training. 




Andrew during his army days





After completing the signal course, I was posted to a new signal battalion. There were only 20 odd of us when we got posted there because it was newly set up. The camp was empty, so we had a lot of work to do to build the battalion up from scratch. They saw that I was a sportsman, and since there wasn't enough manpower, I had to represent the battalion in most of the sports like volleyball, swimming and sepak takraw (similar gameplay to volleyball but only with your feet), even though I had no experience. I also got the chance to join the Small Arms Meet (shooting competition among different military units), and I think that was the highlight of my NS journey. I got to practise at the shooting range daily, and sometimes the gun barrel would go red-hot. It was fun, but it was not easy; we had a lot of physical training to ensure that we had the physical strength to stabilise ourselves when we fire. We did pretty well for the battalion in the meet. Looking back, my national service experience was pretty fun and interesting, and I completed my national service obligations in 1974. 
The market then was saturated with interior designers and carpenters, and there I was again, lost as I stared at the blank canvas of my uncertain future..."" (to be continued)


About the Project
The Whistling Shophouses series pays tribute to the rapid development of Singapore from a third world country to a thriving metropolis. Andrew lived through the period where shophouses were ubiquitous throughout the country, to modern times when skyscrapers and housing estates stand where they once stood. These shophouse whistles signify a remembrance of an era past glory. Singapore shophouses are icons that reflect our history and heritage.

About the Potter









Andrew will be handcrafting every single whistle. Andrew Chua is a Singaporean ceramic artist who began practising ceramic arts in 1970s. Since graduation in 1972, Andrew has exhibited his works in numerous art exhibitions both locally and abroad, and had been commissioned to produce ceramic wares for a Kobe restaurant in Singapore.
Originally trained in ceramics at the Baharuddin Vocational Institute, Andrew gradually broadened his expression in clay from the traditional pots and containers to non-functional objects in which the human form features prominently. Andrew finds sculpture more challenging, and it gives him more scope to express himself, in particular with the many different cultural elements in Singapore.
Since 1992, Andrew began making wind instruments and whistles, ranging from adaptations of primitive South American ocarina and Chinese xun, to unique contemporary creations of his own. His more recent creations include meticulously-crafted pendant clay whistles to owl ocarinas. At a time where online tutorials were not available, Andrew's successes with ceramic whistles, ocarinas and other instruments stemmed from his multiple failures and his determination to get it right. Support him by backing this campaign!
Covid-19 hit the artists hard, especially the older ones who are not as tech savvy. Share this campaign with your friends and families to show your support! Thank you!


Budget
The funds from the backers will be used for the clay, glaze and studio firing costs, as well as the material costs for packaging your items :)","Shipping and delivery might break the pieces. Precautions will be taken to make sure these ceramic instruments reach your hands in one piece, such as bubble wrapping and cushioning them in the package.

Let us know if they are broken and we will solve the problems together.

With a foreword by renowned artist sakimichan and light-hearted conversations, photos and quotes by friends such as Blizzard girl gamer Tradechat, gamer Gustavo and cosplayer YingTze, this is the art book that's not to be missed!Kickstarter LIVE Video:






 







This is an art book that brings you on Rachta's 2016 artist journey. While the focus is on her experiences, it also includes her fan-favorite illustrations done that year. Rachta shares the decisions behind each featured piece and includes, never seen before, behind-the-scenes discussions and conversations. We hope that Rachta's experiences help to inspire and guide aspiring artists to pursue this career full time while sharing some of the thought processes behind each of her astounding art pieces.The 50 page (approx.) book is exceptionally and lavishly illustrated and designed in full-color. A lot of work and attention has gone into each art piece and in collecting the thoughts and memories of the unforgettable experiences.We are extremely grateful and honored to have sakimichan write the foreword for Rachta's first book. Sakimichan is an outstanding artist of our time and serves as an inspiration for all artists. Her illustrations are truly outstanding and a work of art.This book kickstarts Rachta's yearly series where she chrono-logs her annual experiences of her artist journey.







 







 








 Rachta's fascination with manga and animation got her bit by the geek culture bug early. Since leaving her corporate life behind, this artist, with her traditional & digital art, has been traveling around the world, attending events and meeting fans – proving that the ability to create is within all of us.

We have confirmed convention attendance for Doujin Market, FanimeCon and Anime Expo this year. You may choose to collect your rewards (tiers that include art books only) at Rachta’s booth in these conventions. The self-collection rates are much friendlier (as compared to shipping) and already include Kickstarter’s fees and packaging materials. The difference in shipping rates will be refunded when you collect the rewards at the events. Rates and event information are listed in the ‘New & Improved Shipping Rates’ table in the following section. What you will need to collect your rewards at the booth:
Photo ID (Driver’s License, Passport, National ID etc)
Proof of Kickstarter Backing (Screenshot of Kickstarter Backing, Backer’s Email etc)
Note: The rewards will be mailed to you should you miss self-collection at the event. 








We understand the perils of expensive shipping & handling. Thus, product specifications were designed with this in mind, while minimizing the impact to quality. All of Rachta's artist prints are done on high quality and thick 250gsm white card and postcards on 330gsm white cards. The ARTIST JOURNEY OF 2016, RACHTA LIN art book also bears the same detailed thought process behind each product design and will feature similar high-quality materials. Having learned from over ten years of logistic experiences, our shipping & handling is efficient – artist prints are shipped rolled in a postage tube, postcards in a padded envelope etc. All Supporter Rewards are shipped from Singapore via registered mail with tracking.Update: We managed to work with our logistics provider for more efficient shipping to get the rewards into your hands! This means that: 
Most of the rewards are updated with the new & improved shipping rates. Rewards currently pledged (by existing backers) cannot be edited and still show the old rates. However, do not worry as we will refund the difference after the Kickstarter completes. 
If you backed a reward tier before the shipping rate change, you will be refunded the difference after the Kickstarter completes.
The new improved shipping charges are updated in the table below.
Both the original and new shipping charges are shown below for your comparison.

 ALL-WEATHER PROTECTIONThe innovative use of a triple layered flysheet makes the weatherHYDE extremely suitable for extreme weather conditions. The reflective layer traps a family's body to heat for warmth, and reflects solar heat for summers.WOMEN-FRIENDLYOur triple layer skin blocks light and doesn't cast embarrassing shadows. The fully enclosed weatherHYDE provides privacy and a safe haven for women, their children and families. URBAN DEPLOYMENT FRIENDLYThe sturdy design allows weatherHYDE to be deployed in tough conditions. We added weight to the frame to eliminate the need for anchoring. Reflective details and bright colors increase urban visibility and night safety.EMPOWERING TO THE HOMELESS THROUGH LOCAL MANUFACTURINGThe simplicity in its manufacturing makes local production possible, creating enterprise and job opportunities for the homeless to help pull them out of their homeless state.







In 2016, billionBricks launched weatherHYDE's first pilot test in Delhi, India, giving homeless individuals like 23-year-old Khushi their first homes.







  







 









 









There are more than 33 million homeless all over the world who have no protection from life-threatening extreme weather conditions. With many unable to survive the harsh winters or summers, the rate of death in certain environments can be as high as 120 persons per hour.Affecting developed and developing nations alike, it impacts millions of homeless who are the most vulnerable to illnesses and diseases caused by exposure to extreme weather. 







 









In 2013, almost 9,000 families were rendered homeless by communal riots in the North Indian town of Muzaffarnagar. In this community alone, more than 30 children died when the night temperatures fell to near freezing. Link to story.







After this incident, billionBricks innovated an emergency tent to protect homeless families from the harsh weather conditions, which the they endure and fight while living on the streets.







 









YOU CAN HELP A HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILYYour pledge can send a WeatherHYDE tent to homeless families in India, or to disaster-displaced families across Asia Pacific.You also have the option of purchasing a WeatherHYDE for someone whom you know is homeless and in need. This option is available for limited countries.GET A WEATHERHYDE OF YOUR OWNBy purchasing one for your own personal use, you would be able to help by allowing us to send more tents to the homeless. Since we do not profit from those purchased for the homeless, we've created a separate package at a higher cost for private use. BUY ONE AND GIVE ONEHelp us reach our funding goal buy buying one for yourself and gifting one to a homeless family in need.







We are shipping WeatherHYDE to the United States, India and Singapore. 







We are committed to be fully transparent  and to keep you informed, especially with details such as where your donated tent will be deployed, details on family beneficiaries - their background and feedback on weatherHYDE use - and ways by which the product is making an impact in their lives.

We are Hello Run and we are working on this new startup to provide you with virtual sports events. With the current COVID-19 pandemic going on, we are unable to join race events like how we used to with the joy of completing a distance and receiving a token of effort. Perhaps regardless, you did not have the time to commit to train and attend race events.


Here we are with a solution where you can run/walk/jog when you can. You may even use a treadmill! Our aim is to get people moving any time, anywhere, any way at their own pace and preferences. Upon reaching the goal, submit screenshots of your runs/walks/jogs data and simply wait for your hard earned medal to arrive in your mailbox!


People like being recognised and awarded for their efforts and contribution and we hear you. We want to make runs/walks/jogs rewarding intrinsically when you feel stronger and better about yourselves and extrinsically with medal collection to appraise your effort. And even better! These medals that you earned can be personally engraved with your name too. Who doesn’t like customised items, right? Be recognised and valued for your accomplishments!


To bring across this opportunity and experience, we will need your help and encouragement. From designing, manufacturing to setting up this whole project, we require financial support to execute Hello Run successfully.


What We Need & What You Get

















Visit bottom of page for bigger image size.
(Actual product may differ slightly due to colour and placement of digital copy)


For our first series, we have decided on the 12 Chinese Zodiac animals. We worked with an experienced designer to bring you fashionable medal designs that you can not only collect to show your achievement, but also you can add it as an accessory to your outfits.


Hence this is where we need your support. We have created a few tiers that you can choose from:
1 - Donation - any amount
2 - Any 1 Zodiac @ Early Bird $17, Pre-launch $18, Original $19.90 each
3 - Any 1 Zodiac with Shirt @ Early Bird $31, Pre-launch $33, Original $36.80 each
4 - 12 Zodiac Set + Special Box Packaging @ Early Bird $191, Pre-launch $203, Original $238.80
5 - 12 Zodiac Set + Special Box Packaging with Shirt and free engraving @ Early Bird $205, Pre-launch $217, Original $255.70


Special Limited Shirt includes 1x 12 Zodiac dry fit T-shirt. You may choose the design that you want (we will contact you). See bottom of page for more designs.







  (Actual product may differ slightly due to colour and placement of digital copy)


Currently we are working on the Chinese Zodiac series and it will be released each month corresponding to the order, ie. Rat in January 2021, Ox in February 2021 and so on. Participants may choose to pre-order but the real event will only start in the corresponding months.


However for you, as our early supporter, we will process all orders and ship your medals and merch in approx Feb/March 2021, or earlier. You do not have to wait for the corresponding months to receive your items! We do not expect you to run/walk/jog but you still can if you wish to~


This is how it will work when we officially launch in 2021:

  Visit our website and select the medal you want
  Sign up by making payment
  Finish the race within 15 days, or otherwise stated
  Record your runs/walks/jogs with any mobile app
  Submit your data to our email with screenshots showing the distance and dates (must be within 15 days from date of purchase or else not counted!)
  We will then take 3-5 business working days to check verify and send you a confirmation email before shipping out your medal
  Wait for your well-deserved medal to reach your mailbox!

Pig","Costs: Based on our initial calculations and the current Chinese Zodiac designs, we will require at least a sum of SGD 7,500 but with more funding, we will be able to provide more stocks and medal designs in the future. In order to make the medals, we will need to create molds and then the medal itself. This comes to around SGD 3,000 for the molds and test quantity of each design. Incorporation and setting up the website itself comes to over SGD 2,000. Another SGD 1,500 or so will be needed to cover the machinery and designs, thus reaching the minimum sum required. The remaining SGD 1,000 of the goal will go to this platform.

Design: Getting the right design that can appeal to people. We understand that design is something that is personal. Something that appeals to us may not be appealing to certain groups of people. Hence we hope to come up with ideas and concepts that can attract as many people as possible.

Timeline: As we are aiming to launch everything by 2021 in time for January’s Rat medal, we are working tight to make sure we have all the necessary tools and platforms to execute this. Then we will have other festivals, holidays and events to prepare for as well.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 18 or more\n\nAbout US$ 13\n\n\n\nAny 1 Zodiac (Pre-launch)\n\n\nYou may choose any 1 zodiac of your choice from the 12 available.\n\nSpecial Early Bird price @ $17 (Until 9 Dec 2020)\n\nPre-launch price @ $18 (10 - 22 Dec 2020)\n\nOriginal price @ $19.90\n\nWe will contact you regarding your choice of zodiac medal and free name engraving.\nIncludes:\n\n\nAny 1 Zodiac\n\n\nFree engraving\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 33 or more\n\nAbout US$ 24\n\n\n\n1 Zodiac + Shirt (Pre-launch)\n\n\nYou may choose any 1 zodiac of your choice from the 12 available and 1 shirt design.\n\nEarly Bird @ $31 (Until 9 Dec 2020)\n\nPre-launch @ $33 (10 - 22 Dec 2020)\n\nOriginal @ $36.80\n\nWe will contact you regarding your choice of zodiac medal, t shirt size, design and free name engraving.\nIncludes:\n\n\nAny 1 Zodiac\n\n\nAny 1 Shirt\n\n\nFree engraving\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 203 or more\n\nAbout US$ 146\n\n\n\n12 Zodiac Set (Pre-launch)\n\n\nYou will receive all 12 medal designs packaged in a special box to show off your collection. \n\nSpecial Early Bird price @ $191 (Until 9 Dec 2020)\n\nPre-launch price @ $203 (10 - 22 Dec 2020)\n\nOriginal price @ $238.80\n\nWe will contact you regarding your text for name engraving.\nIncludes:\n\n\n12 Zodiac Set\n\n\nSpecial Box Packaging\n\n\nFree engraving\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMar 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd-ons""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 217 or more\n\nAbout US$ 156\n\n\n\n12 Zodiac Set + Shirt (Pre-launch)\n\n\nReceive all 12 medals packaged in a special box to show off your collection. \n\nFree engraving.

Our heartfelt gratitude to all our backers for your strong support of Black Souls! Thanks to you, this game will be MADE! If you have missed this campaign, we can still try to help you in some way or other. Drop us an email at: Sales@MedievaLords.com





FREE MINI-EXPANSION FOR ALL SETS!We are into our final lap now! Whether or not this really fun and unique game becomes a reality depends on the next 24 hours! We have added nice promos for Castle Dukes & Queen of the Hill. We have added cool crossover Black Souls tiles from The Networks Executives. We have added a really nice special boss tile featuring the Castle Dukes dragon as a boss here in Black Souls. We have added very cool extra Scoring Boards to the game for all 6 players. We have made an awesome AI for Solo Mode. We are adding 1 extra die to the game for Solo Mode too. Still we are short by that really small amount! To push things further, we are now throwing in something MORE again! We will produce the mini-expansion and include it into all your sets for no additional cost - yes, FREE!







SOLO MODE AI:Dominic has made a Solo Mode video to show how the AI works! Here is the video: (The video uses the prototype we have, which is still using non-colorblind friendly components and not yet implemented with inclusivity - the final product WILL be otherwise.)


Enjoy!Designer Inc's latest video game title Black Souls has achieved international success! Hailed as one of the toughest digital games ever, it has attracted millions of hardcore gamers. The secret behind this huge success lies not in just making an extremely difficult game. Anyone can do that. The true challenge lies in balancing it to be as difficult as possible, but still fair enough that the very best players can survive to the end. Alas, the game studio is heavily short staffed and the management is looking to hire one more Game Designer for developing more content in Black Souls.







You have been given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be hired by Designer Inc as a level designer, an integral part of Black Souls' development team! As one of the finalist candidates, you must prove your designing skills under the judging eyes of your future employers in an 'Early Beta Access' trial to create a level that best reflects the spirit of Black Souls - a very difficult, yet fair game. A group of professional playtesters will be sent to try out your carefully designed level, and provide feedback on whether they like or dislike it. If the level is too easy, they would not feel challenged at all. If it is too hard, they would all be killed and find it unfair. Who will be the final candidate to be inducted into the ranks of Designer Inc?


As the campaign progresses, more content may be unlocked in addition to the above chart due to Stretch Goals.





 







ALL Kickstarter copies of Black Souls will have every single promo featured above for free. These are on top of any stretch goals unlocked during the campaign itself.






 







In Black Souls, players are candidates vying for the dream job of being a Game Designer on an internationally successful video game. They must design a beta level for the game, balancing difficulty with good matrix. First, they will design their own dungeon crawler levels. Then they will lead a professional team of playtesters through the very levels they just designed. Whether the playtesters like the design or not, depends on how challenging the levels are, as well as if at least one survives the level.

The game is played in 2 phases - Design phase, followed by Gameplay phase. During the Design phase, players will play Bid Cards simultaneously to snatch first pick on their tile of choice from a common pool.







Note that Bid Cards also have special abilities that help the players in some way. It is important to play these abilities at the right time, advancing the players in their strategies.

Once each player has a tile, they immediately place the tile onto their own individual Design Board. Tiles can be placed on any of 3 levels, but must always fill the leftmost space if it is on either level 1 or 3, and must always fill the rightmost space if it is on level 2.







If players' Bid Cards clash, they go last regardless of their numbers played. Also, their powers do not trigger. However, each player has 2 Hacks which allows them to ignore this penalty.







 Once all players have completed their level designs with 12 tiles each, phase 2 occurs and players take on the roles of the professional playtesters sent to test their levels.







On each tile, the party must clear the location by resolving ONE type of hero to die. In the example shown, the party will clear the current tile location by killing just 1 Fighter, or 2 Mages, or 3 Healers. The last value on the tile is the Difficulty rating of the tile and is only used for end-game scoring.

The following are the tiers available for the duration of this Kickstarter campaign. Note that the Retailer Pledge tier is NOT available to the general public. Stringent checks will be made to ensure we protect our retailer partners. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS IN SGD CURRENCY - WHICH IS A LOT LOWER IN VALUE THAN USD!







 







Simply add any of the following items to your pledge rewards by paying the appropriate fees as stated. For example, if you wanted to add a copy of Sweet Spot, just add another $42SGD on top of your pledge tier amount. We will send out a survey at the end of the campaign to check with each individual backer on what their additional money is intended for.







  







We are always looking to work with our retailer partners as much as possible. If you are a retailer, we have specially made a pledge tier just for you! Please check out the ""Retailer Pledge"" tier on the right. Do note that this is strictly for brick and mortar retailers, and we will require proof of business license as well. If you have any further questions regarding retailer support, reach out to us via email at Sales@MedievaLords.com







Black Souls will be charging shipping straight off from the campaign itself. There will be no additional cost after the campaign to watch out for - unless you are getting add-ons of Castle Dukes. Thanks to Quartermaster Logistics, we have managed to get affordable shipping! They do not handle the Asia+Australia regions though, so the rates for these places are not going to change too much. We did have a long internal meeting, and decided we wanted everyone to be happy still. So we will also reduce the shipping by just that tiny little bit through our own pockets for folks in these places.For this relaunch, we also managed to find a way to give great savings on combined shipping, so get a few buddies and pool them together! The minimum for the savings of combined shipping is 3 copies though.Lastly for Singapore only, we have the luxury of having our headquarters here, so we can allow local pick-up at the Battle Bunker retail shop. If you are fine with doing self-collection at Battle Bunker, there is a special tier just for Singaporeans to do so, and this will then bring your shipping down to as low as what the US backers are enjoying - which is about US$9. There is STILL shipping charge, because we are shipping the games in from China, and they are not manufactured locally.







Battle Bunker Productions:







Medieval Lords will officially be working under the banner of Battle Bunker Productions for this game. The same folks from Medieval Lords that you have come to trust over the multiple Kickstarters will all still be on the team, but with more firepower now that we are part of the Battle Bunker family. Medieval Lords has upheld a strong reputation despite its smaller following simply because we do right by our backers, and we have a track record of delivering our previous KS campaigns EARLY! That's something to boast about!







The Game Design Corner:As always, following in the tradition of Medieval Lords, we will share the game matrix of Black Souls for the hardcore players who are interested in looking at the balance of the game.Click HERE to download the game data for Black Souls!","Yes!! Our 7th product! Same high quality, same high standards of game play! The risk section - You have probably read this many times over, but it is our obligation to state this down in black and white in all our projects, so please bear with us~

We will not hesitate to inform all backers and attempt immediate rescue actions should we miss a deadline or see a potential threat to having it delayed.

If you have been an ardent supporter of Medieval Lords, you will know we put maximum respect to all our backers and attempt to go every mile for everyone of you. At a 6 to 7 months timeline, we are already providing a very, very short production timeline compared to more than half of other Kickstarter tabletop games out there. On top of that, we have been delivering EARLY across all our previous Kickstarters :)","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nStay tuned to updates and follow the progress of Black Souls throughout the campaign.

Meet LUMISTRAW | Instant Water Purification is now Simple as a Sip - and it's magically filterless









LUMISTRAW uses state of the art purify-as-you-drink technology to give you instantly clean water, all with the convenience of a reusable straw.
Instead of waiting for your water to boil, going through the hassle of changing filters, using water purifying tablets or dealing with outdated disinfection technology, LUMISTRAW taps on Champs Industrial’s LUMIFLO Technology (patent-pending), enabling you to quench your thirst and drink clean water wherever you want it, whenever you want it.









Water purification is long in need of an update. 
We at Champs Industrial have been designing consumer household water products for more than 20 years. In our years in the business, we have understood that water is the essence of life, yet getting clean water is riddled with inconveniences.
With current systems, we are constantly troubled with paying monthly subscriptions of time, effort and memory for the maintenance of our filter systems. 









Even with the latest light-based purification bottles, we are made to wait 60 seconds before we can even consider drinking.  









The Big Realisation
This is when we realised, 
Why should we purify large vessels of water just to wait endlessly for a sip of clean water? 









What if you could purify only what you want to drink as you’re drinking it?

















LUMISTRAW uses state of the art purify-as-you-drink technology to give you instantly clean water, all with the convenience of a reusable straw.
 LUMISTRAW Features 









Instantly Purified Water
Utilising our patent-pending purify-as-you-drink technology, LUMISTRAW reinvents the way we use UV-C to bring down the time you wait for your water to virtually nothing.
Effortless Purification 









Just press and drink. No opening of bottles, no waiting, no nothing, just drink.
Replace Nothing, Ever Again









Never replace another filter, bottle or anything ever again. Just press and drink.
Purify Without Limits 









Based off medical grade UV-C Technology, LUMISTRAW allows you to purify water endlessly, and we mean ENDLESSLY.
Drink Anytime, Anywhere 









LUMISTRAW is made to be portable to carry along wherever you may go, making clean drinking water a convenience you never knew you missed.
Drink the Way You Like It









Drink from a cup, a bottle, a pool (ok maybe not the pool), whatever you like. LUMISTRAW isn't limited by a vessel.  


Anti-Spill. Anti-Leak. Anti-Worry









With the inclusion of a one way valve, never worry about water messing with your life.

With a good timeline ahead with sufficient buffer, we are confident to deliver a quality product on time.

We do share the same risk that all kickstarter projects share when going into large scale manufacturing. There will be some fine edits so that we can create a more easily reproducible product.

Kassini Zero-proof Genever is a graduate project of Kanishka Tripathi, an International Fashion Business student of Coventry University (UK) at Raffles College of Higher Education, Singapore.
Being a gin enthusiast for as long as I have been legal, my passion for creating a non-alcoholic variation stems from my own taste for botanicals, without having to go through the health deterring effects of alcohol.


KEY FEATURES

  A sustainable non-alcoholic gin distilled using renewable/ solar energy
  Crafted in a micro-distillery in Singapore with artisanal and traceable botanicals sourced from all around the world
  A glittered refreshing drink made from juniper berries, cardamom pods, coriander seeds, lemongrass and citrus bitters (lemon and orange)
  A healthy drink for any time of the day
  Product specifications: 800ml
  Each bottle comes with a crystal charm that can be used as a pendant




































CAMPAIGN STORY









In light of COVID-19, people have resorted to various wellness and pseudoscientific methods of healing and maintaining health. Particularly Gen-Z and millennials are emphasising on having “clean fun” by adopting no and low alcoholic beverages in social situations.
Kassini is an alcohol-free alternative to traditional gin— a revolution in the beverage industry.
Developed and manufactured in Singapore, Kassini makes drinking healthy!


What We Need
I am looking for contributors who believe in the potential of this product and the methods adopted to manufacture Kassini, complied with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3, 7 and 12:









The first funding needed in order to put the plan into action is $1000. With these funds, I will progress with product sampling and allocate a portion of resources on product development as needed.
Being a sustainable and environmentally-responsible brand, Kassini will also need to buy machinery and equipments such as copper-pot distillation kits and solar panels.


The Impact
As many of us make a switch to healthier lifestyle alternatives, we believe you shouldn't have to compromise on what brings you most joy-- satiating your taste buds.
Kassini is an excellent alternative to anybody who must abstain from alcohol for any reason.









Any and all help that you can provide will help us climb an additional step on the ladder of success. We want to give you a product that you truly believe in, a product that you trust has potential.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you trust the potential of Kassini and want to support without making any contributions, there is still so much you can do!

  Please share the idea and campaign forward across social media platforms or simply Indiegogo share tools! Remember, even the smallest stone makes a ripple!","Launching a sustainable business, particularly in the FMCG industry is a challenge in itself.

 What are Hard Enamel Pins & Acrylic Charms?
Hard enamel pins (lapel pins/brooch) are decorative art that can be worn or otherwise displayed. They have raised metal lines forming the 'line art' and the recessed sections between the lines are filled with colourful hard enamel. The piece is then polished smoothly so it can be at the same level as the metal lines.
Acrylic charms are made with a solid, clear acrylic material that can be printed in full color and cut to any shape.



Past Campaign Pins








Past Campaign Acrylic Charms













 Due to popular demand, you can add past campaigns' pins and stickers as add-ons.









How do we know which design you would like?
At the end of the campaign period, we will send you a survey form for you to indicate the design you would like. You will be able to indicate which pins, charms, stickers or add-ons you desire.










   22 Jan - Kickstarter campaign starts and runs for 14 days.
   04 Feb - Campaign ends. Backer surveys are sent out afterward to your email (to indicate your choice of pins, charms, stickers, and add-ons).
   18 Feb - We receive the fund pledge from Kickstarter. (2 weeks after the campaign ends). Production begins.
   Mar/Apr - Pins, charms, and stickers expected to reach me - I will proceed with quality checks and grading.

I really thank all of you for making this dream come through! This project could never become a reality without your support! I would be honored if you share the project with your family and friends!
~ Love, Dinojar | Instagram","REWARDS
The final pins may vary slightly from the designs shown here. Every single pin is handmade, there is expected to be minor defects or flaws. Standard grade pins will be used to fulfill pledges and these pins may have minor defects that are only visible under extremely close inspection. Pins with more noticeable flaws are lower grade and will NOT be used to fulfill pledges. The actual color or size of the pins may differ a little from the descriptions, but I'm confident that any differences will be minimal. I am working closely with an established manufacturer, to ensure smooth fulfillment of all the orders.

TIMELINE
Delays in shipping and production of pins may occur when creating enamel pins. This may happen because of production errors and manufacturing defects. If there are any delays, all backers will be immediately updated!

FULFILLMENT
I will update here on Kickstarter and Instagram so that backers have an idea when their rewards will be shipped out (you can change the shipping details if needed up until then). Please double check your address to reduce the chance of a package being lost! Once a package is mailed, it is out of my control but I will do my best to assist and accommodate for any lost packages for TRACKED shipment. We always encourage you to upgrade by adding TRACKING to the shipping with a small fee for peace of mind.

ADDITIONAL FEES
Backers outside of the SG are responsible for any and all customs fees, import taxes, VAT, GST, or other additional costs associated with importing goods into their country, and those costs are NOT included in their pledge or shipping cost.

REFUNDS & CANCELLATIONS

There's always a risk that suppliers do not fulfill orders on time during manufacturing due to the complexity of the production. However we are working very closely with our manufacturer, who has decades of experience, to make sure production goes smoothly. We even plan to deliver before the expected dates if possible.

About the Shipping
Due to the current global COVID-19 issue changing everyday, production and delivery dates could be subject to change though our factory has assured us that their production line and schedules have not been affected. We will make sure to keep everything transparent and ensure every backer is updated on a regular basis on the progress of production and shipping.

And there are shipping restrictions countries by Covid-19 issue. We hope this issue ends until our shipping date. We will try to ship reward as soon as this issue over for these countries. 

*If there are any delays or roadblocks down the road, we assure you transparent and regular updates.

About shipping fee
Currently due to the COVID issue, there’s a limitation for courier and flights for shipping, therefore, the high hike for shipping cost. So we have decided using regular mail due to decreasing much the shipping cost.

We will hold shipping until regular mailing service available again after COVID-19 situation of the courier lightens up. Please note that delivery may be delayed or may proceed as originally on September. We will also try to find third party courier and shipping services. Let's pray hard until situation better. 

We hope you to understand.

If we could see it, what would it be like at a temperature of 6,800℃ there? Will there be scalding lava? Radioactive substances? Or high energy manganese crystals? What will be hidden in that highly compressed space?









The processing technology of this set of dice is very complicated, and it takes four surface treatments to achieve the current effect. For the first layer, the internal metal is demolded before the surface polishing. For the second layer, the anodizing process is applied on the surface to add the background color of the dice. For the third layer, glue is applied onto the numbers and edges, and the dice is rolled through the glitter material. Finally, the cured layer is sprayed onto the entire surface to prevent the glitter material from falling off. The last two steps are all done manually. It is with this difficult processing that the beautiful design is produced.

















There are three series of dice.

  Radiant Light: The glitter part is formed by glitter chips of three colors including golden yellow, brownish read and dark green.











  Treasure Light: The glitter part is formed by glitter chips of three colors including purple, ocean blue and light green.











  High-energy Manganese Crystal: The glitter part is composed of peacock green glitter chips, and the edges are made colorful through high temperature process.（Have unlocked）

 WHY SPACE and WHY PUPPIES?
E V E R Y O N E is talking about space!
Elon Musk recently said “… I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars”. He’s kinda right, though, I mean if you can why wouldn’t you? So for all of us who can’t go to space until we make our billions, why not play a card game that takes you there for 15-20 mins? That’s longer than Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson spent in space in their super cool aircrafts.
And we get to do it with Space Puppies!
So let's get right into it!
Space Puppies is a fun family card game that depicts the adventures of astrodogs who serve in the space-borne peace-keeping armada of the Su-paw Star Enterprise. They're tasked to bring the planets back to their orbit, time and time again to restore peace and balance in the universe.
Paws for dramatic effect.
That’s right! Space Puppies, together with your help, will go where no dog has gone before.









Your job is to collect 3 packs of unique dogs who will save individual planets. A complete pack of dogs will earn you a planet. If playing a points version of the game, collect enough planets to make 40 points.




designs not final





 Use ACTION CARDS to help you sabotage your opponent or boost your mission.




designs not final





But, watch out, it could all backfire and the course of the game can change if the opponent uses their protection cards. So use them wisely and plan your strategy!




designs not final





There are 12 unique action cards that will keep you and your kids on your toes throughout the 20 minute game. And then you start all over again, a new adventure to save those planets!
A game of strategy and mischief, designed to bring the family together on a cosy night in or test the strength of relationships over Christmas! 


















  Quick to learn, thanks to simple, elegant rules system and clear instruction sheet
  Surprising depth and replay value once you get the hang of it.
  What’s not to love about Dogs and Space!

Set Up
Place all planets, face up, in the middle.
Dealer deals 5 cards to all players. Don’t show your cards to anyone. Rest of pile becomes the draw pile, keeping space for the discard pile next to it. Person with the loudest bark starts.
On your turn
Play up to two cards at a time. That could mean, start placing dog cards in front of you or play action cards.
Action cards all have a description on them. Play Action cards by placing them in the Discard pile and following the instructions on the card.
When you complete a dog set, pick up a planet that is named on the dog card. If your first choice isn’t available, pick the next one.
In the points version of Space Puppies, player needs to achieve 40 points. Each planet carries a point value. Note, there is an alien card that wins you 5 points. Keep that up your sleeve in the points version!
Who wants to play?

It's a kit with instructions to help improve your life by training your mindset. 







To kickstart your whole journey towards a better you, the Kofuku Starter Pack will guide you through it. The Starter Pack consists of a monthly Gratitude Journal, a Face Your Fears Journal, A Better You Journal and a Self Care List. So what are these about?01. Be Grateful







 Write down at least one thing in the journal that made you smile or happy today. What are you thankful for today? Train your mind to always look for the positive things in life first! This is an everyday activity!02. Face Your Fears







 Use this book to guide you through your fears. Figure out why you’re afraid and fill in the charts. You will see that maybe there’s nothing to be afraid of!03. A Better You







 This is a book for your strengths. No weaknesses should be mention in it. Set realistic goals and celebrate them. Before the start of each day, write down three compliments to yourself and the goals of the day. It can be anything even if it’s small. If you find your confidence dropping slightly, write down why then read what you wrote in the morning. You are an awesome you!Because the quality dropped, the activities here are:
3 Compliments of the day to yourself (AM)
Goals of the day (AM)
Did your confidence level drop? If yes, why? Then read the compliments to yourself again. (PM)And if you want to go one step further:04. Let It Go















It’s not a daily journal. We all have things that still bother us no matter how long it’s been. It’s time to let them go. Write them down and the reasons why they affect you so much. Let go of your anger, sadness, and frustrations out in the book. Curse as much as you want. And when you close the book, let it go.Because letting go is another way of loving yourself.A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME.Hello, my name is Noeleen and I am basically everything behind The Kofuku Kit. It all started when I reached a certain down period when I first started my own brand; it was never planned to be this. So I’ve lost a lot of confidence and got a little negative. That feeling was something that I really hate which was why I started reading up on how to train myself to be positive and these are the ways I’ve come up with for now. First, we need to be grateful, even for the simplest thing. 
Second, let go of your fears, trust yourself. Since most of the time, the fears come from the negative thoughts of your brain. 
Third, forgive others to let go of your pain. I’ve tried all methods on my own. It’s not magic, it won’t work immediately just because you did it for a day. I’ve been writing in my monthly gratitude journal for about four months and it helps. That was when I started changing the direction of the plan of my own brand. And I hope that what I’m doing will be of help to all of you.","This is the start of my journey to be of help to the society. However, I know it’s not going to be easy to start a project like this, especially without the help I need. Here are some of my biggest worries.

ONE – Production
Everything is handmade from the scratch, from the covers to the inserts and to the books, because of the small capital I have. However, my plan is to have the covers produced with sturdy leather material so that the users will have a better experience using the kit.

TWO – Marketing
It took me a while to finally decide to start a project on Kickstarter because of the risks. The thing about Kickstarter is that if the funding didn’t reach its target, everything goes back to Zero. It’s not easy to really get the words out. So, it would be really helpful if you spread the words to your friends; who knows this kit might actually be what they need.   

THREE – Disappointment
I’ve had some experiences with contacting suppliers and sometimes, things go wrong and the delivery date/production quality might be affected. However, to really thank you for the support, I will try my best to foresee everything so you get your well-deserved reward.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout $4\n\n\n\nThank You For Your Support!\n\n\nThank You Card\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nSep 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 15 or more\n\nAbout $11\n\n\n\nYou're Awesome!\n\n\nThank You Card + A Gratitude Journal\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nNov 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 30 or more\n\nAbout $22\n\n\n\nDouble It Up\n\n\nThank You Card + 1 Starter Pack\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout $36\n\n\n\nSharing Is Love\n\n\nThank You Card + One Kofuku Kit\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 100 or more\n\nAbout $72\n\n\n\nYou're a Great Help to Society!\n\n\nThank You Card + 3 Kofuku Kits\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2018\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""}]",0.0,0

“ They don’t make things the way they used to anymore!” That was what my Dad used to say all the time. And it became evident what he was saying is true when I was looking to buy my third backpack in 2 years. It suddenly dawned on me that we were buying into the idea that things were not supposed to last and that fast fashion was the norm. That was when we decided to start Astray Goods Co. We wanted to create a brand that takes pride in how things were made. Where every piece was crafted individually by hand, slowly, deliberately, honestly.




Astray Rolltop Backpack in Mustard / Vachetta





The Rolltop Backpack
The Rolltop Backpack is our first product at Astray Goods Co. Sticking to our brand promise, the Rolltop Backpack is built to last a long time and we have spared no effort in making sure of this. This is achieved through the use of time tested materials and processes.

Built To Last
Right from the beginning, it was very clear that the main feature of our bags will be their built quality. We work with Craftsmen who have years of experience in bag making to create each bag by hand with features that enable them to stand the rigours of daily use.

To make sure the bags will stand up to our promise, we sent it for Load Testing. On our pull test, our bags load strength per strap is in excess of 100 kg (220 lb).
Warranty
Lifetime Warranty: Our vision when creating Astray Goods Co. is to create carry goods that last a lifetime, and we are starting with the Rolltop Backpack. Like all goods produced by Astray Goods Co. going forward, the Rolltop Backpack will be backed by a lifetime warranty against all manufacturing defect. If something breaks, send it back and we will repair it for you. If it is something we can't repair, we will replace a new one for you.

The Rolltop Backpack is crafted out of 16oz Waxed Canvas. We use Bees Wax to wax our canvas as it is more environmentally friendly and provides better color protection and fastness for the fabric. The waxed canvas provides a weather resistant outer to protect your belongings.

While the centre bar buckle is the traditional way to fasten a strap, it can be too cumbersome and slow. We found the solution in the Conway buckle which provides the secure fastening of a traditional buckle with quick unbuckling. 



Conway Buckle for Fast Unbuckling





Hidden at the back of the backpack is a quick access zipper to reach the main compartment of the bag.

The interior of the Rolltop Backpack is lined with 8oz Twill canvas. A padded compartment holds laptops up to 15"" in size.

Things to Note:
The Rolltop backpack is created using natural materials such as waxed cotton canvas and natural leathers. As such, each and every piece will be unique. When new, the bag will be stiff due to the wax content within the fabric. With use, white lines will appear on the waxed canvas and over time the fabric will soften after breaking in. The Vachetta leather used the bags will darken and create a patina over time.

But there is not one game that has made be hook for years except Runescape Classic. Which was known as Runescape in 2007. This was a game that I enjoyed so much just fighting rats in the sewers to make my character strong to fight in the Wilderness. The satisfaction feeling when you annihilate someone and plunder their items makes me want to pvp even more. The fun had never stop for me. Until.........The game had undergo big updates and become more 3-dish. Combat system has been changed. And ever since that day, I had never found a game as satisfying as Runescape Classic.It is the time to revive the 3 round combat system.. With many more weapons, equipment, updates and NPCs.As you know, Game Development cost a bomb to make. Therefore, I find that Kickstarter is the only way, a fantastic game can be made by You! With your help, I am confident that we can make game for old timers and for generations to come.We are inspired to make a game that has the same combat mechanics as Runescape classic. Where it is a 3 round battle system. The gameplay will be very similar and will make tweaks here and there to improve it.GamePlay:-MMORPG-Character Progression System-3 rounds combat system ( will be able to run after the third round)-Multiplayer with PVPVE elementsStory Plot:Lucifer was second most power being in the Heavenly Realms next to God. However, he was very envious that the human race worship God and God only. At this, he started to think to himself 'Why cant I be worship for being the most powerful angel in the Heavens?' He was filled with anger and pride that God banished him to the deepest depths of Hell to be punished at the appointed time.Knowing that God loves the Human race so much, Lucifer created 7 Deadly creatures to go into Earth to take as many lives to Hell so that they will not be with God. They were named after the sins that God hates the most. The names were Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy and Pride. They caused so much destruction to Earth that Lucifer was called Satan, 'The enemy of God'.At this, God was in great sadness for the lost of human beings for thousands of years. He decide to send his one and only trusted Messenger to Earth, on a quest to destroy the 7 Deadly Minions and Satan for the final battle. The Battle for Good Against Evil.We are still in the midst of discussing on what we can add to the game to make it more enjoyable. Let's make the game a epic blast this year 2017.","Risk: The cost of the game is mainly coming from my own pocket.

Contraband Insider is a deduction board game:

  For 3 to 5 players
  45 to 90 minutes to play (inclusive of the time for setup and learning the game)

The game is played over 3 rounds, which each round will determine points that add up to the final score. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins the game.

















































































 In summary, these are the phases for each round of the game:




























We tried our best to design and produce Contraband Insider as a fun and engaging board game. There are also additional features and upgrades we would like to introduce with love and support.




















Shipping cost will be confirmed after the campaign ends via the pledge manager. As shipping cost fluctuates from month to month and possibly affected by COVID-19, we can quote a likely accurate amount closer to production.","DELAYS AND MANUFACTURING DEFECT

Given that the product requires mass physical manufacturing and fulfilment, there is a margin of error during production and delivery. Certain parts' colour might be slightly off due to the large scale printing and parts may have slight defects. We pledge to provide replacement parts that defects make the game unplayable at our discretion.

Customs, shipping, clearance, delay in production, and COVID-19 might cause delays in delivery. However, we aim to be as transparent about the process as possible, providing constant updates whenever these incidents take place.


REFUND POLICY

As Contraband Insider is being funded in SGD, refunds will also be made in SGD at our discretion. Usually, this excludes any applicable fees that have already been applied to it. We are not responsible for the changes in the rate of foreign exchange.

The refund will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied through whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter.


TERMS & CONDITIONS

By pledging to Contraband Insider, the backer acknowledges that:
1) The backer has agreed to the risks of delays, manufacturing defect, and terms of our refund policy.
2) All pledges will automatically be confirmed 14 days after the campaign has ended.
3) Shipping will be made to the address that the backer has provided in our Pledge Manager and that the address provided is deliverable by normal methods. (Please note that we are unable to ship to PO Boxes)
4) Upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, the backer has acknowledged that title and risk (such as import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities) will be passed on to the backer as our responsibility is to ship the backer's order as entered into our Pledge Manager.
5) The backers are fully liable for incorrect shipping details and any other incorrect information that would cause the pledge to be delivered to an incorrect location or become lost in transit.
6) The backer will be added to our Kickstarter mailing list. The backer can choose to unsubscribe in the next mail from us if they do not wish to be updated.

If you do not accept these terms, we urge you to wait for the general release instead.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nCrime Watchers\n\n\nAs crime watchers, you will receive digital wallpapers featuring the cops and criminals from the game.

For people new to Kickstarter: You may  pledge  now and change/cancel your pledge anytime later, your cards  would not be  charged until the kickstarter campaign is complete.
Hello! I'm back with another intricate spinner enamel pin that I would love to share with you!
For EU backers: Please head over here on Etsy as I'm unable to process EU pledges directly on Kickstarter!
The timeline for this project has been shortened to 15 days instead of the usual 30; as I wish to release Princess Mononoke before October :D I have another big project upcoming that I would love to share with everyone here! More updates will be released on my instagram.









My launches of previous Ghibli Pins were a great success, and I'm back with more!
People who missed out on previously will also get another chance to grab the previous pins together with Totoro :)


Due to production costs concerns, I will unfortunately have to space  out the pins into separate Kickstarters. I will try to release them in 4  phases, one each for June, July, August and September! Delayed shipping  options will be available for people wishing to collect the whole set. Everything will be shipped by December :)

























Here is a photo of Chihiro's Pin to help visualize what it will look like :) The other pins are still in production and some early samples are due to arrive sometime in late August. I'll take photos when they're ready!

























































I'm Yuu from Tea & Buns and I'm a 3D Artist based in Singapore. I have been actively participating in local  conventions since 2012. 
You can check out my Etsy, Instagram, and Facebook here~!
I do wish to produce more works in line of this pin if this is funded successfully so please do follow me on these platforms if you would like to see more art from me!
Here is a sample of my other products, you can see more on my etsy!









Thank you for your time!","✤ This is my sixth Kickstarter, and I have >6000 successful sales on Etsy and have been actively creating batches of self-funded pins for years. I have a very trustworthy and efficient manufacturer who has never failed to deliver quality pins.

✤ Pin colors might differ slightly than what you see here due to everyone's personalized screen settings.

✤ In the current state of affairs, it is a sad reality that postal services have been badly affected by the pandemic, I will try my best to expedite all orders, but do take note that the postal efficiency is not what it was.

Scribe in Stone is created to provide alternatives to frequently used items, we hope to expand our offering to packaging and other products to replace traditional pulp paper.

Daily commutes are more than just a cheap and reliable way to get from one place to another. The time spent travelling allows people to unwind, relax and reflect as they get to their destination. Be it a long day at work or going somewhere after a tough all-nighter, everyone needs a short yet blissful break.

Straying Away from Traditional Travel Pillows
While traditional travel pillows have developed to be more comfortable every year, style and portability are some key features that are often neglected. After all, travel pillows are quite unpopular in public transports due to their bulky design and hard-to-match look. komfi. aims to change that!









 How to use komfi.
It's simple, really! Hang and keep it on your bag when you are on-the-move, putting the 'travel' in travel pillows. 









Then, flip it up and tighten straps (engaging the pillow!) when you feel like having a short nap on your commutes.









komfi. is also easily detachable so you can set it down on the table and use it as a normal pillow, huggable bolster and wrist/elbow rest!


Say Goodbye to Awkward Moments on Your Trips
Have you ever slept on the shoulder of a total stranger on the train? Well, I certainly did and I still fear those moments. With the ergonomic chin and neck support komfi. provides, not only will you be able to nap in comfort, you don't have to worry about landing yourself in awkward situations anymore!




Use komfi. to take a nap, without the worry of leaning on the person next to you





Rethink how things can be kept, with the EZ strap!
With the EZ strap concept, bringing a travel pillow on-the-go has never been easier. Using the strap is simple. Just set, loop and tighten the straps, and you are good to go! While komfi. works best with laptop backpacks, don't let it stop you from being creative and bringing it around in different bags. The EZ strap has a simple two-way mechanism that allows you to hang on one loop or both!

komfi. on a tote bag





Keep komfi. looking FRESH everyday with stylish, swappable covers
Not feeling a specific colour today? Don't worry! Since komfi. comes in two parts (Pillow and Cover), You can easily swap the current pillow cover, with another!









As for the colours available... It all depends on you! There will be a vote among backers to decide the top three colourways that will be to be sold! 
While there will three available colours at first, a colourway slot may be added for each funding milestone hit, which means more colour choices for everyone to choose from.

Keep up with komfi.!","Risks - 
1. This is my very first Kickstarter project! While I am excited and have prepared all that I could, I am still uncertain of the journey ahead, especially on the topic of business. However, I am dedicated to being honest and earnest in my work, I hope to communicate and work with every backer as we tackle them one by one!

2. A lot of thought, drafts and prototypes have been made to reassure you that the travel pillow is plump, comfortable and of course, as stylish as promised in the video.

Challenges - 
1. I am currently doing this project by myself, which may mean delays and issues keeping up with all my backers. However, there will be regular updates on the progress, shipment and other useful information to keep everybody on track of my progress.

3. I am still an amateur when it comes to fabrics and sewing, but I assure you that proper quality control and checks will be done honestly and to the best of my ability.

4. Lastly, due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, do expect delays in production and shipping. If I do find out about such incidents ahead of time, I will let you all know! Please stay healthy and wash your hands!

However, we have already sourced and established relationship with our printer. The risk or challenge is to ship out the planners as soon as possible within the planned timing once the project is successful. We are aware there are always events outside of our control that could delay shipping. But we will give our best to avoid it.

Another challenge is to ensure we have a quality Startself Planner that is delivered to our Backers as early as possible. We will work very closely with our printer to ensure the quality of the planners. Currently our Printer  is ready to produce the Startself Planner as soon as we give them the green light.

Hi hi, Nice to meet you! My name is Yin Yan and i'm a rookie illustrator, based in Singapore, trying my hand at making my own merchandise. I love drawing cute round animals. A few months ago, I created a tiny enamel pin collection for bubble tea bunnies and I've been loving the process of making pins since!


Campaign
The initial funding goal will cover the production cost of Pin #1, with the other adorable designs unlocking, in order, as stretch goals are reached.
Pin Details:
-Rose Gold Plating
-Hard Enamel
-1.25 inches tall
-Rubber clutch
-Packaged individually in plastic wrap
Backers will be able to select their design(s) of choice from the unlocked designs at the end of the Kickstarter campaign. Since Kickstarter is an ""all-or-nothing"" format it means that if a project doesn't get funded, you will not be charged.
You can increase, decrease or cancel your pledge at any time during this Kickstarter campaign. Pledging helps to unlock designs and fun freebies during the campaign! You can pledge for all the items you want, regardless of their locked/unlocked status.
You will only be charged when the Kickstarter campaign ends. If we don't reach our goal by the end of the campaign date, you will not be charged. It's that simple!
Note: When the campaign ends, you will NOT be able to change your pledge amount.
If you ever have any questions about how this works, or about this campaign in general, feel free to contact me via Instagram direct message @ohpenyo!


Stretch goals
Pin #1 Cosy Raccoon - SGD$650 (Initial campaign goal!)
Pin #2 Chirpy Chicken - SGD$1300
Pin #3 Zen Cat - SGD$1950
Pin #4 Pearlie Pancake - SGD$2600
Pin #5 Artist Cat- SGD$3250

To change your pledge amount, click the ""Manage Your Pledge"" button located at the top of the campaign page, then click the ""Change Your Pledge"" button. Add $10 per pin to the current pledge amount.
(Example: Early bird 3 pins + 1 additional pin would be $27 + $10 = $37)

Little Big Boss idea started from a parenting journey. As parents, we are constantly thinking about how to engage our children to learn beyond a classroom setting.
We live in a society that is well known for its cookie-cutter education system. Young students go to school to get drilled in passing exams with flying colors. But how many of us actually put these mathematical formulas or scientific facts that were drilled in us to good use later on in our lives? Here lies the opportunity for us to develop an alternate platform for our children to develop life-long skills that can assist them to succeed in life.
Skills like critical thinking, creativity, communication, are equally or if not, more important than academics. And these are the very skills that entrepreneurship cultivates. In Little Big Boss, we provide an early start for children to experience entrepreneurship. Children will embark on this entrepreneurial journey in which they will acquire business knowledge via our online resources. Thereafter, they can put their little ideas into business concepts and launch their businesses at our children friendly business portal where they will be carry out real business activities with other like-minded young entrepreneurs and consumers. 
We hope to raise $10,000 with this campaign. The money that we raise will be used to fund the production of our Little Big Boss Starter Kits.
How it started?
It all started when 7 years old Xander who was in Primary 1 asked Ray for additional allowance to purchase a keychain each for him and his brother. The next day, Xander returned home with 6 keychains. Ray realised that Xander did not understand the value of money, and to his surprise Xander proposed to sell his extra keychains to his friends. The following day, he managed to sell the rest with a small profit. Ray saw that this was a great learning opportunity for Xander and would like every kid to have an opportunity to build on their life skills from being an entrepreneur. 









What's in the starter kit?
The Little Big Boss starter kit will include a year of subscription to access the portal (online market place and resources), business journal, an activity kit or book on entrepreneurship, a handphone stand, a pin, an erasable pen, and 5 customizable business cards.
The portal will allow kids to access online resources to pick up Business101 in children friendly terms, launch their businesses and interact with like-minded young entrepreneurs.
Meet the Founders









See See has an Honors Roll in MSc in Technopreneurship and Innovation and an entrepreneur running shoe business. Ray has been in the technology advisory and human resource industry for more than 10 years. Dave is a cofounder overseeing the operations in various countries.

What's in for Little Big Bosses and Parents? 









What's next?
We have big plans for Little Big Boss and we like you to join us in this journey. We envision Little Big Boss to be a continuous learning process for our young entrepreneurs. There will be regular updates on our online resources and as soon as it's safe, we plan to roll out a series of physical events for our little big bosses to put their acquired theories into practices.","While risks and challenges exist with any project, we truly believe we have vigilantly prepared for the production of little big boss. Our business journal is completely designed and ready for print. Each of the products in our boxes has been sampled to ensure a quality product from a quality supplier. 

Risks involved include:
1) Timing. We have knowingly planned in extra time to complete your order because we import products from overseas. We have received samples from and found shipping to be punctual with each of our suppliers. However, there are a lot of moving parts with importing. Unplanned or unforeseeable events may delay shipment from our suppliers due to the current pandemic.

2) Quality Control. This risk exists anytime a product is outsourced. We have personally handled each of our products and find them to be of excellent quality.

Am I consuming more than the recommended sugar intake per day? Am I consuming foods that could lead to diseases in future?These are questions we don't register daily but are crucial in preventive healthcare.At ODOSH we want to help people live better, healthier lives through data, by providing users with a health rating of your grocery purchases. Sorta like those marvel superhero cards collection we had when we were kids, where each product has a rating of Fiber, Calcium, Vitamins and Minerals, Protein which are beneficial to your health.We hope that by raising this awareness, you can be empowered to make better choices in your purchases, and prevent future diseases from affecting you.","Our main challenge right now is getting users onboard. The only way for us to provide users with rich meaningful data is by having more data collected, but not many users would want to be the first to sign up since we don't have much information on board.

So for the initial stage, we plan to purchase data of marketing companies but that would cost us some money and that is what we hope to use your supporting funds for.

In addition, we want to get our word out of what we plan to do, the more people know about us the better we get traction and data, so some funds would be put in marketing and outreach.

Lastly, we want to improve on our app and provide beautiful graphs and a wonderful UX so that it is easy and fun to use, perhaps add a ""fun"" element to the app so you get entertained and motivated to use our app.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nGratitude\n\n\nA big thank you for your genuine goodwill and we will send you updates on our progress\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout $4\n\n\n\nPurchase Report\n\n\nOur gratitude and updates to you, AND send us a photo of your recent purchase so we can send you a free report of your health score\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 10 or more\n\nAbout $8\n\n\n\nUpsized Report\n\n\nMany thanks, updates on our progress, 1 report of your latest purchase AND a recommendation of similar products in the market\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 20 or more\n\nAbout $15\n\n\n\nThe Full Works\n\n\nEverything from rewards 1 -3 AND we will send you a healthy product from these following options:\n\n1) Stevia Classic Sweetener (50 Sachets)\n\nor\n\n2) Instant Roselle Tea (Reduced Sugar)\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nAug 2018\n\n\nShips to\nOnly Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (49 left of 50)""}]",0.0,0

KENNY OOOOOOOOOMEGAAAAAA








Evil Usagi Yojimbo








Nappa








See what I did there with the subliminal message?





You know what they always say, either you go big or you go....to Japan. 
Yes that's right, No-Brainer is back with issue 3 with 44 pages, almost twice that of No-Brainer #1 and #2, and for the first time, No-Brainer is going Manga!









What is a No-Brainer?
No-Brainer is a solo comix anthology featuring different stories in different styles by the same cartoonist. Each issue contains a main serialized story in the first half along with a bunch of shorter stories in the second half. 
The short stories range from kids growing up and dealing with changing friendships, to salmon trying to survive the treacherous upriver journey to their spawning grounds. To kick things off, I'll hand you over to the host of No-Brainer, Grandpa Cassius.









Okay, that didn't go too well, anyway, let's move on...












Standard Edition - Paintball!








Exclusive Variant Edition - Monkey Busters Manga!






  Both covers are wraparound covers.
  The exclusive variant edition will be signed and numbered and only printed for backers of this campaign.

Patreon-Exclusive Cover




Patreon-Exclusive Cover (Not Included in this campaign)





This cover is not included in this campaign, but I thought to let you know that I have a Patreon page which I use to document the making of all my comics, including No-Brainer #3, and also, to publish my comics. All subscribers to the physical books tiers will have each new issue of any comic I publish sent to them directly, with a patreon-exclusive cover. This is is the same for No-Brainer #3, and not only does it come with a special cover, the book is printed in standard size as well, so if you'd like, join me on Patreon :)









 Thoomgard: Final Mission Chapter 3 (22 pages) 
""Earths greatest protector gets retrenched after five decades of service, due to declining performance and a new wave of upcoming talent. As he struggles to come to terms with reality, he embarks on what seems to be his final mission - be a panel speaker at the academy's recruitment expo.""
As depressing as that sounds, Thoomgard is essentially a buddy sci-fi action-adventure where a gorilla man and his cat-like sidekick fights ferocious aliens.
*Catch up with Chapter 1 and 2 in No-Brainer #1 and #2 respectively in the add-ons section*

















Here's some preview pages for chapter 3:

































 Monkey Busters (16 pages)
STRONG. FEMALE. LEADS
If you're looking for them, look no further.
Based on a true story, the Monkey Busters are a trio of elderly ladies in Japan who decided to set up a task force to defend their town against invading bands of monkeys. It's a true story . Since it's set in Japan, I took the chance and tried my best to attempt to draw in manga-style :)









Here's some preview pages:

























Eddie's Life Tips: How to have fun at the Supermarket (2 pages)
Sandwiched between these two action packed stories is a short instructional comic that will be essential to the enrichment, or should I say nourishment, of your life ;)

























For this campaign, we are introducing the RAW EDITION!
This Raw Edition is a 68-page perfect-bound standard-sized book and is will be perfect for process junkies who would like to take a look behind the scenes of how No-Brainer #3 is made. The entire comic will be readable with the raw scanned original art of the interior pages and the covers, and the back of the book will not only contain the scripts from the stories, but also the digital thumbnails for a side-by-side comparison of how the story evolves. 
This will be available in the different reward tiers listed below :)

            

          









The book will be in both digital and physical forms.
Digital - A 41-page PDF file
Physical - A 44-page saddle-stitched ashcan-sized comic book
The comic is printed at a smaller size than the standard comic book, for cheaper prices, easier shipping and takes up less space in your storage. For the collected editions in the future, it will be standard-sized :)
Here's a comparison:  






















*All Prices are in Singapore Dollars (SGD)* 











































Original Art Tiers
*All original art is 11"" x 17"" bristol board unless otherwise stated*
Pages from No-Brainer #2 and #3 will be available. 

  Catalog of original art will be sent over as a PDF once pledged.
  You can get multiple pages, just inform me of the page code, and I'll notify you of the increased pledge amount.

No profanity in the dialogue as well. If you have other concerns, please feel free to contact me.","The book is all done and ready for printing. I have experience posting out books to different countries all over the world (especially the UK and US) for No-Brainer #1-2, the 6 Snake Claws issues and the collected edition and will use the same process for this series as well.

This line of breathable resort wear garments are enhanced by small embroidery patterns done by the women of North India in order to generate employment for women and support the cause of women empowerment. Aloe House does not only produce the product ethically but also believes in working for a cause and solving a problem. The line is manufactured in India in order to generate employment and would be sold online through our website. Based on research we saw a gap in the market and decided to launch a line which was never heard off or seen before in the market and so we came about with Aloe House. As a sustainable brand, we believe in slow fashion and ethical production practices. The brands objective is to provide a line to consumers that would satisfy their needs and support the cause of women empowerment.

One question we often get at conventions is: ""When is 2019's art journal coming out?"", or ""When's the next book?"". Rachta's annual Artist Journal is the sum of her year's art & travel collection, fueled by her desire to share her passion with the community, and inspire the next generation of creators.
This year's journal, foreword by Collateral Damage Studio's KC Ng, is filled with many of Rachta's latest illustrations. With over 50 hand-designed pages of her art; experiences; friends; (and food!), and combined with the all-new Inktober Sketchbook, this year's journal is bound to please!   

















Rachta's fascination with manga and animation got her bit by the geek culture bug early. She took a leap-of-faith by quitting the security of her full-time job to pursue her passion for the arts. In the last 5 years, she has traveled the world to share her creations while making many new friends and experiencing diverse cultures. This year, she visits Seoul for the first time while sharing moments with friends in far-off cities like New York and exotic Japan. 









 For the 4th year running, Rachta shares her 2019 adventures and illustrations in this perfectly bound journal, each of the 50 pages lavishly hand-designed in full-color. And for the first time ever, Rachta makes available her Inktober artworks, all collected into one convenient sketchbook. 









 This year, we are extremely fortunate to have KC Ng, General Manager of Collateral Damage Studios, pen the foreword for the journal. KC and his team are extremely talented and have been gracing us with beautiful artworks such as those in Anime Expo's badges and banners. We are really blessed to call KC our friend.  

































 Inktober was originally created as a challenge and is an event held each year during the month of October where artists from around the world create one ink artwork each day. Rachta participated with over 20 sketches of her favorite characters this year. Each of these is collected and carefully arranged into one sketchbook for your enjoyment, and available to her wonderful Kickstarter backers!

































 Rachta's fascination with manga and animation got her bit by the geek culture bug early. Since leaving her full-time job to pursue her passion for drawing, she has been traveling to share her art with the world, proving that the ability to create is within all of us. Her adventures and experiences influence her creations and are expressed in her original manga which she currently creates.

















































Add-ons provide you the ability to customize your Supporter Package. Some of these add-ons are Kickstarter-exclusive and cannot be found elsewhere! To include an add-on, simply add the value of it to your pledge. We will contact you after the Kickstarter campaign completes to confirm the add-on. Shipping for add-ons are free! (For example: If you have pledged SGD45 and want an SGD50 Custom Sketch, simply pledge SGD95).
























  Here's an example of one of Rachta's special animated augmented art will look like!

            

          









Rachta is so blessed to have her artist journey so strongly supported by the wonderful community. Last year's journal was crowdfunded in a record breaking time of 3hrs and 38min (compared to 16hrs in the previous year). Thank you so much! Here are some highlights:

We have confirmed convention attendance for Doujin Market and Anime Expo in 2020. You may choose to collect your rewards (tiers that include art books only) at Rachta’s booth in these conventions. The self-collection rates are much more affordable (VS shipping) and already include Kickstarter’s fees and packaging materials. The difference in shipping rates will be refunded after you self-collect the rewards. Rates and event information are listed in the 'Shipping Rates’ table in the following section. 
What you will need to collect your rewards at the booth:

  Photo ID (Driver’s License, Passport, National ID etc) 
  Proof of Kickstarter Backing (Screenshot of Kickstarter Backing, Backer’s Email etc) 

Note: The rewards will be mailed to you should you miss self-collection at the event.









2019 - Artist Journey of Rachta Lin is thoroughly thought out to feature high-quality materials while still maintaining shipping efficiency. The team learns from experience and we are always on the look out for ways to lower logistic costs for you. All Supporter Rewards are shipped from Singapore via registered mail with tracking. 
We experimented with a new, more efficient packaging method last year and found it to be successful, with zero shipping incidents or mishaps. As a result, shipping costs are reduced this year.","The team is well experienced in both the creative and production aspects. Rachta Lin, an artist of over 27 years of creative experience is being assisted by a production team with over 18 years of exhibition-scale production and logistic experience. The team has provided production support for over 330 events, of which over 60 are of Rachta's events & appearances. Naturally, all manner of risk cannot be removed. However, we have kept the amount of risk to a minimum with our experience and incorporated buffers for all potential issues that might arise. Nevertheless, we are committed to staying on schedule and communicating any deviations that may occur. We are glad to share that we did not encounter any problems or delays with our previous Kickstarter campaign (2018 - Artist Journey of Rachta Lin) and delivered Backer rewards ahead of schedule.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 30 or more\n\nAbout US$ 22\n\n\n\nDigital\n\n\nThank you!

 Our products contain no methyl alcohol, no sulphates, no gluten, no phthalates, no paraben, no artificial colorant, no animal byproducts and no carcirogen/mutagenic and reproductive damaging chemicals.  Fine scents and craftsmanship, this is all The LAB Project is about!We made our brand launch at Insead Singapore campus on 20th of September where not only we sold many bottles of our first two scents Agar and Iris, but also collected all the material to build our facebook and instagram pages (such as our ""happened at the lab shop"" series on Instagram).Our aim is to go beyond controlled environments and really reach to the public with a physical location. This is why we wanted to kickstart our project here: We aspire to secure the rent for our first public appearance in Singapore. Our Kickstarter campaign ends at 20th of November. From 20th of November until 3rd of December, we intend to open a sales stand at the following events in Singapore for our first public appearances: 1 - The Christmas Pop-Up Fair at 9 Raffles Boulevard (S$ 950)
 2 - The Christmas Glamour at Fullerton Hotel ($380)
 3 - The Enchanted Christmas Fair at Tanglin Club (S$ 550)4 - Fairs and Bazaars
Christmas 2017
Pan Pacific Orchard
 (S$ 580)The plan is to finance these four events with Kickstarter (hence the threshold of S$ 2460) and then to use the income generated there, to open a proper shop. The LAB's operating model will be simple: Once you select the 'The LAB' scent, we freshly hand blend your bottle. Now we have two scents ready to commercialize: Agar and Iris. So the rewards of big flacons will be given with these two scents only. Nevertheless, we are also able to produce small sized samples with our future scents. So, we added small reward options to offer sample size sets from our future scent collection. The LAB will be happy if you love our scents as we do! And we dream to keep sending our great fragrances to you wherever you are in the world (as long as custom regulation allows).

 Fine FragrancesThe LAB names its fine fragrances on the most prevalent ingredient.On the top of its first fragrances Agar and Iris, The LAB intends to offer 6 more perfumes in the near future: Pepper & Tobacco, Lily, Peach & Musk, Ginger, Rose Oud and Earl Grey. Below, we tried to define all our scents, beginning with Agar and Iris.Agar


Agarwood





Agar wood is one of the most precious ingredients in a perfumer's lab. 
Along with cardamom and exotic rosewood accords, this smoky, beautiful and powerful blend creates a sensation of warmth and sensuality.

 Top notes: 
Rosewood, Cardamom, Pepper

 Middle notes: 
Oudwood, Sandalwood, Vetiver

 Base notes: 
Vanilla, Amber, Tonka Bean
...Iris


Iris





Iris makes the origin of this elegant fragrance, which opens with fruity flavors fortified with jasmine and orange blossoms.
 The base is warm, gourmand and powdery due to almond like accords of tonka bean, patchouli and vanilla.

 Top notes: 
Blackcurrant, Pear

 Middle notes: 
Iris, Jasmine, Orange Blossom

 Base notes: 
Patchouli, Vanilla, Tonka Bean
...Pepper & Tobacco:


Pepper & Tobacco





Pepper & Tobacco is a blast of spices softened by an encompassing freshness. 
 It is a mixture of two clashing accords: blazing spices of pepper and saffron with the breadth of tobacco and bursting fresh notes of bergamot and grapefruit.

 Top notes: 
Bergamot, Grapefruit, Pepper

 Middle notes: 
Saffron, Cinnamon

 Base notes: 
Tobacco, Vetiver, Leather   
...Lily:


Lily





Lily is a light and tender fragrance with a mixture of citrus and floral notes. Mandarin and orange blossoms give the fragrance its zesty, sparkling scent and body, while the lilies, peonies, and heliotrope provide an invigorating floral essence. 

 Top notes: 
Orange Blossom, Lily of the Valley, Mandarin

 Middle notes: 
Lily, Peony, Heliotrope

 Base notes: 
Patchouli, Rosewood
...Peach & Musk:


Peach & Musk





Peach.&.Musk is a well-balanced combination of sweet fruity and musky scents. It is an exquisite and sensual fragrance infused with a bouquet of sweet fruit including peaches, raspberries and pears on a strong base of musk wood. Top notes: 
Passionfruit, Peach, Raspberry, Pear Middle notes: 
Lily of the Valley Base notes: 
Musk, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Patchouli ...Ginger:


Ginger





Ginger is a sophisticated fresh fragrance on a contrasting warm woody base. 

 It opens with a sparkling fresh mix of bergamot and ginger before settling into semi-spicy mix of pepper, vetiver and cedarwood. Rich and full, but inoffensive. 

 Top notes: 
Ginger, Bergamot, Lime

 Middle notes: 
Basil, Pepper, Violet

 Base notes: 
Vetiver, Cedarwood
...Rose Oud:


Rose Oud





Rose Oud is a unique and powerful fragrance with oriental woody notes. 

It begins with an enchanting aroma of elegant roses intermingled with a hearty dose of exquisite oud wood and softens into a rich, vanilla-scented amber accord.

 Top notes: 
Violet

 Middle notes: 
Oudwood, Rose

 Base notes: 
Vanilla, Amber
...Earl Grey:


Earl Grey





Earl Grey is a sensual fresh fragrance captivating with its ecstatic tranquillity. 

 Uniqueness of this fragrance is reflected in delicate floral notes blended with characteristic freshness of tea and bergamot and warm aromas of sandalwood and amber.

 Top notes: 
Bergamot, Tea, Lime

 Middle notes: 
Orange Blossom, Tiare, Heliotrope, Pepper

 Base notes: 
Amber, Musk, Sandalwood, Vanilla","The rewards I put on Kickstarter are risk-free, because the raw materials are already purchased. 

All we need to do is to handcraft and bottle the fragrances to prepare the awards. And this is what we love to do. 

So as soon as the reward is merited, there is no risk intrinsic to the project, which can prevent us from producing and sending the fine fragrances to their owners.

The money raised at Kickstarter will be fully allocated to finance the rent of the sales events mentioned at the story part. We won't use the money to buy more raw material.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 1 or more\n\nAbout $1\n\n\n\n1 ml Eau de Parfum Agar or Iris\n\n\nOnly for Kickstarter!\n\n1 ml sample size of eau de parfum, freshly blended for you. \n\nAgar (woody) or Iris (floral).\n\nHand made by the founder of The LAB.\nIncludes:\n\n\nFine Fragrance\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\n3 x 1 ml Eau de Parfum Set\n\n\nOnly for Kickstarter!\n\n3 sample size flacons of 1 ml of eau de parfum, freshly blended for you. \n\nFrom our collection of great scents, selected by us. \n\nHand made by the founder of The LAB.\nIncludes:\n\n\nFine Fragrance\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 3 or more\n\nAbout $3\n\n\n\n2 ml Eau de Parfum Agar or Iris\n\n\n30%+ off retail!\n\n2 ml of eau de parfum, freshly blended for you and labeled to your name. \n\nAgar (woody) or Iris (floral).\n\nHand made by the owner of The LAB.\nIncludes:\n\n\nFine Fragrance\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout $4\n\n\n\n2 x 2 ml Eau de Parfum Set\n\n\n30%+ off retail!\n\nTwo small flacons of 2 ml of eau de parfum, freshly blended for you and labeled to your name. \n\nFrom our collection of great scents, selected by  us.\n\nHand made by the founder of The LAB.\nIncludes:\n\n\nFine Fragrance\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2017\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 7 or more\n\nAbout $6\n\n\n\n3 x 2 ml Eau de Parfum\n\n\n40% off retail!

 Where can I use Bambi Lashes?








 When wearing Bambi Lashes, there are really just no limits as to where and when you can use it. Becoming a bride or attending a wedding? Wear Bambi Lashes for ultracomfort throughout the day and look like you own a great set of lashes for close-up photos. Have a photoshoot or a selfie day? Wear Bambi Lashes that helps to enhance your eyes effortlessly- even without extra eyeshadow and eyeliner. (Yes, the lash band also helps to act as an eyeliner!).Running late for school? Bambi Lashes is made quick and easy-to-wear even for beginners. Have an important meeting? Bambi Lashes is versatile and can be played up with more eyeshadow/eyeliner, or less. Without eyeshadow and eyeliner, it looks appropriate for an office wear. Depending on the occasion you're in, you decide your look! Getting ready for a date? Realistic-looking eyelash fibers will help that flirting go on well. Wearing plasticky synthetic falsies or smudgy mascara is going to freak your date out! Uh.. Did we mention about getting styes on eyes from eyelash extensions? That's freakier.







But I already have eyelash extensions on, do I still need Bambi Lashes?
Eyelash extensions may seem like the easiest way out to get lashes to fit your eyes and lengthen them, but your beautician will probably not tell you about the side effects. Not only are eyelash extensions troublesome in maintenance, they also can cause traction alopecia. This is the condition which your natural lashes may not regrow permanently. Read here to learn about why this procedure is not recommended for you.
Ophthalmologists have also proven that eyelash extensions have caused injuries the eyes. The fibres of your extensions can cause your cornea to get scratched. Additionally, the glue used for your eyelash extensions may cause allergic reactions (especially formaldehyde).
Another issue that most people dislike about eyelash extensions is that makeup(such as eyeliner) is difficult to remove without damaging the extensions. Most girls would have makeup trapped in their eyelashes and this can result in infection.








 









But I don't wear lashes. Would I enjoy Bambi Lashes?We think so! If eyes are the windows to the soul, then your lashes should be the perfect curtains to it. Maybe you fumble a lot with makeup like eyeshadow and eyeliner but still want a polished, enhanced look. Bambi Lashes is designed to help everyone (including beginners) put on lashes easily! Because it is also lightweight and ultracomfortable, you won't feel it's there - you'll feel like Bambi Lashes are your very own eyelashes!

 Where are you in the process?We had a number of prototypes previously and in 2017, we've redesigned our lashes according to mathematical formulas and science - so it's all rounded in terms of aesthetics, durability and comfort. We've also veganized our product to ensure there's no animal derivatives. In order to make one pair for you, we need a minimum order to make this possible. And only in Kickstarter will you be the first to try out our lashes.What does your timeline look like?







Bambi Lashes has been an idea way back before 2015 with the mission of providing comfort and an easy-to-wear experience to girls. We sold some of our very first prototypes to Singapore and grew a humble fan base within Asia. In 2016, we decided to redesign our lashes. Bambi Lashes is now based on Golden Ratio of different ethnicities, and have been designed through countless experiments with makeup artists and tests on different eye shapes. (We worked unimaginable, crazy hours each day to make sure we got it right - including the formula to create hyperrealistic eyelashes and the easiest false lashes you'll ever wear) Our products are also now vegan and have absolutely no animal derivatives.We are super excited that you get your hands on them and try them! We work hard every day to ensure that each and every Bambi Lashes gets to every one of you on time.","This is our first Kickstarter project and we've delivered our past prototypes on time and grew a humble fan base.

Welcome to Dinoverse, a prehistoric world where dinosaurs roam. It is here that you will learn how to survive with your pack against the ever-changing landscape. Will you be able to adapt fast enough and manipulate the herd to your advantage, or will the transformations leave your pack broken?



















Use the Carnivores to cull the Herd and benefit from the rising body count.  Expand the Herd with Herbivores and defend yourselves against the bloodthirsty Carnivores with all the tools available to yourself. The fate of the Herd is in your hands, will you lead them to abundance? Or devastation?









Dinoverse is a 2 to 5 player game where each player is assigned a Pack, consisting of 2 Dinosaurs, that journey alongside the Herd. The Herd is a central pool of dinosaurs that will interact with one other. Use each Dinosaur's unique ability to manipulate the Herd to your advantage. Carnivores eat other Dinosaurs and score from the rising body count while Herbivores grow the Herd, and earn points by defending it against the Carnivore's onslaught. Manipulate the game end events to your advantage based on the type of Dinosaurs in your pack. The player with the most points at game end, wins!









Each Dinosaur in the game has a unique ability and unique scoring method. The game uses 5-7 different types of Dinosaurs out of 11 types and using different permutation of Dinosaurs will result in a fresh playing experience!
From the makers of finance games such as Dirty Money and Zombielife Insurance, Dinoverse also comes with their fan favorite Gamification Guide where designers explain how they design game mechanics in relation to the characteristics of each dinosaurs.

You can add the value of any optional buys onto Kickstarter add-on and the shipping fees for the optional buys will be collected during the pledge manager phase. Please refer to the estimated shipping cost of each add-on at the ""Shipping Fees"" section. 






















































































If you are a retailer or an individual who wishes to do a bulk purchase of 12 copies or more and enjoy more discount on the shipping, drop us an email at info@capitalgainsgroup.com.



















The shipping fees are not included in this campaign and will be collected during the pledge manager. The current fees are based on the most recent rates and Capital Gains Studio will be subsidizing a large portion of the shipping cost as a promotion for our campaign.
Shipping rates have shot up in recent months due to a shortage of shipping capacity due to COVID-19 pandemic and rising energy prices. We are hoping that the shipping rates will come down in the near future so that we can lower the shipping fees when the games are being shipped.
We may also ship the games in separate packages as there is a large jump in shipping fees for packages that are 2KG and above. Therefore, it becomes more economical to ship in smaller packages as a bid to help our backers save on shipping.
We also reserve the right to decline any shipping to countries with an active armed conflict or a country with a high chance of non-delivery. We will refund any pledge made in this case after a review with our logistics partners.
In the case there are additional charges or fees due to taxes or customs, do drop us an email and we will reimburse any relevant custom fees to our backers.
The expected delivery date of Dinoverse is Jan 2023.

When it comes to a project like this, there are always risks regarding production and delivery that are beyond our control and may cause delays. However, we are confident of delivering by the stated dateline.

Due to the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19 on international freight services, the shipping rates may be adjusted to reflect a possible spike in shipping rates though we will try as much as possible to absorb small increases in shipping rates.

As with any foreign production/logistics, we may still be faced with unforeseen circumstances such as manufacturing and shipment delays or errors. If we were to meet with an issue, we promise to keep everyone updated and will share details of the problems and our solutions.

Check out our previous campaigns on the kind of communication you can expect due to any manufacturing issue or shipping delay. If you have any question or concern, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@capitalgainsgroup.com.

We may produce additional copies for the Kickstarter editions of the game as a result of the manufacturing process and we will sell these excess copies through our website or through special events and conventions.

If fashion is a cycle, then it’s time we revisited the Golden Era of Art Deco.
Inspired by sleek geometry, elegant typography and bold designs of the 1930s, Vario’s Empire Art Deco Watch Collection is merging time with timelessness.
We’ve opted out of impersonal stock parts, choosing instead to give each watch in the collection its own custom-made case, dial, crown, and hands for visual drama. We’ve also pared down the pronounced horn lugs for a more refined, contemporary look. At its core, the sapphire glass-covered Miyota 6T33 Hand Wound Movement allows for a smooth winding ritual.  An optional Seiko NH38A Automatic Movement will be offered if we hit our stretch goal of $US$36k/S$48k (UNLOCKED).

Vario Eclipse (Previous Watch) Testimonials 



















We've had 4 successful crowdfunding campaign (2 Kickstarter and 2 Indiegogo) and delivered thousands of products to hundreds of backers before this so we understand the process. We will certainly do our best to make sure that the watches arrive on time so we can get them to our Kickstarter backers as soon as possible. 











Vario’s Empire Art Deco Watch Collection is your piece of a defining period in history. Pre-order starts 30 April on Kickstarter. 
Production of 1st 300 commenced in March but we have only secured 200 handwound movements so we will only have 50 handwounds for each of the 4 designs. We will release up to 40 of each variant on Kickstarter and the 1st 160 handwound watches will be ready in June. 
If we're lucky enough to hit US$36k/S$48k (UNLOCKED), we will order an additional 300 automatics using the reliable workhorse Seiko NH38A, keeping the same specs for the watch but at 11.5mm thickness and a closed caseback. Prices for Automatic and Handwound will be the same. 2nd batch will start production in June after the Kickstarter campaign and we will send out the automatic watches by end September so it pays to get in Early!","We've had 4 successful crowdfunding campaign (2 Kickstarter and 2 Indiegogo) and delivered the products to our backers before this so we understand the process.

This watch was built to measure our most, most precious resource: time. The Journey is based on the popular BOLDR Voyage concept, with a vintage, aviator-inspired design. The Journey has a unique Seiko meca-quartz movement that keeps impeccable time, beneath a durable box mineral glass lens. It’s the first BOLDR watch to feature a limited-edition art piece on the caseback, and only on the first limited-edition Kickstarter run.







Watch MovementThe Seiko VK64 Meca-Quartz Movement is a hybrid of quartz and mechanical movement for the chronograph, combining the best of both technologies. The timekeeping mechanism is quartz, with a crystal regulator, powered by a battery. This gives the watch a mechanical feel, while still containing a quartz crystal so you never miss a tick. 







Limited Edition Caseback Artwork
The BOLDR Journey was designed to celebrate first steps. In line with that, the custom art on the Journey’s caseback is based on the theme of taking the first step in your adventure - crafted by Malaysian tattoo artist Kevin Tan. Each BOLDR line of watches will possess a unique, custom-designed artwork on the case back - carefully created to represent each BOLDR line of watches, and what it represents.  
 







Unique Domed Mineral Glass Lens 
The domed shape of the box mineral glass lens lends the watch a vintage look, while creating a curved canopy, reminiscent of antique aviation dials. The mineral glass lens brings out the dial characteristics and highlights the watch face, while also scattering and breaking the light on the sandwich dial, creating a soft, even tone of light on the textured watch face. 









Vintage, Aviation-inspired designMixing the best of the old and the new, the BOLDR Journey uses different textures on the double-layer sandwich dial to bring out the watch’s character. The watch face features a classic “Disc-Track” texture on the subdial to further highlight and accent the layers, while the numerals take inspiration from vintage aviation instrument arrangements, found in planes during the 30’s and 50’s.


BOLDR Journey Chronograph Wasp: Black Lightning Yellow dial with Midnight black strap

























The Journey Chronograph come in a variety of colours to suit all styles. To honour their vintage aircraft rooted design, each model is named after mechanical aircraft from yesteryear. This also celebrates the BOLDR Journey commitment to accompanying you on every journey you take.

  Kickstarter Rewards
  Timeline










Simply put, Pride celebrates the LGBT community. Flags have come to symbolise groups of people, identities and serve as a symbol that unites, regardless of place, culture or even time. In a similar vein, LGBT flags have become powerful symbols, empowering those who fly the flags as their own.  Pride  is an homage to these flags, and the people behind them who raise it as a part of their identity.




3D Render of the Card deck, cards and custom designed tuck-box





Where it all began
Being an asexual, I'd always held an affinity for the ace card as a sign for asexuality. Both subtle, and a pun. The Ace flag, specifically the colour scheme, was also something which I had taken a great liking to, an understated, and subdued design. 
Unable to sleep one night, I came up with a potential design to celebrate Pride month as a poster on Displate. In the morning I quickly worked out a design in Photoshop based on what I had come up with in my head at night. 




1st iteration of the Ace Card design





It was supposed to end there. Maybe come up with a few more puns for fun and move on to my next art project. Sometimes in life however, one can never predict where it can go.  Sending the design to one of my LGBT friends for fun, his response was unexpected, yet simple.
""You know, I think you could come up with a whole deck for the community""
And that, was how it began.











Inspired by a neon, minimalistic style, these cards combine the colours of various iconic LGBT flags with an overall darker theme. Text at the sides of each card identifies which LGBT identity the card was inspired by. Together, these design elements result in a subtle yet striking design in terms of colour and aesthetic. 




Card based on the LGBT flag





Many of my friends are part of the LGBT community as well, which is also one of the reasons which inspired me to do an entire card deck. Our differences do not divide us, rather, they have allowed us to come together and celebrate our differences. Pride is an ode to everyone in the LGBT community, and allies who support it.

Dusty Raging Fist Boss Fight Scenario (work in progress)








Dusty Raging Fist Mini Boss Fight








Lighting Guardian on Summon

















Set in a time before 'Dusty Revenge' (released on Steam in Feb 2014), 'Dusty Raging Fist' features a younger vigilante Dusty aided by his team of skillful fighters. The story began when a young visitor from a faraway land sought our hero’s help, the little boy spoke of a peculiar phenomenon of lost children and deadly minions that plagued the lands. The once peaceful and brightly lit sky had produced two dark moons, an oddity that was once extinguished by the legendary Knight of the Iron City centuries ago. In a time of uncertainty and chaos, the Mythical Guardians have beckoned our heroes to come forth and harness the Guardians’ great powers. A journey thus begun. What is the evil behind all these chaos? Will our heroes cross paths with the lineage of the legendary Iron Knights? Will the powers of the Mythical Guardians prove equal or greater than the oncoming evil? Dusty's gang must ride this journey in order to seek answers and restore peace to the land.

'Dusty Raging Fist' style of combat combines melee attacks with ranged attacks. You start off with basic attacks which allow you to earn combo moves, you can juggle in the air, perform uppercuts, roll, dash, air dash, smash down, and combine all these moves to chain more combos. Your characters are also equipped with range attacks. Dusty will be equipped with dual pistols, Kitsune uses shuriken, and Darg throws a large boomerang. As you progress in the game, you will need to collect the 3 key combat elements: 1) Elemental Powers, 2) Support Characters, and 3) Mythical Guardians. Different elemental powers are used for different purposes. Support characters lends artillery and sniping abilities. You are also equipped with the powers of the ancient Guardians for full carnage attacks. Let's talk about Elemental Powers first:







There will be 6 different types of elemental powers available:




Elemental Powers








Ice Elemental Freeze








Lightning Elemental Shock





Each elemental powers will have different effects on enemies. For instance, Ice Elemental will freeze enemies, giving you and your friends extra time to damage them. Lightning Elemental electrocute enemies, other enemies that comes into contact into electrocuted enemies will get electrocuted as well, creating a domino effect.







To aid you further, two other support mechanisms comes in handy when situation gets sticky. You will be able to call upon your sniper support from a zoomed out view to take down pesky enemies, or bring forth your cannon support to blast away enemy clusters.


Using Support Character 'Snow' as a Sniper.





When using your sniper support, a zoom out view of the sidescrolling game layout will be presented, you can then take aim at the enemies that may be higher up in the air for more effective combat for instance.Stronger or bigger enemies may require the use of your artillery support character. Forcing your enemies in a cluster before taking them out is also a good way to use the artillery support mechanism for instance. See below.




Using Cannon Support Character 'Leo' to bomb Enemy Clusters
















Darkness Guardian on Summon - Sucking enemies into a black hole





You can also summon your chosen Mythical Guardian for ultimate carnage, as above. Different Guardians may have different effects on different enemies. For instance, the Darkness Guardian will suck enemies into a black hole, eliminating them at the expense of gaining health or XP orbs. There are also Guardians with healing powers.The use of Mythical Guardians is a powerful feature inspired by JRPGs. We've decided to incorporate it in a beat'em game setting to add more depth and interest to the game play. Use these Guardians wisely and they will save you in dire times of need.

















Dusty has a great sense of righteousness and will not hesitate to stand up and do the right thing.







Kitsune is from the far east. Originally an enigmatic assassin, she has come to respect Dusty and many a times follow him on his quests. But being the skeptic she is, she will challenge Dusty's decisions.







Darg is a childhood friend of Dusty, he places a lot of trust in Dusty. And he will follow Dusty to the end of the world.







Ex-militia trained, Snow did not favor the military practices. Instead, he longed for freedom to fight his own justice. He followed Dusty as he finds Dusty's code of justice similar to his.







Originally an arms maker, Leo decided to travel with the gang to test his powerful cannon and fight for justice.







Sir William guards the stars and maintain world balance. From the lineage of the Iron Knights with extreme power and strength, is he a foe or friend?

Upgrade your characters and skills with XP collected





The characters in 'Dusty Raging Fist' can be upgraded. All you need to do is to fight your way through the onslaught of enemies inside the game to collect as much XP as possible, in order to distribute them to various skills and powers of your characters!In summary, 'Dusty Raging Fist' is a 2.5 D sidescrolling beat'em up action game, a traditional genre refreshed in a modern way. There will be local and online co-op, up to 3 players. In addition, the game features the sniper and artillery combat support system (as seen in Dusty Revenge). It is a unique combat system designed by us and not seen in other beat'em up games. There are 6 elemental powers to collect (Fire, Ice, Wind, Earth, Lightning, & Darkness). Elemental powers have their own unique properties. Also, mythical guardians can be collected and summoned in times of need. These mythical guardians serve different purposes, and they are used generally in dire times. There will be platforming elements, so be prepared to dodge, roll and jump out of dangers too! 'Dusty Raging Fist' is a passion project by us, the creators, growing up playing classic games such as 'Streets of Rage', 'Double Dragon, and many more. Throughout our growing up years, we have also enjoyed playing modern games such as the 'Devil May Cry' & 'God of War' series. Hence, 'Dusty Raging Fist' was conceived, to fuse modern game play and awesome art into a classic game genre.

















































































































































To thank our backers further, we've included a special 'Hall of Fame' webpage dedicated to the personalities that would make Dusty Raging Fist possible. Backers of all Caricature Tiers will be included in this special feature.















Like most indies, we need strong support from the community. Although we have a good team internally, we still need additional public support to see us through. We need involvement from the public to help us better our game. Your feedback will help us greatly. And we definitely need the funds to help us get to the end point, which is ultimately releasing an excellent and fun game, 'Dusty Raging Fist'. 

'Dusty Raging Fist' was conceived because we wanted to create an extremely fun side-scrolling beat'em up taking cues from modern games, fusing traditional stylized 2d game play in a modern way. At the same time, we wanted to improve vastly from our earlier game 'Dusty Revenge'. To be candid, our earlier game 'Dusty Revenge', although award winning, did not fully lived up to our own expectations because we lacked funds to improve the game. One of the issue with 'Dusty Revenge', was our lack of experience in building a large game using an old game engine that subsequently resulted in some technical glitches. The whole experience strengthened us as a team nonetheless, and we aspire to improve ourselves from then on. The pre-production for 'Dusty Raging Fist' actually started some time back, but due to the business environment where we have to cover realistic running costs, we have also  been actively engaged in other client based projects while we were working on 'Dusty Raging Fist', in order to keep the team afloat. Right now, we will like to break the cycle and dive right into the production of this game full steam ahead. And we hereby appeal to you, our generous backers to help us achieve that.

We need your support, in every small little way. For the full completion of this game, we are looking at another 9 months of additional work, including all game testings. We've come up with really cool awesome tiers that you will find very enticing. In return for your help, we'll deliver a fun and exciting game, and we hope to have you involved in this project. So join us in our game making journey!

After 2 wildly successful Pilot watch projects, Ventus is proud to present the Mori Brass Diver. 







Mōri Motonari “The legend of the three arrows” is a story about Mōri Motonari. In an effort to get his sons to work together, he gave them each an arrow to break. This was done easily, and he challenged his sons to repeat it with three arrows bound together. This proved to be unbreakable. Our Design Philosophy - Inspired by the past, built for the future







From the lesson of Mōri Motonari, we wanted to design an awesome diver's watch by focusing on 3 aspects. The 'Three Arrows' story is reflected on the dial, when the dive bezel triangle, dial triangle and Ventus logo line up. Aesthetic DesignThe Ventus Mori was designed with the diving watches of the 1950s in mind. A highly legible dial and an unimposing case gives it a rugged elegance. The Mori is a watch that fits under your shirt cuff, yet tough enough to be taken on a dive. The case is also made from Brass, a material which patinas as you wear it. This makes each watch unique to its owner and every watch will have its own story to tell.







The dial is produced with a sandwich effect which gives a sense of depth to it. The dial design was kept clean and legible, with a date wheel printed in matching colors to the luminous paint.  Mechanical craftsmanship







Even though the Mori looks like a watch from the 1950s, it has been designed with the latest advancements in technology. Its slim 12.5mm case (without crystal) is able to withstand a very respectable 300m of water pressure.To commemorate its vintage roots, the caseback features a diving helmet design that has been stamped to give it an amazing 3D effect.







The double domed sapphire crystal ensures scratch resistance during dives. A 120 click unidirectional dive bezel keeps precise timing and the brightest C3 or BGW9 superluminova glows brightly in the murky depths. 


BGW9 Lume





 



Vintage Lume (C3)





Inside, a reliable Seiko NH35 automatic movement ensures that your watch will run for years without ever needing a battery.







Production QualityEach watch is built to last and this will be achieved through precise production and careful assembly techniques. Having worked with our production partner on many projects, we are confident that quality will exceed expectations.Rewards

But some legacies managed to endure the perfect storm by the technologies and shines even brighter in front the world. Hand craftsmanship is one of those. It includes watch making, leather making, art making and other old fashion that carry ancient wisdom and culture in the modern days. For example, the traditional watch making industry were nearly wiped out by the evolution of quartz watch in the 70s. But today it is still considered one of the greatest arts in the human history. Because legacy is what defines who we were and what we are. 
The use of wallet becomes less relevant in today's world, with various payment mode embedded in our smart phones. We can live without a wallet but we cannot live without a phone, which would sound ridiculous if it was 10 years ago. But it doesn't mean that we shall forget about the wallet, on the contrary, the hand craftsmanship is becoming more relevant now. 
""In an age where many things are mass-produced, you don’t get a sense of how they might have been put together. Items no longer seem to have their own personality.""

This project is dedicated to awake the appreciation of hand craftsmanship before it eventually turns into a lost art some day.  Each of the wallet is hand crafted and singly made one at a time to upkeep the quality. 
The wallet is a typical cardholder style that serves as both a cardholder and wallet at the same time, which is not usually the hot pick in the market, due to multiple reasons, such as commercial restraints, mass production limitation, etc. This wallet consists of a  coin pouch, 5 credit card slots and a bill compartment that fits most of the currency notes. It is carefully made, stitched, wax, colored and embossed.
If this project is successfully funded, each backer will have their own edition of wallet at an exclusive price before it comes into commercial production, where each of the wallet will be with their own signs, such as preferred nickname, city name or short words on the wallet.","The potential risk is the uncertainty of leather material due to current global supply issues, where it might cause unexpected rise in price that inevitably hit the cost hard before we are unable to launch the production. 
Meanwhile, the prototyping process isn't easy, as we are expected to produce the wallet with long last quality, which inevitably results increased wastage and repeated adjustment to the desired quality standard. 
Therefore, we will need extra funds to procure the material in a bigger bulk to fulfill the order and mitigate the risks.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 150 or more\n\nAbout $108\n\n\n\nExclusive Edition with Your Own Sign\n\n\nExclusive edition for backers at an exclusive price.

Concept

  A Travelling Musollah cum MultiUsage Space, acronym TRAMUS. 
  This is a lightweight, portable, inflatable, lighted, tall rectangular tentage. 
  Designed for Multi Usage.

 - For  Muslims to perform their daily obligatory prayers, indoor or outdoor, where there are no proper place made available. For this purpose, it will be accessorised with pegs to ground the tentage for outdoor use. Also a slender bottle spray pump will be included for taking the ablution prior to performing the prayers. Thus hassle free.

  TRAMUS can also be used as a 2 man tent. Ideal for those who loves the outdoors 
  TRAMUS is also ideal as a makeshift changing room, usable indoor and outdoor. Great for those selling clothes at fairs or flea markets where there are no proper changing room to try out the outfits.
  TRAMUS is also ideal for use as a Security tentage for Law Enforcement Agencies usage for the crime scene forensics investigations or even in areas such as Airport gatehold rooms or Immigration checkpoints, where a person is subjected to a body search, thus away from public views. This can also be deployed for use at events where there are heightened security coverage. 
  TRAMUS can also be use for other purpose such as a temporary shelter during events, both indoors and outdoors.
  Additionally, TRAMUS can alao be use as a temporary shelter for storage of stores or equipments. 
  TRAMUS is designed to be lightweight, spacial, portable and be very simplistic in its setup. Each tentage comes with internal lighting and a portable pump for inflation and deflation. 

History of TRAMUS
The inception of creating TRAMUS came to me about 8 years ago. It was initially aimed for Muslims to be able to perform their daily obligatory prayers.
 Unfortunately, my initial drafts and ideas was severely crippled by my fellow peers critical comments of its viability. It was shelved. 
The idea was revisited over the years but development was obstructed by the high  development cost. 
Funding became the greatest issue even to develop the prototype as I do not have the financial means to fund the  project. 
This year, the idea was once again aroused. Whilst sharing my thoughts, a stranger came to me told me that not only was this project useful for the community, but it also has other viable market potentials. I was also introduced and advised to the crowdfunding platform to fund the project. 
This inadvertently spurs me on and I am now adamant to make the idea a reality. 
Product Design & Versatility
TRAMUS is designed to be simplistic, practical for outdoor and indoor usage, spatial and its portability. It is also lightweight as the entire sructure will be made with lightweight canvas material. 
The framework structure uses inter-connected air tubes, which can be inflated and deflated with the use of a pump. This allows TRAMUS to be easily folded and be carried easily. 
Another interesting feature is that it comes with LED Lights. Thus remove the hassle for additional or seperate and bulky lamps for night usage. 


Marketing Strategy
Over the last couple of months, I have started doing preliminary market research locally to gather feedbacks and gauge TRAMUS viability and marketability, for its primary and secondary uses. 
I have personally spoken and promote the idea to my acquaintances, friends and colleagues. I have also spoken to strangers on the streets to gauge their responses. Of these, more than 95% of those I spoken to have shown interest to purchase TRAMUS. 
Once the prototype has been developed, my next approach is to rigourously promote the product through various means for greater exposure. 
These includes:



  Via various social media platforms as well as other online marketing platforms. A video clip of the product will also be featured in. 
  Roadshows at various venues and events to showcase and promote the product first hand. These includes Mosques, community events, picnic grounds, trade fairs and trade exhibitions. 
  Personalised emails to various government agencies and other relevant private companies to promote TRAMUS secondary usage.

Additionally, a local major event organiser, whom I shared my idea, has expressed their interest to promote the product with their business clientele as well as assisting in marketing the product by providing sales booth during their on going events and trade shows. 
Furtherence to this, this event company has also plan to market the product in the neighbouring countries through their extensive contacts with the nation celebrities and business retailers to greater promote it. 
Appeal
This journey has took me 9 years in the making. 
I have completed the draft design for TRAMUS. I have also engaged a company to begin developing the prototype and eventually manufacture the product.
I strongly believes that TRAMUS has a huge market potential for both its primary and secondary usage. I am now even more committed and determined to bring the idea of TRAMUS into being. 
The groundwork has already begun and the prototype development for TRAMUS has been initiated. Henceforth, I am now reaching out to you in seeking your assistance for your support in funding this project. 
My sincere appreciation and gratitude to you.","The main challenge is to identify a trustworthy company that is able to develop the product in its entirety. 

Other challenge involves developing the inflatable structure with the use of air tubes. The tent structure should also be able to withstand a certain degree of wind resistance for general outdoor use.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout $36\n\n\n\n50% Discount\n\n\nFor the next 50 pledgers, offering 50% discounts of the product launched\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (49 left of 50)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 100 or more\n\nAbout $72\n\n\n\nProduct Complimentary\n\n\nGet the first complimentary edition\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2021\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (50 left of 50)""}]",0.0,0

Hello! My name is Kathy Gabriel and I'm thrilled you've stopped by to check out my Kickstarter project!




Mindfully Me Card Deck





Mindfully Me is a meditation card deck that has taken me close to 2 years to create, thoughtfully researching and curating some of my favourite meditations and those I have been deeply inspired by throughout my years of practice. As a full time yoga and meditation teacher, this deck has been put together with my students and clients in mind. Through my work with them, I’ve found that these meditations and mindfulness techniques have not only been helpful but also really simple to practice and integrate into their everyday life. 
This deck has a total of 54 cards. 50 of them detail a different mindfulness exercise that is inspired from various traditions and spiritual practices. The 4 blank cards are included for you to add your own mindfulness rituals or affirmation practices to make this deck uniquely yours. These exercises have been curated to create a timeless and spiritually neutral deck for all ages. 
In the deck, you will find a thoughtful mix of mindful movement, breathing techniques, chanting/ mantras, visualisation exercises, self-massage methods and affirmation meditations. The exercises can be practised seated upright, lying down or unless stated otherwise. All of them will take you no longer than 5 minutes to do so you can do them on the go, whenever you need a dose of calm, reset or the kick of energy to go about your day. 
There will be a simple guidebook that will give you more information about the practices along with some creative suggestions of how to use your deck for yourself or others.




Mindfully Me Title Card





Details

   Artwork - The entire deck is made up of original Watercolour images that were painted by a local artist who I worked closely with to match all the art with the meditations and the felt-sense of the various practices. These are intended to inspire your visualisations and to spark fun or joy in your practice
   Main Deck Illustration - The Cherry Blossoms are cherished symbols in my life as they remind me of my mother who passed away from cancer when I was 14. Her journey showed me how courage and strength can help us weather through any hardship and was exactly what set me on my path of meditation and self-healing.
   Illustration & Typography - I also worked closely with a professional designer to tie the whole look and feel of the deck together

How To Use This Deck
All you need to do is shuffle and draw a card. Indulge in the meditation that is written on the card itself. Depending on how much time you have, you can draw more than one.

Meditations can be broken down into a few distinct categories:

  Breathing  
  Movement 
  Sound & Voice 
   Visualisation 
  Touch & Self Massage
   Felt-Sense Practices

   S$10,000 - Limited Edition Wooden Box Keepsake for card storage and display","The biggest risk is production/packing delays and/or not meeting the MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity). Please also note that this is an ALL OR NOTHING CAMPAIGN. If I do not reach the campaign goal, I do not get any of the funds to process the payment to the printer. PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS ALL DONE BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT A TEAM. It will take me time to pack such volumes and to assess for all quality checks in order to make sure your order comes in perfect condition - that is my guarantee to you.
I also plan on updating backers regularly on each step of the process. 

There is also the risk of postponements due to COVID-19. I will comply strictly by Singapore Governing Laws  so if there are measures that require further delays, then that will take priority. Also factor in certain countries applying restrictions in deliveries/shipping. Please only purchase a deck if you are willing to accept delays that could lead a few months! That being said, my aim is to get this deck to you within the 6 month framework so definitely something you can consider as an early Christmas Gift! Should the printing be done early, I will mail out completed decks before the time indicated.

It is possible that if stretch goals are unlocked, I may need to extend my delivery date. If that's the case, I plan on notifying all the backers well ahead of the deadline (preferable shortly after the completion of the Kickstarter) with my new intended delivery date.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout US$ 4\n\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SHOUT OUT\n\n\nGet a shout out on social media via @dirtyhippieyogi and @mindfullymecards\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 32 or more\n\nAbout US$ 23\n\n\n\nMINDFULLY ME CARD DECK\n\n\nThe deck of cards printed on premium heavyweight card stock, housed in a sturdy gilded tuck box.

Meet Diah - A flat, multi-purpose, paper-thin light that turns on in one easy snap!







It’s easy to assemble - Just snap the two magnetic ends together and your space is lit.
 






 







It’s lightweight & portable - Weighing in at 18 grams per light, Diah can also be packed flat and slipped right into any bag.







Modular form & function - Diah is more than just a pretty tea light. Snap many together to make wider bases. Just like lego, you can get creative and make complex lighting structures.







Omni-directional illumination - Our unique hollow design enables light to emit in all directions. A definite step up from traditional bulb lighting, you now have the ability to wrap your lights around any object.  48-hour battery life - Powered by 2 replaceable cell batteries, this light powers on for 2 days straight. Replace them if you need them to go on for longer. Endless applications - Here are a couple of scenarios in which Diah can turn a bland moment into the perfect #mood. .- Fairy Lights 
- Tea Light
- Dining Chandelier
 - Accent Light 
- Wall Sconce
 - Night Light
 - Camping/Glamping 
- Pop-Up Lighting & more!







How does it work? 
Clasp the magnetic ends of this flat piece of paper and have your Diah transform into a beautiful light. Should you want it off, simply flatten it and slide it back into your bag. 










Surprise yourself with Diah  - Be delighted by the endless combinations Diah offers.  Its hollow design and magnetic clasps give you the opportunity to wrap it around tree trunks, poles or even, wine bottles. You can also create larger configurations such as chandeliers and halos if you’re into DIY. 








Inspiration:
""How can we do more with less?""
This question, in particular, inspired Diahs' design.We started out with the goal of creating a structurally minimal product both in size & weight that when assembled, would command a presence far greater, than the sum of its parts.Everything from the structure, electronics and even the manufacturing processes, have been stripped and reassessed to use as little as possible. We believe that driving sustainability is not only defined by materials used, it goes down to the final detail of shipping, packaging and minimising waste. To stick by these principles, we've minimised weight and designed for flat packability making shipping easy. Specifications:







 **Do note: Colour options will only be available once we reach our stretch goal of 50,000$. If we only hit our initial goal of 20,000$ we will issue gold as the standard colour. Diah Timeline:April 2017 - The first forms of Diah were prototyped.August 2017 - Once we were happy with the functionality of Diah, we created a small batch of 50 Diahs to observe possible lead times with our vendors. We also used them for our brand video. Our inner circle of friends and family also got a chance to see our prototype and offer feedback.October 2017 - After a few tweaks and a lot of 3D printed mock-ups of possible multi-functional hooks, we ordered in our first batch of 500 Diahs that are currently being used as marketing samples. November 2017 - We launch on Kickstarter! We're waiting to hit minimum order to hit the go button with our vendors! The sooner we reach our goals, the sooner we get production going.We're also refining Diah to have a single clasp with a multi-functional hook like the one below.







December 2017 - Shipping of the first batch of Diahs begins! Rewards:

Refinements




Iteration 1








Iteration 1





Initially, the first iteration had 16 game pieces and the frame is made of plywood and hard styrofoam.




Iteration 2





We cut down to 9 game pieces in the next iteration so that we could ensure that the pieces would have more consistency in the overall appearances. We made use of bent acrylic to create the game board frame.


User Testing
Usability tests allow us to test out the functionality and the game mechanics of Foodsory Play.  This allows us to sieve out any usability or design issues and make improvements to it. By testing out with individuals of different age groups, this ensures that we can cater to their requirements.

WHAT IS THE VULVA?


Photo taken by Kelvin Lim of www.kelvinlim.com.sg





Your vulva is the part on the outside of your genitals, the clitoris and the labia - which have an inner and outer set of lips. 'Vulva' doesn’t mean anus or your vagina – your vagina is actually inside, leading up to your womb. 
WHY A VULVA BOOK?
1) This book, solely focused on Asian vulvas, would be the first of it’s kind in the world.
 
2) I have been asked by many Asian clients about what [‘normal’?] Asian genitals actually look like [add: “are ‘supposed’ to look like?’].
3) I have also found that the lack of sexual anatomical knowledge that causes a significant  percentage of the sexual difficulties people encounter.
4) The aim of this book is not to  reduce sexuality to only body parts, and ignore the spirituality of our being/sexuality. But rather, with this book, we hope to help and empower people with knowledge of their own and their partners’ bodies.   
5) Due to resource constraints, we are focusing on Asian depictions. 
  

6) A photo book featuring Asian vulvas would facilitate education, and healing around sexual inhibitions for many people, especially women.

WHAT IS THE MONEY FOR?
We’re raising funds to print 100 copies of the book at S$40 per book. We are absorbing the costs of design, storage and transcription of interviews with the models so that our fundraising money will go towards the design and printing of the actual book. We are offering each volunteer model a copy of the book as well as a high-resolution digital image of their choice. We are not paying ourselves for this work.

A WORD FROM THE AUTHOR DR MARTHA

I’ve been practising as the only Singaporean Chinese Clinical Sexologist with a doctorate in human sexuality in Singapore since April 2009. When I was in sex school (Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality), I was embarrassed to admit to myself (and to my classmates) that even though I am comfortable with my body and with expressing my sexuality – I didn’t know what “vulva” referred to, was confused between Vagina and Vulva, and knew even less about the different parts of the female sexual anatomy. 
It took me eight attempts researching numerous online websites, books, and various other resources to begin to make sense of all the different parts of the anatomy. 
What’s so confusing, you might ask? Well, for starters: there are not three “holes” (vagina, anus, and urethra) in the vulva (external female sex organs). The vulva includes the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, vestibular bulbs, vulval vestibule, urinary meatus, the vaginal opening, and Bartholin's and Skene's vestibular glands. One can visibly see seven “holes” if they knew where to look (Bartholin's and Skene's vestibular glands). What had added to my confusion was that there wasn’t a single anatomical diagram I could find that named every single part of the vulva!
 
If I was confused, there must be others who are too! I came across the seminal vulva photography book Petals by Dr. Nick Karras (USA) – capturing the variation and beauty that each woman possesses in sepia. Led by my intent to better support others, I started collecting vulva photography books around the world as a possible resource for my future clients. They include: I'll Show You Mine (Canada), and Heart of the Flower (Australia). I liked parts of, and disliked parts of each of these books. 
 
Yet none of these books stated the ethnicity of the vulva owner – by not making it a race thing, it didn’t answer one fundamental question: “Do I look different “down there” to other women like me?” I wanted a better vulva photography (and being Asian, an Asian) book! This was the same question my clients, especially my Asian female clients with Vaginismus (a condition where penetrative sex is difficult or impossible – usually due to fear of pain) asked – what is common or normal, and how am I different? I had no answer as we poured through these books together. Over the years, the desire to publish such a vulva book never left me. I explored with different photographers in Singapore but did not find anybody I could work with. Until Kelvin Lim introduced himself via e-mail. 
 
Before we arranged to meet, I looked him up and understood he was a seasoned and well-established portrait photographer who also does boudoir photography. How does he look like – not sleazy, I decided. When we met, he brought his wife and it was clear that their partnership was a complimentary one. As we explained our work and got to know another through, I finally shared… my long-time dream of a vulva book. Cautious about whether he is my photographer, “How interested are you to do this?” “200%” was the prompt reply. And so, our work began…

A WORD FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHER KELVIN

Early in my career, I was photographing clients with a highly-specific, pre-determined set of expectations - what to wear, what backdrop to use, where to shoot, how to pose. Four years on, with a strong portfolio and an established clientele, I began to question the purpose of my work. Why are people so focused on backdrops and shooting locations? Why are clients so concerned about their outfits, their makeup and hair, their poses? Why was I asked to photograph everything but the individual characters themselves, the real people?  
I began to find ways to simplify my portraits by minimising distractions, and maximising the expression of real feelings.  No fancy backdrops or poses, no fancy outfits.  Without distractions and props, all I had was light, and the person in front of me.  The only thing left to do was to start a conversation.

 
It was through these conversations that I discovered how people really felt.  It wasn’t just about getting great-looking shots that look pretty on the outside.  When people come for personal portraits, they’re asking, “How do I really look?” “Am I normal, or different?” “Can you show me how beautiful I can be?”

 
It is this emotional bond between a person and her portrait that kept me going for more than 16 years.  It was also for this reason that I was drawn to Dr Martha Tara Lee’s work.

 
When Dr Lee first expressed her idea of publishing a vulva book, and described one such photo-book showing the different forms of female genitalia, I was hesitant.  I didn’t want to be involved - again - in something that was simply graphic, decorative, and shallow.  However, as she explained what she liked and disliked about each such book she read - how she didn’t want the photographs to be dressed-up in distracting embellishments, how she loved the stories written by the women being photographed - it became clear that we both want something that connects emotionally to the reader. Furthermore, the book will be immensely useful for Dr Lee and many other professionals around the world in handling cases of Vaginismus - a condition which I never thought was so common, until I met Dr Lee and understood the work she does so passionately. 
The subject of this book can easily be misunderstood, especially in our Asian culture where the slightest hint of intimacy is considered taboo.  But there are real issues - both clinical and emotional - that can be addressed in this project, regardless of race or culture.  I cannot be more privileged for the opportunity to contribute to the work of Dr Lee.

 ABOUT KELVIN
Kelvin Lim was born in Singapore in 1971. In 2002, Kelvin left a promising IT career to be a wedding photographer. It was his first taste of life as a full-time artist. 

 
Despite enjoying great popularity and commercial success, Kelvin felt restricted by mass expectations of staged romance and surface beauty, and started questioning the authenticity of his own work. Beneath the gorgeous outfits, backdrops and poses, Kelvin sees a real person - a beauty waiting to be discovered. 

 
Driven by a desire to understand people as unique individuals, Kelvin started photographing people outside weddings. Instead of trying to get that “perfect” shot, he spent his time listening to people, one at a time. In an undecorated studio with plain backdrops and simple lights, Kelvin welcomed people of all race and status - from famous personalities to the common passers-by, from wealthy businessmen to the odd-job worker, from newly-weds to wrinkled old couples, from newborns tasting life, to the terminally ill. 

 
Kelvin’s subjects range beyond paying clients. Besides telling real-life stories of the less-privileged, Kelvin embraces the minorities, the lonely, and communities that conservative society considers taboo. In a career spanning 16 years thus far, he is heavily involved in several humanitarian projects, including: 

 

A major project with Home Nursing Foundation, culminating in an island-wide exhibition 
and a book of portraits of the elderly, and stories on the lives of the poor. 

 
An art residency with Exactly Foundation, documenting and telling real-life stories 
depicting the reality of caregiving in Singapore. 

 
An exhibition and a calendar of portraits for Breast Cancer Foundation, celebrating the 
beauty and courage of breast cancer survivors. 

 

Among Kelvin’s notable achievements was the Best Portrait Photography Award by Singapore Tatler, and being listed among Singapore’s finest services. 

 
Kelvin continues to express beauty through honest conversation and deep listening. In his own 
words: “We have an opportunity to give back to society every time we photograph someone—
anyone. The camera isn’t just a tool to capture the obvious. If we take the time and heart to 
listen and empathise, we will discover a beauty beneath how people look on the outside. It’s a wonderful blessing for us, as artists, to have this ability to touch people’s lives."" 




Kelvin Lim of www.kelvinlim.com.sg","* Search for Vulva Models - Our photo shoot began on Friday, 17 August, and to date we have completed photography sessions with 11 models. We aim to include at least 20 women in the book. It has been challenging enlisting vulva models, especially with Malay and Indian women, with a rejection rate of about 50%. Any Asian woman open to being a vulva model is encouraged to contact us. Each model will receive the printed book as well as a digital image of their choice.

* Publisher - We may well end up self-publishing the book. However, since the intention is to help women, especially Asian women, who wonder how their genitals look, we are actively seeking an international publisher. Any leads will be greatly appreciated.

* Cost of publishing - While the photographer Kelvin Lim and I (the interviewer/author) are volunteering our time, we are bracing ourselves for the costs involved in publishing such a book. We have promised each of the models a copy of the book, as well as our Kickstarter contributors of S$40 or more. With printing, bigger quantities will mean a lower cost but we do not relish storing lots of these books. 

* Other parts of the series in the works - We are committed to publishing an Asian breast book and an Asian penis book  as parts of the series. Any interested models, partners, sponsors, and funders are welcome.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 40 or more\n\nAbout US$ 29\n\n\n\nDonate {Un}Inhibited\n\n\nDonate a copy of the book {Un}Inhibited to any worthy person including the vulva models.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nFeb 2019\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 40 or more\n\nAbout US$ 29\n\n\n\nPurchase {Un}Inhibited\n\n\nPurchase a hard copy of the book {Un}Inhibited.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nFeb 2019\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 200 or more\n\nAbout US$ 143\n\n\n\nCounseling/ Coaching Session\n\n\nPurchase a life, relationship or sex counseling or coaching session conducted by Relationship Counselor and Clinical Sexologist Dr. Martha Tara Lee of Eros Coaching (usual S$250 for 50mins).\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 550 or more\n\nAbout US$ 392\n\n\n\nPhoto Shoot with Kelvin Lim\n\n\nInclusive of: an artistic portrait session for an individual or a couple (bespoke, not limited by time); makeup and hairstyling; 5 edited portraits in digital format with Kelvin Lim of http://www.kelvinlim.com.sg\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 1,000 or more\n\nAbout US$ 712\n\n\n\nBespoke event\n\n\nIf you like a talk relating to relationships, sexuality, or the book {Un}Inhibited, we'd be happy to work with you. 2 -3  hours.\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nFeb 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""}]",12.0,15

In the Shan state of Myanmar, where hardworking and heart-warming people live, national parks flourish and British architecture within townships abound, tourists are often welcomed not only to the impressive temples and the sight of occasional hot air balloons, but also to the people whose family values attract that human touch. Opening up to the world, tourism aside, Myanmar has plenty to offer, with farms of high quality produce coming from arable land abundant with fresh sources of water and nutrients. Hidden like a gem for some time, with Arabica coffee being a specialty of the Shan state, these quality farm produce would eventually find their way around the world. Improving export is the next step farmers look forward to. These beans are offered green, so that unique roasts could be experiment on. 







We bring you to Ngu Shwe Li, an excellent coffee farm on the scenic hill town of Pwin Oo Lwin. They farm and process coffee, with machinery and a healthy thriving circle of workers sweating to pull off the abundant harvest every season. Care for quality in the farm could only be described as professional and efficient, which could only give in to productivity that turns coffee cherries into packs of processed beans in large seasonal batches.







Moving on to Ywangan, which is located within the Taunggyi Township of the Shan State. Mountainous landscape fill the horizons, and greenery so lush it takes the mind a moment to process. Farms that not only strive on coffee plantations, at 1200 meters above sea level where the rain could only bring untainted minerals along with freshness of the air, that would nurture the best in any plant produce. Detail placed in organising the plantation, experienced farmers to cultivate delightful coffee shrubs, prudently interspersed amongst macadamia trees, and grown alongside dragon fruits, brings diversity to the soil and the propensity to infuse delightful character in the coffee cherry.







When produce exceeds processing ability of an individual farm, which happens. In the neighbouring area of these farms, a processing plant with both wet and dry processing facilities, regularly managed tanks and machinery scrub away in unison to humble the coffee cherry to its essence. Coffee seeds that are processed go thru selection and sorting, they are graded, packed and sold according to washed, honeyed or natural processed types, where meticulous processing would allow quality to increase after filtering where only the best of the batch survive till before packaging.







When lightly roasted, honey processed SL-34 beans would cup with flavours of nuts and citrus, and at medium roast a more chocolaty profile. The wash processed Ywangnan beans give clean nutty notes, while the peaberries bear hints of dark chocolate.Also, visit us at: http://heartofbeans.asiaMusic clips (video): foolboymedia_forest-song, setuniman_etude","After obtaining the requisite phytosanitary and various certifications, then bringing the beans into Singapore for a hastier delivery, shipping out to various countries remains a challenge. Having sourced for couriers, sorting out countries with import duties and setting an appropriate shipping cost, it is indeed challenging for a startup, but not impossible.

Created by mums, for mums, LoveAmme's TailorMade Pro was conceived over the years through talking with a lot of mums on our breastfeeding challenges and journeys. Being breastfeeding mums ourselves, we were deeply dissatisfied with current breast pumps as the painful issues mums encounter with breastfeeding continued to reduce us to tears. 
Because each woman's body and breastfeeding journey is unique, we decided to design a bespoke system tailored to each mum’s breast and breastfeeding need.

1 out of 10 women who breastfeed will experience mastitis, and even more will encounter clogged ducts. Symptoms of mastitis include swelling, flu-like symptoms, and pain when breastfeeding. Sore, cracked or bleeding nipples are also common grievances we have heard from mums. TailorMade Pro aids recovery from a range of painful issues through:
a. Individualised breast settings that enable mums to customise the pump session to each breast's condition;
b. Deep Expression Phase to clear blocked ducts and help you empty your breasts completely;
c. Custom-fit breast shields that ensure a near-perfect fit, thus increasing the effectiveness of each pump session.

























Breasts can be rock-hard when engorged, or tender to touch when infected. Our proprietary FlexSkin™ Breast Shields departs from hard, unfriendly plastic cups, and are made of 100% Food-Grade silicone. The soft material firmly, yet gently conforms to sensitive skin and breast contours to reduce spills. It is able to support pumping in semi-lying positions so mums can rest while they pump. Using individual settings for each breast, it can also aid mums with uneven supply to increase the milk production of the breast with lower yield.
Coupled with pliable silicone, our custom-fit FlexSkin™ Breast Shields increases comfort-levels with a massaging effect as gentle as expressing by hand, enabling mums to keep pumping and feeding through issues.

















 Despite its gentle suction, TailorMade Pro is one of the most powerful breast pumps available. Our FlexSkin™ breast shields make it possible for mums to select higher suction strengths when compared to hard breast shields. This enables mums to empty their breasts completely to stimulate more milk production. Using individual settings for each breast, it can also aid mums with uneven supply to increase the milk production of the breast with lower yield.

Developed by mums, for mums, the TailorMade Pro is a revolutionary breast pump system that truly solves problems encountered by mums, For seasoned mums, it offers unparalleled comfort and saves time. For first-time mums, its a life-saver.  

























While it is standard practice to put default breast shield sizes into every breast pump box, at LoveAmme™, we are appalled by the idea of having a “default” breast size, as it’s common for a woman to have two different breast sizes! 
Our FlexSkin™ Breast Shield comes in 5 sizes and is custom-fit to ensure each breast gets its most accurate size. It will even fit women with inverted or flat nipples, including those who cannot achieve a proper latch with their babies.









It's important to get the right size for each breast as this would enable the most efficient, most comfortable expression, and also reduce spillages. You can download the nipple ruler here and measure up!

At LoveAmme™, we don't sell milk bottles. TailorMade Pro enables you to pump directly into the bottle you want to feed with.

We have T-Joints that fit most of the world's leading wide-neck milk bottle brands, including Tommee Tippee, Philips Avent, Pigeon, MAM, NUK, Snapkis and Hegen (requires adaptor from Hegen).

What we need isn’t bravery from being back into a corner, what we need is resolve. Resolve is the ability to forge a path through the darkest night!









⠀⠀EPITAFFIO is a collaborative Oracle deck crafted by 48 passionate contributors around the world. In this, you will find that everyone on board are fans like you; people who have experienced the story through manga and/or anime, and have come together to create something that can be used on a daily basis, something that continues the love for these characters. With so much love poured into this project, we hope you’ll be able to see it in EPITAFFIO.
What is an Oracle Deck?
⠀⠀An oracle deck is a thematic card deck that can provide the readee answers and guidance regarding a certain inquiry among the topic the deck is crafted towards.
⠀⠀It differs from Tarot in that it does not follow a system strictly, and it can be anything because it is not bound by any rules. An oracle deck is what its creator designs it to be, so every oracle deck is different. And because an oracle deck is relatively unstructured, it can be an easier starting point for beginners. It can be used on its own or paired with tarot spreads, so it is a really flexible divination tool!
Why an Oracle Deck instead of a Tarot?
⠀⠀Other than the oracle deck’s accessibility to readers of any level, we saw that its freedom and unstructured nature would house our Part 5 characters best. Each character has their own unique symbolism and themes that would be limited under Tarot’s system, so we chose to create an oracle deck to be able to showcase the maximum possible potential of each of our beloved characters.

























⠀⠀EPITAFFIO features the writings and illustrations from 8 writers and 28 artists around the world. The messages this deck primarily holds pertain to inner growth, self-discovery, overcoming adversity, developing trust, and accepting the self to name a few, just like how our heroes evolved in their journey with their conviction and resolve.
⠀⠀Beginning as a 32-card deck that showcases major characters of Part 5, it is automatically upgradable to 40 cards through the stretch goal. We start off with the boy who has a dream, who eventually grows into his bloodline, then meeting the people who change his life as he does theirs. As his journey unfolds, so do the people he meets get depicted in the deck. 









⠀⠀The cards will measure 70x120mm (standard tarot size), and be printed on 350gsm white core paper, with a matte varnish finish. Gilded edges for the cards is available for upgrade as another stretch goal. The deck will be housed in a two-piece rigid box, with the cover designed by Lanhacy!


THE GUIDEBOOK









⠀⠀The accompanying guidebook is a 72-page book that comes in PDF version with every purchase of the deck. Inside contains each card’s individual artwork and its interpretation, plus unique spreads that can be used with this Oracle deck.
⠀⠀The guidebook is also available in physical copy as a SGD$21/USD$15 ADD-ON.









⠀⠀The guidebook will be printed as a 148x210mm perfect-bound paperback on 170gsm matte paper stock, complete with a matte cover. The paper stock and size of the physical book are available for upgrade as stretch goals. 
⠀⠀Every physical copy of the guidebook comes with a bookmark designed by Dyalexa.

















⠀⠀Our talented contributors have helped to manifest this deck. With their love for these characters and this project, they worked hard to bring EPITAFFIO to life.  For the full list of contributors with their portfolio links, please visit our Carrd!









































































⠀⠀We have prepared some stretch goals in order to keep moving forward in our journey! These goals include improving the quality of the items offered. This project wouldn’t have been possible without the interest and support of many of you all these months, so we hope to give back as much as you all have given us!









⠀⠀★⠀Deck expansion — Unlocks at SGD$4,325. When the goal is met, every order placed for the deck will automatically be upgraded to 40 cards at no extra cost!
⠀⠀★⠀Gilded card edges — Unlocks at SGD$7,220. When the goal is met, all 40 cards of the deck will get a gilded edge finish at no extra cost!
⠀⠀★⠀Free acrylic charm — Unlocks at SGD$10,315. When the goal is met, every order placed on bundles with physical merch (Crescita and Sogno bundles) will get an additional charm at no extra cost!
⠀⠀★⠀Paper stock upgrades — Unlocks at SGD$15,900. When the goal is met, the Guidebook will be upgraded to have a soft-touch cover along with thicker paper, and A5 prints will be produced on a thicker card stock.
⠀⠀★⠀Physical guidebook size upgrade — Unlocks at SGD$24,780. When the goal is met, all orders with physical guidebooks will be upgraded from A5 to A4 size at no extra cost!









PAYMENT INFORMATION
⠀⠀Kickstarter works with most major-brand credit and debit cards worldwide that allow international payments.
⠀⠀If the project were to not be successfully funded, Kickstarter’s system would not charge your credit card for your pledge amount. Your card will only be charged if the campaign is successful and we have reached our main goal of funding the project.
⠀⠀In the payment section, you can pick up the physical guidebook with the bookmark as an add-on to your pledged bundle.









⠀⠀★⠀I don’t have a credit/debit card but still want to purchase. What can I do?
⠀⠀If the campaign is successful, we will be opening a preorder period on Etsy for backorders (duration to be announced later). Etsy allows alternate payment methods such as Paypal. If you happen to miss this period, in the future we will be selling the leftovers in the store as well.
⠀⠀* Take note that we will be offering within the bundles the stretch goals that get unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.
⠀
IMPORTANT FOR UK CUSTOMERS
⠀⠀We are NOT able to accept any physical orders from the United Kingdom (UK) at this time due to the recent changes, as of January 2021, made to their VAT regulations. If you are a UK customer during this leftover sale period, we will unfortunately be refunding your pledge. For more information, please visit the UK government guidance website discussing VAT taxes in overseas businesses.
⠀⠀UK customers can wait until the backorder period since Etsy’s platform allows us to manage VAT from purchases.
⠀
⠀⠀★⠀Can I choose to pledge later instead then?
⠀⠀We highly advise against it unless you truly have no means to pledge to Kickstarter, since it could affect the development and success of the campaign itself and the stretch goals to be unlocked. We hope you understand and lend us cooperation in these matters.
⠀⠀Backorder period is meant to be for people who: 

  Don’t have any payment method accepted by Kickstarter; 
  Are from the UK due to VAT regulations; or, 
  Happened to find the project late after the campaign closed and still wish to pre-order.

 










SHIPPING INFORMATION
⠀⠀Backers will be charged for shipping after the campaign successfully ends. When filling out your information please ensure that your address is correct and valid when we prepare to ship backer orders out.
⠀⠀We will be shipping from the United States with the United States Post Office (USPS). Backers will receive their orders and be provided with tracking numbers after our production is complete and we ensure that all items are of the utmost quality. We will make sure all backers are aware of when our shipping period begins.
⠀⠀If you need to request an address change before the shipping period begins, please inform us as early as possible so that we will have an adequate amount of time to correct your address.









GENERAL INFORMATION
⠀⠀This is a general idea of what will happen once this Kickstarter campaign ends, for those who may be unfamiliar with the process. 









Please refer to the FAQ section for more questions answered!","-All items are finalized and need time to be produced and shipped by our manufacturers. Further details listed below, we will keep backers aware of our current status if the campaign is successful.

Hi, my name is Aria. I am a first-time author, a mother of two, and wife to the adventurous hubby! We love nature so much that we spend most of our time outdoors with the kids. We have thrived and grown so much through interacting with nature.
In return, I wrote the story Jojo to raise awareness in kids to protect our nature.  
INTRODUCTION
Jojo is a fiction picture book about getting along with the wildlife. The main character, Jojo, is a special girl who can speak to animals. In the story, she solves the conflict between her brother and the animals. Her special ability has also brought her to the treasure keeper of the rainforest. 



Jojo's father hunted animals for his family.








Jojo is strange among her people because she doe not eat meat.








She accidentally discovered her ability to talk to animal








Abhi need to learn to get along with the animals.





*It is a 30 pages fully illustrated digital picture book, best for age 6 and above. 









The main character, Jojo, is based on the image of my daughter, Boo. Jojo is the virtual image of Boo, who is going on a mission to save the rainforest.
Watch the story of Boo here. 









Jojo is UNIQUE, LOVING and BRAVE. 
Jojo is UNIQUE among her people, because she doesn't eat meat. That is because she wants to protect the animal. Jojo is LOVING. She risked her life to save her brother from the animal. Jojo is BRAVE to negotiate with the animals when she was rescuing her brother.
We hope to bring the positive energy to kids all around the world!
 OUR MISSION 









We want to raise awareness in kids to protect mother nature through the picture book Jojo. We would like to encourage kids to immerse themselves in mother nature as well.
Besides that, we also pay attention to kid’s wellbeing. We want to encourage kids to be unique, courageous, and adventurous at the same time.
 CONTRIBUTE TO Mother Nature 









Rainforests are an important part of life on our planet. They provide us with the air we breathe, and they are home to plants and animals too. Yet, towards the end of 2019 and the start of 2020, forest fires started to destroy the forests of the Amazon, Australia, and Indonesia.
We have lost several forests within half a year, but to regrow a forest takes decades. With all the forest we have lost, the time to start regrowing them is now.
Half of your pledge will go to Danau Girang Field Centre (DGFC). DGFC is a collaborative research centre located in the east coast of Sabah and dedicated to the applied conservation of tropical ecosystems and the effective management of wildlife in a fragmented landscape. FOLLOW THEM HERE.
By repairing areas of rainforest, we will be increasing forest connectivity which is an essential part of saving the orangutan and other endangered species.
Danau Girang Field Centre will manage the donation and use our donation to regrow the rainforest on appropriate sites.
The number of trees planted will be monitored and reported back. Danau Girang Field Centre will track the growth of the planted trees. We will get the updates on the amount of carbon taken out of the atmosphere, as well as other social, environmental, and economic impacts.
EXTRA VALUE!!!!









 We decided to go green this time. We do not want to cut down any tree to print our book since we are going to regrow the rainforest. 
In addition to thank you for supporting our Kickstarter project, we will be adding another ebook in the pledge!
Jojo features indigenous people, Sun Bear, Clouded Leopard, Proboscis Monkey, Orangutan, and some other endangered animals. Your pledge will include an ebook that introduces the endangered animals of Borneo that were featured in Jojo.
Let’s learn about the endangered animals of Borneo with Jojo!

about OFFWIIGO OFFWIIGO is a multi-functional and stylish bag brand based and developed in Singapore. Our main priority was to offer a high-quality utility bag for both boys and girls. We specifically developed cross body bags that can also be worn as a belt bag, that is suitable for a casual day out and when traveling.behind OFFWIIGO 
The idea to specifically build a cross body bag brand is because, cross body bags are still considered frivolous by the majority, but has a unique appearance to me. Somehow the cross body bag seems very practical and brings a different character and fashion out of me. I wanted my hands on one of these bags. My search was halted when I found that the cross body bags I wanted are either too expensive or extremely hard to purchase during to its exclusivity. When finding cheaper alternatives, I was sad to see there were only functional cross body bags that weren’t stylish. Rather than to continue my search I set a plan to create my own cross body bag and bring my personality into the brand.Features and SpecsAll of OFFWIIGO’s cross body bags are multifunctional, in a sense that it can be worn on both the chest and waist. With two options, you can pull off two different looks with just the one piece.





OFFWIIGO is made with Nylon, to protect the interior from rain and water. Every bag is built with a compartment inside the bag, that easily fits an iPhone plus models. There are many compartments in the bag that fits travel documents and everyday necessities such as passport, cigarette pack and power bank.All three designs of OFFWIIGO are available in three different colors; Black, Blue and Olive. All three styles comes in three different sizes. OFFWIIGO1’s size is 10.5”W x 7.5”H x 3.5”D OFFWIIGO2’s size is 10.5”W x 7.5”H x 3”D OFFWIIGO3’s size is 11”W x 6.5”H x 4.2”DHOW WE BEGAN

As someone who's navigating a rewarding but demanding career and still relatively new at married life, I found Thought Bubbles to be a wonderful tool, helping me  to take an aerial view of how I (and others) see myself - but also a close look at what these perceptions mean and how they can shift and change over time. It's easy to play but throws up deep questions along the way. I can't wait to share this with more of my friends and family."" - Corrie Tan, Writer and Researcher.""I got these cards because I think they would be a really fun and tangible way to talk about helpful and unhelpful thoughts with the kids. I already have a few clients in mind whom I can use them with!"" - Alyssa, Clinical Psychologist.





Thought Bubbles is a 56-card deck featuring 7 endearing characters that represent different ways of thinking. Created by a team of psychologists, it offers:
a hands-on way to help children and adults notice and choose their thoughts
a fun activity for family and friends 
an excellent resource for counsellors and therapists
a platform for self-discovery and growth 
As psychologists, we recognise that thoughts are closely tied to the way we feel, act and respond to the situations that occur in our lives.
 There are many types of helpful and unhelpful thoughts but in our line of work, we have found that the Worrier, Victim, Judge and Controller thoughts are especially salient in conditions of stress, anxiety, depression and anger, and often lead to poor self-confidence and low self-esteem. 








When helping people cope with difficult situations and the thoughts and feelings that come with them, psychologists use a range of interventions and approaches.
Some of these interventions include stepping away from the situation, noticing thoughts and feelings with an open mind, considering different ways to see and approach the problem, acceptance and letting go, being kind to self and others, and viewing experiences as opportunities for learning and growth. These ideas and techniques are embodied in the Observer, Problem Solver and Healer thought profiles. 








 There are so many ways to use the cards. These are just THREE examples:
Penny for Your Thoughts
The aim of this activity is to be more aware of your current helpful and unhelpful thoughts – how they impact your life, where they may have come from, and to consider if change may be helpful.

From the pile of cards, pick 5 that best represent how you view the world.
Have a discussion with someone you trust on any of the following – (i) how these thoughts have impacted the way you deal with the world; (ii) how these thoughts came about; and (iii) to consider the possibility of substituting 1 card with another, to cope with the world in a more helpful way.
You can keep a representation of that card with you and notice if it impacts the way you deal with the world.     
​ 
You can also have another person pick 5 cards that best represents how that person views you, and then have a discussion on the difference between how you see yourself and how that person see you. However, this additional suggestion is not recommended in situations where there is some tension between yourself and that person.

Thought Swop
The aim of this game is to collect 1 card from each of the 7 thought profiles to form a set of 7 cards from different profiles. 

Shuffle all the cards and deal out 7 cards to each player.
Starting with player to the left of the dealer, each player picks a card from his hand and tells a short story that is related to the thought without showing the card. 
After each player's turn, other players can then request to swop that card with one of theirs.
The storytelling and exchange of cards continue until one player has accumulated a set of 7 cards from each of the 7 thought profiles. This player is the winner.

Spare a Thought
 
The aim of this game is to be the first to clear all the cards in your hand.
 

Shuffle all the cards.
Deal out 7 cards to each player. Put the rest in a deck in the centre of the table. 
The player to the left of the dealer starts by putting down a card. The next player puts down another card that is in a different thought profile. Subsequent players have to put down cards that are not in the same thought profiles as the ones already on the table. If a player does not have a suitable card, he has to take a card from the deck and keep it in his hand. 
Once thoughts from all 7 profiles have been placed on the table, the set is put aside and a new set starts. 
The winner is the first player who clears all the cards in his hand.

With so many ways to play, the versatility of these cards is limited only by your imagination. Think out of the box!","We are a team of 5 psychologists and a 12 year old artist-in-the-making. It has been several months of working through the concept, completing the artwork and refining every detail to make it a product that we just can't wait to get our hands on. We are so excited that our card game will be coming to you soon!

Please note that while these cards were created by psychologists and may be used as a tool in therapy, they should not be used as a substitute for therapy.

A big buck tooth dinosaur who is loved by many children all around the world. Bucky is a character I have been drawing since 15, and I have always dreamed about doing a children's picture book series with him as the main character. Thanks to Kickstarter, my dream came true when I published my first children's book ""Bucky The Dino"". This campaign is the second book from the Bucky The Dino series.  









Bucky The Dino Goes Green
Bucky loves exploring! But one day, as he was having a snack during his exploration, his sandwich wrapper dropped to the ground. Mr Robin saw and told him, ""It's time for you to go green!"" 
Join Bucky on adventure to find out what going green means and how you can join him on this journey when you purchase the book!









The story is for children ages 3-8, as it focuses on harnessing the love for nature and actions they can take on to help this planet. At this age, it is best for parents to focus on strengthening their child’s relationship with nature and making them aware of what is around them. So when they grow older, they would have cultivated a habit of protecting the world and appreciating the beauty of nature.

























The story follows Bucky on his journey to find out what going green means. It covers three main learnings – The earth being our home, what are the 3 Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) and shows examples on how to do it, lastly how to plant and care for a seed. 

















At the end of the book, your children will receive a special Bucky's Go Green Club membership card on the last page, where they can make a pledge by filling in their name and commit to going green! The end of the book also includes a glossary and an infographic with environmental terms and their meanings so they can easily refer to it if they do not remember.









They can also immediately apply what they learn with the items provided in the Bucky's Go Green Club reward.  

















THE GARDENING KIT: The Go green club includes all the items and instructions you need to create your own plant terrarium and a monster recycling bin out of recyclable materials.
For the plant terrarium: Plant the seed paper in the container and use the air dry clay to create clay figures to go along with it. A detailed video tutorial on how to build a Bucky clay figure is included.
For the monster recycling bin: Learn about the different recyclable materials in the PDF environment activity booklet and scavenge for these recyclable materials to build your own monster recycling bin. A detailed video tutorial on how to build one is included. 




Example of plant terrarium and monster recycling bin 













Climate change is a world problem that we all face. We as adults have to play our part to tackle the issue and one of the best things adults can do is to educate young children about how vital it is for us to play our part to help the Earth. After much research, I learnt that many parents want to talk to their kids about caring for the environment but do not know not how and where to start. So I thought what better way to teach kids through a fun and interesting story. 




























Details of items in the go green club reward package





































Writing, drawing and working with children is my passion. As I continue my journey a self-published author illustrator, I hope to find more ways to help bring awareness to important issues that children face through books. I also hope that Bucky can become an icon of positivity to everyone in the world. With your help, we can make this book happen and share this fantastic story so that many children will not only enjoy reading it, but also understand the importance of taking care of our environment.

Why wear an automatic watch? 
Mechanical watches have hundreds of tiny gears moving together as one and are characterised by the smooth glide of the seconds hand across the watch face. They are powered by hand-winding and in the case of an automatic like ours, the motions of the wearer's wrist are converted into energy by means of a rotor and powers the watch- there are no batteries in our watches! 
Generally, the world of mechanical watches is a niche market, and one dominated by men. Mechanical wristwatches comprise only 3% of the international watch market, out of which three-quarters comprises men’s watches. This means that less than 1% of watches in the world comprise of ladies mechanical wristwatches. We hope to introduce women to the beauty of mechanical watches and change the way women wear and think about watches, one watch at a time!

Rewards
Select a reward for any watch(es) in our collection. You will receive a survey to specify the model, colour and strap afterwards. 

























Can't decide between the metal bracelet and Italian calf leather strap? Why not get both since our straps are inter-changeable anyway! Or, get an additional strap. 
After you select your reward, manually add US$60 / S$80 to your pledge amount for each additional strap. We will contact you to select the colour of the strap and buckle after the campaign ends. 
Production Schedule
We will deliver the watches worldwide by May 2020.

About our founder  




Sherrie Han, Founder of The Eliana Timekeeper





I started The Eliana Timekeeper as a passion project and it has now taken on a life of its own. It was difficult for me to find a mechanical watch that I liked or could afford; the options available were either too masculine or overly-decorated. Most of my friends were unaware of the difference between a mechanical and a quartz watch, while those who were aware, felt that mechanical/ automatic watches were either too expensive or chunky. This is why I wanted to make my own watch- to introduce more women to mechanical watches. The watches are named after my firstborn,  and I hope you'll enjoy our watches as much as I know she will.
If you have any thoughts or queries, feel free to reach me directly at sherrie@elianatimekeeper.com. You can also view our media kit here. I hope you'll enjoy our watches!
                                                                                                Yours Sincerely, Sherrie Han

An in-house support capability has also been established to handle the rare occurrence of any mechanical/ workmanship issues on our end, meaning your warranty is well-validated.

Import Duty & VAT will be an additional cost for some countries. We do not take responsibility for any additional cost incurred that is subjected to your countries import rules and regulations.

Delays in manufacturing are the biggest challenge. We have mitigated the risk of delay by launching our Kickstarter with a limited-edition run of only 360 watches. This small production run allows us to have greater quality control over each timepiece and the manufacturing timeline. 

Customs delays are another challenge- we will keep you updated if we face any unexpected delays here!","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 10 or more\n\nAbout US$ 8\n\n\n\nVirtual High-Five\n\n\nGet campaign updates, join the Eliana Timekeeper email newsletter list, and get access to special pricing on our products.\n\nContact us directly for special pricing if you'd like to pledge more than 2 Twilight Glint watches.\n\nPledge price approx:\n\n~ USD 7.5 / EUR 7\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 480 or more\n\nAbout US$ 344\n\n\n\nKICKSTARTER SPECIAL (Silver & Linen)\n\n\nOne Twilight Glint in Silver or Linen\n\n*Kickstarter Pricing\n\n*Individually numbered\n\n*Choose: Void black or Vintage linen dial\n\n*Choose: Metal bracelet OR Italian calf leather strap\n\nPledge price approx:\n\n~ USD 355 / EUR 319\n\nSAVE: ~S$320 OFF FUTURE RETAIL PRICE\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (166 left of 170)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 499 or more\n\nAbout US$ 357\n\n\n\nKICKSTARTER SPECIAL (Rosegold)\n\n\nOne Twilight Glint in Rosegold\n\n*Kickstarter Pricing\n\n*Individually numbered\n\n*Choose: Metal bracelet OR Italian calf leather strap\n\nPledge price approx:\n\n~ USD 370 / EUR 332\n\nSAVE: ~S$320 OFF FUTURE RETAIL PRICE\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (122 left of 130)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 865 or more\n\nAbout US$ 619\n\n\n\nKICKSTARTER DOUBLE (Silver & Linen)\n\n\nTwo Twilight Glints in Silver and/or Linen\n\n*Lower than Early Bird Pricing\n\n*Individually numbered\n\n*Choose: Void black or Vintage linen dial\n\n*Choose: Metal bracelet OR Italian calf leather strap\n\nPledge price approx:\n\n~ USD 667 / EUR 598\n\nSAVE: ~S$710 OFF FUTURE RETAIL PRICE\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (7 left of 10)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 879 or more\n\nAbout US$ 629\n\n\n\nKICKSTARTER DOUBLE (Rosegold)\n\n\nTwo Twilight Glints in Rosegold\n\n*Lower than Early Bird Pricing\n\n*Individually numbered\n\n*Choose: Metal bracelet OR Italian calf leather strap\n\nPledge price approx:\n\n~ USD 651 USD / EUR 584\n\nSAVE: ~S$710 OFF FUTURE RETAIL PRICE\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 backers\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (6 left of 10)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 460 or more\n\nAbout US$ 329\n\n\n\nEARLY BIRD (Silver & Linen)\n\n\nOne Twilight Glint in Silver or Linen\n\n*Early bird pricing\n\n*Individually numbered\n\n*Choose: Void black or Vintage linen dial\n\n*Choose: Metal bracelet OR Italian calf leather strap\n\nPledge price approx:\n\n~ USD 340 / EUR 305\n\nSAVE: ~S$320 OFF FUTURE RETAIL PRICE\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n5 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 480 or more\n\nAbout US$ 344\n\n\n\nEARLY BIRD (Rosegold)\n\n\nOne Twilight Glint in Rosegold\n\n*Early bird pricing\n\n*Individually numbered\n\n*Choose: Metal bracelet OR Italian calf leather strap\n\nPledge price approx:\n\n~ USD 355 / EUR 319\n\nSAVE: ~S$320 OFF FUTURE RETAIL PRICE\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n5 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 872 or more\n\nAbout US$ 624\n\n\n\nKICKSTARTER DOUBLE (Mix)\n\n\nTwo Twilight Glints: One Rosegold + One Silver or Linen\n\n*Lower than Early Bird Pricing\n\n*Individually numbered\n\n*Choose: Void black OR Vintage linen dial \n\n*Choose: Metal bracelet OR Italian calf leather strap for both watches\n\nPledge price approx:\n\n~ USD 646 / EUR 579\n\nSAVE: ~S$710 OFF FUTURE RETAIL PRICE\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nMay 2020\n\n\nShips to\nAnywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\nReward no longer available\n\n\n\n\n10 backers""}]",9.0,14

SYSTEM-01 - Equipment For Navigating An Evolving Environment









THE BEGINNING
Since the beginning of humanity, what we wear have always imbued us with protective qualities, from weather conditions (physical) and perceptions by society (psychological). We are going back to this fundamental quality of clothes — to explore and evolve the protective qualities of what we wear according to our evolved environment. We started with this question to help us define the scope of this project: how are we able to reimagine what we wear to better navigate this current climate?









We have already been developing protection-driven products what we thought could help individuals commute better. From the start, we wanted to realise a wonder material, Graphene, that we discovered two years ago, into a product. Extensive sourcing took us through many forms of graphene on the market. Finally, we have discovered a blend that can boast performance and comfort that is completely aligned with our objectives in this scenario.

















Together with our team of experienced tailors, we crafted these fabrics into a system of three highly functional garments - a short-sleeve T-Shirt, a long-sleeve turtle neck T-Shirt, and a technical hoodie/jacket to form this starting launch. This utility-driven drop forms the foundation pieces for readying any wardrobe for our lives in our new future. Every face covering within this series has been integrated with an additional layer of replaceable filter.


Pro Techwear - Evolved Techwear That Protects
SYSTEM-01 is techwear that is meant to improve the existing protective functions of the garments by imbuing it with antimicrobial and antiviral technology (With respect to Kickstarter's new guidelines and regulations, do visit our website for a detailed breakdown of the technology). Even as you are reading this, the work continues - we continue to improve our products, with the central objective around creating products that helps individuals better navigate the changes in our current evolving environment.











Important: 
These products are not medical/health devices or personal protective equipment to prevent the current viral threats and are not substitutes for following the relevant social distancing guidelines which include practicing good personal hygiene, such as frequently washing your hands and not touching your face. 
Please adhere the rules and safety regulations set by your respective medical and scientific authorities at all times. Archetype Equipment makes no claims about the medical benefits of using this product.


Thyra - Short-Sleeved T-Shirt
Made with graphene-infused yarns and embedded with an expandable side  seam zip, Thyra conceals an inner travel pocket for ease of access and security, designed for mobility and as a base layer for a life that is constantly on the move.

















Leja - Long-Sleeved T-Shirt w/ Built-In Mask
Constructed with a combination of Graphene and Sorona, and lined with copper-ion infused yarns at strategic areas, the Leja incorporates a built-in mask/snood that not only shields the wearer against airborne liquid particles from the external environment, but also doubles up as a heat regulating neck warmer when unfolded.

















Hakaan - Technical Jacket/Hoodie w/ Detachable Mask
The Hakaan is developed with a removable mask/snood and a hood integrated with a moulded visor for additional protection against the harmful elements of the environment (e.g. UV rays). Packable and modular in nature, the jacket is adapted for the current needs and integrable with future Archetype products.

















ENGINEERED GRAPHENE GARMENTS
We hate to admit it but like everybody else, we do not like wearing a mask. It is cumbersome and inconvenient but it saves lives. Masks have become increasingly important accessories for us to protect ourselves in the current pandemic. Created with the primary objective of providing accessibility and enhanced protection against the harmful elements of our current external environment, System-01 focuses on the leveraging on the protective properties of Graphene, Copper and Titanium Dioxide while extending functionalities well beyond our current challenges. Every garment has been crafted with its own unique features to drive utility and performance for your daily commute. We have even included copper-ion infused lining at strategic areas on Leja and Hakaan (as indicated) to improve the facial shielding of the user against threats from our external environment.

















System-01 is just one of many systems that will be introduced into Archetype's future range of designs. Continual improvements will be made to the system through the development of new add-ons and products as we reiterate our products to better serve your evolving needs.

































These gears are designed to fit both genders. For woman's sizing, just  order a size down (e.g. if you usually wear a size S, order an XS).  Please refer to the following table for a more concise fit.









If you have any additional questions about the sizing and fit, do let us know via emailing us at help@archetypeeqmt.com.









Like most black garments, we recommend you to wash with like colours and  mild detergent on cold. Do not tumble dry and line dry instead. Do not iron and do not dry clean. Do not bleach or use fabric softeners as  these chemicals will damage the structure of the graphene and the integrity of the fabric and additional coating.













About Archetype
Archetype is built upon a foundation of overcoming adversities and an innate curiosity around new technology and  advanced materials. We believe that innovation happens as a response to extraordinary circumstances and we are defying the status quo to enable individuals in realising their human potential by pushing the boundaries of technological applications and material evolution.


We are driven and united by the pursuit of utility and performance, advancing human potential by pushing the boundaries of technological applications and material evolution. We are redefining how we interact with and solve problems within a rapidly shifting environment.","Our team has a combined of more than 50 years of experience manufacturing garments and international business. It has definitely taken some time for us to put the team together, to ensure that we will be able to deliver you a quality product at the end of the campaign. We are extremely confident of our partners and have done extensive sampling and testing with them to ensure that we are able to do right by our supporters/backers.

We are definitely expecting obstacles along the way during production. But like any other adversity, we are going overcome these hurdles. The most important thing for us to you backers is communication. We will communicate to you clearly when any problem arises, and in a transparent manner. We will provide you the reassurance with our updates to inform you on our phases of developing solutions to resolve the issues.

Supply Chain:

We are working with numerous suppliers and specialists to ensure the highest quality of the product is made before assembling it together in Singapore. Especially with the ongoing trade war between China and USA and the pandemic, we are navigating the different trade routes and larger volume manufacturers (should the need arises) in order to ensure that we are able to deliver the items to you at the lowest cost possible. Fabric delays are the norm in this industry due to customs issues but we have set a time buffer for us to resolve that. There will always be a contingency plan.

We are determined to spearhead this revolution towards tinier, thinner wallets, without compromising style, utility and storage.


We created a design to fit your everyday-carry into and brought it to life using full-grain smooth leather. The wallet is not only thinner than most and minimally larger than the size of the card, the pull-tab function of the wallet allows you to instantly access your cards, avoiding that awkward moment when a waiter waits for you to whip out your credit card. 


Any contribution at all will take us a step nearer towards fulfilling our dream of revolutionising the everyday-carry industry by helping us with the capital required to achieve such a goal.

We’ve all experienced the problems lost socks brings. The rush, the fuss and the never ending madness; in search of that runaway sock. Why are socks designed only to look good with their other half? That’s exactly what we thought.

Missing Socks a norm?







The mystery of missing socks have been around for ages.Many even try wearing only 1 type of sock to combat the issue. Regardless the solution, it’s almost impossible to keep track of every single sock we own. To err is human and losing socks might just be part of our genetics - think about it.Fret not, here's something just for youIntroducing...

WE'RE 100% FUNDED (AND COUNTING!)
TIME FOR SOME STRETCH GOALS!









REWARDS UPDATE!
Hey there! We're overwhelmed by our backers' support and decided to sweeten the deal for some of our reward tiers by including some new stuff - no extra charge, completely free (including for everyone who has already bought these tiers)!
ALL TIERS FROM $150 AND ABOVE (STARTING FROM THE SENIOR DETECTIVE TIER) WILL NOW INCLUDE A NEW REWARD:




There was an urgency in his voice. He said he was fine, but his nervous tone gave me an inkling that he was in danger...





AND BECAUSE OF POPULAR DEMAND, OUR SOLD-OUT TIER, TALKING SUPER SLEUTH, IS BACK IN THE FORM OF A NEW TIER: LOQUACIOUS SUPER SLEUTH! THIS TIER, ALONG WITH ALL HIGHER SUCCEEDING TIERS, WILL ALSO INCLUDE A NEW REWARD:




Dubai, Mexico City, Jakarta... the souvenir magnets on her refrigerator hinted at a life well travelled. I wonder where she disappeared to this time...





We can't update the descriptions of the old reward tiers, but rest assured it'll be part of the respective tiers. Please check out the FAQ for more info.




























Just some of the news and content outlets that have covered Chinatown Detective Agency.





            

          

The world is in flux, as the global economy nears the nadir of its decade-long collapse
Singapore stands as a last refuge of order but even here the government struggles on the brink of chaos. Private detectives are now the first call for those citizens able to afford a semblance of justice.




Amira Darma, the game's protagonist, is no thug. But she's no pushover either...





That’s where you come in. You are Amira Darma, once a rising star at INTERPOL, now a freshly minted Private Investigator in the heart of Chinatown, and your first client is about to walk through your door...




Old mentors make great first customers.





























































From the studio behind indie game Terroir, Chinatown Detective Agency is a cybernoir point and click adventure blending stunning retro design with innovative mechanics. Manage your agency and use real world research to solve cases as you unravel a global conspiracy.
Inspired by the classic Carmen Sandiego games of the 80s and 90s, Chinatown Detective Agency is a mystery adventure game that will take you across Singapore and the world in hot pursuit of criminals, witnesses and clues. Solve puzzles and uncover leads using real research and investigation, and manage your time and money to solve cases from clients both well-intentioned and nefarious.
Along the way, untangle a web of conspiracies and plots that threaten to push the Lion City over the edge.
Unravel a global conspiracy
Explore a rich cybernoir future of mystery and intrigue in a world inspired by Blade Runner, The Da Vinci Code and Black Mirror. Travel the globe from your base in Singapore in search of leads, and talk with dozens of uniquely voiced characters each with their own mysterious agendas. 




Sometimes, the clues hide in plain sight.








Not every door is open to Amira. But that's nothing a little hacking can't solve.





A story with multiple outcomes depending on which client you decide to help
Nothing’s ever simple in Singapore. What starts as a routine recon job might be the spark that ignites this whole city. Your choices matter: do you side with the shadowy underworld informant, or root out corruption for a junior politician? In Chinatown Detective Agency, the cases you choose will tell a story all their own, for better...or for worse.




As a private detective, Amira will need to be ready for any situation - including potentially dangerous ones.





Real-world research
Leads and clues are the lifeblood of the detective. In Chinatown Detective Agency, each piece of evidence affects the outcome of your cases, and many puzzles require real investigation through internet research, code breaking and more.




Research. Decipher. Uncover truths. Rinse and repeat.





Although most of the main quest can be finished entirely in-game, if you want to earn your stripes, you’ll have to dig a little deeper. Solving side quests will require genuine investigation, from googling clues, checking an encyclopedia or scouring a map, meaning you’re not just playing an investigator, you’ll have to become one yourself. 
 Work smart (and never skip a meal) 
For a P.I., time is a precious resource. The daily grind of the working Joe is a one-way ticket to fatigue, and tasks have a funny way of taking longer as you tire. It's up to you to make good use of the time you have and to keep your agency, and yourself, alive.
If Amira forgets to take a break, her energy and focus is going to crash. Luckily, there’s the Endurance meter to help you keep tabs. Go too long without food or rest and watch as everything grinds to a halt, quick as a case without leads.




Endurance plays an important role in how well Amira can perform her duties.





Replenish yourself by travelling to the city's best hawkers for a delicious local dish, but remember that nothing in this town is free - some items can turn a budding new detective into a down-on-their-luck bum in the space of a meal.




Restoring Endurance with a hearty local dish is all part of the game.





Assemble a team
You’re new to the P.I. game, but over time you’re bound to make contacts, build a network, maybe even hire some staff. Part of owning your very own private detective agency is having the right kind of support on deck, whether it's an admin assistant to help organise your bills for you and run the office while you're away, or an eager young researcher trying to make a name for themselves.




You never know who you'll meet in Chinatown Detective Agency, so keep an eye out for potentially useful characters.





Chasing down leads and gathering up evidence may pay the bills, but Amira’s not just a detective: she’s a businesswoman. You’ll need to keep your staff happy, and the office running smoothly.
Lose yourself in the future
Neon lamp-light reflected in pools of rainwater. Anti-government graffiti daubed across aging subways. The encroaching murk of riverside London. Explore 30 stunningly rendered tableaus from artist Ricardo Juchem and immerse yourself in the chaotic future of 2032.




Following leads will take you deep into the underbelly of future Singapore.













The game will feature over 30 locations across Singapore and around the world. Travelling is a fundamental part of any detective’s toolkit, so you'll be taking Amira to different cities and locations worldwide.
In Singapore itself, you'll travel to various places inspired by real world locations.




Singapore's Chinatown








The historic Civic District of Singapore








The side streets of Geylang 





Each main location may have a number of sub-locations within, meaning more people and objects for Amira to investigate.




The locations in the game will come alive with NPCs, both human and factory-assembled.





Amira’s no slouch, but even Singapore can be a big place when you're traveling on foot. Getting around efficiently will mean taking the extensive MRT train system that crisscrosses the island.




Travel across the island through the rapidly deteriorating but still-functioning MRT system of Singapore.





Missions will also take you to different locales in every continent around the world. Luckily, the game's HORUS flight booking system is there to make grabbing that last minute red-eye as easy as falling out of bed.




Chinatown Detective Agency is a globe-trotting adventure - and you can't globe-trot without booking your flight tickets. Just keep in mind flights cost money, so make sure you double check your leads to avoid wasted flights.








Inspired by the classic Carmen Sandiego games, you'll be traveling the world as you pursue one lead after another.








The blinding lights of Dotonbori, Osaka








Drones fly past Galata Tower in Istanbul at sundown








The Petronas Towers shine like a beacon above downtown Kuala Lumpur








The encroaching darkness is kept at bay by the faint light of makeshift bonfires in riverside London





Like the locations in Singapore, these cities will have sub-locations that Amira can visit in pursuit of a breakthrough in her cases. The cities we'll be featuring in the game include: London, Osaka, Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, Toronto, Shanghai, Rio de Janeiro, Dubai, Mexico City, Ho Chi Minh City, Kigali, Athens, Hong Kong, Perth (Australia), Manila, Cairo, Seattle, Busan, Lima, Paris, New Delhi and Jakarta.









Chinatown Detective Agency is a narrative-driven game - and that narrative is anchored in a diverse cast of colourful characters. 

























































Many of the game's important characters are voiced acted, mostly by voice artists from Singapore in order to preserve the nuances of Singapore's own brand of colloquial English (Singlish) and local slang. But the main reason we opted to voice the dialogue is to convey the tension and drama of the story. Here's a sample of an exchange between protagonist, Amira, and one of her most important clients, Rupert Zhou:

            

          









The whine of a lonely synth. The pulse of an electronic bass line. Music plays a crucial role in establishing the atmosphere of Chinatown Detective Agency.
We looked to some of the greatest composers in film for inspiration, with a focus on those who have scored suspense, thriller, mystery and detective movies. Perhaps the most influential were Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, especially their work on The Social Network and Gone Girl. Other influences include the soundtrack of cult classic Twin Peaks, as well as those songs from the 80s that evoke (at least to Mark when he was writing the game's backstory) an image of Tokyo or Hong Kong caught in the lingering glow of neon lights - ""In The Air Tonight"" by Phil Collins, ""Live to Tell"" by Madonna, as well as basically anything by Foreigner.

            

          

The game's soundtrack is being composed and produced by two different musicians: Sean Kolton and Dmitrii Muchkin. Working independently, Sean creates the more contemplative and ambient tracks used during gameplay, while Dmitrii is working on the upbeat and dynamic tracks that you'll hear in the main menu and transition scenes.









We've a selection of varied and rewarding tiers for our backers.
Let’s be honest: we want to make sure a majority of our funding goes straight to the development of the game. To this end we’ve limited our physical rewards to just a couple of items. But because we also want to give our Kickstarter backers the exclusive opportunity to have a hand in the development of the game, we've got something even better,  the ability to add a city of your choice in the game - or you could even be one of the three backers who'll help write a mission in the game!




I got to the drop-off early. No sense waiting around.








There's...something familiar about this place...








Hey...what's that sound?








I never was one for art, but I liked what I saw.








Take this...I'll call you when it's safe.








Singapore is a fine city. Specially for those who keep a mountain of overdue library books at home...








The card was blank...or so I thought.








The Triad wore black, you wore white.








These pages have a clue on them... someone wants to be found.








Just try not to make a scene.








Careful... these walls have ears.








I was going nowhere fast, I needed a change of pace.








As soon as I saw it I knew: this case was the real deal.





You can help bring the game to life by buying one of our available tiers, each with different rewards. Some of them are limited in number, so if you like what you, go and grab it! 

























































































General Interactive Co. is an indie game dev collective consisting mainly of Creative Director, Mark Fillon and Lead Programmer, Jenny Hide. Our lineup changes with every project, but Mark and Jen form the core duo behind each game.
Mark is a writer and digital media creative director by trade, and spent most of his high school years modding the classic games of his generation for his own amusement, including Age of Empires II and Neverwinter Nights. 
As General Interactive Co., Mark and Jenny released Terroir, a winemaking tycoon game in 2017. It was greenlit by the Steam community in 2016, and has been given a generally positive rating by its players. The game is available on Steam, GOG, the Humble Store and the Windows Store.

Jenny has been programming for the past 7 years, and is also one-half of the indie game label, Fox Tor Games - a recipient of a UK Games Fund sponsorship. Her upcoming game with Fox Tor, CULTIVATE: Before Time, has been in development since 2018, and is planned to be released in 2021.




Jenny is the calmest of the bunch. Seen here is her fixing a game-destroying bug that has turned sentient and has evolved into ransomware. Probably.

Ricardo Juchem is Chinatown Detective Agency's Art Director. Over the past four years, his work, which has a particular focus on pixel art, has generated a large following (including well known artists in the video game industry), and has graced everything from video games to magazine covers. 




Ricardo is also a certified interior designer. From the University of Awesome Battle Station Design.

Sean Kolton and Dmitrii Muchkin are the video game composers behind Chinatown Detective Agency's soundtrack, each with their own unique style designed to give the game two distinct musical tones. Sean composes the more contemplative, analog, Twin Peaks-inspired tracks, while Dmitrii does the more electro-ambient stuff.




Dmitrii Muchkin, Composer





Marvin Paule is a programmer that focuses on the game's U.I. mechanics, as well as the team's QA specialist (our official bug hunter, if you will).
Raf Banzuela is General Interactive Co.'s branding and 2D asset artist. He was the lead 2D artist on Terroir, as well as the artist behind Chinatown Detective Agency's physical products and rewards.
Hinchel Or is the creator of Chinatown Detective Agency's cover art, as well as a character artist.
Charlene Lebrun, Chris Patrick and Adolfo Aguirre - under their PR firm, Player Two PR - oversee Chinatown Detective Agency's marketing, community building and PR efforts. Charlene, formerly of SEGA Europe, has been helping indie devs build their audience and image for over 5 years.
How are we using the funds?
Most of the base game has already been created, and a majority of the funds will go towards producing and developing more content. By content, we mean things like new character locations and environments, new case missions, new characters, more animations, more voice acting -- basically things that make the game richer, more vibrant and have more play-time. Here is a basic breakdown of where the funds will go if we are successful:









More than half will be allocated to programming and art (which includes animation), as these are the essential to content creation, while the next largest share goes to music, audio and voice acting, to give the game a more immersive feel. The rest goes towards marketing the game and the fulfillment of backer rewards.
These allocations aren't set in stone - if there's one thing we learned from doing this before, it's that situations change as the development of the game progresses and new challenges are uncovered (including taking into consideration player and fan feedback - something we try our best to incorporate into our decision making).","We've done our best to make sure our rewards can be created and fulfilled for our backers as easily as possible. We've limited our physical rewards, and instead, have offered rewards that allow backers to be part of the game and its development. We are committed to the quality of the game, and if successful, the campaign will give us runway for the remainder of the year - which should be enough time to complete the game.

Having said that, this doesn't account for unforeseeable events that can and will affect any project - changing team members, quality assurance and testing, issues arising from Unity and the other platforms we depend on and, most of all, the global uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. None of these challenges and risks are unique to us. We prepare for them by keeping the game's scope focused, and having a network of professionals and freelancers available to fill in gaps that my come up during development.

As a single player game with a semi-linear story, we're confident we can deliver on the game. However, should there be delays, this will affect our release date - and you will be informed beforehand. We'd rather delay Chinatown Detective Agency than release a sub-par version of it.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 23 or more\n\nAbout US$ 17\n\n\n\nGumshoe\n\n\n(Around US$16) Get Chinatown Detective Agency at launch at a discount.\nIncludes:\n\n\nDigital download (Steam key or DRM-free for Windows and Mac)\n\n\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n925 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 35 or more\n\nAbout US$ 25\n\n\n\nInvestigator\n\n\n(Around US$24) Get the game and a digital goodie pack that includes game-inspired wallpapers for your PC and smartphone, as well as the full game soundtrack in MP3 and WAV format.

  SHORT SUMMARY
  Picture someone wearing a lot of skull designs – on their jacket, shirt, pants, all over. You’d know immediately what image they were trying to project. Now, do you picture that same person fitting into a professional environment?
  High-paying workplaces often spell sartorial compromise. But there’s still a personality beneath every go-getter and team player. What if you could wear just one skull, in a strategic place where it looks smooth and subtly stunning? Could they pull it off in a professional ensemble?
  French Yuppie recognizes the need in each person, to give a nod to their rebel soul, no matter what social context is holding them down. That’s why our new line is sure to get a look of admiration when noticed topping off your workday ensemble. It’s called “Cranium.”
  We feature six varieties – five featuring the skull, and one fleur-de-lis whose contours hint at the cranial. Pick your favorite, or splurge on the entire collection if you’re all about skulls. ONLY 100 PIECES WILL BE PRODUCE EACH WITH INDIVIDUAL EDITION NUMBER regardless of the material use (Titanium or Sterling Silver )
  These rings retail will at US$330 for Titanium and US$285 for sterling silver. But contributors to this campaign will get discounts the public will never see again – nearly 40% off.
  The savings compound the more you contribute. And, for the distinguished buyer who can’t bear to split up this collection, we have an extra special offer. Receive 3 rings and one of our high-craft leather-and-sterling-silver bracelets for free – up to a $60 value.
  Want to make it your own? Get it engraved on the inside, up to 13 characters. Looking for a bit of a different shade? We can cast these designs in gold or other metals. For an extra price, you can claim these custom features for a truly one-of-a-kind ring.

  22 Major Arcanas, 
   16 Court Cards + 4 Aces,  
  7 Chakra cards, and 
  10 Special Cards.



 MAJOR ARCANAS 
The major arcana does not utilise common archetypes as traditional tarot although it still embraces the underlying meaning to an extent. Every card symbolises a more evident sense of looking at self, the changes, the possible occurrences incoming and the past being let go in a World where the old must be retained in terms of value in meaning but has to make way for looking at more of a new viewpoint.




Major Arcanas

The essentiality of these cards is for those who are on the spiritual journey or higher purpose and have pressing questions to whatever they may be experiencing that cannot be deciphered by the norm. These cards are unique as they are the only ones not to be read in reversals due to the higher messages they truly hold.

The sky is the limit - let your imagination flow!



INNI Nails is a new way to get amazing and unique nails. Our new technology allows customers to create their own nail stickers or select from thousands designs that other INNI users have created. High-fashion shapes, gradient colors, photo of your favorite band or picture of your pet - everything is possible with INNI Nails. Visit our beta site: www.inni.comHow does it work?Using INNI Nails is super easy. You can pick from existing designs that our users have done or create your own design with our easy-to-use INNI Nail Studio. You can upload any image from your computer or load images from the internet. You can add symbols, use brushes or gradient tool to make outstanding designs for your nails. Check out the video above!


INNI Nail Studio is done in-house, 100% sweat equity from the team



And if you want to go nuts with your design, you can use our INNI Paint. It's like Photoshop, but it works directly from your browser. You can use hundreds of brushes, layer effects, different filters and much more. Visit beta version (requires Flash Player): www.inni.com/paint


INNI Paint is based on SumoPaint, also in-house product from the team members



Who are we?The driving force behind INNI Nails is Katja Koutaniemi. As CEO she have researched and developed the concept for high-quality, low-cost, colorful, customizable nails.The technology for the website is developed by Lauri Koutaniemi, Katja's husband. INNI is based on his award-winning SumoPaint, online Photoshop with community.


Katja has forced Lauri to test nail stickers and nail polishes to understand women needs



Where we're at?We launched the beta site out last November and we've been testing the app with our friends and family, also sending sticker prototypes to some magazines and bloggers.


Sharp image quality allows you to see even the smallest details



The feedback has been encouraging! Everyone loves their custom nail designs and there has been blog posts about our product with great reviews:http://www.nihrida.com/2013/11/review-inni-nail-vinyls.html http://capitalpolish.blogspot.sg/2014/02/inni-nail-strips.html


Blogger Nihrida made this design using her family photos



We’ve been working on this project for over 9 months. First months was all about developing the website/app and testing different tape materials and printers. Lauri was coding and Katja used all her time for printing their wedding photo on different tapes.


It took a lot of time to test different printers with various materials



Last summer we finally found the perfect tape material and printing technology to produce high quality nail stickers that lasts up to 10 days. Now we have also found manufacturer, who can produce thousands of nail stickers with this technology.With your support, we can automate and scale up the process and deliver stickers all around the world faster and cheaper than doing everything from our tiny office with our tiny hands.


We have been printing, cutting, packaging and sending, doing everything ourselves



Your contribution will also help us to: * Automate the process for manufacturing stickers
 * Localize the website and the production (+shipping)
 * Improve our app to work with all browsers and mobile devices
 * Create new features for the site and new options for sticker materials
 * Add social media features, like commenting and sharing designs


We have been testing silver, gold, hologram and glitter materials for the stickers

We know how to scale things up, so we can produce even thousands sticker sets a day.Why Kickstarter?Now it is time to go global and big. We have a great product, but we want to make it even better and automate the production, so the stickers can be delivered faster to our customers. We are so excited about the future, and hope that this project will help us to reach our goals. It's tempting to think that Kickstarter is just about the money, but it isn't. Far from it.


One of our beta testers suggested us to do Kickstarter project :)



Today, it's hard to get visibility even if you are a great startup. There's so many people doing so many cool things, that it's hard to get noticed. We think that one of the key benefits of a successful Kickstarter campaign is visibility. With your support, we can get noticed, and get people trying our new customized nails. We have been showcasing INNI Nail prototypes in couple of start up events, but it takes much more time and money and we don't have that at the moment (see video below).
Also, if we're lucky enough to get your support, it's a valuable indicator that we're genuinely on the right track. We have our fingers crossed that you'll give us your seal of approval by supporting our campaign. And by doing so, other people will take a more serious look at us, which hopefully will lead to more help and more opportunities.


With gradient tool, you can create great looking effects (try this with nail polish!)



We also want your feedback and your ideas for how to improve INNI Nails, how to launch it successfully, and how to reach more people. We want you to try our nails stickers, give your input and tell your friends. Even if you're a guy (and many of you are), you can introduce us to your wife, girlfriend, daughters, or your best friend.


Combining different designs is fun and it looks great



But, of course, the money is critical. We have a lot to do, and it all costs money. Every cent you contribute will help us improve INNI Nails in terms of our website, the overall system, the design capabilities of our Nail Studio, our production quality, and our order fulfillment capability. It will also help us with marketing and directly impact our further funding situation.Main goal (£10,000): Heavy duty production and localizationSo far, we're being told that our nail vinyls are great. We are happy with that kind of feedback, but we know it can be even better. We have identified several potential production partners using state-of-the-art dye sublimation printing technologies, who can capture the full range of vibrant colors and designs, and print them on heavier duty vinyl, backed with stronger adhesive. We also feel that we need to make an investment in a more industrial cutting and forming tool as manufactured specifically for the plastics industry. And, we have identified an important post-printing step of applying a high-gloss, protective laquer to the printed nails so they stay super-shiny with eye-popping colors for 2-3 weeks. New production equipment chews up a big chunk of our initial budget, and the balance covers the software developmentrequired to make changes related to these new processes, and to add commercial-quality payment processing from a wide-range of online and phone-based payment methods. Overall, this is a key step which allows us to deliver the highest quality, most durable nail vinyls, while increasing production capability to thousands of orders per day (fingers crossed that we'll get that some day).As part of our proof of concept, we've created the first version of our Nail Studio. It's quite versatile and simple, and it allows you to design and customize nail designs based on some initial templates we've created. It allows you to save these designs for your personal use only, or as a public design for others to admire, customize, and use for their own nails.


Sneak peek of our HTML5 based editor, it is still missing a lot, so we need your help



INNI Nails is based on SumoPaint which we spent several years working on, and which we're pleased to say has a large creative community of millions of users around the world. It's like Adobe Photoshop online, an image editor and creative painting application working inside the browser. However, it's too big and has many more features than we need for INNI Nails. It's also based on Adobe's Flash technology, which means it won't run on mobile devices. So, addressing this shortcoming by releasing a HTML 5, cross-platform version of Nail Studio 2.0 is a huge step forward, and allows the widest range of people to design and order INNI nails on almost any computer or smartphone. In the process, INNI Nails 2.0 will get smaller, simpler, and faster, which is also a good thing.


If we reach our big goal, we would go nuts: Ooh, Woah, Aaargh!



And the last word from the boss...We have been working really hard on this, and we all sincerely appreciate your support and input. With your help, I believe we can launch INNI Nails with a bang!We pay a lot of attention to the quality of our products. We used a lot of time to find a perfect very flexible nail strip material, which will cover nails flawlessly. INNI nail stickers will not leave any wrinkles on your nails and last up to 10 days.Please contact us if you have any questions or queries: info@inni.com.


Thank you again for your help! Love, Katja, CEO","INNI Nails is not a figment of our overactive imaginations! It's already a working website (beta) with a low-key soft-launch to friends and family just couple of months ago. The early feedback has been very encouraging, but there's lots and lots of things for us to do to improve the number and quality of designs, make our design tools faster and funkier, streamline our production systems, accelerate fulfillment, get the word out and make the transition to full-on commercial sales and production. Fortunately, these are incremental improvements, not huge, scary obstacles, but we can't address them without your help.

Moreover, the INNI Design team is a credible, experienced group with substantial involvement in previous technology successes with millions of customers around the world. We're growing, and we believe we have what it takes, but Kickstarter will help us make it happen, and Kickstarter will help us get bigger, faster. 

Of course, things can always go wrong. But we have production already in place, and we will soon, with your help, also have back-up systems. There are minor quality issues that have been identified by some early customers, but we are already considering potential solutions, and, with your help, these will be addressed by upgrading to more sophisticated production equipment. Also, we do use normal mail (courier, tracked packages are simply too costly for a low-cost product like ours), so a few orders have gone astray, but we always send a new set free of charge. Overall, all potential issues are manageable, and we assure you that, if you fund us, every Kickstarter reward package will be produced and delivered right, and INNI Nails will launch officially to the world, thanks to you. We appreciate your support and your faith in us, and we promise that we won't let you down!","[{""rewards"":""Pledge £3 or more\n\nAbout $4\n\n\n\nWE LOVE YOU! Thanks for your support!

Hey there everyone!


This is Jean here and I make my own original characters mochibuddies, a group of mochi that are very good friends! This is my very first kickstarter project and I really hope to get it successfully funded.


The art, created with love series features my original characters momo(unicorn), spottie(dog), floflo(bunny), katkat(cat) and panpan(panda). They are all having fun creating their master pieces.


I hope to be able to bring the joy of creating across to everyone.


This is a fixed goal campaign with all pins designs unlocked as I am looking at doing the full series.


This project will last for 16 days only.
You will not be charged for the pledge until the end of the successful Kickstarter campaign","Manufacturing Defects Incident
As the pins are handmade, there might be incidences of defects. 
I had been working with the same supplier for a period of time and her pins are at least 80% great.
Pins would all be graded and assessed before mailing, only good quality pins will be sent out to you.

Colour Differences
Unfortunately, colours translate differently on different devices.
However, I will try my best to make sure that the colours are accurate.

Shipping Duration & Delays
Due to the ongoing pandemic, do expect shipping delays.
Shipping duration varies and depends on the country and state backers postal services.
But do rest assured that all overseas pledges package comes with track mail, which are insured.
For SG pledges, price paid does not include tracking and we highly recommend you to top  up $2 to better insure your package. Only 3 enamel pin pledge and ultimate bundle pledge comes with tracking by default.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 9 or more\n\nAbout US$ 7\n\n\n\n1 Sticker Pack\n\n\nReceive 1 glitter laminated sticker pack\n\nRest of the world -

Over 20 unique insults… I mean, voice messages.
Do you think you are awesome, smart and everyone likes you? Then you need Reality Check Bear for real. 
This fluffy piece of shit is more than a stuffed toy with a voice function. It’s packed with an outrageous amount of sarcastic and smart messages to help you with reality check. 
Also, you can always use it as a punchbag. If you need stress relief or disagree with what it has to say (because you know it’s probably true), just punch the lil' bitch.









You get what you deserve.
We strongly believe that you deserve a 10 inches Reality Check Bear. Stuffed with 200 grams of awesomeness (and crap). Made of soft plush. The toy is well-built to withstand all of your microaggressions.

























Wired with a voice module with a replaceable battery, so it will never shut up.









Look at this cute mug. It will steal your heart and then crush it.

Inspired by flower languages and the meanings behind gifting flowers, I have created a series of 9 Eeveelution Pins; each carefully paired with each other, to deliver a meaningful message for yourself or a loved one. 











✤All pins would come with its own backing card. 
✤All shipping are registered  and comes with a tracking code.



















































































UPDATE:


I have the add-on option enabled! After selecting the tier you want, just follow the instructions to add as many pins as you like to your pledge :)









 Edit: Glittery flowers will now have shiny coloration!
Edit 2: Pouch designs are confirmed! You will be able to choose a color in the final survey.

















 ✤ All stretch goals unlocked! They will be available as options in the survey.
 ✤ You may pledge an extra 23.5USD(pair) or 12USD(single) to your tier and let me know when the surveys are sent out to get them :)

































✤ Timeline is subjected to change depending on when the goal is reached.  


✤ Delivery duration depends on the postal service. I use Singpost which passes mail to your local service once it touches down.


✤ Delivery WOULD probably be adversely affected by covid, as with everywhere else :(


✤ As of now, shipping to SERBIA has been suspended for a while,  and I'm not sure when it will resume. If you are from Serbia please take note! I will update this section if there are any changes.


✤Some photo updates!
✤All main eevee design colors have been filled, awaiting screenprinting and lineart filling~









✤Testing of glitter effect on the flowers



















✤ 70% - Production fees
✤ 20%- Shipping and handling fees
✤ 10%- Kickstarter and other fees

At Bondi Swim Co, we live for summer, and to have the perfect summer you need the perfect summer swim-shorts! The problem is most swim-shorts just don't tick all the boxes. Swim-shorts; they're either too long, too short, too wide, or too tight. They compromise on either function, comfort or style, and to make it worse you have to change them all the time. We know this swim-short problem has needed fixing for years, so over the past 18 months we have been working non-stop on designing the ultimate pair of swim shorts, that you will be able to live in all summer long.









 




Every pair of Bondi Swim Co Swim-shorts features our bold signature ribbon design, so you can transform these shorts from a high performance swim-short into a tailored summer short. Simply fold up the cuff to change the look, length and style of these shorts into a designer short. Now you have a swim-short that you can wear all day, and go straight from the beach to the beach bar or wherever your day takes you. 









 




The perfect swim-shorts need the perfect fabric and we spent months and months working with our manufacturers to engineer the ultimate swim-short fabric. Our specially designed premium fabric is a unique polyester microfibre which features amazing stretch performance technology and with durability for long lasting use.
With the increased flexibility in these swim-shorts you will feel comfortable all day, and your movement will never be restricted. Whether you like swimming, running, partying or just relaxing these all day swim-shorts have you covered.








 



Our customised premium fabric is also infused with water resistant hydrophobic technology, so water and liquids will bounce off these shorts keeping them dry unless fully submerged. 
The quick drying properties in these swim-shorts will have you dry in the fastest possible time, so you will never need to worry about taking a second pair of shorts with you to the beach. They are designed to drip dry as quick as possible so you can head straight from the beach to the beach bar, or wherever your day takes you.











 









These swim-shorts feature a specially built in hidden zip pocket on the side, to give you the perfect place to store your keys and phone, so you can keep your valuables safe and secure. Our 5 pocket design swim-short also features two foldable back pockets for extra storage, so you will be prepared for anything, wherever your day takes you.












 









These swim shorts have the style of a classic European tailored short, designed to look great in every occasion. They are also the perfect length, sitting just above the knee, to make sure that your movement is never restricted. For a shorter length, simply fold up the cuff, which will shorten the length of these swim-shorts to that of a designer short. 
The wrinkle free properties embedded in this fabric will ensure that these shorts will remain crease-free, and always look great in and out of the water.








 







 







 









 






















 NEW COLOUR UNLOCKED - BLACK








 









Bondi Swim Co bases all its sizes on international standards. If you are usually a size Medium, then go for that size. If you are in-between sizes, we suggest selecting a larger size and then using the button tabs to adjust the short to the perfect fit. 








Designed in Sydney Australia, these shorts have been designed for all-day use to handle whatever your day demands. We spent 18 months on prototype development and extensive fabric testing, until we came up with the perfect swim-shorts we have always wanted. Our swim-shorts are styled with a classic European tailored cut, designed to look good in any situation.
 

  









When we started Bondi Swim Co 18 months ago, cost was a motivating factor. We wanted to make a premium quality swim-short at an affordable price point. The current retail margins, through avenues such as wholesaling and physical retail stores are very high, particularly when sourcing the best quality fabrics on the market. In a retail setting, our swim-shorts would cost over $200 in retail, but by being on Kickstarter, we are able to accomplish our goal of making the perfect premium swim-shorts at a great price.

Wenxin spots her best friend Joanne stealing something from the bookshop. She faces the impossible dilemma of choosing between friendship and her moral principles.







 









Our decisions define who we are and sometimes we make bad decisions to take the easy way out.I grew up in Singapore in the 90s and at a very young age, my mother would always ask me three questions after school: If I completed my homework, if I talk in class, or if I was late for school. I guess all this mattered to her as a parent – that I was a good student.I thought that these were the attributes of a good student, and even going through years of Civics and Moral Education ／《好公民》did not prepare me for the moral dilemma that I was about to encounter – witnessing my best friend stealing something from the bookshop.The universal themes of honour, morality and the conundrum of doing the right things versus doing things right is portrayed in this short film. I wish to tell a story of how making the right decisions will render you unpopular and unlikable, which are situations that we as adults face all the time.“Pencil” is a short film based on my personal experience and I hope sharing it would evoke a thought. Then, I feel like I have accomplished something worthwhile.







 







We are hoping to raise S$6,000 more to cover production expenses in the following areas:- casts
- crew
- art direction
- equipment
- locationWe will commence principal photography in late December 2016 and wish to complete the film late January - early February 2017.

Another short film directed by Regina is “Filial Haven,” a heartfelt story of a young man who has to send his mother to an old folk’s home. “Filial Haven” was accepted for the 2016 Cannes Short Film Corner. After graduation, Regina has been working as a freelance 1st Assistant Director for features, commercials as well as television series. She also completed directing 4 episodes of ""The Munah & Hirzi show,” featuring the comedy team that have fast become two of the top Singaporean YouTube stars.

Always eager to keep working, she is also developing several film and television projects.

One day at the brewery a thought came to me. I got curious how beers are made. I went back home and search up the internet and learn that I can create my own beer from home. I told my girlfriend about it and she likes the idea so we went on to buy ingredients to brew. Immediately, I fell in love with my beer the moment it sits in my mouth. Since then I have made different batches at home, practicing and experimenting different kind of tastes. There is a few times my beer got contaminated as I did not sterilies properly. I learn from my mistake and got better every brew. I feel that I have become so good at brewing I would like to share my craft with people out there.Big Bad Wolf Brewery I will produce small batches of beer and each batch will not be the same. Every time a batch is finish a different beer will be in the tap. This is to let every person who comes to feel fresh every time and not having the same taste of beer every time they come back. I feel that brewing beer is a work of art as different brew will produce different taste and with great taste is most important in a beer. I brew mostly IPA and ESB because I love the taste of it. Personally I prefer the british recipe as the taste is still strong but the alcohol level is low so I can enjoy drinking more rather than getting drunk so fast.   The concept The brewery is very straight forward. To allow people to come in and have a drink just sit around do their own stuff like how people would normally hang out at Starbucks. Why I need your helpIt all started out of curiosity and I fell in love doing it. I studied marketing and will apply what I have learn into the business. Now I'm ready to take the next step to make money out of my hobby. However, I just graduated last year and it will take me years to save up and start my dream. Since I'm still young there is not much of credibility so it will be pointless for me to go talk to the bank or investor. I need your support to kick-start my dream of sharing my craft beer with everyone! Here is how I plan to use these Kickstarter funds:
Brewing equipments
Renovation
Purchase of furniture, tables and chairs etc...
Licensing fees","In Singapore, there are only less than 50 breweries people were drinking more of the staples like Heineken or Tiger. Not many people here know about home brewing or even a brewery becasue its limited. My goal is to let craft beer reach out to more people in Singapore. Statistics show that Singapore millennials love to drink!

Doing it in small batches will be hard to keep up with the demand in the near future as the business gets popular. My biggest challenge is fermenting the beer fast enough to make sure everyday, everyone who step into the brewery can taste my beer.

I have made up all my budget and all the necessary information gathering like licensing, location and brewing equipment. Most of my fundings will be for buying brewing equipments and aquiring license fees like liquor license act and manufacturing license.

With all the information I gathered I also found that there is a growing demand here in Singapore. I'm only left with the very last and most important thing, the funds.

Hi I'm Lucius a design student on Kickstarter today to share with everyone my latest food steaming creation out of my love for red bean buns. Growing up, i like to have red bean buns for breakfast daily. Every morning, i'll get them out of the freezer, put them on a plate and steam them in a pot waiting 8 minutes before it's ready for consumption. However the frustration i feel to get that hot plate out of the pot just irritates me despite every tool or method i have tried over the past few years. My unsuccessful attempts often resorts me to physically stabbing my buns to retrieve them but i don't like it when my buns look misshapen.Today i have before you a life changing food steamer every household should own. The Paulor steamer makes food steaming a hassle free task with 2 simple tools. A redesigned steamer bowl to put your buns on to steam and a handle that reaches through the bowl's center before fishing it out of the pot. 
Its easy as 1, 2, 3! Just get lay on any type of food you would like to steam onto the steamer bowl, pour about 300ml of water into the pot before placing your Paulor steamer bowl in. Set the heat to the appropriate temperature of what your're heating and wait for that few minutes till it's cooked and ready. Lift the pot lid open and reach for your Paulor handle, carefully dipping it through the center of the steamer bowl till it slides in and there you hook your meal out of that pot through the designated gaps for the catch between both tools. There it's that simple!
It is also dishwasher friendly making it easy to clean and maintain after usage. 
This creation has made food steaming a simple 2 step process that makes my eating experience more enjoyable and i hope you will too by funding my page. Cheers!

Smart SHABDH™ is a medicine dispenser for patient’s / aged people, to consume their weekly / bi-monthly medication, with smart features incorporated for LIVE tracking / monitoring by their health care centers / family members.
Key Features of smart SHABDH™?
- Enables medication tracking / monitoring of patient’s / aged people by their health care centers and family members respectively
- Reminding patients with medication schedules   - Alerting patient’s for low battery status and re-charging
- Alerting patients with open / close status of the medicine dispenser to avoid exposure to atmosphere
Why LIVE tracking / monitoring?Certain critical patient’s are required to be tracked / monitored for their regular (day to day) consumption of medicine provided by their medical centers to make sure their patient’s do not miss out their medication schedules. This will enable the medical centers to monitor and manage their patient’s from getting in to serious health conditions due to possible irregular medication schedules. Currently medical centers face a challenge for managing their patient’s medication practices. It becomes quite expensive / stressful for both centers and patient’s in case of daily visits to the centers. Also, certain patient’s are not allowed to access bulk medication for reasons beyond medical centers control.
How does smart SHABDH™ work?
Smart SHABDH™ will send an alert signal to the designated Healthcare centers or authorized call centers, whenever a patient activates the medicine dispenser, to consume his / her medication (as prescribed). The health care centers / call centers will be able to manage all their patient’s incoming alert data and track / monitor their patient’s. The centers will be able to call back and remind their patients for medication, in case there is no patient alert status received by their database system. Devices with other options available are, with a medication reminder and an automated (hands - free) medication dispensing. All options are enabled with alerts to the respective centers when medication is dispensed.","Copyright:

Hello everyone! LMD Deck is my very first creation here in Kickstarter. Just like what the brand name signifies, this deck is created from the very basic, from a layman's point of view. A logo plays a major role towards success for most businesses and in this case, I feel that designing a logo deck is a perfect way for me to introduce the brand to fellow cardists, magicians and playing card collectors around the world.

LMD logo primarily consists of 4 triangles, coming together from different directions to form the picture. They represent the driving force for my creative process, the 4 key fundamentals of my life; Faith, Love, Respect, and the ability to Dream.

THE MONOGRAM - I am a huge fan of symmetrical and monogram designs. Needless to say, I have to use them in my very first playing card design. The logos are placed in such a way that looking at the negative space, you can see the letter H (which is the initial of my last name), and 2 arrows representing the ups and downs that are inevitable in life.







BACK DESIGN - Featuring the monogram with 2 logos in blue overlapping the thin border, LMD Deck creates an interesting soundwave visual that interlinks the cards when fanned, spread or during flourishing moves.

FACE DESIGN - LMD Deck is 100% customized. The pips are formed out of the logo itself. They will also be used in future for our more Cardistry styled decks.

JOKER - The Joker card designs feature some optical illusion. A Secret code to decipher. (HINT: Traffic floor signs) I figure it would be interesting if we can have some interaction with the Joker cards. There will also be a secret card reveal on one of them, one of the added features with card magicians in mind.

My name is Vince from Singapore. I am a Graphic designer by day, Layman Cardist, Magician & Playing Cards Designer by night. I stumbled across the amazing world of Cardistry when I found this video on Youtube featuring a group of people shuffling, tossing, flipping playing cards around. I was intrigued by the aesthetically pleasing moves. That video was from the Virts SS16 deck.

 This video is made entirely by myself with my layman cardistry skill. Enjoy!









In the past, my perspective towards playing cards had always been a negative one, it has been years since I touched a deck of cards. To me, they were inevitably associated with gambling, which was a major factor to many broken families, including mine.




My EDC





I was amazed by how the use of a deck of playing cards has changed throughout the years, evolving into a perfect canvas for designers and artists to create stunning art pieces that are interactive and essentially formless.
Without a doubt, the creator in me, awakened from the slumber, is determined to set on a trip to create my very own deck of Playing Cards. Currently in transition between jobs, I put everything on hold because I want to be 100% focus on this project. This might just be a turning point for me.
My philosophy: We are constantly learning new things in life. At any point in time, all of us are considered laymen in one way or another. Given the opportunity and the courage to take a step forward, a layman can one day excel in the things they do.My inspiration: I am constantly thinking of new ideas for my next creation. I draw inspirations from all things awesome. From high fashion, streetwear to popular culture, nerdy stuff like movies, comics, toys, and awesome cardists and magicians from across the globe.Thank you for making it this far! Hope you like what you see here. I love to do what I am doing now and I am taking a step closer to realise my dream. Help me to continue doing this. Help me bring LMD Deck to live!PeaceVince H.Disclaimer: Photos of prototype and images used are for reference only. Colors or finishing of the final product may vary.

 THE ORIGIN STORY
COCOON started when Jarrick, who designs custom spine braces for those with scoliosis, experienced many aches, soreness and inflammations from the frequent training and races - which wasn't fun at all.









Over the next few months, something important happened: After neglecting sports and a social life, Jarrick listened to Mariah Carey Greatest Hits on repeat and developed a cold wrap made of fructose and a zip-lock bag that actually works and brought the idea to life.









While this is my first Kickstarter, I've already created a mass production ready prototype, readied our mold templates, and our manufacturing partners are waiting for our signal to go ahead.
It hadn't been easy...




The journey has been long, but we are ready.





HELP ME MAKE COCOON A REALITY
I wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for me to get Cocoons into your hands and make improvements as a community. I think this iceless cold compression sleeve is great, but I need your help making it even better.
So, if an easy to wear cold compression sleeve that lets you float like a butterfly, doesn't leave you in a wet mess and won't shift around is something you want, please back this project and help me make Cocoon a reality!
With mucho love,
-Jarrick

























SHIPPING WILL BE CHARGED AFTER THE CAMPAIGN (VIA CROWDOX) and prices may go up or down depending on your choice of accessories and global shipping rates when we get to the fulfillment stage. This project will be US, Canada, EU and Australia friendly!




Cocoon is UK-friendly as well





 Many Kickstarter campaigns have disappointed their backers by not thinking through their shipping and logistics strategy. That's why we've partnered with a global fulfillment and logistics company, Floship, and passed their 7 point comprehensive review. 




Cocoon is pleased to work with floship to ensure efficient and cost effective reward delivery. Click on the image for proof and a comprehensive, professional review of our shipping and fullfillment plan.





During these uncertain times, shipping costs are changing every week. We believe that the rates will improve in the coming months and will strive diligently to achieve the right balance of shipping speed and cost efficiency for you.
Any savings we can find, we will pass them on to you.
Here are our estimates of what shipping would be. 




Sample shipping rates as at October 25, 2020





* Prices do not include taxes for Non US, Canada, EU, UK and Australia backers. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each country. We have tried to subsidize the import taxes and duties as much as we can.
** Note that these prices are dependent on the situation, final order and global shipping rates when we get to the fulfillment stage. We make no money at all from shipping.","Unlike most Kickstarter campaigns, Cocoon actually has a working, mass production ready prototype of the product. This means that not only will we definitely deliver the product to you, we will also deliver a product that has been perfected though all the feedback we've gotten from the prototype we mass produced and beta tested.

However, it is important to understand that unexpected things may happen along the way, which are very hard to predict now. For example, delays in shipping can occur due to factors like viruses, travel restrictions or even, trade wars.

If any delays were to occur due to such circumstances, we will definitely update all our backers with full transparency and of course, aid you with any of the doubts you have along the way.

REFUND POLICY
90% pledge back guarantee since Kickstarter retains about 10% of your pledge for various fees. You have 7 days after the campaign ends to receive a refund for the products you ordered on Kickstarter. After 7 days, we will start placing the POs for the products and will NOT issue any refunds or returns.

EXCHANGE & RETURN POLICY
If you receive the wrong size, we appreciate the opportunity to replace or exchange it. Our exchange policy lasts 30 days from when your product arrived according to the tracking # we sent you. To be eligible for an exchange, your item must be unused, free from dirt, dust or damage and in the same package and condition that you received it, you will be responsible for shipping it back to us.

SHIPPING POLICY
If our shipping carrier attempts delivery and you don't get it because you’re not there, wrong address, moved without notifying us, and the package returns back to our warehouse, you will be responsible for the shipping fees to have it resend to you.
** When you receive your tracking #, please keep an eye out for the package. **","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout $2\n\n\n\nRun 50M (and Pledge Manager access)\n\n\nAbout 1 USD\n\nNEED ONE COCOON?\n\nManually add:\n\nS$66  >  One(1) Cocoon + Thermal Carry Bag\n\nThis gives you access to the pledge manager, where you can purchase more cocoons later.\n\nIn addition, for everyone who pledges S$2 or adds S$1 to their pledge, I will run a 50m in their name.

The Agenda Playing Cards is the outcome of Flagrant Agenda's unceasing endeavour to explore alternative means of expressing our ideas. Playing cards are fascinating medium for communication - from visually impressive execution of cardistry flourishing, mind bending and clever exhibition of magical illusion, to navigating imperfect information in game of chance showdowns. It is amazing how something so simple can be used for expression in so many ways.







We have finally unlocked our STRETCH GOAL 2. BLACK AGENDA is now available! We have added 4 new rewards specially catered to BLACK AGENDA: 
The Covert Nonconformist 
The Insurgent 
The Revolutionary+
The Freedom Fighter
 

All existing rewards except the Nonconformist and Revolutionary will become split equally into the same number of WHITE and BLACK AGENDA decks. We have also included 2 new add-ons, the BLACK AGENDA Uncut Sheets and 1 deck add-on for BLACK AGENDA.Do check out the rewards and add-ons sections for more details.BLACK AGENDA







We have made the following add ons available for all the Nonconformists, Objectors, Dissidents, Rebels and Revolutionaries out there: Uncut sheets for WHITE AGENDA, premium cotton tees in white and black screen printed with our Ace of Spade, 1 deck add-on for WHITE AGENDA and special WHITE AGENDA mini decks.WHITE AGENDA MINI


Limited to 100 decks





Our STRETCH GOAL 1 has been unlocked! All the decks will now come with embossed tuck cases! We are embarking onto the next STRETCH GOAL, a milestone that will give us BLACK AGENDA. BLACK AGENDA features:
Spot UV Printed Tuck Case on Thick Matte Black Stock
Tuck Case Embossing
Printed with metallic silver ink on court cards, card backs and faces
Foil Numbered Sticker Seal
Limited to 1000 Decks


























The theme in the deck is that of responsible change and transformation. This theme extends Flagrant Agenda's maxim of making a point to making a change. Various symbols related to change and transformation were included in the design of the tuck case, card back and the court cards. We strive to keep the whole design clean and simple without losing the details and symbology. We hope that the deck design would be timeless and spread the message of responsible change and transformation.























The lack of eyes in our court cards expresses the lack of truth, honesty, wisdom and moral conscience we sometimes see in authority – the Kings, Queens and Princes of our society – and why there is an impetus for a call for change.







The mandala is infused in our card back and Aces designs to convey that all change should strive for eventual stabilization, integration and ultimately a better inner self as propounded by Carl Jung.























The top of the Joker resembles a triangle and carries with it the meanings we are imbuing throughout the deck – the trinity of thoughts, emotions and actions and change. The sphere that the Joker is standing on stands for completeness with the three rounded shapes in the top and bottom embodying the past, the present and the future, both good and bad. All of history is defined by change.

Flagrant Agenda is a Singapore-based, street fashion label that designs apparels with a contemporary and urban overtone with a strong focus on graphics and illustrations. We set up Flagrant Agenda in 2014 to serve as an outlet to express ourselves on issues we feel strongly about.We are influenced by issues related to our surroundings, the environments we grew up in, what we encounter in our everyday lives and the society at large. We seek to understand how people who grew up and live in different cultures, interpret these themes and hope that by doing so, allows us to gain insights into similarities and differences in the way how people think.The Agenda Playing Cards is a new undertaking for us to expand beyond what we have already done with our apparels. We hope that this Kickstarter project can move us into new directions and avenues for expressing ourselves.Regardless whether this project is funded (we certainly hope that this project can be a success!), we hope to trigger people’s curiosity to find out more about the concept behind the deck and inspire them to engage in conversations on and ponder more deeply about the issues related to the concept.","For a project like Agenda Playing Cards, the risks can come in 3 aspects, the finalization of the deck design, the production, and the fulfilment. We have look into these aspects and got them covered.

For the deck design, we have finalized all the designs and they are ready to be sent to the printer once the project is funded. What you see on this page would be what you see when the decks arrived at your doorstep, if you back our project. 

For production, we are working closely with Expert Playing Card Company. You can be assured of the quality of the handles and printing. Extra attention will also be given to ensure that the production schedule is timely.

What do you do every morning & every night? Ooh la la, behave yourself! You brush your pretty white teeth of course :)
Do you know that billions of plastic toothpaste tubes end up in landfills annually? C’est terrible!
Did you think natural toothpaste is totally tasteless? That’s what we thought too… so we made a delicious alternative, and it’s sure to put a smile on your face. 





















NOICE is 100% natural, and COSMOS-ORGANIC certified by Ecocert. NOICE toothpaste offers complete care – we worked with dentists to keep your breath fresh, your gums healthy, whiten your teeth, and prevent cavities.
Packed in an eco-friendly, endlessly refillable bottle we made NOICE simple & affordable. Voila!




























You don't need to be a superhero to help save the planet. It's as simple as brushing your teeth :)
The result? An endlessly reusable bottle that can be topped-up using compostable refill pods and arrive in a fully recyclable cardboard pack at your doorstep.
NOICE is the first GEL toothpaste in the world with a zero-waste concept! C’est Magnifique!














We worked day and night with dentists from around the world to ensure our formula is great for your health, teeth, and gums. Of course, it had to taste tres tres bien!














NOICE employs a subscription model so there’s no need to go to the store! We know when you’re about to run out and send you refills when you need them. You can also reorder refill pods online or from our ambassador stores. 





















We want NOICE to be inexpensive. We are proud to say that NOICE is on average more affordable than other oral-care products on the market!
Extra refill pods can be purchased for as little as US$15 for 3 pods. That’s only US$5  per month! (free delivery included) 














Today we need you to make NOICE a reality. 
Toothpaste should be simple. Let’s keep it that way using a natural toothpaste delivered right to your doorstep with a zero-waste concept.
We hit over 110%!! THANK YOU!! We now launched the production at scale. You can continue to ORDER NOICE on IndieGogo to Keep Brushing!





























We promise to tell you the tooth, the whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth! Our ingredients have been carefully selected with dentists with always a specific purpose. NOICE is vegan, fluoride-free, sodium lauryl sulfate-free and contains no artificial flavors, sweeteners, colors or preservatives. All our organic ingredients are sourced from responsible producers and are certified EcoCert Cosmos Organic.  














Of course, we want to share our delicious zero waste toothpaste with the whole world! But we are super aware of the responsibility that it puts on us to go the extra mile.
Today, our production is in Thailand. In the future, we aim to localize NOICE in major markets.  And in the short term, NOICE will off set 100% of its carbon footprint from the shipping of your orders. So happy brushing!





















A smile communicates trust, trust creates connections, and connections enable collaboration. We want to use NOICE – a contraction of NICE and VOICE– to raise our voice, in a nice manner, and propose solutions. This is what we call positive propaganda!

It probably sucked. Depending on the type of person you are and who ended it, maybe it didn't hurt so bad but we all know that there'll always be that twinge of emotion whenever you part ways with someone.
Everyone faces break-ups differently. Some choose to purge their emotions through tears, finding comfort in ice cream, their bed, alcohol, sports, friends, etc. Others turn their sadness into hate, making it a temporary mission to defile their memory of their ex and reassuring themselves that the break-up was a good thing because now they can move on with their lives without that POS. A lucky few are able to move on quickly and calm, accepting the break-up and making the best out of the situation. For myself, I've been through all three methods and more, when coping with heartbreak. 
What I realised, however, is that I instinctively go down the route of pushing away all the happy memories with my exes and many times, turning them into the villain just to protect myself. I've read up that it's recommended to forget and move on, to do whatever it takes to make you feel better. That's what I thought I did, but after three years of different types of break-ups, I sensed that maybe I didn't have closure. After all, whenever the topic came to my ex, all I can do is passive-aggressively badmouth them. But my relationships weren't all that bad. 
Sure, there were bad and very bad moments from their side. But there were self-discovery moments too where my own insecurities and unpleasant qualities were the problem. By always villainising my exes, I rid myself of any faults that I should have owned up to and confronted so that the same mistakes will stop repeating in any present and future relationships I have, be it romantic or not.
So in light of this sudden realisation on my side, and because I love playing cards, I've decided to create my own card game called 'After the Break-Up'! 
This game can be played by yourself (Just read and talk to the mirror, I guess) or with your friends! If you're feeling wild, bring in your family and exes too. This game will make you question the past relationships you've had and hopefully help you have a clearer idea of what happened, thus building the foundation for your current and future relationships.

Instructions

  There are 3 Cards Categories: Questions, Story-time, Dares. These Cards have the same cover (Black) and will be shuffled together into the Deck. 
  Each player will also receive two Reply Cards: ""Yes"" & ""No"". These cards will have a different cover from the other cards (Pink). 
  Each player takes turn to draw from the Deck. If they draw a Question, they get to choose which question to say out loud to everyone else. All players must then answer the question with the Reply card 'Yes' or 'No' faced-down so no one else can see. Once everyone is done putting down their answer, the placed Reply cards are shuffled and revealed. 
  The player who drew the Question Card must then guess who put down the minority answer. They will only have as many chances to guess as there are minority answers (e.g. Have 2 chances to guess who answered 'Yes', if there are 4 'No's and 2 'Yes'). If there is a draw, there will be no need to guess. Everyone will get back their Reply Cards after the guessing is done. 

[For better visualisation, think of the game 'Black or Red' played with Poker Cards]

  If the player draws a Dare Card, they have to do 1 of the dares on the card. 
  If the player draws a Story-time Card, they have to story-tell a personal experience, prompted by the image on the card.





In each deck: 

  Question Cards: 15
  Dare Cards: 15
  Story-Time Cards: 15
  Pairs of Reply Cards: 8

... But more will be added if you decide to pledge enough to hit the Break-Up Crew reward <3
The funding goal is low because I just need to pay for nourishment and the materials to help me paint the cards (I'll be recycling poker cards that are missing majority of the deck). If the goal is exceeded, I'll very much consider hand-painting or printing the whole deck as an extension to this project c: Thank you!","Everyone will definitely get the PDF files since I just have to send it over digitally. 

The only risk I see is that there may be a delay with the Thank You Letters that include the hand-painted cards, due to any unexpected delivery troubles but they'll definitely get to you before December, at the very latest.

Hi everyone! We are Made by Mate from Singapore. Our name derives from the idea of making things for a friend, from a friend ;) And we hope to create thoughtful design for friends like you! Both of us are graphic designers, and after slogging our ass in the field for a few years, we decided to channel our creativity into something we truly enjoy doing instead. Like what people say, do more of what makes you happy :) This is our first ever Kickstarter campaign and we are pretty excited about it.  We have a lot of ideas that we hope to make them come true with the help of you fellow backers! So if you enjoy and like what we do, please do support us! Thank you!The Popsicle Pin
 







We started Made by Mate in May 2017, and we have been constantly trying to make our ideas come alive, but we often met with financial constraint of producing those ideas. The idea of The Popsicle Pin came about some time in mid-December, we wanted to kickstart of our 2018 the ""sweetest"" way we could, and thus we decided to release a series of candy coloured popsicle pins.







These popsicle pins are made by us from scratch. They are made with 2.5mm hard acrylic and spray painted individually by us. The base and the toppings are secured with chloroform. Each pin measures at 43mmH x 25mmW.  







Each pattern on the toppings are done with the help of a vinyl stencil that we created, and carefully spray painted on as well, they are further coated with a satin glaze.







The pin is carefully glued on the back of the popsicle as seen. 







What's special about the popsicle pin is that they are all done in random mix of colours and patterns from our  palette, hence, there are many permutations and it is very difficult to find more than 1 or 2 that are alike! 









What will you get?The minimum pledge of S$8 will get you a set of our popsicle stickers! A small one with each popsicles at 40mmH and a big one with each popsicles at 60mmH. 








Any pledge from S$16 to S$48 will be random, either full popsicles or munch popsicles from our mix!







Stretch GoalsIf we are able to hit S$2500 or more, we will be able to do customisation based on your favourite colours and patterns from our palette! 







Our Funding GoalWe hope to be able to fund at least S$2000 to kickstart this project. Here is a breakdown of where our funds will go.1. The cost of acrylic and lasercutting - 30%2. The cost of spray paint. (pastel paint colours are more expensive than the normal ones) - 20%3. The cost of vinyl stencils, chloroform, and pin backing. -10%4. Printing of packaging -10%5. Shipment - 20%6. Kickstarter Fees - 10%







Thank you for taking your time to go through our first project! We have a few other works that we have launched ourselves, and we also hope to bring them to Kickstarter in the future. Do follow us on instagram @madebymate or you can take a look at www.madebymate.co!If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us!","The entire process of making the popsicle pin (besides lasercutting the acrylic) is entirely handmade. There may be slight imperfections, but we will try our best with it! We are proud of the process of hand-making each pin, as it encompasses not just the finished product, but the effort and dedication we put in to create it. 

The project will be funding for 30days, if it is successful, please allow us about 1.5 months - 2 months to complete all orders. Which means we hope to complete them by end of March. We gave a slightly longer timeline as it is only the 2 of us doing it :)

The truth is- we are very far from it, most of the sales people we face on a daily basis are simply not up to the job, can be unresponsive or unprofessional enough to be selling their merchandise or services.

The First Module- Goals





 The situation is not getting better when looking spesifically at traditional retail. When we come to purchase an item or service we could benefit immensely if only the Salesperson we encounter is a good one, meaning they would show knowledge about the Item or service they offer and will help us making the right decision about the purchase we make. ""My Goal is to Simplfy the learning process for You and your Sales team""The companies today are facing many challenges when they want to train their teams-•	today learners are impatient- they need everything fast, short and in tiny chewable pieces •	it is very hard to get all of the team in one place at the same time•	it is hard to keep track of the team's progress   ""Shake on it""  solutionI made it very simple for everyone, I Created 8 Modules that will get the individual or Team to being Sales oriented succesfully - 1. Short and fun animated videos(5-7 minutre long)to keep student focused2.Learn on your own free time on Any device-Mobile ,PC or Tablet3.

                       Preview of module 3- Building RapportThis training program was created after over 20 years of experience in the Retail, wholesale and B2B markets, it combines few known and well proven methods that focus on specific points that together build the D.N.A of what a saleperson should be.  The project will eventualy cover a wide range of subjects all within the Sales aspect of things- the overall concept will include more than 50 different sub-context videos with support material to match ad-hock criteria in many fields and many services, products or programs.In order to make a difference and fullfill my dream to Teach using this unique way ,I will need more than $7500.With your support I will make it come true!!!","To this point I have used my personal resources to fund this project, the course required a full team of production personal to work for months to
perfect the animation, voice over etc'. we had quite a few rejects until perfection was achieved almost a year later. 
the Course is sitting on an LMS (Learning management system) that can provide a great answer to videos and quizes online with multiple user interface and broad range of other elements to make the learning expariemce a whole- it is very costly however.
This is the reason I could not fund the entire set of modules and need your help to get the project on the right path and guarantee its go live.
I also would be really happy if i will be able to produce the course in more languages to spread the word in. my first choise would be Chineese.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 10 or more\n\nAbout $8\n\n\n\nThank you for Backing my dream\n\n\nThank You for your support\n\n-a \""Thanks for your support\""  Badge will be digitally sent to all backers\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 29 or more\n\nAbout $21\n\n\n\nBasic course- individuals-Early bird\n\n\nBe the first to receive the fresh course license (unlimited access) \n\n 5 basic modules and\n\nAll its unique characteristics\n\nanimated video modules that will give you a head start when selling \n\njust about anything. \n\nRecieve a digital badge for completing the course- \""Basic Sales Mastery\"" \n\nto hang around your office\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nJul 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited (99 left of 100)""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 49 or more\n\nAbout $36\n\n\n\nFull course- individuals-Early bird\n\n\nReceive the full course license (unlimited access) with All its unique characteristics\n\n8 animated modules that will give you a head start when selling \n\njust about anything.

Have you ever bought a $100+ dollar of perfume, only to realize that it barely lasts a few minutes on your skin, and no one else can really smell it? Did you consider spraying more of your super expensive perfume, only to find out that didn’t work either?You’re not alone. After accumulating a collection of super fancy, highly reviewed perfumes, I noticed that reapplying them every hour on the hour was futile. I tried cologne, EDT, and even perfume, but nothing seemed to work.So I decided to consult a number of leading perfume-oligists (the guys who make the stuff) only to find out that the essence in perfume is actually diluted down into cologne (95% dilution), EDT (85-90% dilution) and perfume (80-85%) dilution. The real stuff is actually oil based, and in fact is healthier for your skin than the alcoholic dilutions we buy in stores!When I started using the oil, my scent would last over 10 hours with a projection of about 3 meters! Way better than the 20 minutes, 30 cm projection that every perfume used to give me. What's more, I learned that if your skin is like mine and drinks everything you apply, then applying it to a concealed piece of proprietary fabric my brother and I designed makes it last even longer!Gíoderma Botanical Essences is exactly what the industry does not want you to know about. It's the stuff people use to use in the 18th century before modern corporations decided to dilute the stuff and charge more.What I want to achieve:My goal is to bring what I’ve been personally using for 2 years to others because I know the scents you buy in stores just aren’t enough. I want to provide affordably priced perfume that will really last, without breaking the bank!Scents we offer:

Jokes aside, we know it's tough trying to learn the mechanics of a new game and getting used to the community. Getting people to back and support this project is an uphill task for us as well.

We've been busy racking up contents and polishing it for everyone. YOU can help us too, by sharing it with your guildmates, friends and family. 

On a second thought, maybe skip the family portion, as it can be awkward when you draw a card that says ""10 year olds sleeping with your mom"".

.....

Anyway, sharing and spreading this project around increases our chances of getting funded. And you know what that means, more games for all of us!

Below is an example of the star sign before - Pisces, also with soft enamel fill and rose gold plated metal and the backing card it comes with. The back is secured with a black PVC rubber clutch (not blue, like in the picture)







 These are examples of soft enamel pins I have manufactured before, to give a clearer idea of what the Aries pin will look like.The end date for each sign is about a month before that sign starts. I have started late with Aries, so the closing date is much closer to the start of the Aries star sign - Aries starts March 21st.







EDIT: End date is on 17th March, not the 10th. I will create a new project for Taurus once this project ends because only one project can be live. Below is the Taurus design which will be launched on 18th March after Aries ends. Do keep an eye out for it!





Let's hope all the star signs get made into pins!

Please note that not all signs will be made into pins - those that do not reach the goal amount by the deadline will not be made into pins.

Instagram: @Cult.____
Facebook: Cult add-on 
Website: www.Cultaddon.com 
Cheers!","— as a new start-up business CULT may have some difficulty to gain our brand awareness 

— people might care-less about our sustainable and eco-friendly concept

— might be a slightly delay on the shipping and production since this was the first time I(Nadira, Founder) making a jewellery brand so it will take some time for me to develop and come up with a perfect product. 

— as this is all started because of my college project I assure you that I will 100% put my effort on it and will continue this brand after graduating. Since this was my long-planned dream. 

Thank you for you supports and I'll keep you updated with all the progress!

On dark, clear nights, the most we can see with our naked eyes (or captured with our DSLRs) is only this much. That hasn't changed at all since the start of human history! Added with the fact that many of us are now living in concrete jungles, the stars we can see are only a mere handful with all the light pollution...


The typical night sky on a dark, clear night





 









With innovations and technologies by astronomers and NASA, the Hubble Space Telescope is able to capture images of nebulas and galaxies deep in space.


The Carina Nebula





 


Part of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)





Since we are unable to see this part of the Universe just by looking out of our windows, the team here at Jr. Studio have come up with a solution. A solution that brings Deep Space to you and allows you to admire the beauty of Deep Space in the comfort of your home — Ethereal.Note: While NASA and Hubble Space Telescope is the source of the images published in the book, the publication and distribution of the photo book, ""Ethereal | Literally out of this World"", on Kickstarter is not sponsored or endorsed by NASA and Hubble Space Telescope.







Ethereal is Kickstarter's first ever Deep Space photo book that will literally take you out of this world. Ethereal is a book that consists of images of nebulas, galaxies, constellations, stars and everything in between taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Every page of Ethereal is covered top to bottom with jaw-dropping, high quality, crisp images that have been stringently filtered out among the thousands of images the Hubble Space Telescope has taken.

Every image on Ethereal is accompanied with a short - but substantial - caption consisting of its name, details and description. Ethereal is not only a stunning book to admire at, it is also the perfect book to learn about the universe beyond what our eyes can see.Ethereal features easy to read captions that is ideal for all occasions - even as bedtime stories for kids that are curious about Space!


*Examples of each caption.





Ethereal is the best ""decor"" that you can get for your tabletops! We dare say that it is as interesting as the latest blockbuster movie. Great way to entertain your guest while you prepare that scrumptious feast for dinner!


*Image shown is a softcover mock-up of Ethereal. Actual copies of Ethereal have a quality hardcover backing.





 









Publishing a book is a very tedious process. Even for a photo book! From gathering of the necessary images and details to designing and printing is a lot of hard work. Getting quality photo books at a great price is hard as printing in itself is extremely expensive. We were quoted S$193 (~USD$134 / ~£109) for a single copy of Ethereal.That is why we decided to reach out to the Kickstarter community. With the help of crowd funding, we are able to make Ethereal affordable to all at just S$39 (~USD$27 / ~£22) per copy while still retaining the high quality. That's right! For just S$39, you can get to enjoy the hidden beauty of the universe through Ethereal. Having the whole universe right in your palms is no longer an imagination. 







Ethereal is Kickstarter EXCLUSIVE! Even if it does enter the market due to overwhelming demand after the Kickstarter campaign ends, you will never get Ethereal at such a great price!Ethereal contains 87 stunning images of nebulas, galaxies and constellations. 7 of the best images are spread out across 2 pages to achieve the ""surround"" effect while the rest (80 images) are single, full-paged images.


*Bold names imply that the images are spread across 2 full pages.





 



*Example of images that are spread across 2 pages when viewed in PDF format.





Specifications of Ethereal are as follow:
Quality Imagewrap Hardcover
11"" x 8.5"" (280mm x 216mm)
Medium Landscape Format
100 Pages
Though costs are kept to a minimum, quality on the other hand is top-notch.
The Imagewrap Hardcover will give Ethereal a modern look, perfect for any tabletops. It is binded with durable PUR perfect binding with reinforced spine backing so Ethereal will last a lifetime for you to enjoy Ethereal over and over again.
Images on Ethereal are printed using offset printing that uses plates to transfer images onto paper. It provides very real colour reproduction and crisp professional looking printings so you can experience amazing image quality with unmatched image reproduction and superb colour consistency for all images. 








As seen above, the more copies of Ethereal you plan on getting the more you save! So grab your friends, family or anyone down the street and choose your reward together!For backers who are interested in getting the PDF version of Ethereal, here are some great news! The PDF version of Ethereal up for downloading will be the version we sent for printing. That's right! The PDF you will be receiving is of print quality and you can print out your very own high quality and visually stunning Ethereal if you so wish.  







 







Stretch goals, everybody loves them! But we certainly do not want to count our chickens before they hatch. We have some plans in mind but we have to first meet our funding goal of S$13,000 before we think big. We believe that we can achieve it together with your support! Stretch goals will be announced once the funding goal has been met and we definitely look forward to that!







If your friends or family love Deep Space, or they simply love to read and enjoy the little pleasures in life, share this project with them! Even better, get them this book as a gift! No one will ever decline a visually stunning book like Ethereal.For queries and bulk orders of more than 10 copies of Ethereal, e-mail us at jrstudio.sg@gmail.com. We love e-mails!","With any project there are risks and challenges involved. However, we are taking every possible precaution possible to ensure that Ethereal will be delivered to you within the stipulated timeline. We strongly believe in clear, transparent communication with all of you and any delays to the project as stated in the timeline will be conveyed to you at the first opportunity.

The greatest challenge that we have lies with producing the best quality book possible for you. But not to worry! We have partnered with Drummond Printing Pte Ltd who have more than 35 years of experience in the printing industry so as to ensure that every copy of Ethereal will take your breath away.

Currently, our biggest concern for this project will be meeting the minimum order quantities for bulk printing. Ethereal can only take you out of this world with you and your friends' and family's help and funding!","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 5 or more\n\nAbout US$ 4\n\n\n\nOur Gratitude!\n\n\n~USD$4 / ~£3\n\nThank you for your support on the creation of Ethereal!

I wanted to encourage the children In Singapore to look forward and stay strong together as a nation with a nation-wide colouring contest. Thus, I organised the “Singapore National Day Colouring Contest” for all schools. There was overwhelming response from the schools! There were prizes worth $10,000 that were given away to the top 100 winners. However, I felt the voices of these children and their passionate artworks for our country deserves to be shared. Therefore, I am proposing the “Voices of Singa Cubs” project.
This book project not only feature the celebration of Singapore's 55th Anniversary as an independent country but also the patriotism our children have for Singapore. It consists the Lion Symbol artwork and a message why they love Singapore. This book portray the  hearts of the Singa Cubs and why Singapore is one of the most beautiful and safest cities in the world with unity.
Lastly, I want the children who contributed to their talents in this book to feel appreciated and be encouraged greatly to see their works published and shared widely. This would also inspire others to pick up art and writing as a hobby. 
The e-book will be sent to the children who participated in the Singapore National Day Contest. This book will be marketed to schools in Singapore. 


The bigger picture would be to publish this book in physical form. This may happen if this current project would be a success. The plan is to distribute few thousands copies of this book to all school libraries so every child can have the chance to enjoy this book.","The challenges will be the production area in getting the works typeset and designed beautifully, cover artist for an attractive cover, editor and lastly managing the project. However, with my experience and connections, these challenges are part of the process and can be dealt with.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 10 or more\n\nAbout $8\n\n\n\n1 copy of the Voices of Cubs (e-book)\n\n\nGet to appreciate the artworks and messages by the children of Singapore with love!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 50 or more\n\nAbout $36\n\n\n\n3 copies of the Voices of Cubs (e-book)\n\n\nGet to appreciate the artworks and messages by the children of Singapore with love!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 backer""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 100 or more\n\nAbout $72\n\n\n\n5 copies of the Voices of Cubs (e-book)\n\n\nGet to appreciate the artworks and messages by the children of Singapore with love!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 150 or more\n\nAbout $108\n\n\n\n8 copies of the Voices of Cubs (e-book)\n\n\nGet to appreciate the artworks and messages by the children of Singapore with love!\n\n\nLess\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery\nDec 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 backers""},{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 1,000 or more\n\nAbout $715\n\n\n\nGold Backer\n\n\nYour name or company name will be published on the \""Gold Sponsor\"" page.

About the DocumentaryHambantota, a small town in southern Sri Lanka was the second worst affected district in that country when the tsunami of 26th December 2004 struck. While Sri Lanka is predominantly Buddhist, Hambantota has a significant Muslims population, most of which lived in the old town by the sea that was ravaged by the tsunami.Seven years after the disaster, filmmaker Ong Chao Hong follows PhD researcher Ted Yu Shen Chen to Hambantota and finally meets survivors of the tsunami, who had previously only existed in his memory as statistics in the news. Through interviews and house visits, he discovers the role of religion and family values in the building of resilience in the community, and witnesses how a PhD research evolves into a personal journey of faith for the deeply religious Ted.'After The World Forgets' is a documentary that has evolved from researcher Ted Chen's PhD study into the spiritual dimension of disaster reconstruction. It hopes to speak to the world about not looking at disaster reconstruction as simply relief, but a process that involves decisions which have long term consequences that is not just physical but central to whether people regain their quality of life, have a sense of well-being and return to normalcy with will to continue living.






The Fundraising CampaignIn June 2011, over a mutual friend's wedding banquet in Singapore, Ted invited Ong Chao Hong, a filmmaker from Singapore, to collaborate on a documentary film about the tsunami survivors he has met in Hambantota, Sri Lanka. Armed only with a video camera and a slim travel guidebook, Ong Chao Hong embarked on a 3-week journey on which he heard first-hand stories of survival, love and loss, religious revelations, housing project controversies, and even one about a wild elephant attack.The film was shot with a borrowed video camera and tripod, and fueled by the goodwill and support of our friends in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia. Now, with more than 30 hours of footage and no budget to carry on, the filmmakers have decided to call out to their friends, family and colleagues from around the world. Hence, we have started a Kickstarter page, through which you can contribute to our budget. The money will mainly go towards post-production such as rental of studio for voice recording, a proper audio mix and color grading, as well as distribution costs such as DVD duplication and film festival fees, etc. In return, we will give you some perks! (see details on the right!). The campaign runs for 60 days and we will only receive the funds if the goal is reached (your credit card will only be charged if the goal is reached). If you would like to support our modest project, please pledge a donation today. We'll be grateful for any amount you give!If you prefer to donate through other methods, please contact us at daoyupictures@gmail.com. You can also see a preview of the documentary at our website www.daoyupictures.comThank You.The Daoyu Pictures TeamProducer | Researcher TED YU SHEN CHEN 
In 2007 Ted had the opportunity to travel to Sri Lanka for a vacation. As a practising architect in Australia, he wanted to see the damages that had been caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the efforts in reconstruction carried out by the local government and international aid organisations. 
'After The World Forgets' is a documentary that has evolved from Ted's PhD study into the spiritual dimension of disaster reconstruction. It hopes to speak to the world about not looking at disaster reconstruction as relief. The decisions made in reconstruction has long term consequences that is not just physical but central to whether people regain their quality of life, have a sense of well-being and return to normalcy with will to continue living.

 1 Cable Fastest Speed For 2 USB Standards 
& We Guarantee It

















Enjoy the fastest recharging whether for your future USB-C devices or the older USB ones up to 100W speed. 
Upgrade to Pro. And you'll never worry about cable again. No matter what random USB port or device you meet, you'll be able to charge and data sync just fine with only one cable.


Every Fast Charging Supported




































The Solution: One That Plugs Into Everything

























 Incredible Built Quality









Crafted With Only Durable Materials
























The Chip That Guarantees 100W









Without E-Mark Chip, USB-C to C cable CANNOT negotiate up to 100W Power Delivery.
Extra, Extra, & Extra Long (2m / 6.5ft)









Because some outlets just have to be in awkward, far-from-comfort locations. Now you control where you sit (or sleep). 
Precision Designed, Eco-Friendly Adapter




Specially designed to fit Charby Edge





We designed and tested different iterations of the lock on their size, endurance, and flexibility. The current design we’d picked allows for a secure lock and effortless removal.
Effortless Removal = Endless Flexibility




Engineered for effortless snapping








Switch sides instantly





Making use of USB-C’s tech advantage (that they can be both input and output), the  Easy-Lock & Remove Adapter lets you switch output/input on the fly. If it is fixed, you’d have to rotate the entire 6.5 ft cable around.


 No Chance Of Losing It




When needed, it's secured

tl;dr: Charby Edge is tested to support fast charging (up to 100W) & data sync while generic adapter doesn't. 
*Speed adjusted automatically to a device’s max limit. No risk of damage.


How Fast Can Charby Edge Charge?
 *The lab tested fast charging time according to each device's maximum power intake










Why Back Us On Kickstarter? 










As thank you for your early support in making Charby Edge a reality, we're offering drastically below-retail prices that are only available on Kickstarter for 30 days. And we're covering your shipping fee too for all Early Bird - Twin & Family Pack. 




Free complementary strap to tidy up your bag













How Charby Edge Began
One day, our co-founder found himself unable to charge his iPad Pro: his car, backup power bank are all USB-A's, and the cable he carried for his latest iPad Pro is USB-C to C. It came to him that this hassle is caused by the lopsided transition of USB-A to USB-C. Though solutions existed, he realized that having a fixed adapter forever dangling around or an OTG adapter that goes missing easily is inconvenient.
Then the idea struck him -- a convenient, no-compromise solution. He gathered the team and introduced the ""Transition Cable"". And so 9 months and a few prototypes later, we took Charby Edge from an idea to what you're seeing now.









Design Sketches









 Timeline - From Idea To Shipping









Who Are We?
We're a product design team in Malaysia with a curiosity and passion for engineering. We (Charby) have been around since 2017, and have partnered with qualified manufacturers in Shenzhen who have tons of experience manufacturing quality products that pass certifications by CE and FCC.
We've had experience in bringing crowdfunding innovation to our backers' hands. Notably, with our debut product Charby Sense on Indiegogo, which we are now consistently shipping all around the world. And another Indiegogo campaign now in mass production. Now, we're raising funds here to share our project to the Kickstarter community, and to hit the minimum manufacturing quantity to make Charby Edge happen.
Hello There!









And Hello To Our Design Partner




OITO Design team













 This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.","We push ourselves to deliver innovative and quality products that will ultimately solve your problems. To that end, we had nitpicked credible manufacturers as our partners. But as manufacturing goes, unexpected hiccup might still occur. But rest assured that if any do arise, we'll address them promptly and ensure that the quality of the final products we ship you is uncompromised.

Since our manufacturing partners' operations have recovered from the Covid-19 outbreak in China, we managed to get the lead time for mass production before structuring our timeline. Hence, we're confident in delivering Charby Edge to you on time even as a pandemic rages on.

On top of that, we're also working with a 3rd party Quality Control Agent who will monitor strictly the production process.

Understandably, now isn't the brightest time to launch a crowdfunding campaign. But since charging cable is an essential of the electronic devices era, we've decided to proceed and make Charby Edge available at its lowest possible prices. 

All in all, we hope everyone (and your closed ones) will continue to be safe from this pandemic. Stay healthy everyone!","[{""rewards"":""Pledge S$ 2 or more\n\nAbout US$ 2\n\n\n\nBIG Thank You!\n\n\nEvery dollar helps!

- Since enamel pins are handmade, it's normal for them to have minor imperfections such as scratches etc. Though I will be grading them and making sure it is up to standard before sending it out.
- I have settled all the pantone colours digitally, the colours might look different depending on your screen.

SHIPPING
- Due to COVID-19 mails being delayed are inevitable.
- To make sure all backers get their reward all pins will be shipped out using TRACKED mail, except for Singapore mails.

REWARDS

The city-centric guide documents insights behind the works of branding. It scrutinises the process of translating what manifested as thoughts that grew into an idea and  ultimately, to reality. 


Brand Guide: Singapore Edition





We narrate the process through the considered use of photographs, brand reports, and graphic pullouts. The monotony of thumbing through a book is now a tactile experience; not just for you, but for us as well. Unlike a regular publication, the work does not end with the printer. Every Brand Guide is hand assembled by us, with lots of love. If you’re lucky enough, your copy might have a drop of sweat on it.


A dossier with 5 booklets & various inserts





 


Foreword by Armin Vit (UnderConsideration)





 






 






 





 













 





Fret not if that’s the case. You can give that drop of sweat some friends when you use Brand Guide as a travel guide to supplement your time in the consistently humid Singapore.

Features and Accolades 

You must be thinking, “I can’t trust them, they sold their souls!”We can’t say that your speculation is groundless, so here are some words from credible sources where we were featured. Hopefully it will be of soul-redeeming quality (pun intended). “Brand Guide does an admirable job highlighting the region’s most innovative local brands, and the people behind them—people you can pay compliments to in person, on your next visit to Singapore.” - Wired   ******“With its unique design and meticulously laid-out pages that simply reflect the enthusiasm and devotion that make these Singapore brands shine, this is more than just a book filled with pretty pictures… With plans to publish books for other cities in the future, the Brand Guide series might soon become the design-oriented entrepreneur’s indispensable travel companion.” - Yatzer    ******“Foreign Policy Design Group, who we featured on the site last year, has nailed the art of collating diverse and sometimes complex ideas into a beautiful, cohesive publication. ” - It's Nice That   ******“A gem for any one with even a fledgling interest in design, the creative process, print guides, and the city of Singapore.” - Spottly Insider   ******""Brand Guides have probably never appeared on a summer reading list, but after seeing Foreign Policy Design Group's take on the genre, we're telling everyone to move it to the top of their stack."" - AIGA Eye On Design

We’re Kirei Affinite and for our first Kickstarter project, we are pleased to present to you part 1 of our Horoscope pins :) In this part 1 series, we have included 2 fire signs and 1 earth sign. 
First up, representing the Greek god of war whose ruling planet is Mars. Passionate, bold and natural leaders. They are also highly symbolized by the colour red. Have you guessed it yet? Drumrolls YES! It’s the first astrological sign – Aries! For those of you who were born between 21st March and 19th April, or those whose rising/sun/moon sign belong to Aries, this pin is definitely a must get!  









The 2nd pin we have is the next fire sign. Leos', born between 23rd July and 22nd August. Known as the magnificent lions who are guided by their pride and loves attention. The Leo sign is represented by the colour yellow or gold and is ruled by the planet Sun. For the proud Leos out there, its time to adorn this pin and show it off ;) 









Lastly, we have the earth sign. Known as the headstrong bull associated with the colour green, Taurus is ruled by Venus aka the planet of love. 20th April to 20th May babies, your horoscope for 2019 predicts that you will earn a good amount of profits ;) So spend some of that profit on getting this cutie pin!

Set in a small rural fishing community, Jellyfish is a film about Suri, a 13 year-old girl who befriends a mysterious transgender woman who arrives in her village one day. Realizing that Riya is troubled and has nowhere to go, Suri hides Riya in her home. Suri soon forms an attachment to the alluring Riya, desiring her as both mother and lover.






Suri struggles with her emotions, and harbors fantasies of being with Riya. However, her illusion is broken when she discovers that her father and Riya are together. The day after her discovery, Suri takes Riya out fishing. Enraged and confused, Suri considers the unthinkable.The Purpose Of JellyfishJellyfish explores the themes of teenage desire, blossoming sexuality, and jealousy – all set in the context of a small fishing village in Borneo.As I director and writer, I created this project out of a pressing urge to understand how it would feel to be a young girl growing up in a remote fishing village, and trying to understand herself and her own sexuality.What would it be like to live in a tiny village in which one sees the same people every day? How would a young woman feel desirable when she fishes all day long, when her hands are rough and callused, when she doesn’t have a mother or female influence in her life? How would she understand her own feelings of desire? Would her inability to understand her own confusing feelings drive her towards violence in the right situation? Jellyfish was born of the need to explore these questions.I am lucky to be collaborating on this project with Faye Lum - who is of the Malaysian and transgender community, in addition to being an excellent writer. She has been an invaluable source of information and inspiration, as well as a critical editor of material. A promising screenwriter, her works have been featured on national television in Malaysia.",,"[{""rewards"":""Pledge $10 or more\n\nAbout $10\n\n\n\nA private online screening of the film.

Touge Shakai (Mountain Pass Society), or TougeS for short, is an online Touge Racing Game based on Japanese car culture in the 90s. With an emphasis on balance between realism and fun gameplay, the physics are tailored for competitive drift racing, while giving a challenge to all players. The game is built upon our fan-made creation Initial Unity.









In Touge Shakai, the driving physics are mainly simulated, but not to the extent of hardcore racing simulators. The driving characteristics of each car is tailored to be distinctly different from the others, to prevent the feeling that each car feels the same, just with different performance numbers. The objective of the physics is to be fun while remaining believable. However, there's a twist to the driving physics: Drifting is faster than grip driving for most rear-wheel drive vehicles.


The goal for this campaign is to replace all art assets with original content, add new features, and get the game to Steam Early Access











Time Attack









Race against the clock with various cars and courses to improve your pace and compete on the leaderboards. Players can also challenge the “ghosts” of other players, which are apparitions of their previous runs to learn from their driving. Medals are awarded with target timings, and provides progression for customization for each car.


PvP Battle









 Classic touge-style battle. Battles rules include ""First to finish"" and ""Cat and Mouse"".  Cat and Mouse has a leader and a chaser, with the leader trying to pull away and the chaser trying to keep up. The leader wins when they finish the course by a fixed distance from the chaser, while the chaser wins if they manage to overtake by the finish. The race moves on to the next round in a draw, with their positions reversed. Cat and Mouse mode is recommended as it provides the fairest battle, as overtaking is difficult and dangerous on the touge.
Team battles consist of multiple PvP Battles ongoing at the same time, with the team with the most wins coming out on top.


Free Ride









Practice, socialize and start impromptu races with others on the touge and just have fun! Learn from others and enjoy the course without the pressure of winning or losing. Showcase your rides and hang out with other racers and teams.











These are some notable features that Touge Shakai will have:



  Dedicated servers
  Cosmetic car customization - Car parts and livery editing
  Online matchmaking and ranking
  Multiple online game modes
  Driver and team profiles
  Replay camera editor - Setup race cameras using key frames
  In-game music player - Load your own tracks into the game
  Different weather conditions - Rain, fog
  Progression - Unlock new cars and parts as you hit objectives
  Steering wheel support with Force Feedback
  Virtual Reality Support

*Note: Not all features will be available on the first version of Early Access, and will be added progressively through updates











Touge Shakai is about building a community that is enthusiastic about Japanese Mountain Racing. After running a successful Discord Server for Initial Unity, it helped shape the game and gave us ample feedback by directly interacting with our players daily. We would like to continue having same relationship with our players, to be able to improve and build on the game we dream to create.











The personnel we currently lack are 3D artists. 3D models seen in the trailer and screenshots above are modified models of mods made by the community for other racing games. The majority of the funds will go to hiring 3D artists to produce original, optimized assets for the game. Smaller requirements are to acquire resources and hardware to support more controllers, wheels and peripherals such as VR. The rest of the funds and any excess will go towards general development of the game, and hiring more artists to generate more content for the game.



  3D Artists : 60% 
  Steering wheel Support : 10% 
  VR Support : 5% 
  General Development : 10% 
  Kickstarter + Processing Fees: 15%

Let's say your a cool, well-groomed dude.  
You use beard oil to give your facial hair the perfect, hipster glow. 
You use cologne to give yourself a fresh scent before a hot date. 
You even purchased face wash to keep your skin looking good. 
But, let's say you get a pimple.  What's a dude to do? Introducing Brave Face.  Scare those pimples right off your face.  Use our product personally matched to your skin to cover those pimples right up.Don't worry. Brave Face comes in a manly tinture bottle, so she'll never know.





We're Tam & Alan, a half-American / half-Canadian couple living in Singapore, working at Google and traveling around Asia.  Last week before a BBQ, Alan got desperate and used some of Tam's make-up to cover up a blemish.  





No dude wants to do that.In a world with an influx of male hygiene products, why not have a cover-up designed only for males in an unassuming bottle?We've contacted a cosmetics & tincture bottle distributor and are ready to get started with Brave Face if we can get $50,000 of pre-orders for the product.  The manufacturer has 25 years of experience producing facial products in the North America & Europe.





We need $50,000 to make out dream come true, so we can develop Brave Face at scale.  All backers get a bottle of Brave Face, personally matched to their skin using a ""selfie.""If you're not ready for Brave Face, tell your guy friends.  Make some noise!","We are confident that our manufacturer for the Brave Face cover-up are high quality and able to product a small batch (2000+ bottles) for trial.  He's a family friend with over 25 years of experience in the facial products business.

As with any entrepreneurship project, there can be delays in the delivery date if there are any problems in the supply chain.  It will also take time for us to hand match the right Brave Face color to the ""selfies"" submitted by backers.","[{""rewards"":""Pledge $25 or more\n\nAbout $25\n\n\n\nFor $25, you'll get 1 bottle of Brave Face matched to your skin type.
